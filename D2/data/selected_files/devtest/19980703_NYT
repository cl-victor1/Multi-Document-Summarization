JAPAN ANNOUNCES PLAN TOCLEAR BANKS' BAD DEBTS AND SPUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The government announced a long-awaited plan Thursday to
clear away the nation's pile of bad debt in hopes of bolstering
global confidence in Japan and setting the world's second largest
economy on track for growth.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Total Plan,'' which still needs to be approved by
Parliament, amounts to a program for dealing with at least $550
billion in problem &UR;  &LR; loans held by Japan's largest banks. The
centerpiece is a mechanism to allow banks to fail without provoking
chaos in the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The government would shut down insolvent institutions and turn
over their clients to government-run ``bridge banks'' to keep the
credit flowing. It would also accelerate sales of depressed real
estate held as collateral for bad loans. Shaky companies would
close, thousands of people could be put out of work, and bankers
could be prosecuted for financial misconduct. The government hopes
that the plan could be completed within the next two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hikaru Matsunaga, the finance minister, announced that the
government was embracing the plan, shortly after it was approved
Thursday by a task force. Markets reacted cautiously to the
announcement, which had been widely anticipated, while foreign
governments urged that it be followed up with strong measures to
put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing apprehension that the Japanese banking
crisis is now at the heart of Asia's financial problems and may
also threaten the economies in the West and the long boom on Wall
Street. And President Clinton and other American officials have
been stepping up the pressure lately on the Japanese. In
Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a statement
that the plan contained ``potentially significant steps,'' but he
stressed that ``what is important is for the Japanese authorities
to move quickly to translate this approach into concrete actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, analysts warned that because the plan would bring
about a great deal of pain, Japan's leaders faced enormous
obstacles in carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a great deal of will to clean the bad debt out
of the private sector, and I think the politicians are committed to
that, but I'm not sure the politicians are willing to restructure
the financial sector and restructure the economy,'' said John
Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in
Tokyo. ``They are wonderful when it comes to passing around the
pork, but much less willing to pass around the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks, which has soared over
the last seven days on expectations of the plan and in anticipation
of tax cuts, was down 90.81 points, to 16,380.77, at the midday
recess Friday. On Thursday, the Nikkei finished up 108.69 points,
or sixth-tenths of a percent, at 16,471.58.
</P>
<P>
   Currency markets showed hesitancy, weakening the yen to 140.34
to the dollar from 139.17 in early London trading, just as
Matsunaga, the finance minister, was outlining the plan.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the plan, which is expected to be approved by
Parliament in late July or early August, was disclosed by Matsunaga
and other officials. They insisted that Japan would move toward a
market-based economy and pull away from the convoy system in which
all the banks support one another and move ahead only as quickly as
the slowest bank. Masaharu Hino, head of the new Financial
Supervision Agency, suggested that the government would allow more
banks to fail. He said the agency would take ``strict measures''
after it inspected the nation's 19 largest banks over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will recover confidence in the Japanese financial system by
severing ties with the past convoy administration and shifting to
an administration of severe policing, based on clear rules,'' Hino
said. ``That is the main road toward the rebirth of the financial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has been languishing ever since the speculative
economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, sending property prices
crashing and bad loans soaring. For nearly eight years, both the
government and the banks have been sitting tight in the hopes that
the real estate market would recover and their problems disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Though the banks have been nibbling away at their bad debts, the
problems have worsened with the recession. The government has let a
few banks fail in a controlled, ad hoc fashion, and it has set
aside $214 billion to protect depositors and bolster the capital
strength of the banks. But it has been loath to take drastic
measures to solve the problem _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, officials used the English words ``Total Plan'' to
describe the new measure Thursday, perhaps because they sound
bolder and more innovative than the equivalent Japanese terms. The
effort appears to be modeled on the U.S. cleanup of the
savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The plan tries to tear off bad debt from the banks through
foreclosures on properties held as collateral and by encouraging
the revival of the real estate market. It also aims to bring about
a more open financial system by increasing disclosure in a
traditionally secretive banking community, and to impose greater
rigor in the system by stepping up inspection standards and
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Insolvent banks will be allowed to fail, using a two-stage
bridge bank. The plan will first put collapsed banks under
government administration, protecting creditworthy borrowers left
in the lurch by the failed bank, while a merger partner is sought.
Then the collapsed bank will either be acquired or, if no buyers
emerge, nationalized with public money, sending the bad debts to an
agency established to collect bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the bridge bank approach is that it insures
that corporate customers of a failed bank will continue to have
access to loans, reducing the shock of a bank failure. The
disadvantage is that it raises questions about whether Japan, which
has overcapacity in its financial system, is truly willing to let
banks fail and whether the bridge bank system is simply one more
way of allowing insolvent institutions to founder a bit longer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Initially, public money will be drawn from the 30 trillion yen,
or $214 billion, bailout fund set up in March at Deposit Insurance
Corp., which will set up the bridge banks as subsidiaries of a new
holding company. The corporation will then try to transfer the
business to a healthy bank within two years, though that could be
extended to five years. The total cost of the bailout is by no
means clear.
</P>
<P>
   One sticky point is how the distinction between good and bad
borrowers will be made and whether bad borrowers will be rescued
along with the good ones. Naturally, any client of a failed bank
will insist that it is a good borrower and should continue to
receive loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is designing a mechanism that appears similar to the
former Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States, which disposed
of bad debts during the savings-and-loan crisis in the 1980s. In
Japan, the Financial Supervisory Agency, which last month split off
about 400 people from the Finance Ministry to inspect the banks,
will be given wide authority to direct the process.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the blueprint, however, say the Total Plan does not
address some of the fundamental rigidities of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Total Plan at all,'' said Chiaki Nishiyama, an
economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who is
now in Tokyo. ``It's a very deceiving term.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan purges the banks of their bad loans, many
economists feel that a broad restructuring and deregulation of
industry are still necessary to bring about a strong economic
revival. One difference between the American experience and Japan's
situation is that the United States embarked on the painful
reworking of the savings-and-loans industry just as the economy was
picking up. In contrast, Japan is beginning its plan as it sinks
into a recession, and it is already spending $120 billion in fiscal
expansion to bolster economic output.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might get a mild recovery out of this, but it will not be
impressive,'' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities
Japan. ``If there's a promise of a deregulatory effort, they can
use fiscal expansion as a down payment. But a fiscal down payment
by itself, without restructuring, is a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, however, are a little bit more hopeful.
Resolving the bad debt is the first step toward improving the
economy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we have to solve the confidence crisis, and solving the
bad loans is a starting point,'' said Heizo Takenaka, an economics
professor at Keio University. Then, he added, Japan can ``promote a
deregulated, more transparent open-market system.''

SHEFFIELD A RELUCTANT ALL-STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For Gary Sheffield, it was easier to make the
All-Star team than it is to get to the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is still going. But instead of flying home to Tampa,
Fla. before playing in Tuesday's game, his family is meeting him in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   National League president Leonard Coleman and NL manager Jim
Leyland insisted Sheffield attend Monday's workout at Coors Field,
which is major-league policy.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheffield refused, the league wanted the Los Angeles Dodgers
to send Raul Mondesi, who is spending the break in the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers stepped in and will fly Sheffield's parents and
three children to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my family since spring training,'' said
Sheffield, who was traded to the Dodgers May 15 from Florida. ``I
was just hoping to get away from baseball for a couple of days and
collect myself. It's an honor to play in an All-Star game. But with
the things that have happened this year, I thought it wasn't too
much to go in the day of the game. I thought the league would
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield respects Leyland and understands what the All-Star
game means to his former manager, who lost almost all of his World
Series championship team in a salary purge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sheffield, former Marlins on the NL squad are
Houston's Moises Alou, San Diego's Kevin Brown and San Francisco's
Robb Nen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean a lot to him to have all of his guys there,''
Sheffield said. ``We never really got a chance to celebrate the
title. It will be good to have us back for one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla back: Bobby Bonilla, sidelined since June 17 with an
intestinal infection, returns to the lineup tonight in San
Francisco. To make room on the roster, catcher Paul LoDuca was sent
to Triple-A Albuquerque after only one day with the club.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca was brought up when the Dodgers optioned left-hander
Dennis Reyes to Single-A San Bernardino so he could get work during
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who did not have an extra-base hit after homering in
his first game with the Dodgers, said the illness robbed him of his
power. Bonilla has shown some pop in batting practice this week,
but he knows the pitching will get a little tougher starting
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so great to get back,'' he said. ``There will be 60,000
people in the stands in San Francisco. Everybody will be pumped.
This has taken so long to get over. I am so ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers eventually will send down third baseman Adrian
Beltre, who has impressed everyone with his raw ability. Manager
Glenn Hoffman said Bonilla, 35, does not have the mobility to move
to the outfield.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton said Friday that ``cronyism,
corruption and overextended credit,'' unchecked by competent
financial regulation, had led to the economic maelstrom now
sweeping Asia and has spread to Hong Kong, plunging it into its
deepest recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis has touched nearly all the nations and households
of Asia,'' Clinton said in an address at the soaring harbor-front
Hong Kong convention center. ``Restoring economic growth and
confidence will not be easy, but the United States will do all we
can to help any Asian government work its way back to financial
health.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first comment by a U.S. official on the banking reform
measures announced by Japan on Thursday, Clinton Friday endorsed
the proposals that are intended to create an emergency $200 billion
fund to protect businesses and depositors in need of bridge loans
to weather the financial storm. He called Tokyo's program
``potentially quite significant'' and said the United States
welcomed it as a partial means to ease the impact of the crisis on
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Beijing, as he has several times on this
nine-day trip to China, for what he called the ``disciplined and
wise policy'' of resisting the temptation to devalue its currency,
the yuan, to boost exports and hard-currency earnings. Allowing the
value of the Chinese currency to fall, Clinton warned, could lead
to ``competitive devaluations that could threaten China, the
regional economies and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to several hundred business leaders in a morning
event sponsored by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived here Thursday evening, Clinton pledged that the
United States would do its part to lift Asia out of its economic
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that the United States considers Hong Kong
vital to the future,'' Clinton said at a banquet where the chief
executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, was the host. ``This present
financial crisis, too, will pass, if we work together with
discipline and vision to lift the fortunes of our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Hong Kong, the first by a sitting U.S.
president, came one day after the former British colony marked the
first anniversary of its return to China. And it gives him the
opportunity to assess one of the grander experiments in modern
political history: China's pledge to let Hong Kong remain a
capitalist enclave in the world's last communist empire.
</P>
<P>
   These days, economics are overshadowing politics here. Hong Kong
is suffering badly from the Asian financial contagion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is a world symbol of trade, enterprise, freedom and
global interdependence,'' Clinton said, looking weary despite
having relaxed earlier in the day on a two-hour boat trip on the Li
River near Guilin, in south China. He used the visit to Guilin to
discuss China's dire environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   After flying here he praised Hong Kong and China for being
anchors of stability in a region-wide economic storm _ a reference
to the fact that neither government has devalued its currency,
despite the continued weakness of the Japanese yen and a wave of
tit-for-tat devaluations across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, a shipping magnate appointed by Beijing shortly before the
hand over, welcomed the president's show of support, saying that
``what started as a regional crisis has taken on a global
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met privately with Tung for 20 minutes before the
banquet, during which they discussed the economy, according to
White House press secretary Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said Clinton also pressed Tung to accelerate the
introduction of democracy to Hong Kong by allowing voters to elect
a larger percentage of legislators directly.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, who long lived in the West, is not known as a champion of
democracy. In his remarks at the banquet, he pointedly reminded
Clinton that Hong Kong was a Chinese city. ``The fact is, we are
Chinese and were brought up in Chinese tradition and values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Clinton sampled the new Hong Kong _ with a hectic series
of meetings and appearances that brought him in contact with
newly-elected politicians, both friendly and hostile to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, the deputy assistant to the president for
national security affairs, said the Clinton administration wanted
to demonstrate that the United States ``continues to be active and
involved and concerned about preserving Hong Kong's autonomy and
strengthening democracy there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has landed in a minor tempest over a meeting
with Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy leader, Martin Lee.
Clinton was scheduled to meet alone with Lee on Friday, a move
likely to displease Beijing. The White House barred press coverage
of the meeting, except for a photographer. It said it would issue
no public statements afterward, upsetting Lee and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the restrictions were ``normal practice'' when
Clinton meets with opposition leaders. Lee's aides said the White
House was seeking to assuage the Chinese, and had originally balked
at a one-on-one meeting, even though Lee has met Clinton before in
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If true, the White House may have ended up irking both sides.
Lee said he found the decision ``very odd, because it seems to me
that President Clinton's whole visit to China has been televised.
Why does he stop with me?''
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, Clinton was scheduled to sit down with a
group of Hong Kong leaders, including Lee and three other
popularly-elected legislators. Among them was Tsang Yok-sing, a
former high school principal and avowed Marxist who heads the main
pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The President also planned to meet with senior civil servants,
and the head of Hong Kong's government-owned broadcasting outlet,
Radio Television Hong Kong, Cheung Man-yee. RTHK has been harshly
criticized by pro-Beijing people here for undermining the local
government and being disloyal to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was among the first passengers to land at Hong Kong's
new $20 billion airport _ touching down 10 hours after Chinese
President Jiang Zemin dedicated the vast complex _ and became its
first departing passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Like some Hong Kong residents, though, Clinton expressed
nostalgia for the old airport, Kai Tak, which was famous for the
rooftop-skimming approaches made by planes as they landed. Clinton,
who sat in the cockpit of a plane as it landed at Kai Tak on a
visit to Hong Kong more than a decade ago, said, ``It was one of
the most exciting and uncertain experiences of my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Before flying to Hong Kong, Clinton spoke on the environmental
hazards confronting China. With the spectacular limestone peaks of
the southern city of Guilin as a backdrop, Clinton said that 5 of
the world's 10 most polluted cities are in China and virtually
every body of water in the country is tainted with human and
industrial waste. But, he said, China did not have to sacrifice its
environment to continue to build its economy.
</P>
<P>
   He urged China to build more energy-efficient cars, homes and
factories. The alternative, he said, was further environmental
degradation and ultimately, slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The president, addressing a small, carefully-screened audience
at a park in Guilin, one of China's most popular tourist
destinations, said that not long ago American cities were choked
with smog and many of its urban waterways were seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's extraordinary growth has put the same kind of pressure
on your environment, and the costs of growth are rising right along
with your prosperity,'' the president said. ``You know better than
I that polluted air and water are threatening your remarkable
progress. Smog has caused entire Chinese cities to disappear from
satellite photographs. And respiratory illness is China's No. 1
health problem.''

SYNOPSIS OF FLOYD ABRAMS' FINDINGS CONCERNING CNN REPORT ON NERVE
GAS USE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the laywer specializing in First Amendment cases,
advised CNN to retract its broadcast of ``Valley of Death,'' after
he had investigated the ``five pillars'' on which the June 7
television report and the subsequent Time Magazine article were
based. The reports had asserted that in Operation Tailwind the U.S.
military had dropped nerve gas on a Laotian village in 1970, while
pursuing American defectors. However Abrams concluded that each of
the report's pillars was flawed:
</P>
<P>
   ADM. THOMAS H. MOORER
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
1970, was ``the single-most quoted and shown senior officer on the
broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though a review of the outtakes of the broadcast demonstrates
that his memory remains satisfactory, his responses are often cast
in hypothetical terms,'' Abrams wrote of Moorer, now 87. ``CNN
itself ceased calling on Admiral Moorer to appear to comment on
ongoing issues in the early 1990s, and CNN's Pentagon correspondent
raised this credibility issue before the broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams concluded, ``that the substance of Admiral Moorer's
interviews do not confirm `that nerve gas was used in Tailwind' or
that the Tailwind `target was indeed defectors.'''
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES
</P>
<P>
   Three confidential sources were considered key in substantiating
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams said one source who was consulted as the story progressed
did not use actual knowledge in supporting the conclusion that
nerve gas had to have been used in Laos. Abrams found fault with
the indirect way the staff consulted with the second source, and he
concluded that the responses of a third source, ``although
supportive, are ambiguous.'' ``They are, possibly deliberately
blurry,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEN OF OPERATION TAILWIND
</P>
<P>
   Abrams was critical of whom the broadcast left in and whom it
left out.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Eugene McCarley, who led the Army commando unit that was a
key subject of the report, denounced his treatment on the
broadcast. Abrams wrote: ``He states that after saying that the use
of the nerve gas `was possible,' he then said that it had never
been used by any of his troops.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarley said the mission had nothing to do with killing
American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams wrote that what McCarley said to the CNN producer, April
Oliver, and she to him ``is a matter of credibility about which we
are unable to pass judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can judge, however, is the unacceptability of
minimizing McCarley's views on the broadcast,'' he wrote. ``Given
the fact that he led the mission, we do not believe that McCarley's
views, even if rejected by CNN, were given sufficient prominence.
The same is true of others who repeatedly rejected the notion that
nerve gas had been used.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Van Buskirk, the most prominent of the Operation
Tailwind participants, has become, in Abrams's words, the most
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he has in spectacularly self-destructive fashion, stated
that he had repressed memory syndrome, which he only overcame while
speaking with Oliver,'' Abrams wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``It was unacceptable to ignore his medical
history, the inconsistency between his book'' _ written in 1983 _
``and what he said on air, and the ambiguity in his recollections
of the gas. Whatever can be said for using him before June 7, the
added weight of evidence uncovered since the broadcast seriously
diminishes any further reasonable reliance on him.''
</P>
<P>
   OTHER CORROBORATIVE INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   This group included veterans of the commando unit in Laos and
pilots who offered ``additional, ancillary support for nerve gas
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams wrote: ``This information, however, played a secondary
role. Moreover, it was often ambiguous or conflicting.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EXPERT SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the use of experts to identify the gas dropped by the
symptoms observed by those on the ground below, Abrams wrote:
``While there was supportive information provided by the experts,
the relatively oversimplified manner in which the symptoms were
described raises doubt about the strength of the conclusions that
can safely be drawn from these interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   In his conclusion, Abrams wrote, ``We are lawyers, not
journalists, and it must rest with journalists to determine how
best to avoid in the future the pitfalls illustrated by this
broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the CNN broadcast was not fair; that journalistic
errors led inexorably to more errors, and ``the degree of
confidence approaching certainty of the CNN journalists who
prepared the broadcast of the conclusions offered in it contributed
greatly to the journalistic flaws identified in this report.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision was made by CNN to broadcast accusations of the
gravest sort without sufficient justification and in the face of
substantial persuasive information to the contrary,'' he wrote.
``CNN should retract the broadcast and apologize to the public and,
in particular, the participants in Operation Tailwind.''

DODGERS CRUISE PAST SLUMPING RANGERS, 4-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The prospect of a third shutout during the
past 10 games loomed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' mighty offense refused to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame this potential embarrassment with a clutch,
run-scoring balk in their 4-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers last
night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will enter tonight's game against the Seattle
Mariners hitting .176 (22-for-125) with seven extra-base hits and
seven runs during their past four games.
</P>
<P>
   This latest performance caused the Rangers' team batting average
to sink below .290 for the first time this season since Opening
Day. The Rangers have lost five consecutive games, including all
three in the series with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone to step up and get that big hit to drive in
the crucial run, and we're not doing that right now,'' said Rangers
designated hitter Lee Stevens, who collected three of the Rangers'
seven hits against Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park. ``We need to
be aggressive and establish our own luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position and
likely would have stranded first baseman Will Clark at third base
if not for Park's second-inning balk.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and first baseman Will Clark, who went 2-for-3 with two
doubles, collected five of the Rangers' seven base hits against
Park (7-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down right now, and we faced a good pitcher tonight,''
Stevens said. ``With that combination, it's tough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Darren Oliver (4-6) surrendered four runs on
nine hits and issued two walks during his five-inning appearance,
but manager Johnny Oates removed his starting pitcher well before
the Dodgers put this game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it would not be the heart of the Dodgers' order
that would be Oliver's undoing. Designated hitter Paul Konerko,
third baseman Adrian Beltre and catcher Charles Johnson entered
this game hitting .214, .192 and .209, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That trio produced the Dodgers' three-run second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko greeted Oliver with a single to open the second inning
and advanced to third on the ensuing double by Beltre. That brought
Johnson to the plate, who deposited Oliver's 2-2 offering into the
left-field seats for a 3-0 lead. It represented Johnson's first
home run in 87 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been better,'' Oliver said of his second
appearance since being reinstated from the 15-day disabled list
June 26. ``I made a few mistakes that cost me. I hung the curveball
to Konerko, and the curveball to Johnson wasn't a good pitch at
all. I'm still not pitching the way I want to be pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 4-1 lead on a fifth-inning sacrifice fly ball
from Konerko, but the Rangers' bullpen kept the visitors in check
the remainder of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Tim Crabtree allowed only two hits during three
scoreless innings, and right-hander Xavier Hernandez retired the
side in order during the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers' offense provided no support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ballclub is down a little,'' Oates said. ``We're not
swinging the bats as well as we have.''

<P>
   For me, the Fourth of July has always had a British spin. My
most memorable Independence Days began by setting the alarm clock
for an early breakfast of strawberries and cream and the
gentlemen's finals at Wimbledon on the telly: Ashe and Connors,
McEnroe and Borg, Becker and Edberg, Sampras and whoever.
</P>
<P>
   When the match was over, I'd pull out my tennis whites, open a
can of white balls and try to channel what I'd seen. Suitably
inspired, I'd serve and volley, chip and charge, or at least
curtsey toward an imaginary royal box. And yet my post-Wimbledon
celebration always fell a little short. Something was missing. The
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've played thousands of sets on clay and hard courts,
and even a couple on Astroturf, I'd never hit so much as a single
ball on a grass court, unless you count whacking a couple around my
backyard. I'd even made two trips to Wimbledon, where I approached
Center Court like Thomas a Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. But play
on the hallowed lawns of the All England Tennis and Croquet Club?
The sternly worded sign aimed at commoners like me _ ``Members
Only'' _ mocked even the notion of it.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Paine and friends didn't fight for nothing. In
America, we have freedom, liberty and public grass courts. Not
many, mind you, but we have them. And the biggest is in Newport,
R.I., at the Newport Casino Lawn Tennis Club. There, you don't need
connections _ only cold, hard cash _ to play out your own Wimbledon
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   So as June approached, I packed up my rackets and headed to
Newport, vowing finally to fill this glaring gap in my tennis
education.
</P>
<P>
   I began my weekend by sitting in on the Saturday
stroke-of-the-week clinic with Bill Rompf, the club's director of
tennis and one of the country's best coaches. The class was held
indoors, but it would be a perfect grass-court cram session.
</P>
<P>
   The first day's curriculum included the approach shot, the
overhead and the volley. Under the watchful eye of Bill and his
wife, Mary, a former touring pro, I became an attacking fool. I
learned how to hit a sneaky short approach, close in fast on the
volley, backpedal even faster on the overhead. Pete Sampras, watch
out.
</P>
<P>
   But in my eagerness to get to the net, sometimes I lapsed into
the sloppy footwork that most of us cannot get away with on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stop and then hit,'' said Bill, as I dumped an
easy forehand volley into the bottom of the net. ``McEnroe could
get away with running through his volleys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I'm not McEnroe,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped outside, I found that I got a little more of
Wimbledon than I bargained for. A combination of thunderstorms,
flood watches and as much as two inches of rain gave Newport that
English summer ambiance. Most years, tennis at Wimbledon means a
little tennis and a lot of waiting for the courts to dry out, Boris
Becker meets Samuel Beckett, and this seemed to be my fate, too.
</P>
<P>
   As I would discover, there are few better places to wait out a
rain delay than Newport.
</P>
<P>
   First, I watched a little court tennis, a strange and obscure
indoor hybrid of tennis and squash that dates to the 16th century.
Then I ventured to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, part of
the same complex as the club, and saw a bigger stash of old rackets
than the one in my hall closet _ except that these had once been
owned by Bill Tilden, Don Budge, Maureen Connally and Jimmy Connors
_ and a collection that surpassed even Wimbledon's own.
</P>
<P>
   And even as I turned my attention to Newport's nontennis
distractions, I wasn't deterred from my quest. As I peered out at
the acres of manicured lawn at the Breakers, the palatial
Vanderbilt mansion, I couldn't help but wonder: How many grass
courts could you fit here?
</P>
<P>
   I was ready, but the courts were still wet. So as the drizzle
continued, I stopped by the club to get a little advice about
grass-court tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though people are enthralled by being out there, it's
more demanding to play on,'' said Bill prophetically. ``You've got
to move your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When the weather finally broke, I found myself on Court 2 with
Joshua Bainton, an associate pro at the club and a college player
at Old Dominion. As we warmed up, the first thing that struck me
was the sound, or more accurately, the lack of it. For the first
time, I could hear myself play tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The ball fairly whispered as it hit the ground. My feet were
slipper quiet on the soft turf. There wasn't even the familiar
CA-CHING of the ball ricocheting off the chain-link fence; it just
nestled silently in the nets separating the courts. The only sound
was the solid THWOCK of a ball hitting the center of my strings, or
the BONK of one sailing wildly off the edge of my frame.
</P>
<P>
   For all its seeming civility, this was a less predictable game
than the one I grew up playing. After the ball hit the ground, it
seemed to have a mind of its own. One time it would skitter beneath
my racket like a white rat escaping from a behavioral-science lab,
the next it would kick erratically into my body, as I stood
flat-footed, pondering the inequity of it all. Played tentatively,
I discovered, grass-court tennis was just a sloppy version of
hard-court tennis. But play it with a gambler's heart, and it
becomes something different.
</P>
<P>
   After a few genteel games, I said to Josh, ``C'mon, let's see
the A serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked with a chuckle, ``The A game, too?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   He wailed a flat first serve to my backhand. This time, I got
down as low as Emmanuel Lewis and moved my feet like Fred Astaire.
I blocked it back, right at his feet. My return practically knocked
the racket out of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   This court, I suddenly realized, is a living thing. And living
things are seldom predictable. Grass-court tennis was a game that
rewarded shot-making. Patience didn't pay off here. Attack, the
turf told me, or be attacked. So I let loose and played a set of
lassiez-faire tennis.

</P>
<P>
   But in my eagerness to get to the net, sometimes I lapsed into
the sloppy footwork that most of us cannot get away with on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stop and then hit,'' said Bill, as I dumped an
easy forehand volley into the bottom of the net. ``McEnroe could
get away with running through his volleys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know I'm not McEnroe,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   When I stepped outside, I found that I got a little more of
Wimbledon than I bargained for. A combination of thunderstorms,
flood watches and as much as two inches of rain gave Newport that
English summer ambiance. Most years, tennis at Wimbledon means a
little tennis and a lot of waiting for the courts to dry out, Boris
Becker meets Samuel Beckett, and this seemed to be my fate, too.
</P>
<P>
   As I would discover, there are few better places to wait out a
rain delay than Newport.
</P>
<P>
   First, I watched a little court tennis, a strange and obscure
indoor hybrid of tennis and squash that dates to the 16th century.
Then I ventured to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, part of
the same complex as the club, and saw a bigger stash of old rackets
than the one in my hall closet _ except that these had once been
owned by Bill Tilden, Don Budge, Maureen Connally and Jimmy Connors
_ and a collection that surpassed even Wimbledon's own.
</P>
<P>
   And even as I turned my attention to Newport's nontennis
distractions, I wasn't deterred from my quest. As I peered out at
the acres of manicured lawn at the Breakers, the palatial
Vanderbilt mansion, I couldn't help but wonder: How many grass
courts could you fit here?
</P>
<P>
   I was ready, but the courts were still wet. So as the drizzle
continued, I stopped by the club to get a little advice about
grass-court tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though people are enthralled by being out there, it's
more demanding to play on,'' said Bill prophetically. ``You've got
to move your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When the weather finally broke, I found myself on Court 2 with
Joshua Bainton, an associate pro at the club and a college player
at Old Dominion. As we warmed up, the first thing that struck me
was the sound, or more accurately, the lack of it. For the first
time, I could hear myself play tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The ball fairly whispered as it hit the ground. My feet were
slipper quiet on the soft turf. There wasn't even the familiar
CA-CHING of the ball ricocheting off the chain-link fence; it just
nestled silently in the nets separating the courts. The only sound
was the solid THWOCK of a ball hitting the center of my strings, or
the BONK of one sailing wildly off the edge of my frame.
</P>
<P>
   For all its seeming civility, this was a less predictable game
than the one I grew up playing. After the ball hit the ground, it
seemed to have a mind of its own. One time it would skitter beneath
my racket like a white rat escaping from a behavioral-science lab,
the next it would kick erratically into my body, as I stood
flat-footed, pondering the inequity of it all. Played tentatively,
I discovered, grass-court tennis was just a sloppy version of
hard-court tennis. But play it with a gambler's heart, and it
becomes something different.
</P>
<P>
   After a few genteel games, I said to Josh, ``C'mon, let's see
the A serve.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked with a chuckle, ``The A game, too?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded.
</P>
<P>
   He wailed a flat first serve to my backhand. This time, I got
down as low as Emmanuel Lewis and moved my feet like Fred Astaire.
I blocked it back, right at his feet. My return practically knocked
the racket out of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   This court, I suddenly realized, is a living thing. And living
things are seldom predictable. Grass-court tennis was a game that
rewarded shot-making. Patience didn't pay off here. Attack, the
turf told me, or be attacked. So I let loose and played a set of
lassiez-faire tennis.
</P>

(INCLUDES NOTES) 
MIKE-ROSCOPIC MEDDLER IS WEISMAN'S M.O.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Man, how wise can it be to put a mike in the hands
of a Mike Weisman?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Joe Torre doesn't agree, but the folks in charge of Fox
baseball aren't about to cut the juice.
</P>
<P>
   This season, it's been the modus operandi of producer Weisman to
find another nontraditional way to tweak the Fox Saturday
game-of-the-week telecast with wireless microphones and/or
hand-held cameras.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for Saturday's Dodgers-Giants broadcast from 3Com
Park, Weisman sought and received permission from Orel Hershiser to
put a mike on the pitcher in the San Francisco dugout and get his
commentary (to be taped and used judiciously). That would have been
another Weisman broadcast first _ no one outside of a manager or
coach has ever worn audio equipment during a real game.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday afternoon, before leaving for the Bay Area from his
home in Brentwood, Weisman was informed he couldn't do it because
it needed approval from the MLBPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll do it another time,'' said Weisman, who wants to hook
Tom Lasorda up with a mike in the stands for some live, impromptu
fillibustering.
</P>
<P>
   For Weisman, a nonoral Orel is a small bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned by Fox baseball coordinating producer John Filipelli to
oversee one of the four regional Saturday telecasts with the Thom
Brenneman-Bob Brenly broadcast team and director Jim Lynch, Weisman
has turned these World Series hors d'oeuvres into midseason treats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Good Lord wanted to create a baseball producer, he
started with Michael Weisman,'' said Filipelli, who Weisman hired
as the lead baseball producer at NBC some 15 years ago and has
returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Back as a hands-on producer, Weisman's baseball broadcasts are
part ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' part ``Pop-up Video.''
Yet they're 100 percent Weisman, who once had the media-created
nickname ``Mad Mike'' when he did particularly innovative things
for NBC Sports as its boy-wonder executive producer during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved the way Letterman broke down the wall
between the TV camera and the audience,'' said Weisman. ``Doing
games for Fox, I've been able to live out some sports TV
fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as:
</P>
<P>
   _During a Chicago Cubs-Atlanta Braves game, Weisman sent
cameraman David Benzer from his normal dugout spot in the fourth
inning and had him go onto Weyland Avenue, beyond the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Weisman's thinking: We've seen all kinds of TV pictures of a
ball hit out of the park and onto that street. Why not have a live
camera capture the flight of the ball as it comes right into the TV
viewers' laps?
</P>
<P>
   With a glove on his left hand, the camera on his right shoulder
and a wireless mike so he could talk on the air to Brenneman and
Brenly, the burly Benzer went out there and waited.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get a chance to catch a ball with his glove (or lens),
but Benzer ended up talking to a father and son who were playing
stickball against the outside of the Wrigley Field wall.
</P>
<P>
   _During a recent Dodgers-Rockies game at Dodger Stadium, Weisman
put a mike on Roger Owens, the famed peanut vendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no interest in mikeing (then manager) Bill Russell,''
said Weisman, ``frankly because baseball is slow enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Without telling Owens when he'd be on camera, Weisman used him
as an escape hatch for some levity during an otherwise one-sided
game. Weisman's reward was some priceless live footage of Owens
bantering with the customers (even though much didn't make it on
the air).
</P>
<P>
   _During a Rangers-Giants telecast last week, Weisman put a
microphone on one of the 3Com Park ``ball dudes,'' the 70-something
gentlemen who sit in uniform down the left- and right-field lines
to retrieve foul balls. The result was something like Letterman
doing a live remote with Larry ``Bud'' Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is some of this stuff sophomoric? Yes,'' said Weisman. ``Are
we doing it to amuse ourselves in the truck? Yes. Do the people at
home enjoy it? I'm not sure, but my rationale has always been to at
least try, make it fresh. With this crew (Breneman and Brenly), we
can do almost anything we want.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Weisman doesn't know when to shut up. The irony
is that the guy who won 15 Emmy Awards in 11 years from '78 to '89
with NBC as either producer or executive producer on the '88 Summer
Olympics, eight World Series, seven Super Bowls and numerous
Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments was also the one who
came up with the ``silent minute'' during the pregame show of Super
Bowl XX.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Fox doesn't keep an eye on him, either. It
was the Yankees-Red Sox game last year that Weisman was producing
when miked manager Torre's expletive was inexplicably aired after a
key Paul O'Neill home run. Although the blunder occurred because
the audio man rewound the tape about three seconds too far, Weisman
took full responsibility. He issued an apology on air, then
personally apologized to the irate Torre, who had to be persuaded
by Weisman to wear the mike in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The New York media actually backed Weisman for the mistake since
he apologized to Torre (who wouldn't accept it) and for Fox's
attempt at add a little life to some otherwise stagnant midseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``More times than not, I think that no one blames you as long as
you're trying,'' said Weisman. ``I'm glad more producers haven't
caught on to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports TV can be such a copycat business. The material is
often the same, but it's in how you present it.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- Fox Sports Net's ``Goin' Deep'' will cater a major-league
baseball town-hall meeting _ a nice original concept _ Wednesday at
8 p.m. on Fox Sports West. At least baseball's real ringleader,
Paul Beeston, and not Bud Selig, will be on the firing line, with
questions coming from a panel that includes former Orioles great
and Fox baseball analyst Frank Robinson, Seattle shortstop Alex
Rodriguez, baseball intellectual George Will and USA Today's Hal
Bodley. A studio audience will be ushered in to watch in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   -- L.A. will be spared from the ESPN Radio coverage Saturday of
the New York Mets-Atlanta game. That would be a game that has
ex-Dodgers GM Fred Claire as a sidekick to play-by-play guy Charley
Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Craig Simpson, the Fox Sports Net NHL studio analyst the past
few years, is reportedly close to signing on with CTV Sports Net in
Canada to be its lead hockey analyst.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -- Guaranteed money from NBC and Turner will help the NBA owners
avoid financial hardship during an extended lockout. Each team
stands to receive a reported $23 million from the two networks _
even if regular-season games are canceled, according to the
contract. The league must then pay them back by the fourth and
final season of their TV deal depending on how many telecasts are
missed.
</P>
<P>
   -- This sexy, taking-a-life-of-its-own rumor that CBS and Fox
will show up NBA commissioner David Stern and show a rival pro
basketball league if the NBA players lockout gets deep into the
upcoming season. Guess where rumors like that start. Not from the
network side, no matter what ``TV industry insiders'' are quoted.
The story started in New York's Newsday this week after some NBA
player agents (in particular, David Falk) threw it out as
bargaining rhetoric. Consider the sources.
</P>
<P>
   -- By the way, how could Fox be part of such a thing with
part-ownership in both the Lakers and Knicks?

COBI'S ALLEGIANCE PUT TO ULTIMATE TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The rumors are shadowing Cobi Jones, picking
up where German and Iranian and Yugoslavian defenders left off.
They trailed the flashy forward around the Left Bank in Paris,
where he retreated after the U.S. World Cup soccer team went three
matches and out. They dogged him as he crossed the Atlantic,
returning to L.A. in time to rejoin Major League Soccer's Galaxy
for its game Saturday against the Kansas City Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   If the rumors were any more persistent, they'd be able to pass
themselves off as Eddie Pope. At the Louvre last weekend, the buzz
was the Westlake High product would be returning to France next
year to play for one of its pro teams. Thursday at the Rose Bowl,
word was the former UCLA standout was possibly bound for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It's all old cap for Jones, whose 110 international matches are
the most of any U.S. soccer player. He reportedly was coveted by
German teams after the U.S. squad of which he was a contributing
member advanced to the second round in the 1994 World Cup. Jones
eventually signed with an English team, Coventry City, for the 1994
season and honed his skills in Brazil in 1995 before gracing the
Galaxy with his presence, starting in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, has speed to burn and enough star power to command
the maximum MLS salary (which is around the minimum wage of an NBA
player). That he also has sufficient elan as a playmaker to attract
interest of top-rate clubs overseas has brought Jones to a
difficult crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   As Independence Day weekend unfurls like a U.S. flag, Jones is
having to gauge which way his priorities blow. Does he pursue his
unalienable right to have some German club negotiate his transfer
with MLS or does he continue to serve the best interests of soccer
in the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism or pragmatism, that is the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conflict of interest,'' Jones acknowledged. ``You want
to go overseas and play in the top leagues in Europe and get the
whole soccer experience that you grew up hearing so much about. But
at the same time you want to help soccer to grow in the U.S. I
definitely am going to weigh the options of all the interests; MLS,
U.S. Soccer, my own (goals) ...''
</P>
<P>
   Jones paused for effect, then broke into the grin that launched
his MTV debut a while back, ``and basically wait for Sunil Gulati
(the MLS deputy commissioner in charge of player-related issues) to
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Jones. From his days at Westlake High he has constantly
challenged himself, not authority. Long before he was lauded for
his speed and his passing, he was a walk-on at UCLA who won
compliments for his coachability. If U.S. coach Steve Sampson had a
few more players with the same respect for authority as Jones, he
wouldn't have had to waste so much of the World Cup looking out for
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, Sampson is looking for a new job, having been
done in by his own 3-6-1 formation but also by the vocal discontent
of a few of his veteran players, Jones' former high school teammate
Eric Wynalda among them.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's timing on the changing of the guard of U.S. soccer was
curious; right after the World Cup would have made more sense than
during it. But you didn't hear that from Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sampson) was the coach. He was the one who had to make the
decisions,'' Jones said. ``Some players were not happy with those
decisions and they decided to take it to the press. That's not
something I'm going to do. That's not my nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The bellyaching by veterans-turned-benchwarmers Tab Ramos and
Alexi Lalas split the team and created a tension that was as thick
as the coffee served in the corner cafes along the Seine River. Far
from perking the players up, all it did was bring the whole team
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could have been a bit more unity,'' Jones said. ``You
could see some of the players were (discontent). That undermined
the team a little bit. It was a situation that kind of escalated
with the help of the press. It kind of distracted the team from
focusing on the games.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with being a U.S. star in a sport that is
starved for attention stateside. Some of the players saw the media
throngs and they couldn't help themselves; they kept going back to
the banquet table for more attention long after they should have
called it a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The results were hard for everyone to swallow: one goal and zero
points in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that don't need to be said in the press,''
Jones said. But ``the people who were outspoken were the veterans
of the team. They had the outspoken personalities. So what are you
going to do?
</P>
<P>
   What Jones does next will be of great import to U.S. soccer. It
says here the sport will survive the exporting of a couple of its
local-grown stars as long as it continues to import the likes of
Mexico's Carlos Hermosillo and _ dare we say it? _ Germany's Jurgen
Klinsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Let Jones and Pope kick their dreams around for a while. They
will be better for the experience and so, too, by extension, will
future U.S. teams.

   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County Health Services Department
officials say that Mayor Richard Riordan's Original Pantry
restaurant has received a poor rating for a second time since the
county began issuing letter grades.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown restaurant was closed in November after failing an
inspection. Now it has posted a score of 64 out of 100 because of
problems found in a recent inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors gave the low score May 29. An A is 90 to 100, a B is
80 to 89, a C is 72 to 79, and any lower score does not get a
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Original Pantry staff quickly addressed the
problems, which included excessive flies and kitchen workers not
wearing hairnets, the score must stay up until the next routine
inspection, said Alfonso Medina of the county Health Services
Department.

EDITORIAL: PRAYER IN A BRONX SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, July 3:
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Mildred Rosario for leading a sixth-grade
public school class in prayer last month has brought a predictable
flood of denunciations, and in an odd way performed a valuable
service. Joining Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in defending Mrs. Rosario,
a bilingual teacher in the Bronx, were such luminaries of the
Christian right as Rep. Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, and Gary
Bauer of the Family Research Council, who said ``we need countless
teachers like this.'' In fact, Mrs. Rosario's actions showed
precisely why we need to keep the ban on prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over school prayer has gone on for so long that it
has deteriorated into a clash of empty slogans. Mrs. Rosario has
humanized the situation. She had not yet taken attendance in her
class when the principal asked over the intercom for a moment of
silence in memory of a fifth grader who had drowned. In the anxious
discussion that followed, Mrs. Rosario, a member of a Pentecostal
church, asked ``if anyone would like to accept Jesus as their
Savior,'' and then placed her hands on some children's foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   School-prayer advocates have gone to great lengths to assert
that, by itself, prayer in the classroom need not violate anyone
else's rights. But by Mrs. Rosario's admission, this was a case of
proselytizing. It was carried out, moreover, at a sensitive moment
that was bound to be coercive. The parents of one child, both
Jehovah's Witnesses, objected. They were clearly within their
rights to do so. For the spokesmen of conservative religious groups
to seize on her case as an example of what they would like to see
repeated in other classes around the country is a clear warning
sign.
</P>
<P>
   When the Supreme Court banned prayer in the public schools in
the early 1960s, it recognized that situations like the one in Mrs.
Rosario's classroom would inevitably result from officially
sanctioned prayer. President John F. Kennedy, when asked for his
reaction at a news conference, gave an answer no less applicable
today. He said that those concerned about it at least had an
alternative. They could pray in their homes or churches. Whether or
not it was right to dismiss Mrs. Rosario, it is right to keep the
classroom free of prayer. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ An altercation between a New York state senator and a
police officer on Thursday night ended with the senator being
sprayed with Chemical Mace and handcuffed after the police said she
bit the officer in the hand.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, Ada Smith, who represents the 12th District, which
includes sections of Brooklyn and Queens, was driving her car in
the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn around 8 p.m. when the
altercation occurred. She was later taken to a hospital after
complaining of burning eyes and wrist pain.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman, said the
incident began when Ms. Smith got caught behind a police cruiser
that had stopped another car.
</P>
<P>
   According to officers on the scene, Ms. Smith became annoyed and
told the officers they were blocking traffic at the intersection of
McKibbon Street and Graham Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The argument escalated, and when the police asked the senator to
produce her drivers' license and registration, she refused,
according to the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith declined to step out of her car, and when the officer
attempted to pull her out, she bit him on the hand, the police
said. One officer then sprayed Chemical Mace in her face,
handcuffed her and took her to the 90th Precinct station house.
</P>
<P>
   While being processed for arrest, Ms. Smith began complaining
that the handcuffs had cut off circulation to her wrists and that
the chemical was burning her eyes, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   When emergency personnel arrived at the station house, Ms. Smith
was still in handcuffs, authorities said. She was taken to Woodhull
Medical Center on Thursday night, where she had her eyes rinsed
with a saline solution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the officer said he was bitten in the hand, the police
said that the officer refused medical attention by emergency
workers who arrived at the scene. But Fire Department officials
said that no ambulance responded to the scene and that they had no
knowledge that an officer had been bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Among her colleagues and constituents in Queens, Ms. Smith is
known for her sharp tongue and no-nonsense demeanor. An independent
thinker, Ms. Smith endorsed the Rev. Al Sharpton in the 1994
Democratic primary against Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and in
1997, she endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the Democratic
candidate, Ruth Messinger.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear on Thursday night whether Ms. Smith had
identified herself as a state senator. She was placed under arrest
on Thursday night, but the charges were pending.

OUT-OF-BOUNDS SNOWBOARDERS COULD GET BILL FOR RESCUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Two snowboarders who were lost overnight in
the San Gabriel Mountains above Los Angeles during an El Nino storm
have been convicted of skiing out of bounds _ misdemeanor offenses
that could lead to a $23,600 bill for rescue costs.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Jenks of Glendale, nine miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, and Claudio Maluje of the L.A. suburb of North Hollywood
are believed to be the first Californians to be prosecuted in an
effort to recover the cost of their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court Thursday, Deputy District Attorney Lonnie Felker
said the case did not indicate that Los Angeles County will go
after every person who makes a mistake and needs emergency service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every criminal prosecution is to set an example,'' Felker
said. ``That goes for (out-of-bounds) snowboarding, speeding and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Sheriff's Department officials maintained throughout
the case that snowboarders, skiers, hikers and other outdoors
enthusiasts who don't break the law will continue to be rescued
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   A jury deliberated for about two hours before finding the
snowboarders guilty. Municipal Court Judge Barbara Lee Burke will
sentence 24-year-old Jenks and 28-year-old Maluje on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Felker said prosecutors will seek a small fine and the cost of
their rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Jenks and Maluje got lost at the Snow Crest Ski Resort in
February, eating cactus and sleeping in a cave to survive.
</P>
<P>
   With the rescue coming less than two days after the death of
14-year-old Jeff Thornton _ who was pulled out from the same
mountains _ the defendants became mini-celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, they found out they were being charged with a
misdemeanor crime: ``Knowingly skiing in an area or on a ski trail
which is closed to the public and which has signs posted indicating
the closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Maluje's lawyer, Craig Wormley, claimed the ski resort was
poorly marked, and the men didn't know they were out of bounds.
Before trial, Jenks said the pair had snowboarded only a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a mountain man,'' Jenks said. ``That's probably why I
got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, jurors marveled at the seemingly endless parade
of signs at the resort, warning patrons to ski within the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were signs along the road on the way to (the resort),
there were signs on all the lifts and there were signs all along
the boundaries,'' said juror Randy Nieves. ``I don't know how you
miss them unless you close your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman David Martinez added: ``Even if they were amateurs
they should have known to stay off that run. If you go by a sign
and disregard it, that's your fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants plan to fight getting stuck with the rescue
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verdict is an absolute outrage and he will be seeking a
hearing to get the prosecution to prove every cent of restitution
that they want these young men to pay,'' said Wormley's assistant,
Carver Farrow.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Deputy Roger Wallace said department officials believe
it is the first prosecution for rescue costs in the state, although
Los Angeles and other counties have sent bills to lawbreakers for
rescue costs before.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an intentional criminal act, we feel taxpayers shouldn't
have to be burdened with the costs,'' Wallace said.

CNN RETRACTS REPORT THAT U.S. USED NERVE GAS IN LAOS IN 1970 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 25th graf to replace interview quotes from Arnett) (ps) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN AND FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable News Network executives Thursday retracted the network's
report that the U.S. military had used lethal sarin nerve gas in a
secret 1970 mission in Laos aimed at killing American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The retraction, broadcast Thursday afternoon and accompanied by
an apology, was based on an independent investigation, performed at
CNN's request, that showed the report's conclusions were not
supported by the evidence. The original broadcast, which was
accompanied by the fanfare of advance publicity common in the
growing community of broadcast news magazines, was shown June 7 as
the feature presentation on the first installment of the news
magazine show ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP;Time.''
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast, a joint venture with Time magazine that was being
hailed within the Time-Warner empire as the fruit of productive
synergy between the company's disparate news-gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The apology amounted to a devastating admission that the report
had falsely cast the U.S. government, and in particular its
military and intelligence arms, as brazenly using and concealing
the use of one of the most forbidden weapons in the modern arsenal,
a nerve gas banned by numerous international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the piece was broadcast, a slightly modified version
of the account of a mission that was code-named Operation Tailwind
was published in Time, which also made a retraction and an apology
Thursday. Journalists at Time and CNN said Thursday that the story
was broadcast and published despite reservations raised by
journalists within both organizations who received a last-minute
chance to examine the report.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive with the network confirmed Thursday that
Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and perhaps the
network's most prominent correspondent, had been reprimanded for
his work on the story.
</P>
<P>
   April Oliver and her colleague Jack Smith, the producers who had
led the eight-month reporting effort, refused to resign and were
fired. Pamela Hill, the executive producer, and who made the basic
decision to broadcast the report, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that CNN alone was responsible for the erroneous report,
CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson issued a statement Thursday
saying, ``We acknowledge serious faults in the use of sources who
provided NewsStand with the original reports and therefore retract
the Tailwind story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at Time for
this mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Time's article appeared under the bylines of Ms. Oliver and
Arnett, whose career has taken him from Vietnam in the early 1960s
to Bagh- dad in the Persian Gulf war. A Time editor reviewed the
article and ac- cepted its basic thrust. The investigation of the
broadcast, conducted by the noted constitutional lawyer Floyd
Abrams, offered a microscopic examination of how journalism can go
awry. ``The CNN broadcast was not fair,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It showed no fabrication or illegality, but a more subtle
process of distortion that began when conclusions outstripped the
evidence, continued when sources were encouraged to believe that
unseen evidence proved their own suspicions to be true and was
compounded by interviews laced with hypothetical questions and
ambiguous answers. Ultimately, the report concluded, the
journalists refused to give more than a glancing nod to a series of
eyewitnesses' denials that sarin gas was have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNN journalists involved in this project believed in every
word they wrote,'' according to the Abrams report. ``If anything,
the serious flaws in the broadcast that we identify in this report
may stem from the depths of those beliefs and the degree to which
the journalists discounted contrary information they received
precisely because they were so firmly persuaded that what they were
broadcasting was true.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as her work was being repudiated, Ms. Oliver, the
producer, refused to back away from her conclusions. ``I feel that
this report was solid,'' said Ms. Oliver, 36, ``that I made every
step any journalist would take to ensure its accuracy and that I
had the full backing of management all the way up to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Abrams said he had
enlisted former intelligence officers from the investigative firm
of Jules Kroll to try to independently confirm the account through
their own military, intelligence and diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
   The account of the Abrams investigation, which was posted on
CNN's site on the World Wide Web (www.cnn.com), included numerous
instances of overreaching in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, his report examines the five underpinnings of
the broadcast _ including interviews with participants, information
from nerve gas experts, confidential sources with knowledge of U.S.
intelligence operations, a retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff _ and finds flaws in every one.
</P>
<P>
   The most-cited source, Admiral Thomas Moorer, who was chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from mid-1970 to mid-1974, is 87,
lives in an assisted-care retirement home in Maryland, and is no
longer relied on by CNN's military correspondents. And many of the
answers he gave were to hypothetical questions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of those on the scene, where a special forces
commando unit had attacked a base camp and then called for support
from backup airborne units, are dramatic. Particularly dramatic are
accounts that the backup fixed-wing planes dropped gas to help the
U.S. unit escape.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one of the pilots of the aircraft said Thursday, when
the CNN journalists interviewed him, ``I mostly got nerve-gas
questions and I gave tear-gas answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Art Bishop, now a retired satellite engineer, made a
brief journal entry the day after the 1970 engagement saying his
craft had been armed with cluster bomb units that carried r tear
gas and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In his conference call, Abrams said that a separate document the
journalists relied on was ``a bad Xerox.'' It contained a virtually
illegible reference to a substance used in cluster bombs coded as
``25'' (the code for explosives). The journalist read the illegible
number as ``15,'' the code for nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the Abrams report pointed out, one member of a
reconnaissance unit on the ground near the action, Jay Graves,
``was an important on-the-ground source of information for both the
use of sarin gas and the presence of American defectors.'' The
broadcast quoted Graves as saying ``We saw some round-eyed people.
We didn't know if they were prisoners or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graves' qualifying statement _ ``I didn't see any of them''
_ was not used in the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Oliver, the show's senior producer, Smith, said
Thursday that he stood by the story.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home on Thursday night, Arnett said, ``I accept
the Abrams report. The reason I accept his judgment is that I was
convering the Baghdad crisis for about four months during the
critical formation of this thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was essentially brought in late. I asked a few questions
and I read the script.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last days before the broadcast, people in Time magazine's
New York and Washington bureaus were raising concerns about the
piece, according to several Time journalists. In particular, Mark
Thompson, the magazine's Pentagon correspondent, said he doubted
the truth of the article's allegations. ``He thought it was
unsupportable,'' said one correspondent who insisted on anonymity.
``The entire bureau was worried about it.'' Thompson was on
vacation Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people at Time, Thompson and the Washington
bureau's deputy bureau chief, J.F.O. McAllister, made their
reservations known to editors in New York on June 5, the Friday
before the magazine's Monday release.
</P>
<P>
   According to one editor who spoke on condition of anonymity,
Time responded to these reservations by toning down the piece
somewhat _ putting a question mark in the headline, for example;
writing in the subhead: ``A CNN investigation charges that...''.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson, Time's managing editor, declined to elaborate on a
statement he issued Thursday, which said, ``Based on our own
investigation and that conducted by CNN, we have concluded that the
facts simply do not support the allegations that were made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Time article was edited by John F. Stacks, an executive
editor, and Johanna McGeary, Time's senior foreign correspondent _
both of whom did not return calls seeking comment. It was also
overseen by Joelle Attinger, an executive editor at Time Inc. who
serves as Time magazine's liaison with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' Ms. Attinger said Thursday. ``I think we
all take responsibility for it _ anybody involved in any aspect of
it must.''
</P>
<P>
   People at Time say the magazine relied on the 156-page summary
that Ms. Oliver had prepared that detailed her sources, a summary
that Abrams criticized in his report as selective and slanted.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, several people at Time said, did anyone question Ms.
Oliver's material as insufficient or suspect, nor did anyone argue
that the article should not run. Moreover, people at Time said
there was no overt pressure from CNN to publish the article.
</P>
<P>
   But one correspondent said the timing of CNN's broadcast of the
gas story _which ran that Sunday _ was such that Time felt
compelled to publish the article. ``Normally, on a Friday, if there
are serious questions about a story, you can always hold it,'' said
one Time correspondent who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time has been working with CNN on polls and on the news
magazine program ``Impact,'' the gas story was the magazine's first
collaboration in the magazine. Despite its potentially damaging
results, Isaacson said in his statement that Time looks forward
``to continuing to collaborate'' with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc.
said the company stood by its alliance with CNN. ``It doesn't cause
me to rethink the teamwork with TV,'' he said. ``All of us
obviously learned some things here and I'm sure as the weeks go on
we'll have discussions about what are the appropriate procedures in
any kind of joint venture.''

DODGERS BEAT RANGERS

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Last July, Chan Ho Park became a star. A year
later, the Los Angeles Dodgers think the twinkle is back.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy. Shattered confidence and battered breaking
balls have been a big part of this season, but Thursday night's 4-1
interleague victory over the Texas Rangers in front of the 38,514
at the Ballpark in Arlington might be a hint he and the Dodgers
have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at what he did and what we are doing and you get that
feeling that something good is finally on the way,'' said Bobby
Bonilla, who will be activated for tonight's series opener against
the second-place Giants in San Francisco. ``We're a good team and
he's a good pitcher. Now it's starting to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who went 5-0 last July on his way to a team-high 14
victories, allowed just an unearned run in 81/3 innings to give the
Dodgers their first three-game sweep since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   He ended a five-game road losing streak an won back-to-back
starts for the first time this season. All this against the Rangers
who came in as the American League's best hitting team.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, the Rangers scored just seven runs. Park, Darren
Dreifort and Dennis Reyes held baseball's top RBI man Juan Gonzalez
to three meaningless hits.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Dodgers send Ismael Valdes, with a two-hit shutout
and a near perfect game in his past four starts, against the Giants
tonight and former ace Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do this, we're going to do it with these
guys,'' Eric Karros said. ``Chan Ho was so big for us when Ramon
(Martinez) went down last year. Ramon is gone again and Chan Ho is
back in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes on the field and front office, there is
something familiar between this season and last.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were 39-42 after 81 games in 1987. Although their
season ended without a playoff appearance, they went 49-32 the rest
of the way. This year they also were 39-42.
</P>
<P>
   But with three consecutive victories here, the Dodgers reached
.500 for the first time since May 19 and shaved two games off San
Diego's monster lead in the National League West. They are still
11{ back but play their next 10 games against the Padres and
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is an important time,'' Park said. ``We have
struggled so far. I have had problems with my confidence, but that
is over now. As the game went along my confidence really shot up.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (7-5) was spotted an early lead when Charles Johnson hit a
three-run homer off Rangers left-hander Darren Oliver in the second
inning. They added another run in the fifth on Paul Konerko's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not have a home run since June 2 vs. St. Louis, a
span of 87 at-bats. He also had 15 strikeouts in his previous 31
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two strikes on me and I just wanted to make contact,''
said Johnson, who now has 11 homers. ``I got it up in the air and
it flew out.''
</P>
<P>
   Park had the lead, but it would have been easy to give back on a
96-degree night. But after struggling for the past six weeks, maybe
he had finally learned how to pitch through adversity.
</P>
<P>
   He could have come undone after balking in a run with the bases
loaded in the second. With Fernando Tatis at the plate and two
outs, Park completed his delivery, but never let go of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by what he had done, Park then rolled the ball to
the plate, but home plate umpire Eric Cooper waved in Will Clark,
who doubled and took third on Adrian Beltre's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw that before,'' Johnson said. ``But that was just
one play. What I remember about that inning was he had the bases
loaded with one out and got out of it with just one earned run. You
could tell he wanted to go nine innings tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed only one runner to third the rest of the way. He
allowed a second double to Clark to open the fourth, but retired
the next eighth batters.
</P>
<P>
   Park cruised into the ninth, but allowed a single to former
Angel Lee Stevens with one out. Scott Radinsky, who earned the
victory in Wednesday's game, took over and got the final two outs
for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his last start, he struggled by won,'' pitching coach
Charlie Hough said of Park. ``There are always little spots in a
game that can change everything. Tonight it was the bases loaded in
the second. He really stepped up.''

ANGELS FALL TO GIANTS

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ J.T. Snow didn't take kindly to the words of Angels
president Tony Tavares a couple of years ago when Tavares said the
Angels had too many pretty boys from Newport Beach, or something to
that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who actually lives in Corona del Mar, was eventually
traded to the San Francisco Giants, but he obviously hasn't
forgotten. Snow hit two home runs, doubled and drove in four as the
Giants beat the Angels 7-4 before 33,272 at Edison Field on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels maintained their 3{-game lead over
Texas in the AL West. The Giants picked up a game on San Diego and
now trail by 4{ in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Snow went 5 for 13 in the three-game series and is hitting .379
(11 for 29) with five homers and 12 RBI in seven games against his
former teammates in his two seasons as a Giant. Thursday marked
Snow's eighth career multiple-homer game, five of which came while
with the Angels. He has three as a Giant, and two of those have
come against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Though Snow had a good year with the Giants last season, hitting
.281 with 28 homers and 104 RBI, 1998 has been a struggle. Snow
went into the three-game series against the Angels hitting only
.216 but was obviously affected by the illness of his mother, who
recently died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the player the Angels got for Snow _ pitcher Allen
Watson _ remains on the disabled list with a lacerated wrist, an
injury he suffered opening a beer bottle earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Kirk Rueter (10-3) gave up nine hits in 51/3
innings but got the win because he gave up only one run _ Darin
Erstad's leadoff homer (No. 18) in the first inning. Erstad and
Gary DiSarcina each had three hits for the Angels; Dave Hollins,
Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson had two hits apiece. Everyone in
the Angels starting lineup except Cecil Fielder had at least one
hit, and they actually outhit the Giants 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   But they left runners on base all night. They stranded 10,
including five in scoring position. The only clutch hit the Angels
came up with was Hollins' three-run homer (No. 9) in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson (8-6) has the league's
third-longest winning streak, getting seven victories in a row from
May 16 to June 21. But he lost his previous start _ 6-3 to the
Padres last Friday _ and he struggled again Thursday from the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Stan Javier doubled home a run with one out in the
first inning for a 1-0 Giants lead. One out later Snow made it 3-0
with his first homer of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the bottom of the first with his home run, but
that would be as close as the Angels would get in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Snow doubled home Charlie Hayes in the third inning, then led
off the sixth with his second homer of the night _ his ninth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   When Rey Sanchez singled in two runs later in the sixth, Dickson
was done for the night. His line: 51/3 innings, 7 runs, 9 hits.

Swoopes 
stable after 
collapsing
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forward hospitalized; &QL; 
test results incomplete
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes collapsed during a practice
Thursday but had stabilized and was resting comfortably at
Methodist Hospital later in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Comets team physician Dr. Jon Divine said the cause of Swoopes'
problem had not been determined but said late Thursday night the
second-year pro was ``awake, she's stable, she's smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks a whole lot better than when she came in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes collapsed at about 1:30 p.m. near the end of the Comets'
workout at Westside Tennis Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a walk-through, getting ready for Sacramento,''
said coach Van Chancellor. ``Sheryl sat down at the end of the
basket, and she began to feel poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, 27, was sweating and on the verge of passing out as she
was being treated by team trainer Michelle Leget.
</P>
<P>
   After being stabilized, she was taken by ambulance to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Divine, who treated Swoopes upon her arrival at Methodist, said
dehydration may have been contributed to her condition. But he said
further testing was necessary before a complete diagnosis could be
rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we really don't know for sure (what caused the
problem),'' Divine said. ``She is getting better with (intravenous)
fluids. Her cardiovascular system is stable; her breathing is
stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a few more tests cooking. As soon as those results
are back, we'll know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes remained in the hospital overnight for observation. She
could be released as early as today, pending the test results.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes' swoon, said Chancellor, cut short the preparations for
the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be a million miles away,'' Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento comes to Compaq Center tonight at 8, having snapped a
five-game losing streak Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When Swoopes collapsed, Chancellor was in another part of
Westside Tennis Club away from the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to find Leget ministering to Swoopes near the base
of one of the goal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought I panicked, yeah, you were right,'' he said.
``If you thought it worried me to death, you were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, I'm always concerned about individuals. I was very
concerned for Sheryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Leget, who left the University of Houston women's basketball
program last year to become trainer for the Comets, said shortly
after Swoopes collapsed, she had trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation, she said, never appeared grave.
``Fortunately, we were very prepared for the situation,'' Leget
said, adding that Swoopes never fully lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe she could still hear me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as spokeswoman for her teammates, center Wanda Guyton,
who is on the injured list because of a back injury, said,
``Everyone is real emotional. Everyone is worried about Sheryl,
what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second physical ailment Swoopes has had since the
beginning of training camp in early May. Just before the start of
the regular season June 13, she strained a hamstring but didn't
miss any playing time.
</P>
<P>
   With Swoopes in obvious trouble Thursday, Chancellor said
Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson gathered their teammates in a
circle on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kim Perrot, ``Sheryl is very important to our team, and
that holds true for everyone on our team. We prayed for her, and we
know that she's healed because we have faith. It's always tough to
see anybody with that kind of health problem, but to see someone
that you're with a couple of hours a day, seven days of the week,
it takes its toll on you.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first nine games, Swoopes ranked second on the Comets
in scoring (15.6 points per game) and third in the Women's National
Basketball Association in free-throw percentage (.860).
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes could return to the lineup as early as Monday night when
the Comets travel to Cleveland and face the Rockers for the second
time during the regular season.

GILLOM KILLS 'EM AS MERCURY WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Rockers must plant spies in Gund Arena
for visiting teams' game-day shootarounds.
</P>
<P>
   They had to have seen Mercury center Jennifer Gillom clank a
series of three-point shots in a Thursday afternoon contest that
fattened Bridget Pettis' coffers by $200. Between that and Gillom's
2-of-10 three-point tally for the season, Cleveland did not care to
bother with her out there Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, by admission, is not a practice player. But she is a
gamer. Gillom tied her WNBA career high of 29 points, nailing all
four of her three-point tries, to help Phoenix rock Cleveland,
76-61, to improve its record to 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really shocked,'' said Gillom, who also led the team in
rebounds with and in steals with five. ``No team in the league has
let me stand behind the line and shoot threes. Once I made the
first one, it was all over. I had a rhythm going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just her best night of the season. It might have been
the Mercury's top effort, given Cleveland's caliber and home floor.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's defense was as stifling as ever, holding the league's
top shooting team to a 44 percent night and rattling it into 22
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better, not our best,'' Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller
said. ``It wasn't great. It wasn't good. It was better. We've got a
long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Try those lines on Cleveland (5-4), whose legs buckled to the
intensity coming off a Wednesday win at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers got out to a 16-9 edge with an 8-0 run, but Miller's
first regular-season technical foul, for arguing with the official
that didn't make the call, and a timeout gave the game an
about-face.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-0 retort started with a Gillom three-point post play, and
the Mercury dusted off its three-point arsenal for more. Andrea
Kuklova, Michelle Griffiths and Pettis all dropped bombs to launch
Phoenix to a lead it would never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury hit 9 of 18 three-pointers. Phoenix averages 11
tries and had hit just 30 percent, but aggressive penetration
designed to tire Cleveland ended up opening the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to match their intensity,'' Miller said. ``It's
a back-to-back game, and we wanted to see if their legs were tired.
The goal was for us to get aggressive and go into a transition
game. Jennifer helped herself by knocking down perimeter shots and
then scoring off the dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom scored the Mercury's final nine first-half points with a
varied menu, including a three-pointer, a fast-break layup, an
off-the-dribble jumper and a driving scoop. Phoenix led at the
break, 35-30, limiting the Rockers to 12.6 points less than their
first-half season average.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was worse offensively in the second half, seldom even
running its triangle offense because of the pressure. The Rockers
scored two points during an early five-minute stretch and then went
scoreless for a six-minute span to trail, 65-45, with 5:00 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The aggression had Phoenix thriving at the free-throw line, even
though it hit only 21 of its 32 chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice point margin,'' said Pettis, who scored 18. ``I
hope that scares Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, Phoenix's next stop on this rough five-game Eastern
trip, may be a bit scared of the film on Mercury forward Umeki
Webb. Rarely does a player get shut out in the scoring column and
stand out so much.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned Cleveland's versatile 6-3 swing player, Eva Nemcova,
Webb smothered her. Nemcova was held to one field goal and six
points while committing four turnovers. Webb had five steals, seven
rebounds, four assists and a block to excuse her 0-for-4 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best defensive effort I've ever seen,'' Miller
said. ``Nemcova is one of the greatest offensive players ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Rockers that hurt Phoenix offensively were limited in
minutes. Center Isabelle Fijalkowski dominated the low post with 16
points on 8-of-11 shooting but played only 28 minutes because of
foul trouble. Starting guard Merlakia Jones hit 6 of 7 field goals
for 13 points, but got just 23 minutes because of a leg cramp. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ In a tragedy that stunned one of
America's safest cities, a single mother has been arrested on
suspicion of killing her four young daughters just days before she
was due in court in a child custody case.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Nieves, 34, remained hospitalized under police guard as
investigators prepared a case to take to the district attorney, Los
Angeles County sheriff's investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   If charges are filed, Nieves will be arraigned either Monday or
Tuesday in Newhall Municipal Court on four counts of murder in the
deaths of her daughters _ Nikolet Amber, 12; Rashel Hollie, 11;
Kristl Dawn, 7, and Jaqlene Marie, 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are with God now, and I believe they are angels
now,'' said neighbor Lynn Castro, who placed a wreath of flowers at
the front door of the family's home in Santa Clarita, 26 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. ``I just feel for them and I
hope they didn't feel any pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Homicide investigators said that when they responded to Nieves'
emergency call at 1:16 p.m. Wednesday, they found smoldering fires
and a container of ``accelerant'' in the rented house. The oven
door was open, its pilot light out and natural gas filled the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   On the kitchen floor lay the pajama-clad bodies of the girls,
wrapped in blankets and sleeping bags as if at a slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves calmly met paramedics at the door, telling them there
were ``four victims'' inside. Nieves and her 14-year-old son,
Ferdinand, who goes by his middle name, David, were treated for
smoke inhalation as detectives began their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves and her second husband, David Folden, whom she divorced
in August, were due Monday in a Riverside County court for a
custody trial to determine ``the custody, visitation and legal
status'' of the girls, officials said. The hearing was taken off
the court calendar at the request of the attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as investigators pored over evidence collected
under a search warrant, a portrait emerged of a troubled family.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was 19 when she married her first husband, Ferdinand
Nieves, in Las Vegas, Nev., on April 10, 1983, according to court
documents. The couple had their first child, Ferdinand David
Nieves, in June 1984, followed by Nikolet in September 1985, and
Rashel in September 1986.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the couple was living in Altus, Okla., where
Ferdinand Nieves was stationed in the Air Force. The couple bought
a house there, and had a $22,000 mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the birth of her third child, Sandi Nieves filed for
divorce, citing incompatibility. A divorce decree was filed April
24, 1987, in Oklahoma's Jackson County Court, and became final that
October. The court gave Sandi Nieves full custody of the three
children and granted the father liberal visitation. It also ordered
Ferdinand Nieves to pay alimony of $100 a month for a year, plus
child support of $450 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He paid support for only two months, according to a lawsuit
filed in December 1987 by his ex-wife, who by that time had
remarried. In documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court
in Pomona, Sandi Folden _ as she was then identified in court
documents _ said Ferdinand, then stationed in West Germany, owed
her $2,750 for support from July through November.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said Sandi Folden was in ``dire financial
circumstances and has not sufficient income with which to pay
counsel fees or costs of suit.'' In fact, she filed documents with
the court to represent herself in June 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not indicate the outcome of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Folden had two daughters with her second husband, who
subsequently adopted her two older girls, according to sheriff's
investigators. The couple was living in the Riverside County city
of Perris, east of Los Angeles, when they divorced in August 1997.
According to a temporary custody agreement, David Folden was
granted visitation three weekends a month while the mother
maintained physical custody of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of Sandi Nieves said he saw Folden waiting outside to
pick up the youngest girl last weekend, and that he never saw the
man enter the house on any occasion.
</P>
<P>
   In divorce papers, the couple exchanged allegations of being too
rough on the children but the documents showed that neither law
enforcement nor child protective services intervened.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, one of Folden's Perris neighbors said Folden was
devastated by Wednesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Deanne Tilton Durfee, executive director of the Los Angeles
County Inter-Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, said it is
common for violence to occur in families while members are facing
something as stressful as a custody hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very clear nexus between conflict involving parents
and fatal abuse of children. Children often get caught in the
cross-fire,'' Durfee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most precious thing to some people are their children.
Sometimes their attitude is, if I can't have them, nobody can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieves and her children moved from Perris to the single-story
Santa Clarita house in the spring, and neighbors said the family
kept to itself.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't talk to anyone,'' said neighbor Jim Jernigan.
``I'd try to wave to her just to be nice, but no way. She'd look
the other way, take the kids and they went inside. They were never
really outside for more than five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls attended Santa Clarita Elementary School and Arroyo
Seco Junior High School.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were a shock for residents in Santa Clarita, ranked
the nation's fourth-safest city by the FBI. Officials said that
while people are emotionally affected by the crime, it would likely
not disturb them in the way a random crime might.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people are concerned for their own safety in
this case because it wasn't an outside intruder, it was a member of
their own family,'' said Lt. Larry Gump of the Santa Clarita
sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure they're all upset about this.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Before D.J. Rupple even cranks the ignition, he has
already lost money.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how well he drives or how many cars he passes, Rupple
never will recuperate what it cost to park his battered 1977
Oldsmobile Cutlass along Manzanita Speedway's pit road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me $20 to get in the back gate,'' Rupple said. ``It'll
cost me another $5 for gasoline to race that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I buy a hot dog or a drink, I'm in the hole because the
most I can get by winning the main event is $25.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to stock-car racing's real world, where there are no
treasure chests, headlines or corporate sponsors pouring untold
dollars into a driver's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of drivers with empty pockets and dreams of
stardom. Drivers such as Rupple, 26, still cling to hope that his
early success in the appropriately titled bomber stock division
will one day lead to the sport's upper echelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I'm at right now, it doesn't get any lower,'' said
Rupple, the bomber stock-car leader in the driver's standings.
``But it's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NASCAR Winston Cup Series is the sport's zenith, then the
bomber circuit that Rupple and others compete in on Friday and
Saturday nights in front of mostly small crowds at dirt tracks all
across the country is the nadir.
</P>
<P>
   Although each state usually has its own particular name for the
bomber division, at Manzy it is a snug fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars we drive, they're pretty much beat up,'' said Lyle
Goodwin, a 17-year-old NASCAR wannabe and a senior at Avondale
Westview High School.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike NASCAR's premier racing division _ when scrapes and dents
are smoothed out each week or replaced with a new sleek machine
with shiny new corporate logos _ bombers remain pockmarked forever
with sponsor's names such as Askren's Used Auto Parts slapped on
with a paint brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars you see out here in this division have little or no
value,'' said Phil Hertel who created the class several years ago.
``They're just a bunch of old clunkers. Virgin cars (those without
nicks and dents) get converted very quickly out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the drivers have driven the wheels off them, they just
leave them lay there and go out and find another one. But that's
the idea behind the series. Keep it cheap and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a charter that bomber President Richard Madrid insists on
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is designed for beginners, and we want to keep it
as inexpensive as we can,'' Madrid said. ``There's a $350 claim on
each car, meaning if someone else wants to buy your car, you have
to sell it for that amount. If you don't sell, you're barred from
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the claim is so small, that discourages people from
pouring a lot of money into their cars. Why soup up the engine or
try and make it pretty if you're going to lose it, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Madrid makes certain every driver starting the main event
receives some return for a night of racing, even if the return in
some instances barely covers the cost of a sandwich and a cup of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last place pays $5,'' Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
   But one night a year at Manzy, the stakes are increased
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Arizona Automotive Recyclers Association 250 at Manzy
is worth $1,200 to the winner, a jackpot in the eyes of most of the
60 drivers expected for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like $12 billion for me,'' said Rene Madrid, who
regularly competes in the International Motor Contest Association
modified division. ``I could use the money. That's why I'm going
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, however, the bomber association discourages the
better drivers from remaining in the division.
</P>
<P>
   When racers such as Rupple begin to dominate, they are slapped
with penalties that are difficult to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Rupple recently won his fifth race of the season, and for the
remainder of the year, he must tag every main event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind it,'' said Rupple, a construction worker by day.
``I think it's a good rule. But when drivers from the upper
divisions come down and race, I think it becomes a bad rule.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the division is mostly loaded with
novices. But that doesn't translate into non-competitive racing.
</P>
<P>
   If trading paint and rubbing fenders is what turns you on, the
bomber division is the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a dirty class because there's a lot of rough
drivers out there,'' said Goodwin, who drives a 1976 Ford Torino.
``But that teaches you how to stay out of wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to go to NASCAR, and this is a way for me to get
some good experience. I know we're not Jeff Gordon and Dale
Earnhardt, but we put as much into our racing as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupple echoes that thought. And like Goodwin, Rupple hopes to
make a steady climb to stock-car racing's summit.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the road that links the bottom with the top is
long and winding, a road so full of potential potholes and dead
ends, most drivers never will reach its final destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a poor boy right now, but I still look for ways to move up
to factory stocks every week,'' Rupple said. ``A lot of guys are in
this division just to have fun, not to go up to NASCAR or anything
like that. But there's some like myself that dream of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though we're not NASCAR, we race just as hard and
want to win just as much as those guys.'' &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS STRIKE OUT  
 CUBS PITCHERS HANDCUFF HITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out at the
old ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   The late Harry Caray sang those words. The Diamondbacks are
living them.
</P>
<P>
   In their three-game series against the Chicago Cubs that ended
with a 3-2 loss Thursday at Wrigley Field, the Diamondbacks struck
out 37 times _ 13, 14 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   Their scratch-and-whiff approach _ scratching for every run they
can get while whiffing most of the time _ isn't a new fad. It's
been going on all season.
</P>
<P>
   They have 648 strikeouts this season. The only team remotely
close is the Cubs, who have 619. The Houston Astros, the
Diamondbacks' opponent for a three-game weekend series that begins
tonight in the Astrodome, have 604.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (29-56) struck out 13 times against rookie right-hander
Kerry Wood in the middle game of the series on Wednesday and once
against closer Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it against Wood, but against the other guys (Game
1 starter Mark Clark and Thursday's starter, Steve Trachsel) . . .
we need to start putting the ball in play more,'' a disgusted
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Trachsel had a solid effort, tying his career
high in strikeouts with nine and giving up a run on seven hits in 7
innings to raise his record to 7-5. Left-hander Terry Mulholland
got the last out of the eighth, and the right-handed Beck pitched
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Beck struck out Yamil Benitez to end the game after surrendering
a solo homer to Devon White, the Diamondbacks' All-Star
representative, with one out in the inning. Beck earned his second
straight save and 20th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trachsel pitched well,'' Showalter said. ``I would like to
have seen us do a better job with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel and Arizona right-hander Jeff Suppan traded scoreless
innings through the third, but Suppan clearly was having a more
difficult time of it. He was constantly behind in the count and
issued three walks in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks broke the ice in the fourth for a 1-0 lead.
Trachsel walked leadoff man Travis Lee, who advanced to second on a
single to left by Matt Williams. Trachsel got White and Jorge
Fabregas on pop-ups. Benitez then singled to left to score Lee, but
Williams was thrown out at third after the Cubs cut off the throw
from left fielder Henry Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel settled down, but Suppan continued to labor. It
appeared to be only a matter of time before the Cubs would get on
the board.
</P>
<P>
   That time was in the fifth when Jose Hernandez singled with one
out, Mickey Morandini walked and Mark Grace placed a soft single
into right to score Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored what would prove to be the decisive runs in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Alexander doubled to right to lead off. Suppan (1-7) hit
Scott Servais with a pitch, and Trachsel sacrificed them over.
Hernandez followed with a single through the hole between third
base and shortstop to bring home two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan said he threw a slider to Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get it down, but it got away from me a little,''
Suppan said.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan threw 115 pitches in 5 innings, not a good sign of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have preferred that they hit every first pitch,'' he
said. ``That would have been great. But it didn't work out that
way. The thing I want to do is try and make 'em hit grounders and
keep us in the game, and I think I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of Suppan's 17 outs were on ground balls, and three came
on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Suppan's highlight of the day came not on the mound, but
with the bat. He singled with one out in the fifth and stole second
on a called third strike to Andy Fox on a 3-2 pitch. It was the
first stolen base by an Arizona pitcher, and the hit was Suppan's
sixth of the season. &QL;

CHICAGO DOESN'T GET HATRED OF COLANGELO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - Here, the sun is shining on Jerry Colangelo, who is
sitting in the first row, dressed in a bright orange shirt, unaware
that a glob of sun block is resting on his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, there was an official tribute attended by the
mayor of Chicago. Today, he will serve as grand master in a Chicago
Heights parade. There are dinners and parties and a posse of
hard-core friends, hard-core faces that will tell you what a great
guy this man happens to be.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to wonder. To be so loved here. To be such a
lightning rod back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the old expression,'' Colangelo says. ``The climb up
the ladder is a lot more enjoyable than the perceived arrival. Once
you arrive, you're a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's a target now. A name that draws reverence from his
cronies and suck-ups, genuine appreciation from a silent majority,
careful rhetoric from weak-kneed politicians and pure hatred from a
firecracker group that isn't going away. As Colangelo glances
across the field, there is irony here.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he attended his first night game at Wrigley
Field. His basketball team was down the street, playing for an NBA
championship. America West Arena had opened to rave reviews. And no
one ever talked smack about him then, not the ambassador of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I watched the game, I had a twinge,'' Colangelo said. ``I
thought, wouldn't it be great if we had something like this in
Phoenix. Two to three weeks later, they came to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That twinge would change Colangelo's life. They would come to
him, and naturally, he would become richer. But the pure corruption
of a backdoor tax changed his standing in the community. Regardless
of his involvement, he became the symbol of forced progress and
pork-barrel politics. And ever since he stepped into the arena of
baseball, that unequivocal love has split off into separate
factions: Jerry backer. Or Jerry basher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumstances have changed for me personally,'' Colangelo
said. ``If there's a perception that has been created, that's
unfortunate. But if people knew me _ really knew me _ that's not
what they'd think. I tell you why I feel very comfortable when I
come back here. These people really know me intimately, and nothing
has changed for them.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't understand the resentment here. They have Jerry
Reinsdorf and Jerry Krause and Michael McCaskey and Bill Wirtz. An
owner who is breaking up the Bulls and an owner who won't put the
hockey team on television. They think you should feel fortunate to
have Colangelo, and when you mention the taxation without
representation, they laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Chicago was practically built in the back rooms, by
shady politicians cutting deals, by men who got things done in a
unique fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And this is how Phoenix arrived where it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Mayor Daley last night, and we were
discussing projects being done in various cities,'' Colangelo said.
``Bottom line is this: If you're a doer, you will be involved in
controversial issues. But I remember how Phoenix looked 20 years
ago, 15 years ago. I believe we've carried the banner for the city
and the state for three decades. I think we've instilled a little
bit of pride. I'm proud of what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, of course, is another story. The tree is still
sprouting, and soon, other doers will go out on that shaky limb.
They will ask you to help fund an amusement park for the Cardinals,
and down the road, the Coyotes might solicit your spare change. In
the end, the Colangelo backlash will influence the changing face of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment that must've been worth the price of admission,
Colangelo ran into Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill this week. Bidwill
was dining alone when Colangelo approached and offered a ticket to
the game. If there's one thing Bidwill hates more than the dice
game in the Valley, it's the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a White Sox fan,'' Bidwill said, leaving it at that.
</P>
<P>
   So many enemies now. But this is what bothers Colangelo the
most: His gift is his vision, and some of you can't see past the
rage. Once, you couldn't walk through downtown Phoenix at night
without fear of the shadows. Now, there is a stadium that lights up
the sky, police on the corners, a city growing out of its kid
clothes fast enough to make your head spin.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have voted for this. But when you get by the
emotion, are you thankful it happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm too sensitive, that I'm at the point in my
life where things shouldn't bother me,'' Colangelo said. ``If that
ever happens, then I'm really in trouble. But I've never entered
anything based solely on personal gain. And with all the personal
abuse that has come along with baseball, I really still believe the
majority appreciate it. I really in my heart believe that to be
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, the roof was open at Bank One Ballpark. It was
110 outside, 78 degrees inside. Bottom line is, it works. But when
you continually get beaten upon by a small segment of the
population, well, you can't win that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   As he watches his baseball team lose another game, this is the
crux of the matter. Once, he was the benevolent king, embraced by
all. And just when he reaches the top of the mountain and Phoenix
makes the big leagues, some of you don't trust him anymore. Not
like you used to, and not like they do here.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo will be escorted down the streets of his past today,
soaking in the adulation and unconditional support. And he will
probably wonder: Will it ever be like this again, back home in the
desert, in the city he built? Or is he stuck with his own little
tax, the mighty fall from hero to owner? &QL;

NEWEST COYOTE AT HOME  
 SULLIVAN JOINS TEAM WITH EASTERN FLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Sullivan has been spared a second frustrating
experience with an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan, the center-left wing whom the Coyotes acquired
from the expansion Nashville Predators this week for a
seventh-round draft pick in next year's NHL entry draft, is hoping
that he and Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk won't be ships that pass
in the night as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 30, was co-Most Valuable Player and big man on campus
when he played at Boston University. But the Marshfield, Mass.,
native departed school the year Tkachuk, a promising Boston-area
hotshot, joined the Terriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Keith through Boston College,'' Sullivan said, ``but
I've never had the chance to play with him. He's a great player,
and I'm really look forward to playing on the same team with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he gets that chance hinges on whether Coyotes General
Manager Bobby Smith can work out a contract extension with Tkachuk
without acrimony rising to a level that makes a trade the only
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the seven-year NHL veteran will be joining a team
with a distinctly New England flavor. Centers Jeremy Roenick and
Bobby Corkum and defensmen Keith Carney and Deron Quint, in
addition to Tkachuk, all hail from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan has played only with Roenick, on Team USA in the 1988
Junior World Championships in Moscow. Surprisingly, it was Sullivan
who was selected the team's most valuable offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprising because Roenick is a recognized offensive force
in the NHL, having scored more than 90 points in a season four
times, including three 100-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And Sullivan's career-high season came three seasons ago when he
scored 21 points with Calgary, although he had 18 points (five
goals) with Boston last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role thus far has always been in more of a defensive
posture,'' the 6-foot-2, 190-pound Sullivan said. ``Things like
killing penalties and playing on the checking lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weakness, I guess, has been offense. But it's been
something I've been working hard on and know that I'm on a team
that is capable of scoring a lot, maybe I can contribute more on
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons he was acquired are many. For openers, the Coyotes
didn't tender an offer to third-line left wing Darrin Shannon and
will lose him via free agency. Also, if the team somehow loses
restricted Group II free agent Corkum, Sullivan can replace him as
center on the checking line and on the penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   But if Corkum returns, as expected, having fast-skating Sullivan
on his left wing promises to provide a dangerous penalty kill.
During his career, Sullivan has led both San Jose and Calgary in
short-handed goals and points. Corkum was among the league leaders
last year with five short-handed goals and six short-handed points.
</P>
<P>
   The trade ended a hectic time for Sullivan, who swapped jerseys
three times in a week, going from his hometown Bruins, to Nashville
in the expansion draft, to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty I had mixed emotions about going to an
expansion team,'' he said. ``I went to San Jose in its first year.
It was exciting being part of something starting from the ground
floor and being part of the developmental process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed playing in Boston last year. It was the
hometown team, and my family was happy. But Boston told me after
the season I would be made available in the expansion draft and I'd
probably be taken. It's just the reality of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Smith called him with news of the trade to Phoenix, it
was welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be part of the Phoenix organization,'' he said.
``Bobby told me he was excited to have me, and he thinks I'll help
improve the team. It's a good team. It's a chance for me to be part
of a team that is capable of having a chance to win a Stanley
Cup.'' &QL;

HIGH GRASS BOTHERS OUT FIELDERS

<P>
   CHICAGO _ With its emerald-green field and lush ivy clinging to
its brick walls, Wrigley Field is aesthetically pleasing to the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Diamondbacks outfielders have a different
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not quite as thick as a jungle, the grass is very
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to judge,'' said  &UR; David Dellucci, who
started in right field in Tuesday's first game of the three-game
series and in center field in Wednesday's second game. ``You've got
to really be on top of things. If you don't, the ball could stop 20
feet in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't exactly enamored with the bleacher bums.
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw orange peels at you,'' Dellucci said. ``And I just
knew that if I got close enough, they'd try to dump a beer on me.
They weren't even into the game. It's a circus, not a baseball
game.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yamil Benitez, who started in left field in all three games of
the series, said the fans near him ``were saying a lot of bad
stuff, but not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar atmosphere at winter-league games in his
native Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really serious about the game,'' he said. &QL; 
On to Houston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci is certain to find the Astrodome more to his liking
when the Diamondbacks begin a three-game series there tonight
against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   He will have a cheering section of his own, a group of several
dozen friends and family members who will be driving from his
hometown area of Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was joking around the other day that so many people are
going to be going that they'll have to leave at 5 a.m. because of
the traffic jam,'' Dellucci said. &QL; 
Caught in the middle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As one who likes to relax before games by playing cards in the
clubhouse, shortstop  &UR; Jay Bell has been dealt some interesting
hands.
</P>
<P>
   None, however, has been as strange as the one fate has dealt
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who wears No. 33, now finds himself placed between a
couple of quirky left-handed pitchers,  &UR; Alan Embree, No. 32, and
 &UR; Brian Anderson, No. 34. Most clubhouse men set up the visitors'
lockers on a numerical basis.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two pitchers like plenty of space, some of their
clothing articles stray into Bell's area. Embree even went so far
as to write his and Anderson's names above Bell's in magic marker.
</P>
<P>
   Bell got revenge, however, on the two pitchers who were
teammates with the Cleveland Indians and have been hanging out
together since Embree's arrival in a trade last week.
</P>
<P>
   He got them to engage in a somewhat heated debate about their
choice of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' Bell said. ``I knew I was going to end up being a
referee.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Ken Robinson, who was claimed on waivers from
Toronto during spring training, experienced some shoulder problems
and was on his way back to recovery, is out until next spring after
undergoing surgery on his rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, left-hander  &UR; Omar Daal, on the
disabled list because of a strained hamstring, will make his next
start July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks investor  &UR; Jose Canchola, the former mayor of
Nogales, threw one of the ceremonial first pitches Thursday. &QL;

   Chisox's 4-run inning spoils Lima's outing
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Jose Lima had two words to describe his latest flirtation with
picking up his first victory in nearly a month:
</P>
<P>
   ``No suerte.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to have to do,'' said Lima after
his fifth failed try for win No. 8 in Thursday night's 4-3 loss to
the Chicago White Sox at the Astrodome. ``Sometimes, there is
nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was easy for Lima to pinpoint where things fell
apart. For Lima (7-5), one pitch led to one big inning. Chicago,
outscored 27-6 in the first two games of the series, received all
the run support it needed during a four-run fourth inning,
highlighted by a bases-loaded double by Magglio Ordonez that gave
the White Sox a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros righthander had a career-high 11
strikeouts. But that was little consolation after his latest
setback sent him to his third loss in five decisions. Since
becoming the National League's first six-game winner May 10, Lima
is 1-4 with five no-decisions in his past 10 outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needs to win a game,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said of Lima, who hasn't won since June 6. ``When you go a long
time without a win, sometimes it seems more difficult than it
really is to get one and you start to press forward. He was kind of
unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he had strikeout stuff and he was in command
throughout most of the game. He had one lapse, particularly the one
bad pitch to Ordonez.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Ray Durham reached base to begin the fourth on an
error by second baseman Craig Biggio, then advanced to third on
Mike Caruso's single to right field. Two batters later, Durham
scored on an RBI double by Albert Belle. Lima walked Robin Ventura
to load the bases before Ordonez lined a 1-0 changeup off the
center-field wall to score three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in run production has something to do with Lima's
woes. In his first eight starts, which produced a 6-1 record, the
Astros provided Lima with 8.6 runs per game. They have averaged 4.2
runs in his past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a matter of Lima starting one day too late. The Astros
had scored in double figures in three straight games before
Chicago's James Baldwin (3-3) limited them to three runs and four
hits in 5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to complain or blame it on my teammates,'' said
Lima, who retired the first nine batters he faced, five by
strikeout. ``They've scored some runs for me all year. I went out
and battled again and pitched seven good innings. We lost. I lost.
It's nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth inning, Lima settled down and scattered four
hits over the next three innings before being replaced by Scott
Elarton, who pitched two scoreless innings. The 11 strikeouts by
Lima marked the most by an Astros starter this season and surpassed
his previous career best of nine against the Rangers in 1995 when
he was with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   With Lima cruising, Baldwin appeared to be the one in trouble
with five walks and one hit batsman during the first four innings.
But the Astros had only a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you can get hit around all night long and have a
couple of guys on every inning and never give up more than a run or
two,'' Dierker said. ``Other times, it seems you are practically
unhittable and all of a sudden they score four runs off you.
Ordinarily, I think we could have overcome that, but not tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pulled within 4-1 in the fourth when Carl Everett led
off with a walk, Sean Berry was hit by a pitch and Lima followed
two batters later with his first RBI of the season, a groundout to
third. The Astros, who had their four-game winning streak snapped,
added two runs in the fifth. Derek Bell hit a one-out double, and
Jeff Bagwell hit his 19th homer of the season, a two-run shot off
Baldwin.

NASH SEES POTENTIAL IN DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Former Phoenix guard  &UR; Steve Nash, who was traded on
draft day to the Dallas Mavericks, said he has mixed feelings about
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad in some ways because I really love Phoenix, and I was
hoping to play my whole career there, he said. ``But I'm excited
about the opportunity I'll have in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity includes the chance to be a starting point
guard. Nash would have been a backup behind  &UR; Jason Kidd with the
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be a contender right away, but we've got a
good young nucleus of players who can grow together,'' Nash said.
``I know Fin  &UR; (Michael Finley), and  &UR; A.C. (Green) and (assistant
coach)  &UR; Donnie
 &UR; (Nelson), so it's exciting to be back with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns traded Nash for the rights to Notre Dame's  &UR; Pat
Garrity, forwards  &UR; Bubba Wells and  &UR; Martin Muursepp and the
Mavericks' 1999 first-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Nash wanted to be paid starter's money and get
starter's minutes to sign a contract extension with the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Nash wouldn't comment on the specifics of the negotiations, but
he said he only asked that he be assured he was a major piece of
the club's future plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just came down to the fact they weren't sure they
would be able to re-sign me, and they didn't want to lose me to
free agency (next summer),'' Nash said. ``I think they made a
pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the negotiations said reports that Nash
was seeking a contract worth $8 million a year were exaggerated. He
was actually seeking between $4-$5 million a season in an
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Nash wouldn't confirm that number, but said, ``I just wanted
what young, upcoming point guards in the league are getting right
now.'' &QL; 
Back to Flagstaff? &QL; 
General Manager  &UR; Bryan Colangelo said the Suns are contemplating a
return to Flagstaff for training camp this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's if there is a regular training camp. The
league and players are in a labor lockout that could threaten
training camps in October and perhaps the start of the regular
season in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is finalized, but we're considering going back to
Flagstaff,'' Colangelo said. ``We expect to make a decision within
the next week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have held their camps in such locals as Prescott, Lake
Havasu City and Flagstaff. Last season, the club conducted camp at
America West Arena.

YANKEES DEFEAT PHILLIES, 9-8, IN EXTRA INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a two-out, ninth-inning, game-tying home run
swing on Thursday night, Tino Martinez turned what had been a
dreadful evening for the Yankees into yet another chapter in their
enchanted season.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, after the Yankees rookie Ricky Ledee had singled
with the bases loaded in the 11th inning to give the Yankees a 9-8
victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Martinez was asked to
explain how his team sustained its run of memorable moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' Martinez said, ``every time that key at-bat comes up
_ the one that will decide the game _ the guy standing at the plate
is the guy with the hot bat.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Phillies holding a three-run lead in the ninth,
Martinez found himself at the plate. And he could hardly wait to
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel good about your swing like I do now,'' he said,
``you want that at-bat. You're rooting for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' closer, Mark Leiter, had yielded a double to Derek
Jeter and a walk to Paul O'Neill in the ninth, bringing Martinez to
the plate as the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a sinker to Martinez that didn't sink,'' Leiter said
of his 2-1 delivery. ``It sunk in the upper deck.''
</P>
<P>
   For Martinez, it was his second home run of the game and his
fourth in five games. He has 11 runs batted in during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th inning against reliever Jerry Spradlin (3-4),
O'Neill hit a leadoff single. Martinez followed with his third hit
of the game, a single to right field, and Spradlin walked Darryl
Strawberry to load the bases. Ledee then hit a ground ball to
center field past a drawn-in infield, giving the Yankees (58-20) a
sweep of their three-game interleague series with the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The heroics of Martinez and Ledee saved the Yankees' starting
pitcher, Hideki Irabu, from his third consecutive defeat. Irabu,
who less than a month ago led the American League in earned run
average, had another poor outing, giving up five quick runs. Irabu
left the game before he could get an out in the fourth inning,
giving up five hits and walking three.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies hit three home runs off Irabu, who has given up
eight homers in his last 112/3 innings after giving up just five
homers in his first 11 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   By every statistical measure, Irabu's recent slide has been as
dramatic as it has been sudden.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 11 starts this season, Irabu not only had a 6-2
record, but he also led the league with a 1.68 era. Opposing
hitters were batting just .192 against him and had a slugging
percentage of .307. In his last three starts _ two losses and a
no-decision _ opposing hitters have hit .362 against Irabu and have
compiled a slugging percentage of .894.
</P>
<P>
   While Irabu gave up more than two runs in just one of his first
11 starts, he has yielded 14 earned runs in the last three starts,
raising his era to 2.91.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no physical problems,'' Irabu said. ``But I know I'm
letting the team down, and it concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said he was concerned about Irabu, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think most of his problems are correctable,'' Torre
said. ``He is just giving the hitters too many good pitches to hit.
Those home runs were pitches that were too fat, too good.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu gave up two home runs to Rico Brogna and another to Mark
Lewis and left the game trailing by 5-0. The Phillies extended that
lead to 7-2, the Yankees' runs coming on Martinez's fourth-inning
home run and a solo home run by Jeter in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run homer by O'Neill in the eighth inning cut the
Phillies' lead to three runs. And when reliever Yorkis Perez walked
both Martinez and Tim Raines, Jorge Posada went to the plate with a
chance to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   In came Leiter, and Posada singled up the middle to score
Martinez, but Leiter got Chad Curtis to end the inning with a fly
out to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Brogna's second home run was measured at 414 feet and gave him
his third multi-home run game of the season and the seventh of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan followed with a sharp single to center field, and
Irabu walked Bobby Abreu. Lieberthal then singled to left field,
scoring Jordan and bringing Torre from the dugout to remove Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes relieved Irabu and retired three consecutive
batters to quell the Phillies' rally, though Holmes benefited from
a diving stop and throw to first by second baseman Chuck Knoblauch
for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular defense helped keep the Phillies scoreless in each
of the next two innings with Holmes on the mound. Left fielder Tim
Raines chased down a one-out drive by Brogna in the fifth inning,
making the catch at the wall and then throwing to Jeter, the
shortstop, who delivered a strong, one-hop relay throw to first
base to double up Scott Rolen, who had advanced several steps past
second base.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, when Abreu hit a ground ball that ricocheted off
Holmes, Jeter grabbed it near second base and started a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 5-0, the Yankees were scoreless against starter
Tyler Green until the fourth, when Martinez hit his first homer.
Two innings later, Jeter led off the sixth with his 10th homer to
straightaway center, drive estimated at 424 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter tied his career high for homers in a season. In each of
Jeter's two previous seasons with the Yankees, he has hit 10 home
runs.  &QL;

MARINERS FINALLY GIVING FANS A `BRIGHT SIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Somewhere in the Regulation Issue Sportswriters'
Handbook, there exists a passage that stipulates that, on certain
rare occasions, sports scribes must momentarily cease ranting about
why the home team is so stinking lousy and, instead, ``look on the
bright side.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, even when it comes to the 1998 Mariners, now 36-49 and in
last place on your shocking American League West scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for me and the Mariner faithful and the Mariner
semi-faithful _ all those people who secretly continue to watch
televised Mariner games but who refuse to publicly admit they're
still interested _ the M's have gone ahead and provided a rare
opportunity to ``look on the bright side.''
</P>
<P>
   And this right before they head to Texas, where the M's have
made an annual habit of bashing the brains out of the poor,
heat-stroked Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have won two games in a row, starting off July as hot as
a Independence Day firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, though, how the Mariners winning two games in a row can
spark a rash of optimism so unbridled, you could almost imagine the
M's coming real close to a AL West comeback.
</P>
<P>
   (By suggesting such an improbable comeback, have we officially
gone overboard on the ``look on the bright side'' mandate?)
</P>
<P>
   You would think so. But maybe not. Let's listen to Lou Piniella:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new month,'' the Mariner manager said Thursday, after
the M's clobbered the Rockies 10-3 with a pleasing mix of small
ball and big ball, if you want to consider Ken Griffey Jr.'s 35th
homer of the season a big ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get out of the old month. That was rough. Now we
need to see where it leads. Things can turn around on a dime in
this business. You never know,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion has it, however, that it will take some form of
currency larger than a dime on which the Mariners could turn around
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Like a bucket of Krugerrand or a billfold full of Franklins.
</P>
<P>
   But we applaud Piniella for his newfound optimism, because
frankly, it was getting scary watching Piniella vacillate between
growing good-luck mustaches, kicking dugout water buckets after yet
another Bobby Ayala blown save or muttering exasperated post-game
quotes like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Write whatever you want'' or my personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious things aren't working around here,'' which
Piniella screamed back in early June, when a Randy Johnson trade or
an infield shake-up still seemed like it might fix some of the
Mariner woes.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella isn't the only one who had just about given up on the
Mariners, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, let's be honest: The level of suspicion regarding the
Mariners this season had just about reached an all-time high as
June came to a demoralizing end.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the final day of June, just around the time the M's
were coughing up that 6-4 loss to the Rockies at the Kingdome,
paranoia was (to quote that great baseball sage and Creedence
Clearwater Revival founder John Fogerty) striking deep.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest now. Who out there was not thinking something like:
</P>
<P>
   Could the Mariners really be this bad without trying to be this
bad?
</P>
<P>
   Could Russ Davis and Joey Cora be trying to set some Guinness
Book of World Records benchmark for combined errors between a
second and third baseman?
</P>
<P>
   Did Cora and Davis (34 errors between them) desire to have their
picture in that tome, right next to that Indian guy with the
world's longest fingernails and the world's fattest man, who was so
fat (How fat was he, Laura?) that he had to be buried in a piano
box?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' June tied the club's all-time worst monthly tally
of 8-20, and by the time June 30 rolled around, you really had to
wonder:
</P>
<P>
   Did Johnson, the loser Tuesday against the Rockies, deliberately
throw that wild pitch that allowed a Colorado run to score? It was
too weird the way Johnson never flinched or got mad at himself
immediately after Greg Colbrunn crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The mind plays tricks. You start to hallucinate, because in that
same June finale game, you swear even Griffey brainlocked when he
came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, two
strikes and went golfing at a bad pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's totally entitled to do what he wants. Griffey's the
man. But if you're a desperate Mariner fan, thirsting for an RBI
single in that situation, you're starting to wonder when this
Mariner team will ever start to put it all together?
</P>
<P>
   Well, two games into July, we're here to tell you things are
looking up. Remember '95. Put on your rally caps this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're mandated to perform this civic duty under the
bylaws of the Regulation Issue Sportswriters' Handbook. Enjoy this
dose of the brighter side, since the darker side has been written
to death.

GRIFFEY STAYS IN ZONE, KEYS WIN OVER ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The blue and red T-shirt Lou Piniella wore Thursday is
well worn, and looks it. But the message emblazoned across the
front, at least for this Seattle baseball team, is a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Shut up and play ball.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive outing, the Mariners put on their
game face and slapped around the Colorado Rockies, beating them
10-3 before an afternoon crowd of 32,523 at the Kingdome. In 36
hours, the home club came up with 19 runs, two victories and some
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Mariners (36-49) are in Texas for a final three-game
set before taking their All-Star break, praying that none of this
newfound attitude adjustment has been misplayed while crossing two
time zones. There have been many false signs before in three
troublesome months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be all right,'' first baseman David
Segui said. ``We're coming out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. continued his most torrid stretch of hitting
this season, homering for the fourth straight game and seventh time
in his last nine. He went 3-for-5 with three RBIs, lacking only a
double for the cycle, one of the few offensive feats that has
eluded him in his career. His homer was his 35th.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, one-time Rockies reject Billy Swift threw seven
strong innings at his former club, walking only one. He picked up
his team-leading eighth victory in 12 decisions. He's the fifth guy
in the rotation, but No. 1 in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   And, for just the 37th time in 85 games, the Mariners went
errorless. Now a daily ritual, the club turned to defensive
replacements in the late innings. It's sort of like a second
bullpen. Left fielder Glenallen Hill and second baseman Joey Cora
were lifted for Rob Ducey and Rico Rossy, respectively, in the
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   This combination allowed the club to put together a two-game win
streak for only the second time in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we need some follow-through,'' Piniella said. ``We'll see
where it leads. Things can turn around on a dime in this business.
You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and his big bat, however, remain a constant. He got the
Mariners rolling to a six-run first inning by tripling into the
right-field corner and driving in the first two runs. He hit an
opposite-field homer to left to ignite a four-run second inning,
helping give his club a 10-0 lead after two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, Griffey had extra-base hits in six consecutive
at-bats, tying a club record but falling one shy of an American
League standard.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also provided an All-Star catch in the seventh. On a
dead sprint to straightaway center, he made an over-the-shoulder
catch, stabbing a well-hit ball by Colorado's Mike Lansing as he
neared the warning track. As Griffey made the long jog in, Lansing
stood at first in disbelief while a pop song centered around the
words ``You're Unbelievable'' appropriately was cued up and blasted
out of the Kingdome public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   Epitomizing this more serious approach, the normally playful
center fielder politely but firmly refused all interview requests
Thursday, something he did throughout the brief homestand. It's as
if he's in a zone, and doesn't want to be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where he is _ he's locked in,'' Segui said. ``And when
he's locked in, he does tremendous damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Swift of Griffey: ``It's all momentum in this game. One guy
can make everybody feed off him. He's taking that attitude he wants
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Edgar Martinez: ``He's the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are finally taking out their frustrations on
someone else and getting at least momentary results. Against
Colorado, they looked the like the Seattle teams of old.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, no one's feelings are being spared. Utilityman
Jeff Huson is gone. Pitcher Ken Cloude has been told to spend a few
days in the minors. Hill, Cora and even third baseman Russ Davis,
another defensive liability, often suffer the embarrassment of not
finishing games. Trade talk continues, leaving many in the
clubhouse insecure. It all comes back to the Piniella T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Shut up and play ball.

ANGELS FALL TO GIANTS

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ J.T. Snow didn't take kindly to the words of Angels
president Tony Tavares a couple of years ago when Tavares said the
Anaheim Angels had too many pretty boys from Newport Beach, or
something to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who actually lives in the Corona del Mar section of
Newport Beach, was eventually traded to the San Francisco Giants,
but he obviously hasn't forgotten. He hit two home runs, doubled
and drove in four as the Giants beat the Angels 7-4 before 33,272
at Edison Field on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels maintained their 3{-game lead over
Texas in the AL West. The Giants picked up a game on San Diego and
now trail by 4{ in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Snow went 5 for 13 in the three game series, and is hitting .379
(11 for 29) with five homers and 12 RBI in seven games against his
former teammates in his two seasons as a Giant. Thursday marked
Snow's eighth career multiple-homer game, five of which came while
with the Angels. He has three as a Giant, and two of those have
come against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets you going,'' Snow said of facing the Angels. ``It's
always nice to do well against those guys. I won't lie. Any player
will tell you, when they go against a team they were traded from or
weren't signed by it's nice to do well against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Snow had a good year with the Giants last season, hitting
.281 with 28 homers and 104 RBI, 1998 has been a struggle. Snow
went into the three-game series against the Angels hitting only
.216 but was obviously affected by the illness of his mother, who
recently died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation with my mom was tough to go through,''
Snow said. ``When I came back and joined the team, it was a little
more relaxing. It was time to get back to baseball. All the
worrying and heartache I felt sort of went away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the player the Angels got for Snow _ pitcher Allen
Watson _ remains on the disabled list with a lacerated wrist, an
injury he suffered opening a beer bottle earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Kirk Rueter (10-3) gave up nine hits in 51/3
innings Thursday, but got the win because he gave up only one run _
Darin Erstad's leadoff homer (No.18) in the first inning. Erstad
and Gary DiSarcina each had three hits for the Angels; Dave
Hollins, Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson had two hits apiece.
Everyone in the Angels starting lineup except Cecil Fielder had at
least one hit, and they actually outhit the Giants 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   But they left runners on base all night. They stranded 10,
including five in scoring position. The only clutch hit the Angels
came up with was Hollins' three-run homer (No.9) in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball good, but we didn't come up with the hit that
could have got us going,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``It
doesn't matter how many hits you get if you don't score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson (8-6) had the league's
third-longest winning streak, getting seven victories in a row from
May 16 to June 21. But he lost his previous start _ 6-3 to the
Padres last Friday _ and he struggled again Thursday from the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   With both of his past two starts resulting in losses to N.L.
teams, Dickson is happy that interleague play is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of interleague, it's not for me,'' Dickson said.
``It's such a different game in the National League. They're
hacking in the National League. You throw a fastball close and
they're swinging at it. I should have taken advantage of that
National League strike zone in San Diego the other day, but I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Stan Javier doubled home a run with one out in the
first inning for a 1-0 Giants lead. One out later Snow made it 3-0
with his first homer of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad led off the bottom of the first with his home run, but
that would be as close as the Angels would get in this one.
</P>
<P>
   Snow doubled home Charlie Hayes in the third inning, then led
off the sixth with his second homer of the night _ his ninth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   When Rey Sanchez singled in two runs later in the sixth, Dickson
was done for the night. His line: 51/3 innings, 7 runs, 9
hits. &UR; !end! &QL;

RED SOX COME OUT SWINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The week after the All-Star Game, Cleveland manager
Mike Hargrove will be obligated to show his face in Boston, an act
that might require some bravery after his decision not to include
Nomar Garciaparra on the American League team he will manage in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   But while Garciaparra, who hit a two-run home run in his first
at-bat to extend his hitting streak to 23 games, continues to mock
his omission from the elite, Pedro Martinez gave Hargrove a chance
to save some face after Thursday night's 15-0 win over the Montreal
Expos before 32,637 in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates scored a season high in runs and matched a
season high in hits with 20, the Red Sox ace made a strong case
that he should be Hargrove's choice to start Tuesday's All-Star
Game by toying with the Expos, a once-proud team that now ranks
among the National League's worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Jimy (Williams) making the decision, I know I would
start,'' Martinez said, ``I'm not going to argue the decision, but
yes, I'd love to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez retired the first 13 Expos batters before allowing a
single by Brad Fullmer with one out in the fifth, and sat down an
inning later with a yield of two hits, no walks, and five
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The rout came at the expense of rookie Carl Pavano, the
righthanded pitcher from Southington, Conn., who long dreamed of
pitching in Fenway Park, but not under these circumstances. Pavano,
who with Brian Rose once represented the bright future of Red Sox
pitching before being traded to Montreal in the Martinez deal, gave
up eight hits and six runs in four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really bad for the kid,'' Martinez said of the
22-year-old righthander. ``If I were him, I'd stick my head up and
keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he manages to stay healthy, he's going to be a great
pitcher. I hope he doesn't give up just because of this game. It
wasn't his fault. He's young, he was the underdog, anyway, and it's
not fair to compare him to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not fair to compare many pitchers to Martinez, who has
never won 20 games in a season, but is now well on his way after
his fifth straight win improved his record to 11-2. His earned run
average has now dropped below 3 again (2.87) after his fourth
straight start in which he has held the opposition to one run or
fewer. In his last 29 innings, Martinez has allowed just three
earned runs, an ERA of 0.93, and after striking out five Expos, he
now has 142 strikeouts, second in the league to Seattle's Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw like six or seven strikes in a row,'' Garciaparra
said, ``and when he threw a ball, I heard this funny boo from the
crowd, like `C'mon.' It kind of made me laugh. He was on today.
Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez threw just 67 pitches in six innings, 53 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our catchers should be commended for the way they're following
the game plan,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, acknowledging
the play of Scott Hatteberg Thursday night and rookie Jason Varitek
when it's been his turn. ``Our catchers are growing and getting
better. They're really following the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever script the Expos are following was lifted from Jim
Carrey. ``We had three bad games,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Outscored, 28-5, in the three-game set, the Expos once again
displayed atrocious defense, as the Red Sox rolled up eight
unearned runs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis, who made a wall-crashing catch in the second
inning to take extra bases away from Rondell White, had four hits,
as did Mike Benjamin, who has hit in a career-high eight straight
games. Lewis and Benjamin also drove in three runs apiece, as did
Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Until their last at-bat Thursday night, the Red Sox did not go
down in order in a single inning in three nights against the Expos,
who had three hits Thursday night: Fullmer's single on an 0-and-2
pitch, and a double and single by Shane Andrews, the first hit off
Martinez, the second off reliever John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up Fullmer's single, Martinez struck out the next
two batters, Scott Livingstone and Mark Grudzielanek, whose
throwing error in the bottom of the fifth opened the way for six
Sox runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Red Sox batters paraded to the plate, with Troy O'Leary's
two-run double and Lewis's two-run single the big hits in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had touched off the scoring by launching a two-run
home run, his 12th, into the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shortstop is starting to approach some historic
turf. There have been 35 hitting streaks of 30 games or more in
baseball history, including Garciaparra's 30-game streak last
season, an American League rookie record. Only two players in big
league history have done it twice: George Sisler, 41 (1922) and 34
(1925), and Ty Cobb, 40 (1911) and 35 (1917). Sisler and Cobb are
both in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And neither of those players did it in their first two seasons
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, winners of six of their last eight, are now 18
games over .500 (50-32) for the first time this season. They also
won six of their last seven games against their NL brethren, making
their final rec-ord in interleague play 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out swinging and you know, we've been on the other end
of a game like this _ everybody knows how it feels,'' Garciaparra
said. ``Everything was working well: We were swinging the bats
well, and Pedro came in and did what Pedro does best.''
</P>
<P>
   And what he should get to do in Denver.

EXPOS NEED NO ENEMIES WITH FRIEND LIKE HIM 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Here's a stat worth knowing: the Red Sox went into the
24th inning in this series against the Expos before going down
1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' said John Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' said Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the time Anthony Telford retired Darren Lewis,
Reggie Jefferson, and Nomar Garciaparra on, respectively, grounders
to the pitcher, second, and short in the Red Sox eighth, the Red
Sox already had 15 runs and 20 hits. The horse had long ago scooted
away from the barn, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Felipe Alou. All I could think of while watching this
series was how, not so long ago, the Montreal Expos were a monster
team. They were 74-40 in 1994 when the strike ruined both their
season and their franchise. Now this proud baseball savant is stuck
with prospects and suspects, and the last thing they needed to see
Thursday night was the mayor of Pedro City, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is never a welcome sight for any opposing team,
but there is the routine Pedro Martinez and there is the Pedro
Martinez who mesmerized the Expos through the first six innings of
Thursday night's 15-0 Red Sox victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nasty tonight,'' confirmed catcher Scott Hatteberg.
``He had special stuff. He had a live fastball, his usual changeup,
and tonight he also had his curveball going.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor gave up two hits in six innings. He walked no one. He
threw 67 pitches, 53 of which were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of strike ones,'' observed Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He established the night's ground rules to the very first
batter. F.P. Santangelo walked into the batter's box for what
turned out to be a very short stay. Swinging strike one. Swinging
strike two. Called strike three. Thank you very much. I'd say the
elapsed time of Santangelo's visit with Hatteberg and plate umpire
Greg Kosc was about 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor retired the first 13 men in order. The press box was
already talking you-know-what. With Pedro, you've got to. This is a
man who was born with what you call your no-hit stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have that feeling every time I take the mound,'' said
Martinez, who once lost a perfect game in the 10th inning when he
was pitching for the Expos. ``I know the day will come when I will
get a perfect game or a no-hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer ended the dream Thursday night with a solid single
to center. The only other hit was a sixth-inning leadoff double off
the wall to fairly deep left-center by Shane Andrews. There were no
regrets, because both were hit off pitcher's pitches. ``The only
bad pitch he threw was to (Rondell) White in the first,'' said
Hatteberg. The Montreal center fielder gave it a long ride to
center, but Darren Lewis hauled it in before crashing into the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone in New England was wondering, we are now
looking at the real Pedro Martinez, not the illness-ridden guy who
gave up those 12 home runs in 24 innings a while back. In his last
four starts the mayor has given up 12 hits and three earned runs in
29 innings. His earned run average during those four starts is
0.93.
</P>
<P>
   The only real problem he had Thursday night was that his
teammates wouldn't let him get back to work. The Red Sox batted
around in both the fifth (six runs) and sixth (four more). All they
really needed were the two supplied by Nomar Garciaparra's fly ball
into the net with Lewis aboard in the first.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the mayor retired to the comfort of the locker room
after the sixth. ``I had a couple of long waits, and I mean long,''
he reported. ``That can affect your arm, and your whole body.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his body, Martinez is only now feeling fit following
that bout with gastritis earlier in the season. ``It took me two
months to get back to normal,'' he said. ``I'm still underweight.
But now I'm feeling stronger. I'm off the antibiotics. I'm eating
right. I'm feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   You might argue that anyone would feel better after facing the
Expos, and you would probably be right. The final Boston totals
included 45 hits and 28 runs during the three-game sweep. The flip
side is that nine Red Sox pitchers issued one walk in three games.
The Expos contributed seven recorded errors, two wild pitches, a
passed ball, and a variety of mental blunders. If you didn't know
better, you'd have thought that Montreal shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek was working off some gambling debt. He should have
been wearing a white jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing Mayor Martinez out there against his old team Thursday
night bordered on cruel and unusual punishment. But it was his turn
to pitch, and he had no choice. He was going to torture his
buddies, and there was nothing they could do about it. ``I feel bad
for those guys,'' he said. ``I have a lot of good friends over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a lot of good friends on this team, too, if he keeps
pitching like this. ``He's getting better and better,'' said
Hatteberg. ``You can see his confidence growing. When he's like he
was tonight, he's basically untouchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the thing of it all: the offense is going to bog down,
sooner or later. But Pedro? What we saw Thursday night was nothing
special, not for him. Just hope you're lucky enough to have a
ticket the night he finally throws the no-no.

KOREAN TO GET CALL TOMORROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After two days of hemming and hawing that Derek Lowe
was still in the starting rotation, the Red Sox made official what
they've known all along: Lowe is going back to the bullpen, and
Saturday afternoon's starter against the White Sox will be making
history: Jin Ho Cho, a 22-year-old righthander who will be the
first Korean ever to pitch for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is being asked to do what few pitchers have done, regardless
of their nationality: Pitch in the big leagues in their first
season of pro ball. Will he be ready when less than three months
ago he was pitching for the Sox rookie team in the Gulf Coast
League, the lowest rung of the minors?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out (Saturday),'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
``He throws an incredible amount of strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho, whose signing was announced March 31, the same day the Red
Sox signed Billy Ashley, &UR;  &LR; was a member of the 1996 Korean Olympic
team who pitched for Won Kwang University the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted from Single A Sarasota after going 3-1 in five starts,
Cho was 3-0 with an 0.97 ERA in his first six starts with the
Double A Trenton Thunder. In 37 innings, he had 31 strikeouts and
walked just seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox inadvertently tipped off the move on Wednesday, when
they omitted Lowe's name from their list of probable pitchers for
this weekend's series against the White Sox. As late as Thursday
afternoon, manager Jimy Williams insisted that as far as he was
concerned, Lowe was still his starting pitcher Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before, Williams already had called Lowe into his
office and told him he was going back to the bullpen. Lowe is 0-7
with a 5.81 ERA as a starter, 0-0 with a 1.14 ERA out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' said Lowe, who was in the pen Thursday night.
``We're winning, and if this makes us a better team, I'm all for
it. We're on a pace to win 100 games.''
</P>
<P>
   A roster move is pending. The most likely player to be sent out
would appear to be pitcher John Wasdin, who worked two scoreless
innings Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette raved about Cho, who held opponents
to a .171 batting average. ``He has good command of all of his
pitches,'' Duquette said. ``He's shown some extraordinary control.
He's thrown over 70 percent of his pitches for strikes. He's a big,
strong kid. He's physically mature and mentally mature, and he
throws strikes with all his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Red Sox and their Asian intermediary, Ray
Poitevint, have had little success with their forays into the Far
East. They signed the Dominican mystery man, Robinson Checo, to a
deal that cost them close to $3 million. Checo has one big-league
win, sustained fractured facial bones in a freak batting practice
accident in Pawtucket, and then injured a side muscle during his
rehab stint in Fort Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also thought they had signed a Korean pro star,
lefthander Sang Lee, but the deal was nullified by Major League
Baseball.

CLINTON ENDS CHINA VISIT WITH FORECAST OF DEMOCRACY IN BEIJING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton ended a nine-day visit to China
Friday with the prediction that democracy would replace the
hard-nosed communist regime that has ruled in Beijing since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The president also lavished praise on Chinese President Jiang
Zemin in laudatory remarks that may ignite critics back home who
challenge his dealings with Beijing as a naive, one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during a 37-minute news conference
before departing on an 18-hour flight for Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent barely 11 hours in face-to-face summitry with
Chinese leaders during his five-city tour, said he expects to see
the transition to democracy and the end of Chinese communism during
his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked if there can ``ever be democracy'' in China?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' Clinton replied. ``I believe there can be and I
believe there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would like to see ``the present government _
headed by this president and this premier who are clearly committed
to reform _ ride the wave of change and take China fully into the
21st century and basically dismantle the resistance to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated: ``Not only do I believe there can be
(democracy in China); I believe there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he foresees the end of Chinese communism during his
lifetime, Clinton, 52 , replied: ``I certainly hope so. I believe
that leaders of vision and confidence and courage will find a way
to put China on the right side of history _ and keep it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed China's ``remarkable transformation,'' adding
that Chinese leaders are beginning to share his conviction that
democracy is ``the right course practically as well as morally,
yielding more stability and more progress'' in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is as confident about the emergence of democracy
in China as he is about the eventual election of a woman to serve
as president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I believe that a woman will be elected president of the
United States? I do,'' Clinton said. ``Do I think it will be a good
thing? I do. Do I know when it will happen? No. Who will make the
decision? The American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he has ``very high regard'' for the ability of
China's Soviet-trained 71-year-old leader to lead the nation of 1.2
billion through a tumultuous transition from a command economy
without western-style political freedoms to a free enterprise
system with democratic liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang is ``a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy
and a lot of vision for his age _ and indeed for any age,'' Clinton
said.``I think he has a good imagination; he has vision; he can
visualize; he can imagine a future that is different from the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``There is a very good chance that China has the
right leadership at the right time and that they understand the
daunting, massive nature of the challenges they face.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Jiang showed ``a personal expression of
confidence'' with his willingness to permit a nationally-televised
debate with an American president last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton acknowledged that Jiang faces resistance within the
Chinese leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there were ``powerful forces resisting change'' in
China, including factions that permit ``continuing governmental
restrictions on free speech, assembly and freedom of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else, he (Jiang) has constituencies with which
he must work,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped his trip would help Jiang fend off
hard-liners. Clinton adopted a low-key approach on hot button
disputes with Beijing. He did not meet personally with any Chinese
dissidents, despite criticism from the dissidents here and critics
back home, in an effort to avoid antagonizing hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that more of them (hard liners) understand that America
wishes China well; that we're not bent on containing China; and
that our human rights policy is not some excuse for some larger
strategic motive,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the cause of human rights would make progress as
the result of his private appeals to Chinese leaders to free 150
Chinese imprisoned for non-violent offenses in connection with the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests of 1989 and other Chinese
serving prison time for crimes that have been wiped off the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a strategic partnership with a country with whom
we do not have a perfect relationship,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with Martin Lee, leader of pro-democracy
activists in Hong Kong. Clinton also addressed Hong Kong business
leaders, warning that the United States cannot continue to bolster
Asia's troubled economies with disproportionate U.S. imports of
Asian-made products without Asian imports of U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very limited time period in which we can absorb all
the exports to try to do our part to keep the Asian economy
going,'' Clinton cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that he may have been a bit too harsh
during the 1992 presidential campaign when he accused President
George Bush of ``coddling'' Bejing's dictators after their
crackdown on pro-democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any president would say that once you serve in this
job, you understand a little bit more of the nuances of all
policies than you do before you get in,'' Clinton said. ``But I
believe, on balance, that we have a stronger human rights component
to our engagement strategy than was the case before.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Production at American steel companies is booming, with the
mills cranking out tonnages not seen in decades. Manufacturers are
building new plants using new technology and methods that produce
efficiencies never dreamed of in the factories that once stood in
places like Pittsburgh and Youngstown, Ohio, and still symbolize
the industry's rust-belt image for many people.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, mills in the United States produced 107.5 million
tons of raw steel, a 22.3 percent increase over 1991, the low point
of the decade, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute,
a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Production is expected to be as good or better this year, and
the outlook for the next few years is promising, too, with a peak
of 110 million tons expected in 2001, according to a survey
conducted by Locker Associates, a steel consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The sector of the industry that makes steel by melting scrap _
rather than treating ore in the standard old-fashioned blast
furnace _ has been gaining market share, accounting for 46.4
percent of total production last year, up from the mid-30 percent
range early in the decade. Its share is eventually expected to
exceed 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap-based operations were once known as mini-mills, but
they are not so mini anymore. Indeed, if the mini-mill leader, the
Nucor Corp., proceeds with planned and expected expansions, it will
emerge as the largest steel producer in the country, eclipsing the
USX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, the steel industry has encountered some speed
bumps, and it faces the possibility of longer-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   The strike at the General Motors Corp. is cutting demand for
high-quality sheet steel, the principal product of the remaining
integrated companies _ those that make steel from raw materials
forward, using blast furnaces to process iron ore.
</P>
<P>
   Power shortages in the Midwest are affecting scrap-based
companies, which use electric furnaces that require vast amounts of
power to liquefy scrap.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing the industry are the economic problems in Asia and
the weakening of Asian currencies, which has made Asian steel
cheaper to buy. The fear is that if large amounts of steel at low
prices flood this country, domestic producers will cut prices,
hurting profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the steel industry is vastly different now than it
was in the 1980s, when mills deemed obsolete were closed, throwing
tens of thousands of people out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the impurities in scrap, older steel companies
thought the mini-mills could never produce the high-quality sheet
steel used in appliances and interior car parts. Nucor proved them
wrong with its plant in Crawfordsville, Ind., in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the former general manager of that plant, Keith E. Busse,
and some of those who worked with him there are no longer part of
Nucor. They are the top executives of Steel Dynamics Inc., the
fastest-growing company in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   To further improve quality and to help protect themselves
against rising scrap prices, many scrap-based companies are
developing methods of separating iron from ore without using a
blast furnace. (Steel is iron with a small percentage of carbon and
other additives.)
</P>
<P>
   The integrated companies, meanwhile, are using the symbol of
their old ways, the blast furnace, to retain key customers, like
makers of the exterior parts of automobiles and light trucks.
Because they work with raw materials, these companies can more
closely control the chemistry and metallurgy of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Their newer methods have produced lighter, stronger types of
steel. The Bethlehem Steel Corp., which helped build the Golden
Gate Bridge and 1,100 World War II ships, is now known for products
that were not even made 10 years ago, like ultra-light sheet steel
for auto bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Steel scientists have calculated that if the 24-year-old Sears
Tower in Chicago were erected today, it would require 35 percent
less steel because of advances in steel strength.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These improvements have made foreign auto makers that assemble
cars in this country, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, Honda
and Nissan, happy to use locally produced steel, avoiding the
expense of importing it from home. Some studies show that American
steel mills have lower costs than those in Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The lower costs are a result of improvements in productivity in
the American steel industry. One key measure is the amount of labor
needed to manufacture a ton of steel. The industry has more than
doubled labor productivity, to 3.59 hours of employee work per ton
in 1995, the last year for which figures are available, from 10.1
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   But this understates what has happened. Some new scrap-based
mills are so automated they can make a ton of steel with less than
a half-hour of a worker's labor.
</P>
<P>
   All of this said, there does not seem to be much money to be
made by investing in steel stocks, at least at this time. Many are
currently trading near their 52-week lows, with little to excite
buying interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bethlehem Steel, considered a model industrial comeback
story, has suffered recently. Its stock, which doubled in value
from January to April, has since fallen more than 20 percent, to
trade at the $12.75 to $13 level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is the biggest wild card out there,'' said Robert
Schenosky, a metals analyst with Merrill Lynch. He said prices of
steel produced in Asia are looking increasingly attractive to
potential buyers in the United States, putting pressure on domestic
steelmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the stocks will be cheap enough to create trading
opportunities, but that point hasn't arrived. ``The market dynamics
are very difficult for steel stocks,'' Schenosky said. ``Not all
the bad news has been built into steel stock prices yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel imports have already begun to climb. R. Wayne Atwell, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said imports rose 21 percent
in April after falling in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   He sees an exception to the pessimistic near-term outlook for
steel stocks in Steel Dynamics, which began commercial operations
in January 1996. It is increasing production capacity to 2.4
million tons a year from 1.4 million tons, and is adding
higher-priced offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Steel Dynamics shares have fallen sharply on expectations of
weak second-quarter earnings. This last week they reached a low for
the year of $13.75, off 57 percent from their 1998 high of $23.375
on April 15, closing the week $14.125.
</P>
<P>
   Atwell said the company's problems were temporary and ``the
price more than discounts the likely earnings disappointment.''

INTERN INVASIONS: SURVIVORS' TALES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)

   (italics)There's a good deal to be said for internships. Some
say they give the intern a head start on a permanent job. Then
again, some interns, working for meager or no wages, say they are a
head start on slavery. Women complain that they clean the office
fridge and answer the phones while their male counterparts receive
genuine training. And some bosses, who paid their dues doing menial
jobs when they were interns and still aren't afraid to get their
hands dirty, wonder about a new generation that looks askance at
putting fresh paper into a fax machine.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One place that is home to many an intern is the newsroom. With
an endless supply of chores and plenty of aspiring journalists
seeking experience and an impressive resume, newspapers and TV and
radio stations are a natural habitat for the young and unhardened.
</P>
<P>
   Some are destined for greatness. But as Nancy Stanley of KVOA, a
TV station in Tucson, Ariz., tells it, a university junior who once
worked on the frenetic assignment desk was another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cute as a button and eager to please, she soon worked her way
into our hearts,'' Ms. Stanley writes. ``Except I did notice that
she often looked confused and had a hard time handling requests
involving more than one discrete step. No matter. We needed the
help, and she seemed to fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confirmation that she was in over her head came by way of her
own careful notes, written in careful, loopy discursive. On her
yellow legal pad, amid her list of daily tasks,'' Ms. Stanley says,
the intern ``had written, underlined and highlighted: `When taking
phone messages, ask who's calling.' ''
</P>
<P>
   KVOA found the intern another job, ``far, far away from the
phone.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   In the late 1970s, Kim A. Hanson of Fairfield, Conn., worked in
the human resources department of a large corporation that was
enamored of MBA candidates from its chief executive's business
school. The company recruited them as summer interns.
</P>
<P>
   One summer it hired such a young man to work in the marketing
department. He needed an apartment, and the apartment house next
door to Ms. Hanson's had a vacancy. The young man also needed a
ride to work every day. So he became part of Ms. Hanson's car pool.
</P>
<P>
   There was one little problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was never on time for anything,'' Ms. Hanson writes. ``The
car pool would leave every morning at 7:15 a.m. His routine was to
come running down his apartment steps and jump into the car clad
only in dress pants. Yes, just pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would finish dressing in the back seat of the car, adding
undershirt, dress shirt, tie, jacket, shoes and socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My roommates, who worked with me and the interns at this same
company, did not find their role as his back-seat valets amusing.
Nor did we find it funny that we had to go into his office and wake
him up to take him home at the end of every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bizarre routine continued throughout the summer months
until he finished his assignment. And what was this tardy,
unorganized individual assigned to produce during his few waking
hours that summer?
</P>
<P>
   ``A market readiness report.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a freelance designer for a jewelry firm and a former art
student, Catherine Canino of Manhattan says she can relate to the
free thinking, style and attitude an intern brought to the job a
few summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides body piercing and funky clothing, this young woman was
growing the nail of her pinkie to extreme length. ``We checked out
its growth frequently, as she was very proud of it, and it was a
weekly topic of discussion,'' Ms. Canino writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the summer, the fingernail was so long it had
begun to curl and twist around itself, and the owner had pierced it
and put a small hoop earring through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the final day of her internship, she took the afternoon
orders for iced coffee and walked to Dunkin' Donuts. She returned
distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ``While she was paying for coffee, her treasured fingernail (the
symbol of her summer) broke and dramatically flew across the
counter.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she left, Ms. Canino tied a black bow around the intern's
finger.
</P>
<P>
   In memoriam. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Not all interns are apple-cheeked youths with stars in their
eyes. When Darrell Trout of Forest Hills, Queens, became an intern
he already had a BA and an MBA and had been a buyer for chain
stores, a marketing vice president and the founder of his own
company.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years, he sold his business and took courses in
horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   He was 45 in 1995 when he became an intern in the rock garden.
``The other students suggested I should have a T-shirt created that
said, `Oldest Living Intern,' '' he writes. ``I use that as the
subtitle of a lecture I give based on my experience. That title is
`I Was a Rock Garden Serf.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Trout has finished his first book, ``Country Garden
Planner,'' and started his second, ``Kitchen Garden Planner,'' to
be published by Meredith Books, in October and March, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an intern can change your life,'' Trout said, ``even if
you aren't a college student.''

HUNTING FOR BARGAINS IN LATIN AMERICA

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)

 By MICKEY MEECE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have punished Latin American stocks this year, but
many market analysts say the downturn is strictly a case of guilt
by association with Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Asian stocks have tumbled in 1998, a result of the
crisis in many Asian economies, there has been a domino effect on
Latin American markets. Analysts attribute the connection to
investors' putting all the emerging markets into one basket _ at
least in their investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, for example, when the Morgan Stanley Emerging
Markets Free Asia index fell 3.4 percent, the Emerging Markets Free
Latin American index was off 3.5 percent. The Latin American index
is now down about 22 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts, though, say the link is a fallacious one _ and
that the market ultimately will reward those who see Latin
America's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dip in the market presents opportunities,'' said A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit,
N.J. ``This is exactly the time to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Cabrera, chief Latin America strategist at Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co., agreed that ``there's long-term opportunity in Latin
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis has created very attractive values for the
region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest W. Brown, chief economist for Latin America at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, said potential economic growth would improve
to 4.3 percent a year from 1997 through 2006, up from 2.7 percent a
year from 1987 to 1996. So far, he said, the region was muddling
through, although it ``is being growth-constrained by events
abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The constraint is investors sitting on their hands waiting for
the crisis in Southeast Asia and Japan to pass,'' Brown added.
``Thus far, they are staying away from Latin America in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors who want to go back in, analysts say the safest
way to play Latin America is through the scores of funds dedicated
to the region. Managers are expressing confidence, but they have
their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   The average Latin America fund fell 19 percent in the second
quarter, according to Lipper Analytical, after rising 0.8 percent
in the first quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the average open-end Latin America fund lost 50
percent of its assets in the last 12 months from redemptions,
Cabrera said, with a steady 1 percent trickling out of funds in 23
out of 25 weeks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patti Satterthwaite, manager of Fidelity Latin America, one of
the region's best-performing funds, acknowledged that the fund had
had redemptions in the last quarter but said the volume was not
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Like other managers, she is looking for a turnaround.
``Southeast Asia has had a significant impact on price levels and
volume, down 25 to 35 percent in Latin America,'' said Ms.
Satterthwaite, who has managed the fund since March 1993. ``As
liquidity continues to dry up, price volatility gets higher and
higher. We've seen this before, in 1995.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she is looking for bargains in blue-chip
companies, particularly telecommunications stocks. In general, she
said, Latin American phone companies are among the cheapest in the
world. Among the fund's holdings are Telefonos de Mexico and
Telecom Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The privatization story in Brazil looks attractive with
Telebras,'' she said. Telebras, the Brazilian phone giant, is
preparing to break up into 12 companies this month.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Satterthwaite sees opportunity in the consumer
sector. In Mexico, for example, real wages are rising, giving some
consumers who have been struggling for the last two years the
spending money they need, she said.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Latin America continues to hold a large position
in Brazil, said its manager, Benedict R.F. Thomas. Telebras
accounts for 18.3 percent of the fund's net assets, he said, ``by
far, our No. 1 pick in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   While Telebras is down nearly 5 percent for the year to date it
has outperformed Morgan Stanley's Brazil index by 13.1 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas views the pending breakup as relatively good news for
investors. ``With hugely improved management and growing sector
demand, we think, over all, the progress is positive indeed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Latin America has doubled its position in the last
year in YPF, an Argentinian oil and gas company, so that it now
makes up 5.5 percent of the portfolio, Thomas said. Argentina is
planning pipeline projects to Brazil, Uruguay and Chile, which will
allow YPF to sell its gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   So far, YPF is down 13 percent for the year, hit by a big drop
in oil prices, Thomas said, but it has still outperformed the local
index by 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, Thomas said the fund lowered its position in Grupo
Modello SA, the No. 1 beer marketer, to 2.3 percent of the fund in
the last year, because it is trading at 18.6 times 1998 earnings.
And it started buying Modello's competitor, Femsa Cervesa SA de CV,
which now accounts for 2.7 percent of the fund, trading at just 8.2
times 1998 earnings. ``It's another example of growth at a
reasonable price that is not cyclical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Donald W. Hoskins, who manages the Excelsior Latin America fund
for U.S. Trust, looks for companies that do not need a lot of
capital, that can grow internally and that have solid valuations.
``There are especially attractive valuations in Latin America right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He shares the other managers' enthusiasm for Telebras, which
makes up 10.5 percent of the fund, and he started buying shares two
months ago in Companhia de Electricidade do Estado do Rio de
Janeiro, or Cerj, a utility that went private in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The stock now makes up about 2 percent of the fund. With new
management, Cerj is operating more efficiently, Hoskins said. The
stock is trading at 0.57 Brazilian real, and he expects it to rise
to 0.95 in the next 12 months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins also likes the media sector, especially two Mexican
television companies. He began buying TV Azteca SA, the country's
second-largest broadcaster, when it started trading American
depository receipts in August 1997 at $18.75; it now makes up 1.6
percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The company trades at around $13, but he expects it to rise to
$22 in 12 months. At the beginning of the year he began buying
Grupo Televisa, the largest network in Mexico, which now makes up
2.7 percent of the fund. The company trades at 167.7 Mexican pesos,
and he expects it to rise to 218 pesos in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these companies attractive to Hoskins is the growth
in television advertising in the region. As a percentage of gross
domestic product, total advertising spending is 1.8 percent in
Brazil and 0.4 percent in Mexico, compared with 2.5 percent in the
United States, Hoskins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the advertising sector is very attractive,
driven by more competition and consumers spending very strongly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes Minsur SA-Trabajo, a tin mining company in Peru,
which he began buying in February and which now makes up 2.5
percent of the fund. Hoskins said Minsur was increasing
productivity by expanding its mines by 50 percent. It is also
adding 40 percent more refining capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company reached a high of 6.24 Peruvian soles on June 11,
hitting a low of 3.92 on Jan. 19. It now trades at 5.8 soles and he
expects it to rise to 8.8. ``The real story is their ability to
increase production,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with what's
happening in Asia.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Returning a leased car or truck is often thought to be a
turn-in-the-keys deal, but it can result in stunning, unanticipated
charges. Consumers can minimize the likelihood of wallet-stinging
damage, though, with some strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   How unpleasant can returning a vehicle be? Consumer Reports
magazine surveyed 203 people in August 1997 who had returned a
leased car in the prior year. It found that 38 percent would not
lease again, 25 percent faced lease-end charges and 30 percent
failed to recoup their security deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the back end, there's lots of subjective factors,'' said
Paige Amidon, manager of Consumer Reports' car-pricing services.
``You have very little control.''
</P>
<P>
   Lease experts say the largest unexpected charges are for
``excessive wear and tear'' _ a judgment assessed strictly by the
dealer. A close second are excess-mileage charges. Most leases also
require a ``disposition fee'' to cover the dealer's cost of selling
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Even customers who decide to buy their leased cars face fees.
Most leases require a fee to prepare paperwork if you plan to buy
and require you to notify the dealer in advance, typically a month
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Taterka, a lawyer in Kingston Springs, Tenn., said he was
shocked that a colleague had to pay a $400 fee to buy a Mazda sedan
from a dealer when its three-year lease ended in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a $400 provision, I would have disputed it at the
time,'' said Taterka, who reviewed the deal for his friend. ``But I
can't disprove it without a contract,'' he said, adding that his
friend had lost the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   One way around unreasonable charges for wear and tear is to get
more than one opinion, as Ms. Amidon learned. Before the contract
ended on her Nissan Maxima, she had taken the car to the dealer
that had issued the lease and asked for a written estimate of
anticipated repairs. But she moved to a different city before
repairing the damage, which was limited to a minor dent in a
bumper.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked another dealer near her new home for a similar
estimate, the itemized bill included new tires, a chipped
windshield and a hole in an armrest. ``The second guy found all
kinds of things wrong the first one didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all leases allow the car to be returned to any authorized
dealer, so a good strategy might be to effectively play dealers off
against each other. A lessee might have the car inspected a month
before the lease is up, obtaining a written estimate of any repairs
from one dealer, as Ms. Amidon did. Then she might get another
estimate elsewhere, making sure that the repairs meet the
requirements of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to document the vehicle's condition when returning it
is to photograph the vehicle's interior and exterior and including
in the picture a current daily newspaper in the photo to
substantiate the date. The lessee should also insist that the
dealer sign off on the vehicle's condition upon its return, said
Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are getting bills months later for damage over and
above usual use,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of documentation led to a nightmare for Leigh Gold of
West Hartford, Conn. Ms. Gold said she had thought she was buying a
Volvo station wagon from Mitchell Auto Group in Simsbury, Conn.,
and was simply making loan payments on it.
</P>
<P>
   But when, after making the last payment on her 36-month
financing, she sought the title to the car, she said she was told
she actually had been leasing it from a company called Auto-Tech,
of Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gold said the dealer had never sent her the promised
paperwork on the deal, and she refused the leasing company's demand
for an additional $1,000 to buy a car she thought she already
owned. When it was towed from her driveway six months later, Ms.
Gold said, she reclaimed her vehicle after paying $6,000 in
additional penalties to Auto-Tech, which is the subject of three
complaints with the Connecticut attorney general, including Ms.
Gold's.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mitchell Auto Group said he was unaware of Ms.
Gold's situation and could not respond to questions about it. A
lawyer for Auto-Tech said it was common for people in disputes with
leasing companies to take the position that they were unaware they
were leasing, not buying, a car. But he described Ms. Gold's
contentions as ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mileage can also be a source of problems, said Michael S.
Kranitz, president of Leasesource Online Inc., which operates an
Internet site that helps consumers shop for competitive lease rates
and vehicle prices. Exceeding the mileage allowance in the contract
can cost 8 cents to 30 cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   If the mileage costs are too high, it might be better to buy the
car at the end of the lease instead of turning it in. One factor is
whether the contract purchase price accurately reflects the car's
value in the used-car market as indicated in used-car guides like
those available on line. If the end-of-lease costs are high and the
vehicle has retained its value, a consumer might save hundreds of
dollars by buying it and then selling it independently.
</P>
<P>
   If the retail value is less than the purchase price in the
contract, the dealer may be willing to negotiate. But if the dealer
won't sell for less, and the excess-mileage charges are not too
high, the consumer should probably turn the vehicle in.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to minimize unanticipated fees when a vehicle lease
ends is to negotiate them at the contract's outset. But consumers
should be careful not to miss the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the elements in a financial transaction, the most
important single factor is that consumers have to negotiate the
purchase price,'' Ms. Amidon said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the biggest penalties come when customers
end a lease early, as 40 percent to 50 percent of them do. ``Some
think, `The most I could owe is the balance of the lease,' '' said
Aurora Harris, a consumer laywer in Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, contracts have complex, often sizable
penalties for ending early. Besides levying an early-termination
fee, like the $200 charged by Ford Motor Credit, many contracts
also recalculate a vehicle's depreciation, resulting in charges
that can be more than keeping the lease full term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies use the same formula for early termination as
for default,'' said Nancy Barron, a lawyer in San Francisco who
recently settled a class-action lawsuit against a Japanese auto
maker over its leasing practices. (The settlement prohibits her
from disclosing which company.)
</P>
<P>
   Companies can terminate leases if a customer gets too many
traffic tickets _ or dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So your poor wife is charged as if she defaulted and a lien is
put on the estate,'' Ms. Barron said.

CEILING FANS, COURTLY MEN AND A WHIFF OF OLD CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Buena Vista Social Club basked in the latest wave
of Cubaphilia when it performed on Wednesday night. The concert was
more than a musical occasion. Musicians from Cuba in their 70s, 80s
and 90s, some emerging from retirement, were making their U.S.
debuts at no less than Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   They had been rediscovered by an English recording company,
World Circuit, and an American guitarist, Ry Cooder, who produced
and played on their Grammy-winning album, ``Buena Vista Social
Club'' (Nonesuch). Wim Wenders was filming the concert, and a
largely non-Hispanic audience gave an uproarious welcome to songs
that date back as far as the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   With the bittersweet delicacy of a classic bolero, the Buena
Vista Social Club simultaneously celebrated the vitality and
virtuosity of its musicians and mourned the era they embody. The
concert began with ``Chan Chan,'' an elegiac, minor-key love song
in an old rural style; it ended with ``Silencio,'' a bolero with
the singers Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo dancing cheek to
cheek. In a love song about an unforgettable old flame, the
91-year-old guitarist Compay Segundo sang, ``Hoy represento el
pasado'' (``Today I represent the past'').
</P>
<P>
   Some of the featured musicians were side men for the great Cuban
innovators of the 1940s and 1950s. Ferrer, who had been shining
shoes for a living before the Buena Vista sessions in 1996, sang
alongside Beny More; Ruben Gonzalez, who had retired in 1991,
played piano with Arsenio Rodriguez and with Enrique Jorrin.
Working with members of a younger traditionalist group, Sierra
Maestra, they preserve an era when Latin music was danceable but
not frenetic, restrained yet puckish, and sensual but not blatant.
Ferrer and Segundo sang with sweet, rounded tones, less cutting
than current salsa singers, as the lyrics reveled in passion or
reminisced about lost love.
</P>
<P>
   The concert toured old Cuban styles: the son, with its spider
webs of fingerpicked guitars (partly lost in Carnegie Hall's
acoustics), and the danzon, with an almost stealthy pace and, in
Gonzalez's hands, some grand Romantic piano flourishes. There were
also ebullient cha-chas and mambos that turned into descargas (jam
sessions).
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Calderon and Manuel Mirabal made their trumpets beg and
tease; Barbarito Torres, on the laoudc (12-string lute) played
whizzing lines and jabbing dissonant chords. Segundo's guitar solos
were gleaming and languid, lazing behind the beat and then
sprinting.
</P>
<P>
   Cooder, the best-known musician to the United States audience,
stayed discreetly in the back row onstage, now and then adding a
hint of countryish guitar. He emerged to play alongside Segundo in
the ragtime-flavored ``Orgullecida,'' adding jazzy slide-guitar
chords that suggested Western swing. In the bolero, ``Y Tu Que Has
Hecho?,'' Segundo, who has spent his career singing second, or
harmony, vocals, sang lead in a baritone full of ardor and
authority. Gonzalez was the group's most determined crowd pleaser,
splashing across the piano with two-handed chords, ending phrases
with sweeping glissandos and quoting Liszt during a danzon. In one
tune, he carried a solo up to the top of the keyboard and beyond,
playing the air while the audience cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The music was rich with tenderness and nostalgia, suggesting a
world of tropical ease and prerevolutionary innocence. Part of
Cuba's new appeal to the outside world is the notion, partly
illusory, that its isolation has made it a time capsule,
maintaining styles that have been overrun by hectic commerciality
elsewhere. But these Cuban musicians, an apparition made possible
by shifts in politics, ambition and taste, are not disappearing
again. Gonzalez, Ferrer and other core members of the Buena Vista
Social Club will be touring the United States in the fall, keeping
Cuba's past in the present.

IRVING SLOANE, 73, SELF-TAUGHT GUITAR MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irving Sloane, a self-taught luthier whose how-to
books on high-end guitar construction paved the way for the current
proliferation of finely crafted hand-built guitars, died on June
21. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was renal-cell cancer, said his son David.
</P>
<P>
   Sloane grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan with a
grandmother who masqueraded as a gypsy and told fortunes, and at
the Hebrew Orphan Asylum. Starting in high school, he earned money
lettering signs, a skill he eventually developed into a career in
commercial art.
</P>
<P>
   In his off hours he would play classical, folk and flamenco
music on the guitar, his son said. While taking a walk one day in
the early 1950s, he peered into the window of John D'Angelico, a
renowned guitar maker, and discovered a way to unite his loves of
craft and music.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, anyone interested in guitar construction had to
find a luthier _ usually in Spain, Germany or Belgium _ and try to
become his apprentice, according to one guitar dealer. Sloane
studied with two or three guitar builders in New York and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Working at home over a period of 15 years, he devised techniques
to build a good guitar. In ``Classical Guitar Construction,'' in
1966, he outlined the steps. In ``Guitar Repair'' (1973) he taught
how to fix them. ``Steel String Guitar Construction'' and ``Making
Musical Instruments'' were his final two books. All four were
published by Dutton.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sadowsky, a New York luthier who was a graduate student at
the time, stumbled on ``Classical Guitar Construction'' in The
Whole Earth Catalog. ``Reading it was like entering a new world,''
he said. ``I can vividly recall the pictures of Irving planing his
wood to thickness and boiling his sides in a galvanized pan.'' The
books, he said, started him on his career.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son David, of North Potomac, Md., Sloane is
survived by his second wife, Zelda Phillips-Sloane; another son,
Roy, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Linda Sloane-Atchley of Lakeville,
Conn., and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are some 5,000 professional luthiers in the country
building the ``nicest guitars ever made,'' said Jay Hostetler, an
executive with an Ohio guitar company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are better books now,'' Hostetler said, ``but it all
started with Irving's books and stepped farther and farther.''

WASHINGTON, July 3 -- The following is a correction to last week's
vote chart regarding the ``IRSREFORM'' bill. The chart shows how
house representatives voted on the IRS reform bill. A ``Y'' means
the member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''

</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, June 25, the House voted 402-8, to pass an IRS
overhaul and tax bill. The measure would establish a citizens'
oversight panel and increase taxpayer rights in collection disputes
with the IRS. Supporters said the bill would protect taxpayers from
any abuse from the tax agency. Opponents objected to a measure that
shortens the capital gains holding period from 18 months to 12
months to escape financial penalties, calling it a tax break for
the wealthy. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

SKYLIGHTS: ASSETS, OR PAIN IN THE NECK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 05 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My daughter is installing new interior walls and insulation
in her house, and is wondering if skylights are a good idea. Do
they work, or are they just a pain?
</P>
<P>
   BRENDA DELANEY, Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure they work, if properly installed. Skylights are for
letting in more light, which is fine, but letting in light is also
letting out heat in winter, or bringing in heat in summer, whether
they are double-glazed, low E, or any other kind of so-called
insulating glass. Skylights may have to be shaded in winter to
reduce heat loss, and in summer to prevent excessive heat gain.
Keeping them open in summer is one way to prevent excessive heat
gain and to release heat.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively new are so-called roof windows, flat and movable and
equipped with shades. This is the type to buy. The flat ones may
tend to collect debris, particularly if installed on a shallow
roof. If the roof is shallow, you could build up the walls of the
opening so that when the roof window is installed, it is steeper
than the roof, allowing that debris to run off.
</P>
<P>
   More important to a skylight's function and to your peace of
mind is its installation. And that means the flashing, the metal or
other material that goes around the sides, bottom, and top of the
frame. In the handyman's opinion, the flashing on the sides of the
frame should be step flashing, a type that goes under each row of
roof shingles for a permanent, watertight installation. No other
kind will work as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm building a fence, and am in a quandary as to how to keep
the sections level. Would a string level be OK?
</P>
<P>
   JOE ZERMANI, Rockport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. So far you're on the right track, in wanting to keep a fence
level. Any fence that follows the contours of the property will
look dumb. If your property slopes, step the fence, making each
section at a different height, but level.
</P>
<P>
   So, you can use a string level, a little gizmo with hooks that
attach onto a taut twine. For this purpose, buy surveyor's twine, a
tough twine that pulls quite tight. You can't get it not to sag a
little, but this may not be terribly important when leveling a
rigid board. However, a regular level will be more accurate. Use a
four-foot mason's level. And, you can use the top rail of a fence
section as a level by taping the level onto it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean my hardwood floors that have a white dusty
film from heavy sanding of a bathtub before refinishing it? I wipe
a wet sponge on the floor and it looks great wet, but when it dries
the film remains. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Malden, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's an old recipe for cleaning plaster dust from a floor,
and which should work for the bathtub sanding dust as well. Mix one
tablespoon of oil _ any kind will do: lubricating, linseed, cooking
_ in a bucket of warm water. Mix thoroughly (it won't mix, but try
to keep it mixed anyway. Dip a sponge into this mess, squeeze it
out, and wipe it on the floor. The result will be a shiny and clean
floor. The shine won't last very long, but dust will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Both the faucets in my shower valve are leaking, and I can't
get any hot water. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   BILL BROWN, Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sounds as if something is wrong with the cartridges. If you
can pull the cartridges out, take them to a plumbing supply shop
for replacement. And make sure they are designed for individual
faucets _ hot and cold. If you get no hot water, it might be
because the hot-water cartridge is defective or there is a
cold-water cartridge in its place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new double hung vinyl windows, the tilt-in type, are hard
to raise and lower. How can I loosen them? Would WD40 or silicone
lube help?
</P>
<P>
   JACK MARTIN, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. WD40 or silicone lube might work; spray it on the jamb where
the window moves. The oil won't hurt the vinyl, but be sure to wipe
off excess lube with a dry cloth; left on the surface, the material
will attract dirt. If that doesn't work, you might be able to
adjust the springs.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the window is in any kind of warranty, the manufacturer
or the installer should come back and adjust the springs and free
them up for free.
</P>
<P>
   Windows are a big pain, in my opinion. They have to be tight
enough so they won't leak air. They have to be loose enough so they
will move. So a compromise is reached; not too tight and not too
loose. As with most compromises, it doesn't work very well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a new roof installed. I received several
suggestions, including fiberglass shingles and hand nailing. My
husband asked for organics (shingles that have a felt core instead
of a fiberglass core). The roofer said you can't get organics any
more. What shall I do?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DOROTHY SHUSTER, Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fire the roofer; you can indeed get organic shingles. There
is no excuse for that kind of lying. I know you can get organics
because I had my roof redone this spring with them. Hand nailing is
good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

CAPITOL'S ART WORK IS STILL A MAN'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Look up at the ceiling in the west corridor of
the art-gorged US Capitol, and you'll find one of the building's
few images of women: a mural of suffragettes marching for equal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Then look down and you'll find the words ``MEN ONLY'' in bold
capital letters. The sign is on the saloon-style doors of a men's
bathroom, but it also captures the essence of the congressional art
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 451 works of art in the Capitol, only 12 are individual
portraits or statues of women, according to Barbara Wolanin,
curator for the architect of the Capitol. One more portrait hangs
in a House office building, that of Representative Edith Nourse
Rogers, the Republican lawmaker from Lowell who served in Congress
from 1925 to 1960, the longest of any woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have made major contributions in education, health care,
social work, agriculture, literature, the arts _ you name it _ but
you would never know that by walking through the Capitol,'' says
Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio. ``Women are very
shortchanged in terms of their contributions being displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur is on a campaign to give women their due. She managed to
insert language in the 1999 legislative spending bill calling
attention to the underrepresentation of women in the Capitol art
collection and requiring a congressional plan to correct it. The
bill passed the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be for a House-Senate conference committee
to adopt the measure. Even then, some argue, it will be difficult
to get women literally into the picture on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what they're trying to do, but we can't go down
there and repaint the signing of the Declaration of Independence to
get women in there,'' said Jason Poblete, communications director
for Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who chairs
the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress and the House Fine
Arts Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur says she isn't asking that historical art be doctored or
distorted. But she is determined that Capitol curators be more
conscious about gender when they select or commission art for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some portraits of women are even locked away in storage
somewhere, and I can't understand why they have them but they don't
bring them out,'' Kaptur said.
</P>
<P>
   That recalls a spirited, four-year campaign by a coalition of 78
women's groups to get a 13-ton statue of suffragettes Lucretia
Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony moved out of the
Capitol crypt and into a much more prominent location in the
central Rotunda. In 1996, Congress approved a one-year relocation.
The bulky statue, the 1921 work of Adelaide Johnson, was moved last
year to the Rotunda, where, according to the curator's office, it
likely will have an indefinite stay.
</P>
<P>
   There in the Rotunda, statues of presidents George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses Grant,
and James Garfield stand proud. The only painting in the Rotunda
spotlighting a woman is ``Baptism of Pocahontas,'' by John Chapman.
It shows the Powhatan Indian princess, who wears a white formal
dress, kneeling before men and being blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Washington and her granddaughters stand in a dark balcony
looking on in John Trumbull's painting of ``General George
Washington Resigning His Commission.'' Mrs. Washington and the
girls were not actually at the event, but ``the artist felt it
important that they be depicted on this occasion,'' a text in the
Rotunda explains.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the Capitol artwork shows notable women are
outnumbered by nameless women in submissive or domestic roles _
Indian squaws shrieking in fear as explorers plunder their
villages; women praying, embracing men sent off to battle, and
carrying baskets of bread or spinning thread.
</P>
<P>
   In National Statuary Hall, the only woman represented is
Florence Rena Sabin, a Colorado physician. That statue stands in
the wings, behind a marble column.
</P>
<P>
   Poblete said the Capitol architect can't solve Kaptur's problem
with the statues, since they are selected and donated by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wants anything done about it, (Kaptur) has to call the
50 states' governors, some of which are women themselves,'' Poblete
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have asked the Joint Committee on the Library to do is
to actively promote increasing the number of women in the
artwork,'' Kaptur said. ``Just because the Committee on the Library
doesn't pick the statues, that's no excuse not to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The language in the House spending bill calls for the House Fine
Arts Board, the library committee and the Architect's office to
prepare a plan for the Capitol and the House office buildings
``that is more fully representative of women's contributions to
American society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't cost any more to do this,'' Kaptur said. ``It's
just a matter of trying to commission works that feature women
instead of men.''

TOWARD A NEW AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday is the Fourth of July, a holiday celebrated with the
traditional American pastimes: family reunions, cookouts, and
fireworks. But it is also a time for somber reflection. And a time,
perhaps, for giving back.
</P>
<P>
   What better day than Independence Day to acknowledge the
terrible injustices committed by our ancestors? To face history,
and ourselves, and to recognize that one man or woman's
``independence'' inevitably entails the enslavement or degradation
of a fellow human being.
</P>
<P>
   Cast your mind back 222 years. Imagine the plight of the hated
Tory, or Loyalist _ ordinary citizens of Boston, like yourselves.
These were the Bruce Lindseys and Sidney Blumenthals of their time,
men who put loyalty to their sovereign ahead of narrow personal
concerns. While Sam Adams and his petit-bourgeois pals brayed about
customs regulations and ``taxation without representation,''
Loyalists stood by king and country. You're such a fan of
representative government? I give you Jesse Helms, the late Sonny
Bono, and congressional hopeful Marjorie Clapprood. They were worth
fighting a war over?
</P>
<P>
   What fate befell the Tories? They paid the ultimate price. Most
were forced to move to Canada, home of Alex Trebek, socialized
television, and the ever-plunging dollar. Their ancestors now eke
out a living in towns like Shelburne, Nova Scotia, which had more
Harvard graduates in the '80s than Cambridge. The 1780s, that is.
It is time to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   Or what of the bedraggled Hessian mercenaries, objects of
universal derision in our history books? Sons of a great,
peace-loving nation, plucked from peaceful husbandry behind the
plow to fight an unpopular war in a foreign land. Poorly clothed
and fed, dodging bullets fired by grog-sodden cowards from behind
hedgerows. How do you think they felt?
</P>
<P>
   Do I have something concrete in mind? Yes. It's not enough to
apologize for our shortcomings, as our president recently did
before the slavemasters of Beijing. (World Cup soccer balls
stitched by Chinese prison labor? Talk about bad timing for that
little revelation ...) It is time for redress. I propose nothing
short of returning the original 13 colonies to their rightful
owners, the resurgent House of Windsor and ``Cool Britannia.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm prepared to bow and scrape
before the incipient King William. People magazine reports he's
endowed with his mother's ``sapphire eyes,'' and has the initials
W.O.W. (William of Wales) monogrammed on his racing Speedos. WOW
indeed! And if it's constitutional government you want, they've got
a mediagenic prime minister who seems every bit as alert as our own
guy, but doesn't fool around. Plus Britain has real tabloid
newspapers, the Spice Girls, and a terrific national anthem to
boot.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop there? Would you like to know how we acquired all
those flat states lined up along the Mississippi River? Tom
Jefferson stole them, that's how. That's right. Tiresome Tom,
champion of much-bruited ``Jeffersonian'' ideals, took advantage of
a country in chaos to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase from
war-torn France. Louisiana Swindle is more like it. How about
Texas? Land-hungry cattle barons trumped up the Battle of the Alamo
_ the Tonkin Gulf incident of its time _ and look whose armies are
marching down to the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a past we can be proud of? Give it back, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Alaska, too. If Boris wants it back, we'll surrender it to
him. We'll see how the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge fares at the hands
of the Russian Environmental Protection Agency. (Hint: Russia
doesn't have an Environmental Protection Agency.) California? What
Rupert Murdoch and the Japanese don't own goes back to Mexico. Then
we won't have to listen to Pat Buchanan yapping about a ``border
wall'' during Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we keep? We're keeping a patch of the original Boston
_ the North End _ at least until the end of today. I need a place
to watch the Italy-France World Cup quarterfinal match, and I want
to enjoy it on American soil. After that, who knows? Maybe Tony
Blair will let us keep Rhode Island.

A DIFFERENT SPICE, THOUGH JUST AS NICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The morning of May 29, day of the meltdown but we don't know
that yet.
</P>
<P>
   Phone rings. It's a Spice Girl, as arranged. It should be Geri
Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice, formerly known as Sexy Spice, the
leader of this pack. But it's not. It's Emma Bunton, the tiny,
21-year-old lollipop-licking pigtailed blonde known as Baby Spice.
It's a last minute switcheroo. We're told that Halliwell is ill,
but, otherwise, all is well.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the bombshell drops: Ginger Spice had jumped
ship, leaving Baby, Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Melanie Chisholm
(Sporty Spice) and Victoria Adams (Posh Spice) to fend for
themselves. The elder stateswoman, the boss lady, the former
topless model-turned-multimillionaire pop star, has bolted.
</P>
<P>
   The market crashed, governments fell, and the world shook.
</P>
<P>
   All right. Maybe not. But in the universe that is Spice World _
mostly a world of preteen females _ panic set in. Was it ... over?
In their native England, the voracious tabloid press sharpened its
claws. Having helped build the Spice machine, they decided it had
turned into a monster and was in need of tearing down. Hadn't the
Spice Girls been booed in Barcelona? Didn't they fire their manager
_ Simon Fuller (Svengali Spice?) _ under shadowy circumstances?
Didn't their movie and their second album, both called ``Spice
World'' tank? Wasn't their bloody 15 minutes up?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. What started early in 1996 with ``Wannabe,''
continues to roll forward. The second album has sold 32 million
copies worldwide. Their Boston concert sold out within 45 minutes.
In England, they endorse virtually every consumer product made _
chips, wallpaper, dolls, watches, cups. Now, touring America for
the first time, they've sold out the arenas and sheds in a flash,
including a Great Woods date Wednesday. We attempted to discuss the
post-Ginger Spice Girls scenario, but their representatives said
they were unavailable. (See sidebar below.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here's Baby Spice. Her favorite adjectives are
``amazing'' and ``brilliant.'' Her favorite adverbs are
``actually'' and ``obviously.'' She's got as much love for you _
her fans _ as Barney does for his.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it scary talking to journalists? Or are they coming to
terms with your success now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think hopefully. I mean, with the backlash thing we've sort
of taken it in our stride now. I think that happens with every band
that does quite well. Our fans have been really supportive, just
brilliant, and it's like you sort of just let it go over your head,
take it in our stride now. But I'm not scared about talking to you,
as long as you're not horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'll try not to be too horrible. I've got to say I respect
your sassiness. It seems real.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. I think I think that's one of our messages: You have to
be yourself. We're just being ourselves. We're having a lot of fun
with it, and I think we're optimistic but realistic at the same
time, and I think you know we just enjoy every minute of it. And I
think especially for us coming to America to do this tour you know
all five of us, our dream is to come over to America and tour the
US. And our fans are brilliant as well in America. The last time we
came over for our (movie) premiere, it was amazing, fans all
outside the cinemas, just amazing, absolutely amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do they relate to?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think that's very hard (to answer). A lot of people
say, `Why do you think you became so famous?'...For me it is that
we're quite positive. We think there's enough negativity in the
world. We just want to bring some good music, a bit of fun, and,
you know, a few messages to people. It's like one of our messages
is to go and have some fun. You know, the girl-power thing,
everyone wants to talk about girl power _ it's actually about
people power, it's about having strength within yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long do you think it can last?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think, personally, fundamentally, us five are best
friends, and I think that's one of the main things. You know why
we're together: It's 'cause we're all good friends and we enjoy
every minute of the day, we appreciate every second.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ah, but people wonder if this a fake friendship?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's quite easy on everybody's part, to be negative
about things, but we're just so pleased that our fans are so
supportive. I mean a lot of the backlash has been the press _ `We
can set you up and we can bring you back down.' But we feel that
only our fans can do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's a quote I love from one of you guys: ``The Spice
Girls are like heroin, you can't help but absorb them till you're
sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Do you know what that was, actually? That was a joke by a
presenter at the MTV awards. We were there and it was quite a
funny, actually. I wouldn't say something like that. I'm quite
strict with the girls, that they're not too rude. That's my part.
Make sure nothing's falling out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the platform shoes? How can you walk to say
nothing of dance?
</P>
<P>
   A: The shoes. You have to be careful with the shoes. Don't be
falling off in the shoes. Actually, I got my first pair of Buffalos
_ that's what they are, the big shoes _ I bought them about five
years ago. I've always been quite short, you see, so I've always
needed a bit of height. But you do have to be careful with the
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you always in them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, no, I've calmed down with the shoes. While we've
been in Italy and things, I've been buying some designer stuff as
well, so yeah, I've calmed down a little bit with the Buffalos. But
you'll see a few on the show, I'm sure you will.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tell me about the show. You did a lot of preparation for this
tour, your first.

CAPITOL'S ART WORK IS STILL A MAN'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Look up at the ceiling in the west corridor of
the art-gorged US Capitol, and you'll find one of the building's
few images of women: a mural of suffragettes marching for equal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Then look down and you'll find the words ``MEN ONLY'' in bold
capital letters. The sign is on the saloon-style doors of a men's
bathroom, but it also captures the essence of the congressional art
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 451 works of art in the Capitol, only 12 are individual
portraits or statues of women, according to Barbara Wolanin,
curator for the architect of the Capitol. One more portrait hangs
in a House office building, that of Representative Edith Nourse
Rogers, the Republican lawmaker from Lowell who served in Congress
from 1925 to 1960, the longest of any woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have made major contributions in education, health care,
social work, agriculture, literature, the arts _ you name it _ but
you would never know that by walking through the Capitol,'' says
Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Ohio. ``Women are very
shortchanged in terms of their contributions being displayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur is on a campaign to give women their due. She managed to
insert language in the 1999 legislative spending bill calling
attention to the underrepresentation of women in the Capitol art
collection and requiring a congressional plan to correct it. The
bill passed the House next week.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be for a House-Senate conference committee
to adopt the measure. Even then, some argue, it will be difficult
to get women literally into the picture on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand what they're trying to do, but we can't go down
there and repaint the signing of the Declaration of Independence to
get women in there,'' said Jason Poblete, communications director
for Representative Bill Thomas, a California Republican who chairs
the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress and the House Fine
Arts Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kaptur says she isn't asking that historical art be doctored or
distorted. But she is determined that Capitol curators be more
conscious about gender when they select or commission art for
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some portraits of women are even locked away in storage
somewhere, and I can't understand why they have them but they don't
bring them out,'' Kaptur said.
</P>
<P>
   That recalls a spirited, four-year campaign by a coalition of 78
women's groups to get a 13-ton statue of suffragettes Lucretia
Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony moved out of the
Capitol crypt and into a much more prominent location in the
central Rotunda. In 1996, Congress approved a one-year relocation.
The bulky statue, the 1921 work of Adelaide Johnson, was moved last
year to the Rotunda, where, according to the curator's office, it
likely will have an indefinite stay.
</P>
<P>
   There in the Rotunda, statues of presidents George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses Grant,
and James Garfield stand proud. The only painting in the Rotunda
spotlighting a woman is ``Baptism of Pocahontas,'' by John Chapman.
It shows the Powhatan Indian princess, who wears a white formal
dress, kneeling before men and being blessed.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Washington and her granddaughters stand in a dark balcony
looking on in John Trumbull's painting of ``General George
Washington Resigning His Commission.'' Mrs. Washington and the
girls were not actually at the event, but ``the artist felt it
important that they be depicted on this occasion,'' a text in the
Rotunda explains.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the Capitol artwork shows notable women are
outnumbered by nameless women in submissive or domestic roles _
Indian squaws shrieking in fear as explorers plunder their
villages; women praying, embracing men sent off to battle, and
carrying baskets of bread or spinning thread.
</P>
<P>
   In National Statuary Hall, the only woman represented is
Florence Rena Sabin, a Colorado physician. That statue stands in
the wings, behind a marble column.
</P>
<P>
   Poblete said the Capitol architect can't solve Kaptur's problem
with the statues, since they are selected and donated by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wants anything done about it, (Kaptur) has to call the
50 states' governors, some of which are women themselves,'' Poblete
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have asked the Joint Committee on the Library to do is
to actively promote increasing the number of women in the
artwork,'' Kaptur said. ``Just because the Committee on the Library
doesn't pick the statues, that's no excuse not to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The language in the House spending bill calls for the House Fine
Arts Board, the library committee and the Architect's office to
prepare a plan for the Capitol and the House office buildings
``that is more fully representative of women's contributions to
American society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't cost any more to do this,'' Kaptur said. ``It's
just a matter of trying to commission works that feature women
instead of men.''

ARNOLD LANDS JUICY ROLE IN OCEAN SPRAY DEBUT

<P>
   Arnold Communications will create the first ads for Wellfleet
Farms, the premium 100 percent juice line launched by Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc. six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray, which spent an estimated $50 million last year on
advertising, uses two ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Arnold produces ads for Ocean Spray beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Ads from Campbell Mithun Esty of Minneapolis promote cranberry
sauce and new Ocean Spray products.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Wellfleet Farms label is new, initial ads will be
created by Arnold, Ocean Spray said from its Lakeville, Mass.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows Ocean Spray's recent appointment of Lynn A.
Rotando as senior vice president of brand development.
</P>
<P>
   Rotando had been a general partner at Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray says it has already shipped 400,000 cases of
Wellfleet Farms juices, such as Cranberrry &AMP; Georgia Peach, to
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Given the response of such big chains as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
and the Kroger supermarket chain, Ocean Spray is calling the debut
of Wellfleet Farms the most successful product launch in its
68-year history. Look for Wellfleet Farms ads to begin running in
the fall.

   During July, US consumers will buy an estimated $165 million
worth of frankfurters, 41 percent more than in an average month,
according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago firm that tracks
scanning data at retail stores that sell groceries.
</P>
<P>
   In the next four weeks, consumers will buy $76 million worth of
barbecue-style condiments, $49 million worth of baked beans, and
about $1.5 billion worth of soft drinks and beer, IRI says.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like those, it's no wonder soda makers and beer
companies are among the nation's biggest advertisers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. likes to throw around statistics, too,
including the fact that the families of its more than 12 million
customers buy $37 billion worth of groceries a year.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why AOL just announced an interactive marketing
agreement with Unilever NV/PLC, the conglomerate known for such
products as Lipton tea, Ragu pasta sauce, Popsicles, and Dove (the
soap, not the ice cream bars).
</P>
<P>
   According to AOL, such products will now ``benefit from a
prominent presence throughout the AOL service, with a focus on
popular and contextually relevant areas covering such topics as
cooking, entertainment (and) health &AMP; fitness.''

   In an all-points bulletin to curable romantics, the Diagnostic
Center for Men ran print ads this week featuring a photo of an
impotence doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's tag line: ``Appointment today, Viagra tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that ad slogan as crudely direct as the one from the Maryland
plumber who boasts, ``We're Number One in the Number Two
business''?

Insurance Co. The same campaign was honored at Cannes last year.

festival's most coveted awards: a Grand Prix for print ads that
helped launch Volkswagen's updated Beetle.

AMERICAN BONDING FIRMS ENCOUNTER OVERSEAS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was once the stuff of local political drama: the
humorless officials at Moody's or Standard &AMP; Poor's cut a city's
bond rating and the mayor went on a rampage against Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era of global finance, when American business customs
are now embraced world-wide, it is no longer just mayors who
explode; so do the leaders of India, Russia, even Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrational,'' fumed Japanese Embassy official Mitsutaka
Inagaki of a Moody's warning in April that it might downgrade his
government's debt. ``A witch-hunt,'' fulminated Indian commentator
Mahatir Sabnavis of a Standard &AMP; Poor's decision in May to slash
his country's bond rating.
</P>
<P>
   Bond ratings have gone global. With them have gone the problem
of figuring out which way economies are headed and, for the
countries involved, coping with the consequences of rating
reductions. Even a tiny reduction in a bond rating can cost an
issuing country millions in increased interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``AAA+'''s and ``Ba1-'''s affixed to virtually
every bond in this country for a century are no more than educated
guesses about the likelihood a bond issuer will repay his or her
debt, they have come to mean much, much more, especially to the
emerging countries of eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America that
now depend on bond debt for development.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're viewed as kind of a report card on a country,'' said
Hendrik J. Kranenburg III, the executive vice president of Standard
&AMP; Poor's Ratings Services in New York. As such, they ellicit
powerful emotions, often to the surprise of the people who do the
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Kranenburg remembers a newspaper reporter camping outside his
hotel room during a visit to Stockholm some years ago. The reporter
thought the S&AMP;P executive was preparing to cut Sweden's bond
rating, a move the reporter's paper was convinced would bring down
the government. (Neither happened.) More recently in Asia, rating
agencies have found themselves lumped in with currency speculators
and the austerity-endorsing International Monetary Fund as economic
devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to discourage people from seeing us as report card
writers,'' Kranenburg said. ``We're really kind of nerdy,'' he
explained, ``like accountants.''
</P>
<P>
   The rating agencies have never had a lot of success staying
safely behind their nerdy image. But with the Asian crisis, their
efforts to remain in the background have fallen completely apart.
That's because the agencies' traditional critics have been joined
by a new group &UR;  &LR; _ institutional investors who use bond ratings to
decide what foreign countries, companies and projects to invest in.
</P>
<P>
   These pension and mutual fund managers and corporate executives
charge that the agencies cost them mammoth sums by failing to warn
them in advance of the crisis, then failing to cut ratings quickly
enough to reflect the dimensions of the trouble, and finally
swinging to the opposite extreme and cutting them too abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   Among the critics' chief exhibits: Korea. As late as last
September, S&AMP;P and other agencies maintained the country's ``AA-''
bond rating, the same as Italy's and Sweden's. Then in a matter of
weeks, they dropped it below the ratings for countries like
Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Paraquay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't their finest hour,'' said Luis R. Luis, a managing
director with Scudder Kemper Investments in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the crisis, one rating agency, London-based Fitch
IBCA, issued an unusual admission that it had made mistakes; S&AMP;P
and a second US agency, Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating Co., altered
the factors they examine in setting a rating, and Moody's is said
to be studying similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rating agency executives said that such changes should not come
as a surprise. The modern business of rating countries is still in
its infancy. Although S&AMP;P and Moody's have issued so-called
``sovereign'' ratings for decades, they were only of such stable,
creditworthy countries as the US and Canada and therefore did not
make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of junk bonds in the early 1980s and the 1982
foreign debt crisis, which discouraged banks from lending to
developing countries, investors were offered foreign bonds for the
first time and demanded ratings to guide their purchases. As the
financial revolution has reached into the riskiest corners of the
globe in recent years, some of the trickiest problems with ratings
have begun to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Among countries whose bonds have been recently rated or about to
be: Bolivia, Bulgaria and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, agencies studied a narrow set of issues in coming
up with a rating, like how well a country's economy was running,
whether its government was balancing the budget and whether it was
running a trade surplus. But as they have moved into the developing
world, they have had to answer increasingly controversial and
hard-to-measure questions like whether a regime was likely to hold
onto power or be overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal turns on raters' decisions. According to executives
at several agencies, the difference of a single ``notch'' in a
rating -- for example, that between between ``B'' and `BB'' -- can
raise or lower the interest rate that developing countries have to
pay on their bonds by 1.5 percentage points to 5 or more percentage
points, or tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The result is predictable: ``It can get pretty volatile'' with
government officials, said S&AMP;P's Kranenburg. ``We've had finance
ministers get pretty upset with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anytime there's a downgrade, people blow up,'' added
Daniel L. Bond, vice president and chief economist with Duff &AMP;
Phelps in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fight that the rating agencies are now engaged in over the
Asian crisis goes beyond these kinds of routine disputes. The issue
now is whether the rating agencies were looking in the right places
for potential trouble _ the stability of a country's banking
system, for example. Many critics jabe concluded they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that they were monitoring weren't what caused the
problem,'' said Joyce Chang, emerging markets director with Merrill
Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the agencies correct this problem, however, executives
acknowledge there is still a danger that some country or region
will fail to pay its debts someday. ``No one in the modern bond
market has ever experienced a sovereign default,' said Kranenburg.
``Nobody really knows what it looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   If investors ever find out, they are likely to throw a tantrum
to match that of any big city mayor.

LATTER-DAY COWBOYS AND INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SMOKE SIGNALS 
Directed by: Chris Eyre 
Screenplay by: Sherman Alexie 
Starring: Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Tantoo
Cardinal, Cody Lightning, Simon Baker, Monica Nojica 
Running time: 89 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some intense images) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've heard from the 'hood. Now, with ``Smoke Signals,'' we have
begun to hear from the rez _ as the inhabitants of the Cour d'Alene
Reservation in Idaho refer with breezy irony to the patch of turf
onto which they have been herded. It's also where they survive the
daily assaults to their self-esteem with subversive wit and a kind
of upbeat mockery that is far from self-sparing. When the dour
Victor tells his nerdy lifelong buddy, Thomas, to stop spinning
``Dances with Wolves'' fantasies, the resilient Thomas, alluding to
their tribe's emphasis on fishing, replies that ``Dances with
Salmon'' doesn't quite have the same cachet.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy but nourishing friendship between the 22-year-old men
is the film's mainspring. Adam Beach's Victor is the more
physically imposing one. Evan Adams's Thomas, with his goofy smile,
singsong vocal lilt, and natural ability to demolish the stereotype
of Indians as silent by nature, is the storyteller, smiling
unstoppably through rejection after rejection. They're linked as
well by more than the usual bonds of extended tribal family.
Victor's father saved Thomas from a house fire that killed his
parents. When Victor gets word that his father has died alone in a
trailer in Arizona, Thomas insists on accompanying him there.
</P>
<P>
   Their real journey, of course, is not to Arizona, but to
closure. Victor has been disabled by the rejection he felt when his
father deserted him and his mother years ago, and by the anger that
began by being directed at his father, and has spread to the white
world that repeatedly and sometimes assaultively denies him
respect. When two cowboys steal their seats on a bus, Victor is so
clenched he can barely speak. Thomas defuses the moment, though, by
making up a song insulting John Wayne's teeth as the film
trenchantly reminds us of the second-class citizenship forced on
Indians by a cowboy culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mockery, and even self-mockery, as a weapon is only one of the
things that causes you to pick up your ears at the rightness that
emanates from Sherman Alexie's script and Chris Eyre's direction.
Cour d'Alene Indian Alexie brings a poet's soul to his fiction,
including the story from which this film was drawn. He never makes
grand pronouncements about the pain and the love his characters are
trying to reconcile; he just lets us see both, jostling each other,
and Eyre, an Arapaho, never hits the material too hard. Between
them, we hear everything Victor's silences are saying. We also
sense the deep reserves of healing energies Thomas is reaching into
with his compulsive chatter.
</P>
<P>
   As the friends make their way from the top of the country to the
bottom and back again _ their journey to and from the archetypal
underworld _ they learn a few secrets about Victor's father, learn
what he was haunted by, thanks in part to his strong, wise and
spiritually radiant neighbor, played by Irene Bedard. They return
more complete than when they left, although there are no facile
intimations that human and generational mysteries are to be easily
resolved with a convenient cathartic insight.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Farmer and Tantoo Cardinal are authoritative, too, as
Victor's estranged but far from mutually indifferent parents.
Proceeding from an insider's vision, Alexie never makes the mistake
of dealing in stoic stereotypes. His characters are always alive,
always, they convince us, themselves. And being themselves means
they appreciate the small details of life on the rez _ such as a DJ
accompanying a sunny weather report with an aside that it's a good
day to be indigenous, or a woman who drives her car in reverse
because the forward gears are shot and she hasn't the money to get
them fixed. ``Smoke Signals'' is a disarming little gem of a film,
shining with heart and an idiosyncratic will to wholeness. In its
quiet, personalized, intimately scaled way, it's a landmark _ the
first film to be written, directed, and coproduced by Indians. But
then part of its charm is that it would make fun of the landmark
label.

KC SAYS: COMMERCIAL IS NOT A DIRTY WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Does a melody immediately pop into your head when you read
these words? ``That's the way _ uh-huh, uh-huh _ I like it.'' Let's
try another: ``Do a little dance, make a little love, get down
tonight!'' Yes, I thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work in a retail record store,'' says KC (ne: Harry
Wayne Casey), the brains, voice, and hook-meister of KC and the
Sunshine Band, a man who knows the joy of repetition. ``People
would be coming in not knowing the songs and asking me. And I
thought: `They're gonna know the name of my song if it kills me.'
In reality, that commercialism of a song is what makes it a
commercial hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you never can expect that to happen,'' continues KC,
the most successful white artist of the disco era, ``but when it
does, it's a terrific thing, and kind of gives some credibility to
the idea. When I look back at music history, when I first started
out writing, the thing that gave me a lot encouragement was the
Beatles, although I wasn't a Beatles fan at all. But one night I
was at a friend's house and she had some Beatles albums and I
looked at the lryics and said, `Damn, this is what I'm doing.' It
was simplistic and commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, of course, if it were that easy everyone would sell 75
million albums, which KC has. He wrote about shakin' booties and
the all-night boogie. Camp? Sure, a little, 'fesses KC. The
effervescent singer celebrates 25 years in the biz Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   KC hit a rut during the early '80s: death of disco, death of his
dad, a serious car crash, strident business disputes, alcohol and
other drug addictions. ``I was in `retirement,''' he says, ``doing
all the crap. After you've done it all, where do you go? I started
missing what I loved the most, the performing and musical part of
it. The two _ drugs-and-booze and performing _ did not work well
together. It was not doing anything for me anymore. It got to a
point where, you start with one glass, and then you drink a fifth
and you're not any drunker. You say, `This is no fun, I'm tired and
not all together.'''
</P>
<P>
   KC's music has never really gone away. It has helped sell cars
by General Motors, fast food by Burger King and McDonald's,
semi-fast food by Denny's. It's made him a pile of cash. Pillsbury
wanted to market Old El Paso cheese salsa and so KC re-recorded
``I'm Your Boogie Man'' with a twist: ``I'm Your Cheese Boogie
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some writers do not want their music that way,'' waxes KC. ``I
don't think it hurt. The songs are commercial and why not tie them
in with a commercial? Especially since they're 25 years old.
Although, for `I'm Your Boogie Man,' I had to think about a minute
for `Cheese' _ I thought it would be OK. (The spot) wasn't gonna
run for that long.''
</P>
<P>
   He was influenced by early Motown, James Brown, Aretha Franklin,
and the Animals, the funkier side of early to mid-1960s pop. His
songs have been covered by the Spin Doctors and White Zombie.
They've been in about 15 movies, including ``Private Parts,''
``Devil's Advocate,'' and, of course, ``Boogie Nights.'' Which he
hasn't seen. Doesn't get out much to movies, he says, and even
though he's got the videocassette and DVD versions, he hasn't
screened either yet.
</P>
<P>
   Anything on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on an album for two years,'' KC says, ``and
I'm finally getting to the point where I think it's right. It's
definitely a funky dance sound.'' Is it magic? ``You never can
tell, but I think so. I do feel it. I don't think I've lost that
thing I've been blessed with, that gift for the melodies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's talk about death. Isabel Monteiro, singer of
England's Drugstore, has written this sad, sweet gorgeous song,
``Funeral (But Most of All),'' about what happens at her funeral
(``sad-looking faces surrounding my bed ... heartbreaking tales of
passion and pride'') and what the afterlife might be like (she gets
to bring her friends and treasured possessions).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can't help but think about death, people who love
life as much as I do,'' she says from London, in the midst of
packing for a US tour. ``You can't not be aware that this fantastic
movie is going to end.'' She feels, though, the song is pure
fantasy. ``I wish there was an afterlife. I wish I could believe in
something; death is too cruel. But as far as I can tell, this is
it. Being alive, that's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, a native Brazilian who moved to London 10 years ago
with a backpack and the intent of staying six months, formed
Drugstore with her mates in 1992. She moved to England not to be a
pop star, but to escape a ``fairly oppressive, conservative
family,'' she says, ``to go to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore tosses lot of cool elements into its brew: pop,
art-rock, alt-rock, mariachi. It's buoyant and dark. A cellist, Ian
Burdge, is part of the band. On Drugstore's latest, second disc,
``White Magic for Lovers,'' Radiohead's Thom Yorke joins Monteiro
on ``El President,'' an elegaic song about assassinated Chilean
President Salvatore Allende. But the CD is far from dour. It opens
with ``Say Hello,'' a call to, and an embrace of, people everywhere
_ junkies, sinners, and thieves, too. It's propulsive, upbeat.
Monteiro writes personal songs, but she's no navel-gazer. ``I
wouldn't want to bore people as to (writing a musical) diary....
What fantastic stories can you have if you're not 65?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many different ways to live life,'' she continues.
``Some of us are luckier than others, that's very clear. But we're
all trying to go through it the best way we can. I'm moved by
people _ I can imagine their disappointment. and am moved by that
stuff.'' For all the dark edges in Drugstore's sound, the overall
effect is anything but downbeat. In concert, she says, ``the people
we talk about in the songs come to life. It's very positive _ with
sad moments _ but most nights people walk home uplifted.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odds &AMP; sods: Listen for even more of Gary Glitter's ``Rock 'n'
Roll (Part 2)'' in the movie ``Small Soldiers.'' Speaking of
movies, Newsweek found that the ``Armageddon'' soundtrack hit a
louder-than-rock level 117 db. I cover rock for a living and my
ears rang for three days. ... Checking on the charts, we find Pink
Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon'' is in its 1,108th week on
Billboard's chart (Top Pop, Catalog). Do the math and it'll put you
back in the Mesozoic Era. Floyd's ``The Wall,'' a baby, has been
there but 480 weeks. ... New England: It's not just a region; it
was once a band. Ex-drummer Hirsh Gardner, long a producer, reports
the the former bandmates established a Web site ``as a goof'' only
to get a worldwide response for their three albums, now on CD. ``I
never realized we had so much imapct after 20 years.'' The former
members bought back the rights from various labels and are selling
CDs via www.newenglandrocks.com.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... your first.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: Definitely, but I think not a lot of people realize that our
first act on television, which was on MTV, was live. And I think a
lot of people missed that, and since then we've done lots of stuff
live. So, this show, we were just talking about it a minute ago
with the girls, we feel that the Americans are really going to
appreciate this because it is filled with entertainment. A little
bit like a musical and put different elements and vibes and just
different things on. Hopefully, the Americans will really
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I imagine that as much negative attention that you've gotten
from some of the elements of the rock press there's probably some
aspect of a guilty pleasure working for some of the older people
who are there with their kids. Do you think so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, actually, every single night is very funny. We're very
pleased because a lot of families come, the moms and the dads and
the sons and the daughters. At the beginning of the show, you see
the dads sitting there and they're sort of trying to be a bit cool
and they're just sitting there with their kids going, ``Oh, yes,
calm down.'' And by the end of the show, the dads are the worst!
They're up and they're dancing and they're singing all the words.
They're dancing away and they know all the words and they're doing
the routines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, I think it allows the dads to induldge in a little bit
of, uh, fantasy too.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, maybe, but I don't know about that!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Right. Maybe that's something you can't answer ...
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I wouldn't answer that one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I should ask you, too, because people float these sort of
accusations: Is there lip-synching involved, backing tapes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all, the whole show is absolutely live. We're quite
proud of that. It's something we've been waiting to do, to sing
live. And obviously to prove ourselves a little bit. The whole show
is very live indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People also suggest you don't write your material. Do you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, we write absolutely all of it. We work with producers,
who actually write most of the music because we haven't got time to
go into a studio and work all that side out. But we actually write
all of the lyrics, we do all of the melodies. We do like to say
it's 50/50 because obviously it can get very messy. So, we'll we
want this kind of bass line or we want that ... The producers that
we work with are very good friends of ours who we've worked with
since day one. It's been a really good collaboration. ... At the
end of the day, I can't sit there every second saying, ``We do our
own music, we do sing live,'' You know, you can't keep shouting
about it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   If you actually read the back of our CD, it says ``written by
the Spice Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: We should discuss the rumors of a Spice Girls breakup, and
the firing of your manager, Simon. Did you consider breaking up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not at all. (As to Simon) I can't go too much into detail
with it because of legal sides. But the whole thing with Simon was
we'd actually managed ourselves for a year before we met him. We'd
written our first album, we went to him with our first album as the
Spice Girls. I think it was just a thing where we felt like we
needed to move on..
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was also the rumor of you and he having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, no. You realize, when you've been in the press every
single day how much of it is lies. Sometimes I can't quite believe
what is said but, no, that was so very untrue. I think because we
had a man behind us up until that point, for five girls to go off
and do their own thing was a little bit, ``Oh, are you sure about
that?'' But we have done and we're really proud of that and we're
doing quite well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there room in the Spice Girls world for anything that
isn't upbeat and optimistic?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think, yeah. When all five of us sit down, we do come out
with _ like we've had days where and we're all really tired and
we've written some gorgeous songs. There's a beautiful song on our
second album, ``Take Me Home.'' But we do realize that not
everything is so positive. And we've got some very deep songs. And,
actually, in the upbeat stuff, if you listen to the lyrics, some of
them are very, very deep.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although, I don't think you'd ever be confused with, say, Joy
Division.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think that. I think they were great. People take to
music differently, and I do completely identify with the people who
write about real life and what they've been through. But with the
Spice Girls, we feel like for kids these days there's so much
negativity in the world, we just want to give them a bit of hope
and a bit of positivity, really.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In England, you guys do ads for so many things. In a certain
sense, it seems like you're a commodity yourself.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think every band in some way does publicity, and for us, at
the end of the day, we are more than just a girl band: We've done
films, we've done adverts, and that's what we enjoy. We would never
do anything that we didn't agree with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you ever worry about a glut of Spice Girls related
products?
</P>
<P>
   A: What do you mean a glut?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Uh, too many. Like, enough where people go ``Oh, my God yet
another one!''
</P>
<P>
   A: Umm, not really, because we never take anything too
seriously. We're having fun with that and we enjoy doing it and
we're not hurting anybody. There have been things that we've turned
down, and then there's things that we've really enjoyed doing.
We've sat down and thought about that quite carefully.

TITANIC ARTIFACTS APPEAL TO BOTH BUFFS, LEO'S FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M. R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is too small to be a spectacle, too large to be a
mere curiosity, this modestly titled show, ``Titanic _ the
Exhibition,'' open daily from here to the eternity of Nov. 1. In
its first days, it is attracting a ready-made audience of Leonardo
DiCaprio fanlets with parents and au pairs in tow. The remainder of
the crowd seems to be an older sample of citizens who were
fascinated by the disaster long before the movie ``Titanic''
reached its vast, young audience. Adults were recruited by books,
several previous public television and museum documentaries, and
press coverage of the discovery and exploitation of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable saga _ the world's largest ocean liner sinks on
its maiden voyage _ is embedded in the American psyche. No other
ship has entered the common speech. Every hapless bureaucrat and
incompetent executive has been described as ``social director on
the Titanic.'' More important, they always will be. If this year
were not the 100th anniversary of the Spanish-American War, only
Trivial Pursuit virtuosos would still ``Remember the Maine!''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit itself at Boston's World Trade Center _ about 70
stands and glassed-in pedestals _ probably does contain the touted
several hundred artifacts (is the deck of cards one thing or 52
plus jokers?). And the simple fact is that almost nothing on
display would attract attention except for its temporary 80-year
storage on the floor of the Atlantic, 2 1/2 miles deep. People
would have to be paid money to make their way to lower Congress
Street (``New Congress Street'' in Big Dig parlance) to look at a
safety razor and a paper box of double-edge Gillette blades.
</P>
<P>
   With very few exceptions, the show consists of such mundane
things made into relics by inadvertent baptism in salt water. There
is, for example, a corroded aluminum and brass megaphone, identical
in size and shape to every high school cheerleader's acoustic
device. It certainly looks like it was rescued from 2,200 fathoms
under the sea, but in case the visitor is not awed, a sign
suggests:
</P>
<P>
   ``This aluminum megaphone, with its brass frame, might have been
used by Captain Smith in giving orders to abandon ship.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that curiously retrieved objects gained at
great expense and risk of life are not fascinating. Lines still
form in museums to look at moon rocks, which look exactly like
rocks, only smaller. Pebbles from Mars will, if anyone is still
alive, require extended hours and increased security if some come
back in the year 2525.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing particularly ghoulish about the exhibit; if
anything, it errs on the side of reverence, or perhaps bathos. A
pedestal supports two playing marbles, one intact, one rather badly
broken: ``A childhood dream, soon to be shattered, can perhaps be
seen in these marbles,'' the visitor is advised. Given the age of
the DiCaprio contingent, such advice can perhaps be seen as
necessary to create the proper mood. It does keep one from
remarking out loud that in the big scheme of things, a marble is
just a marble, and in this case, not even an aggie, let alone a
cat's eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of the exhibit, there seems to be a shortage
of signage; several cases are either expected to tell their own
story (possible in most examples) or the label is in the mail. One
of the unlabeled exhibits (as of Thursday morning) is a single
piece of sheet music, probably the second page of a folio. With
difficulty (compounded for the bifocal wearers, who have to enlist
the aid of literate pre-teens to read the uppermost lyrics), it can
be determined that the music is not only authentically Titanic, but
is itself an icon of the straw-boater, striped-shirt, world of
1912. The song is used to this day in movies to establish with a
few bars the time period of 1910 (and it was revived, oddly, during
World War II):
</P>
<P>
   ``Put your arms around me honey, hold me tight, cuddle up and
cuddle me with all your might'' a Leonardo fan read aloud, and
added: ``It says something funny, something like `Oh Babe won't you
roll dem eyes,' and then it ends.'' So it goes.
</P>
<P>
   In an academic exhibit (if one can be imagined), the label might
give you the title (not surprisingly, ``Put Your Arms Around Me
Honey,'') and might even, if it were a Harvard exhibit, inform the
visitor that the lyrics were by Junie McCree and the music was by
Albert Von Tilzer. (Readers who have never heard of Von Tilzer
should know he is also the composer of ``Take Me Out to the Ball
Game.'')
</P>
<P>
   The saddest objects, like most of the personal belongings, were
brought up from the depths in suitcases or valises. Near the exit,
unfolded like a very flattened patient etherized on a table, is a
pressed double-breasted men's suit and socks to match.
</P>
<P>
   The most engaging article, both in size (some 15 feet in length)
and in its organic shape, is what appears from a distance to be
something like a sperm whale's lower jawbone. It is the steel davit
_ a ship's small hoisting crane for a life boat. Elegantly curved,
its function perfectly expressed in its form, the davit fairly
shouts at the visitor: ``This show is about lifeboats, this is all
about death.''
</P>
<P>
   That fact is not lost on the younger visitors. Allison
Ustynoski, 9, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., (where she has been taken out
to the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre Red Barons ballgames) very much wanted
to see the show. ``And then,'' she said, with that pure certainty
of young women of that age, ``I think they should put everything
back.''

PARAMETRIC WOES SPARK NOSE DIVE; SHARES FALL 35% 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parametric Technology Inc.'s growth over the past decade has
been nothing short of spectacular. It has had 40 consecutive
quarters of improved sales and operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing more astounding about the Waltha, Mass.
software company is the breathtaking nose dive its shares have
taken in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that investors can wipe out $4.5 billion of a
company's market value in less than a week, but that's what
happened to Parametric, the leading provider of software that helps
engineers design new products.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Parametric shares plunged as much as 40 percent after
the company warned late Wednesday that glitches in its shift to a
promising new product would hurt sales and profits for its
third-quarter ending Saturday, July 4. The warning prompted at
least four investment analysts to downgrade the stock Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric shares, which had been trading at about 35 in
mid-April, fell 8 3/4 Thursday to close at 161/16. Nearly 40
million shares traded hands, making it the second-most active US
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The tumble came on the heels of another big plunge earlier in
the week, after an analyst at Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill downgraded the
stock amid worries that its core software product was being hurt by
lower-priced competitors that are nibbling away at the lower end of
Parametric's customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The slide began Friday on concerns that the economic crisis in
Asia was choking demand for Parametric's software among Japanese
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-third of the world's economy is taking a holiday, and that
can really hurt a company,'' said Charles Foundyller, president and
chief executive of Daratech Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. market
research firm that tracks the computer-aided design industry.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric makes sophisticated three-dimensional modeling
software that helps engineers design everything from cars to
airplanes to cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Its core product, called ProEngineer, features breakthrough
technology that allows an automotive designer, for instance, to
tinker with one feature of the vehicle, and the software will
automatically recalculate the relative dimensions of the rest of
the automobile. That greatly speeds the time it takes for an
automaker to bring new cars to market.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors have discovered that some mid-sized customers
are willing to do without all of the bells and whistles in
Parametric's design software if they can save money. So they're now
offering design software that costs just $5,000 to $8,000, far less
than Parametric's ProEngineer, which sells for an average of
$19,000.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, and even Parametric executives themselves, say the
company's biggest problem is its own doing.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to begin selling a promising new Web-based software that
works in conjunction with its original program, Parametric shifted
its best sales people _ 25 percent of its sales force _ to the new
product, called Windchill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, sales of its core product, ProEngineer, dropped
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Wednesday afternoon,
Parametric officials said they expect revenue for the quarter
ending Saturday to be 15 percent below analysts' estimates, which
had ranged from $292 million to $300 million, and that earnings
will also fall below analysts' estimates of 26 cents a diluted
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``This result is something of a surprise to us,'' said chairman
and chief executive Steven Walske, who called the shortfall
``embarrassing.'' The company will announce its third-quarter
results July 16.

COUPLE RIGHT ON TARGET WITH SAVINGS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 05 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 33 years old and are saving for our
retirement and for the college education of our future children.
Our retirement investments include $30,000 in Fidelity Growth and
Income fund and $1,000 in T. Rowe Price Equity Income fund, to
which we add $624 and $162 a month respectively. We also have these
mutual fund accounts to which we are no longer making
contributions: $22,000 in Vanguard Windsor II, $5,300 in Fidelity
Contrafund, $4,400 in Scudder International, $1,700 in Vanguard
Institutional, and $1,500 in AIM Constellation. Investments
designated for the college expenses are $6,100 in Scudder Large
Company Value fund, $4,800 in Janus Growth and Income fund, and
$3,900 in PBHG Growth, and $1,600 in Oakmark fund. We add $100 a
month to each account, except we add $200 a month to Janus Growth
and Income. We hope to have the first of two children in the next
two years, and to retire at age 62. Are we being sufficiently
aggressive in saving for our goals?
</P>
<P>
   K.G., Scituate, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, my tally shows a likely retirement pool of $2,511,435
after 29 years (based upon an assumption of 10 percent average
annual returns and contributions at your current level). And my
guess is that you may be slightly overfunding the college accounts.
So you're doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   My calculation is that after 18 years of ongoing contributions
to the college account, you will have amassed $421,367, again
assuming 10 percent average returns.
</P>
<P>
   If we follow the experts who project 6 percent annual inflation
in college costs, the ticket for the freshman year in a private
college in 18 years would be about $56,000. When we carry the
ongoing contributions through a six-year period -- I'm guessing
that the second child might be two years younger than the first --
you'll have plenty to meet the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are two additional factors. One is that it seems
to me probable that at some stage the escalation in educational
costs will have to slow down, lest we either produce a generation
that's uneducated because so few can afford college, or in the
alternative, a generation that will be saddled with $150,000 or so
in college loans by the time they get their first jobs. The second
factor is that almost everybody qualifies for some form of
financial aid -- especially if their parents have planned ahead so
as to maximize eligibility. So it's likely the real costs will be
less than that horrifying $56,000 for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a few points about the portfolios. First, you don't say
whether or not the retirement money is in tax-deferred accounts
such as 401(k)s , IRAs, or similar instruments. If they are not, I
suggest you investigate the variable annuities offered by most
major fund families, which will provide you with tax-deferral, at a
cost of only about one half of one percent less than the returns
for comparable traditional mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Next, one of the funds you list -- Vanguard Institutional --
leaves me a bit at a loss -- precisely what is it? Vanguard offers
two institutional funds that track the Standard and Poor's 500
Index, and my guess is that it's one of these. If that's so, I
tally that eight of your total 11 funds -- and all of those in
which your largest positions are lodged -- are large-cap funds. AIM
Constellation and PBHG Growth both fall in the mid-cap arena, and
International find is a small position. That's not enough: I think
you have too much reliance on large-caps, and I suggest a bit more
diversification for the retirement portfolio -- certainly adding a
small-cap fund, perhaps increasing the commitment to the mid-caps,
and even adding smaller positions in funds in the health care and
technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, once your children are born, I suggest you take full
advantage of the new educational IRAs, which will give you a little
tax advantage on the college-savings side (and shouldn't eventually
amount to so much that they would seriously affect eligibility for
financial aid).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife is 58 1/2 years old and I am 59 1/2. We plan retiring
in June of 1999. My wife has a small pension plan with which she
has a choice of a $24,000 lump sum or a $450 monthly annuity. Which
should she take? I have a $525,000 retirement portfolio, consisting
of $225,000 in money markets and CDs, almost $25,000 in common
stocks, and the rest in income-oriented mutual funds. What changes
should I make? I am trying to be as conservative as possible. I
need to take out approximately $3,200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   C.M., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your wife's pension options sound too good to be true. If the
numbers are right, there's no question that the annuity is more
attractive than the lump sum. If your wife were to take the cash
and invest it so as to produce a $450 monthly income stream for 20
years, she would have to achieve a 24.78 percent average annual
return. Either her employer is offering a very powerful incentive
to take the annuity, or there's something wrong with the terms as
you have stated them. Anyway, if you've got it right, take the
annuity with a glad cry. But check.
</P>
<P>
   As for your portfolio, I worked it out on a spreadsheet and
estimated a portfolio average 6.26 percent yield; I say estimated
because you provided yields for everything but your common stock,
and I plugged a very conservative 1 percent number in there. This
brings you an annual income stream of $32,862, or $2,738 a month.
If you can add your wife's annuity to that amount, it takes you
within 12 bucks of the target $3,200. If you consider the annuity
as separate money, you could simply stick with the portfolio as it
is, counting on it to last about 30 years -- and probably a little
more, because that calculation didn't account for growth within
that small stock portfolio. But if we estimate 8 percent growth in
the stock portfolio over those 30 years (using a lower figure than
usual because you are taking the dividends in cash) that segment of
the portfolio would grow to about $251,000 - - enough to keep you
going for another eight years or so.
</P>
<P>
   That all works out tidily on paper, but not if you worry about
inflation. The value of $3,200 a month is certain to be
dramatically less in a decade or so than it is now. So what you
need is something to deliver capital growth as well as income. I
usually find myself advising people your age to cut back on stocks;
in your case, it's the opposite. You hold less than 5 percent
stocks, and I think at a minimum that figure should be doubled --
and given your relative youth, it should probably be tripled. You
can do this in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   One would be to try to trim your budget by $200 to $300 a month,
transferring funds (slowly) from your lowest-yielding investment
(the money market) to a middle-of-the-road stock fund, such as one
tracking the Standard and Poor's 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, provided you and your wife will be eligible for
Social Security checks in a few years, is to proceed with the
current portfolio until those checks kick in; once that happens,
keep your income stream as it is and use the Social Security checks
to build up the stock position.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, once Social Security does kick in, it will represent
the last substantial ``raise'' you're likely to see in retirement,
so you'll want to use as much of it as you can to protect yourself
against future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 67 with a monthly income of about $3,000 from pensions
and Social Security. I have a total of $209,000 invested, with the
lion's share in fixed-income securities. Since retiring I realize
our investments were too conservative, and now I want to invest
$30,000 which is now in a 3.04 percent savings account, plus
another $10,000. Do you suggest putting this money in higher-risk
funds?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Woodville, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I think it's a good idea -- but move slowly. I suggest
you start with the $30,000, investing it over a 36-month period. At
the end of that time, you can decide whether you want to go
further; a $30,000 stock investment would represent a little less
than 15 percent of your portfolio; another $10,000 would bump it up
to a little more than 19%.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you begin by putting $3,000 of the money in a fund I
have long admired -- Vanguard Index Value, which holds about two
thirds of the Standard and Poor's 500 stocks -- those with the
lowest price-to-book value ratios, and also those that tend to pay
the heaviest dividends. Then put the other $27,000 in Vanguard's
Prime Money Market fund, with instructions to move $800 into Index
Value every month.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming a 5 percent yield from the money fund, this will mean
you'll be fully invested in about 36 months. This technique, called
dollar cost averaging, protects you from a sudden marked downturn
(because you buy later shares at lower prices) and is basically a
conservative approach to establishing a position in a stock fund.
I'm running out of space, but see the letter from C.M. above to
understand why I think a modest stock position is a good idea in
retirement.

INSURANCE INDUSTRY FEARS A TITANIC SHOCK IN YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine you're the captain of the Titanic, and you're 20 feet
away from that iceberg. Suddenly your insurance agent comes
bounding up to the bridge to add just one thing to your policy: a
provision excluding coverage if you hit an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   That, says a spokesman for the Massachusetts Division of
Insurance, is in essence what the insurance industry appears to be
trying to do in the face of a giant iceberg ahead _ the year 2000
computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   Property and casualty insurers are beginning to fear that the
price tag for Y2K litigation could rival the ruinous costs the
industry incurred in the cases of asbestos and environmental
exposure. Insurers are quietly trying to get out front of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually unnoticed, the industry has received approval in about
40 states for new language that could exclude coverage for losses
associated with year 2000 problems in most new or renewed policies.
The exclusions deal mainly with coverage for businesses, but also
affect some homeowners' policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Services Offices Inc. in New York, which develops
policies and policy language for the industry, began filing the
exclusions with regulators last year; a number of companies also
have filed exclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The industry says the exclusions are needed to clarify what is
covered and what is not in products from general liability
insurance to business interruption coverage. Insurers say coverage
for Y2K problems has never been reflected in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policies were never intended to cover this exposure,''
says Emily Canelo, a senior vice president for Zurich Re (North
America) Inc. in New York, a reinsurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug refers to the concern that many software programs
will crash with the coming of the millennium. Because these
programs store dates as two digits, they can't distinguish between,
for example, the years 2000 and 1900.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what happens if the factories can't run or offices
can't open because of the Y2K defect. Can a business owner bring a
suit against the software maker, a distributor, or the consultants
who recommended the program? Who pays for the loss of business
while your company is shut down?
</P>
<P>
   Canelo says the courts stuck insurers with the bills for
asbestos and environmental cleanup and the industry does not want
to let that happen again. She objects to the Titanic analogy:
``Would an insurer insure a burning building?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, say industry critics, is that the industry wants to
exclude everything that moves. Then if businesses and consumers
have to buy extra coverage for Y2K problems at this late date, it
is going to be prohibitively expensive. Can you imagine, after all,
how much it would cost to insure that burning building?
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Eisenstein, a partner in the Washington firm Swidler &AMP;
Berlin, doesn't think insurance companies are going to be able to
make exclusions stick even if regulators approve them. The
insurance business is just too competitive, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is one of a handful of states that have not
approved the exclusions. One of the state's regulators strongly
objected to the exclusions during last week's meeting in Boston of
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. And the
division met Thursday with insurers and business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klein, a spokesman for the Insurance Division, said the
agency is taking a ``wait-and-see approach'' to the exclusions, and
wants to hear from all sides. But he adds: ``If I were the
president of BankBoston, I would say, `Wait a second, why do I have
this coverage in the first place?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the mutual insurance holding company bill wrapped up _ a
gift from Western Massachusetts legislators to Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Co. _ Senate leaders say there is renewed interest
in getting the insurance industry's tax cut bill done. Key senators
are to meet next week with insurance executives to discuss a bill
that would provide $60 million in annual tax savings to life and
property-casualty insurers. But the industry may well have to come
up with more than the $150 million over five years the insurers
have committed to small-business development and housing.

   JULY4-BOSTON-POPS (Boston) _ The grandfather of all July 4
concerts, the Boston Pops and fireworks show on the Esplanade,

   JULY4-HISTORY (Washington) _ The hottest holiday argument this
weekend may be over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day
spent in traffic. But there were Independence Days two centuries
ago when the consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed
into bitter disputes between rival political parties. At a lecture
this week in the National Archives, historian Len Travers of the
Massachusetts Historical Society described how the day became
ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic. And in his
book, Celebrating the Fourth (University of Massachusetts Press,
1977), he recollects an era from the ratification of the
Constitution until the War of 1812 when, in some cities, there was
nothing nonpartisan about the Fourth of July. By John H. Cushman

and through a knot of pine trees, past a naked guy chewing leaves,

July 4th gathering to party and pray for peace. As many as 14,000

<P>
   INSIDE THE BUBBLE, China _ ``Leak to me, too, Barry,'' a
correspondent hollers at a White House aide who is whispering to
her colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the room looks up.
</P>
<P>
   Did they miss something?
</P>
<P>
   No, deputy press secretary Barry Toiv assures everyone. ``Just
answering a question,'' Toiv says. ``If you'd asked the same
question, we'd give you the same answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is the ``bubble'' _ known officially as the traveling
White House press filing center. This is the movable fount of
knowledge where 250 of the world's most proficient, most exhausted
journalists are forced by the iron laws of deadlines to get most of
their first-hand China impressions.
</P>
<P>
   As we sit before our laptops, it is mid-afternoon in Shanghai.
This is the delightful daily interlude when editors back home, a
half day behind us, are sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50 of the 200 chairs in the filing center are
occupied. Even so, everyone is watching out of the corner of their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If a competitor picks up a valuable tidbit from the strolling
White House assistant, who knows if it could lead to a dreaded
``callback'' from an editor?
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate traveling cocoon _ the hermetically sealed
vantage point where we and most of the others in the traveling
Clinton press entourage have been forced to remain most of the time
during Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a week, the traveling press will have
``seen'' Clinton carry off about 39 White House-planned ``public
events'' including about 19 speeches, press conferences,
round-tables and ``brief remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Day Eight of his nine-day trip to China, neither of us
had actually laid eyes on the president in person, except once
during the dramatic welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Because of filing deadlines, we had to give back to the press
office the credentials that would have allowed us to witness two of
the most important events of the trip: Clinton's joint press
conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing's Great Hall of
the People and his speech at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like other correspondents on the Clinton entourage,
we've had to file a patchwork of partial, much too America-centric
first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hard news'' that tops most of our stories has been largely
founded on the raw TV images and sound ``feeds'' that are piped
into the press room. Whatever instant perspective we add is pulled
from our memories, the databases in our laptops, what we can glean
from the ``play'' of the story on Chinese TV. Only on two of the
eight days have we been able to escape from the ``bubble'' to talk
with ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   xx It wasn't that Chinese officials followed us around, or that
the White House cooped us up against our will.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's that during presidential travels, the White House press
room is an information node of such a high-speed, high-volume
``throughput'' that is the only place where correspondents can hope
to stay up with the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents complain about ``bubble fever.'' But once a
presidential trip begins, few have time to escape from the
``bubble'' long enough develop a story that the presidential press
office hasn't put in the ``bible.'' This is the detailed,
semi-secret press schedule for traveling journalists that is marked
``not for release or publication.'' (For China, the ``bible'' came
in two parts, the first 89 pages long, the second 38 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of limits on press access _ imposed by the Chinese, or
the White House, or both _ most all the stops on the president's
daily rounds in China are so-called ``pooled events.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the 200 traveling journalists take turns getting
``pool'' credentials to witness what actually happens. Then they
turn over ``pool reports'' consisting of video footage, radio feeds
or typed-up notes to their colleagues. The White House press office
doesn't censor the content, but it is responsible for disseminating
the results.
</P>
<P>
   While the few journalists with the ``pool passes'' are
``prepositioned'' to await the president's arrival, the rest of the
press corps waits in the press room, until a photocopied ``pool
report'' is passed round the room by a low-level White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the fabled efficiency of the White House
Communications Agency, the press filing center is also the place
where White House correspondents can ``see'' or ``hear''
presidential events as they unfold, without even leaving their
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Sound ``feeds'' from each of the half-dozen presidential
appearances each day are piped into the press room instantaneously,
often accompanied by live TV images.
</P>
<P>
   About half an hour after the president finishes talking, a White
House aide will come around the filing center and deposit a neatly
typed transcript cranked out by the traveling White House steno
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way every city's traffic gets paralyzed during an
American president's visit, the press room is also about the only
place where a correspondent can soak up what's going on, write it,
and not miss deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   For a news organization accredited to cover the White House
regularly, it will probably cost about $20,000 per correspondent to
cover Clinton's China trip.
</P>
<P>
   About half of this is the pro-rata share of the $1.1 million
that the White House travel office is paying to charter from Cathay
Pacific Airlines the Boeing 777-300 stretch jet that serves as the
traveling press plane. The balance is hotel bills, the charges for
the international direct-dial phones arranged by ATT, and the cost
of the round-the-clock filing center buffet.
</P>
<P>
   We started this piece in Shanghai, when the center of the bubble
was perched for three days on the fourth floor of Shanghai's
Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   We had to put this aside to write deadline stories. By the time
we could get back to it, the bubble had decamped 800 miles south to
the ballroom of the Gui Shan Hotel in Guilin, China.
</P>
<P>
   Unless exhaustion interferes, we'll file this in an hour by our
laptop's modem in the Guilin press center, using a Chinese long
distance phone line to hitch into a dialup modem in Hong Kong,
Beijing or Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time our editors wake up and start editing this, the
bubble will have taken off once more and alighted once again. This
time, it will be the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Hong Kong, where we'll
hope to find a pool report telling us what Clinton was up to while
we were flying from Guilin to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the bubble moves, the remarkable thing is how
similarly laid out and superbly efficient is the transmission
paraphernalia. Everything has been pre-set for us by White House
and United States Information Agency advance teams before our
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In the front left corner of most every filing center, two
technicians from the White House Communications Agency (WACA) sit
behind a sound console that has been removed from a large blue
steamer trunk. It's WACA's job to transmit a sound ``feed'' of
every public word uttered by the president to those in the bubble.
</P>

   Just outside the door of every filing center is the non-stop
buffet. It is so ample, so varied, and so quick that few people
ever bother to leave the bubble to eat at real Chinese restaurants.
There are no checks to sign _ the cost will eventually get
pro-rated to the various news organizations by the White House
travel office. That, at least, is the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Guilin, the buffet features a huge side of American
roast beef, along with tofu and mushrooms, stir-fried broccoli some
remarkably good Chinese steamed dumplings. For the faint-hearted,
there is a heaping platter of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
on white bread with the crusts removed.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House well knows, correspondents have families, and
families expect trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   As we were starting this story in Shanghai yesterday, a White
House aide bustled to the front of the filing center. ``White House
press shopping tour leaving,'' the aide called out. ``Meet at the
transportation desk on this floor at 1 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the Huai Ha Zhong Lu market press tour, a chance
for journalists to escape from ``the bubble'' for a few hours
before Press Secretary Mike McCurry's afternoon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pearls, silks, fans, Chinese art,'' read the notation on the
White House signup sheet. About a dozen journalists and technicians
rose from their overworked laptops and made a bee-line for the
chartered buses.
</P>
<P>
   We skipped shopping so that we could get ready for something
really important: today's river boat cruise that the White House
press office has laid on to let correspondents experience the
mythic Li River, said to be the most beautiful spot in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will cruise the beautiful Li an a red, white and blue
river boat called The Panorama an hour or so ahead of the press
boat. If it is mythically beautiful enough for the First Traveler,
it is good enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, dear reader, this is the end of the story. Someone from
the White House staff has dropped a photocopied sheet on our desks
in the bubble.
</P>
<P>
   It says: ``NEW TIME: Press Boat Ride. Board Boat Here 1:30 P.M.
Boats Gone 1:45 p.m.'' This one we are not going to miss.

CLOAKED IN SECRECY, ADULTERY CONTINUES TO FASCINATE AND TITILLATE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertrand Russell, the wide-eyed British logician, simply
couldn't understand why people got so worked up about a little bit
of dallying, why they seemed unable to ``distinguish sexual
intercourse from marriage as a procreative partnership'' and simply
wink at the former and carry on with the latter.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the ``psychology of adultery'' for many of the sexual
woes of society, the misery, as he put it, that usually follows
what the French call liaison intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Views about sex and marriage, of course, are complicated and
often contradictory. Americans may be a moralistic and conventional
(to use Russell's judgment) but they are also tolerant. In the
context of a good economy, for instance, polls show that Americans
seem to care little about whether their president is chronically
concupiscent. And perhaps this ambivalence, in part, explains why
tens of millions of American men and women have had extramarital
affairs or know well someone who has. Still, there is limited data
and only a small amount of research dedicated specifically to
infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other human behavior, adultery is cloaked in
secrecy,'' said David Buss, a psychologist at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, generations of cultural critics, writers,
philosophers, clerics, politicians and so on have been trying to
explain adultery, and now social scientists have joined them. So
far they have assembled only a relatively small body of specific
data, and although that work is often colored by ideology, personal
experience and research samples too small to be conclusive, the
ideas that are beginning to emerge from these efforts offer a
fascinating peak at our roiling emotions, biological appetites and
libidinous itches.
</P>
<P>
   The research falls roughly under two disciplines: social
demography (who does it) and psychology (why do they take the
risk).
</P>
<P>
   One of the most reliable statistics on adultery comes from the
National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. In
1992 the center sent hundreds of interviewers to gather data on the
sexual conduct of Americans in the National Health and Social Life
Survey. In a face-to-face survey of 3,432 adults born from 1933 to
1974, researchers asked: ``Have you ever had sex with someone other
than your husband or wife while you were married?''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the married men in the United States and a sixth of
the married women reported having at least one extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Like all statistics, the data invited different interpretations.
The sociologists who conducted the study wrote in ``Sex in America:
A Definitive Survey'' that the figures show a ``picture of an
essentially monogamous America'' and that ``each individual spends
most of his or her life with only one partner.'' Although marriage
and divorce rates may seem alarming, those in serial relationships
tend to be faithful ``as long as the marriage is in intact.''
</P>
<P>
   More striking, perhaps, is this: Almost 90 percent of the men
surveyed and 94 percent of the women believed that extramarital sex
was ``always wrong'' or ``almost always wrong.'' In other words,
the overwhelming majority of Americans either practiced monogamy or
aspired to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the United States almost universally think adultery
is wrong even while they are doing it,'' said John Gagnon, a
professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Stony
Brook and one of the authors of the Chicago study.
</P>
<P>
   But the same data also suggest a different skein. The Chicago
ratios applied to today's population figures mean that some 19
million American men and 12 million American women have entwined at
least once with someone outside the marriage bed. ``That's a
helluva lot of people being unfaithful,'' said Todd Shackelford, an
assistant professor of psychology at Florida Atlantic University.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many social scientists think the Chicago
percentages are low. ``Can we really expect people to be honest
about such a critical, life-changing event?'' Shackelford asked.
And his clinical colleagues agree. ``We have to realize that if
someone is going to lie to their husband or wife, they sure as hell
are going to lie to a poll taker,'' said Frank Pittman, a
psychiatrist in Atlanta who writes widely on adultery. ``You're
asking them to expose the worst thing they ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts divide even more when they are asked why people
commit adultery. In the last two decades, some social scientists
have insisted that all human behavior is a product of millennia of
adaptation, and increasingly human sexual behavior, including
adultery, is being examined through an evolutionary lens.
</P>
<P>
   When Helen Fisher, an anthropologist, began to study adultery in
the 1980s, she found that ``there exists no culture in which
adultery is unknown, no cultural device or code that extinguishes
philandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued by the conundrum of human mating behavior _ the
preference for monogamy alongside the pervasive fact of
``extra-pair copulation'' _ Ms. Fisher, a research associate at the
Center for Human Evolutionary Studies at Rutgers University,
recently wrote a paper in which she contends that the neurochemical
circuitry of the brain accounts for a person's sex drive, sexual
attractiveness and sense of attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human animal,'' she said in an interview, ``is built to
love more than one person at a time. In other words, we are capable
of feeling long-term attachment while we feel attracted to someone
at the office or the club or on the street. We have neurocircuitry
that can lead us to adultery, and we have neurocircuitry that
allows us to say `no' to adultery.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As Buss describes this idea, across evolutionary history men and
women ``have evolved short-term and long-term mating strategies.''
Each strategy has benefits for the species. Long-term mating, or
monogamy, as it might be called, aids ``pair-bond maintenance,'' or
in acquiring the basic necessities of life, and child-rearing. The
short-term mating strategy is adultery.
</P>
<P>
   In men, says Buss, this is the evolutionary impulse or need to
reproduce, to mate with as many different women as possible to make
sure the blood-line, and thus the species, survives. In women,
however, the evolutionary urge is harder to explain, given the
risks: the loss of a mate-provider and all the resources that go
with him. ``The big mystery,'' as he puts it, at least in
evolutionary terms, is, ``what do women get out of it?''
</P>
<P>
   And here he has developed several theories, among them:
</P>
<P>
   _The resources hypothesis. A lover may supply extra food or
better protection than a woman's long-term mate.
</P>
<P>
   _The genetic diversity hypothesis. Here, said Buss, ``a woman
can produce genetically variable offspring if she has them with
genetically different males'' or, in Buss' words, ``it's like
hedging your bets in the stock market by diversifying your
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   _The mate-switching hypothesis. Women ``might use affairs if
they have a mate who has fallen down, not providing resources or
hurting the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss' colleague, Shackelford, says that ``when the benefits are
much higher than the costs, both men and women are wonderfully good
at committing adultery.'' He quickly added with some heat: ``Now,
that doesn't make it all right. I'm married and don't want my wife
to be adulterous. I don't care if there are evolved mechanisms or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shackelford and Buss caution that a lot of their work is
theoretical and speculative. And some prominent scholars have
questioned the whole premise of evolutionary psychology, dismissing
much of the work as hypotheses without a shred of proof. Among
those who study human sexuality, particularly clinicians and
therapists, the notion that infidelity has somehow evolved as
adaptive behavior holds little weight.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Jacobson, a professor of psychotherapy research and
director of the Center for Clinical Research at the University of
Washington, is designing a major study to answer one of the
fundamental questions among clinicians. ``We want to know to what
extent affairs are being caused by existing marital problems or to
what extent the affair caused marital problems that did not
exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sociologists who conducted the University of Chicago sex
survey feel they have answered this question. Edward Laumann, the
George Herbert Mead Distinguished Service Professor in the
department of sociology, said the data he and his colleagues
collected in 1992 clearly showed that people get into adultery when
the marriage is troubled.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson is not so sure. ``We don't want to let the lore
from the culture or the clinical lore lead us into thinking we know
the answer,'' he said. So he wants to know: Did marital trouble
lead to the affair or did the affair cause the trouble? Do men and
women react differently to the news? What makes an adulterer? (The
popular wisdom is that women dally for love or emotional
satisfaction and men for sex or pure pleasure.)
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Frank Pittman, a psychiatrist who has written often
on the subject in books and magazines, estimates that he has
treated some 5,000 couples in the last 38 years. Lately he has
noticed ``women seem to be having more affairs than they did 20
years ago, 10 years ago,'' in part because as they travel more for
work, they have more opportunities for affairs far from home, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also started to see a few female philanderers,'' he
added, ``married women who have causal affairs in what used to be
the old male pattern of find 'em, bed them, forget them, the kind
of sport men used to brag about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of
Washington, is trying to test the notion that the baby-boom
generation, the cohort that began ``the sexual revolution,'' came
into adulthood with different cultural and moral values from their
parents. Using data from other studies and some 300 interviews she
plans to conduct, she hopes to chart the details of baby-boom love,
sex and marriage, including extramarital amourettes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she and the others discover, the subject of adultery
will probably hold the species' collective curiosity for a very
long time. Ever since Homer set Odysseus wandering and surrounded
the faithful Penelope with suitors, adultery has been a major theme
in Western culture. ``It has fascinated people,'' said Professor
Schwartz, ``because anyone who lives a hidden life is fascinating.
We're shocked and fascinated when we find out what is really going
on: that lovely couple down the street is having an affair with
that other lovely couple down the street.''

inches of rain on the state? What is the forecast for the next
week? If there's any hope of rain, when will it come and why then
and not now? (Mossman, Palm Beach Post)

   JULY4-HISTORY (Washington) _ The hottest holiday argument this
weekend may be over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day
spent in traffic. But there were Independence Days two centuries
ago when the consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed
into bitter disputes between rival political parties. At a lecture
this week in the National Archives, historian Len Travers of the
Massachusetts Historical Society described how the day became
ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic. And in his
book, Celebrating the Fourth (University of Massachusetts Press,

   (``Laughter is the best medicine'' -- Norman Cousins)
</P>
<P>
   (Sir John Templeton, the Tennessee-born billionaire and founder
of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

</P>
<P>
   When the United States entered World War II in 1941, patriotism
was at a high point, and young men by the thousands rushed to
recruiting places, eager to serve their country.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stars of Hollywood were no exception, although some who
applied were not accepted. Comedian Bob Hope was not accepted as a
recruit. The country's leaders felt he could serve a better purpose
entertaining the troops.
</P>
<P>
   He protested vigorously that he didn't want to receive any
preferential treatment, but the government stood firm. They could
not possibly have known at the time what a wise decision they made.
</P>
<P>
   Hope and his group of entertainers logged millions of miles and
gave thousands of performances for the troops in Europe and the Far
East. These men and women risked their lives many times by
performing in combat zones. They visited the hospitals where the
wounded were treated and brought a lot of joy to many people.
</P>
<P>
   Always the positive entertainer, Hope didn't dole out sympathy
or pity. He would ask a wounded serviceman questions such as, ``Did
you see our show, or were you already sick?''
</P>
<P>
   The therapeutic value of laughter was never questioned by those
who received his visits.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter can be a doorway from misery to joy. When a person
laughs, many good things happen. Muscles relax, the breathing is
deeper, the bloodstream is more fully oxygenated. Pain and gloom
are forgotten, or at least put into proper perspective. It's
difficult for a person who is shaking with laughter to think
negative thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Often the most serious of matters can best be solved by giving
the situation ``the light touch.'' In Volume 3 of ``The Life and
Teachings of the Masters of the Far East,'' Baird Spaulding
described his meeting with the ``laughing disciple.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a group of pilgrims through extremely treacherous
territory in the Himalayan mountains, the author tells how the
laughing disciple assisted the group in their journey: ``In all, it
was an arduous climb, but at the rough places, the chela (disciple)
went ahead with laughter and song. At the more difficult places,
his voice would ring out and it seemed as if it lifted us over them
without an effort. ... We thought the trail on its flanks stony and
perilous but now we labored over a trail much of the distance on
hands and knees. Still, the song and laughter of the chela bore us
onward as though on wings. ... Can you, dear reader, not see why
the trail that day was not long and arduous? It all passed in an
instant. The vibrations of strength, power, and harmony that are
always sent forth from the temples but serve to urge the travelers
onward to these peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   We are also travelers over the mountain pathways of life. How
tremendously valuable is the power of joy and laughter to enliven
our soul as we go forward to meet our goals. Laughter can lift us
over the high ridges and lighten up the dark valleys in a way that
makes life much easier.
</P>
<P>
   A happy heart generates a forcefield of love and joy in which
doubt, fear, disaster, and dismay have no power to interrupt the
universal flow of good. And in some instances, laughter has been
considered to be a high form of prayer! Truly, when you are in the
consciousness of the joy of the spirit, you are praying from the
very heart of your being.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting story is told about how laughter can be so
uplifting in a tense situation. In September 1862, President
Abraham Lincoln called a special session of his closest advisers.
When they arrived, he was reading a book. At first he paid little
attention to their entrance, then started to read aloud to them a
piece by the humorist Artemus Ward entitled ``A High-Handed Outrage
at Utica,'' which Lincoln found very funny and laughed heartily at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   But no one joined in. The Cabinet members sat in stony
disapproval of the president's seeming frivolity. Lincoln rebuked
them, ``Why don't you laugh? With the fearful strain that is upon
me night and day, if I did not laugh I should die, and you need
this medicine as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then turning to business, he told them that he had privately
prepared ``a little paper of much significance.'' It was the draft
of the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who bring laughter also seem to be beneficiaries. Although
we can't all be professional comedians, opportunities may be
available to share our laughter and good humor with everyone we
meet. We can visit hospitals, convalescent centers and homes for
the aged and give of the joy of our spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live in these homes are often terribly lonely.
They may feel forgotten by the ones they love, and visitors are
welcome, especially those who bring moments of healing laughter.
</P>
<P>
   For those who may feel unsure of themselves as natural wits or
stand-up comedians, books and videos and audio tapes are available
which can be shared. The sharing is the important part. It can
brighten a lonely person's life; it can improve your relations with
those close to you.
</P>
<P>
   The reward for bringing laughter is extremely high and it is
better than any spring tonic for yourself. Laughter is the best
medicine!

<P>
   GLENARDEN, Md. -- The last verse of the Old Testament envisions
a day when the Lord ``will turn the hearts of fathers to their
children and the hearts of children to their fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that yardstick, America's fathers are far off course. Four
of ten children -- 28 million out of 70 million kids -- do not live
in homes with their biological fathers. Never in history has there
been such an abandonment of children by their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Those kids are six times as likely as those from intact homes to
be in poverty or commit suicide and 2-3 times as likely to drop out
of school, become pregnant or delinquent as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Another 25 to 50 percent of fathers are emotionally absent from
their children. ``The average dad spends 37 seconds with a child a
day. Kids spend six hours a day watching TV. Where are they getting
their values?'' Deacon Lawrence Lee asked a gathering of 119
African-American dads gathered for a ``Great Dads'' seminar the day
before Father's Day at First Baptist Church of Glenarden, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Great Dads is a new national group holding seminars across the
country to teach an ``Action Plan for Being a Great Dad.'' It was
founded by Robert Hamrin, 51, an economist who quit a presidential
campaign in 1983 to work as a consultant so he could spend more
time with his kids, a son who is now 21, and twin daughters, now
aged 17.
</P>
<P>
   Hamrin is the author of ``Straight From a Dad's Heart,'' an
inspiring book that can be ordered for $13 from Great Dads, PO Box
7537, Fairfax Station, VA 22039.
</P>
<P>
   His seminar teaches ``The Six Basics of Being a Great Dad'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Provide Unconditional Love and Affection: Thousands of teens
were asked what single question they would like their parents to
answer. Fifty percent said, ``Do you love me?'' One way to show
that love is to see the uniqueness of each child, and to read them
such Scriptures as Psalm 139: ``I am fearfully and wonderfully
made.'' Hamrin also tells his kids each evening as they go to bed,
``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key step is to build up each child. For every criticism,
dads ought to give ten compliments -- the opposite of what most
dads do.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spend T-I-M-E. Men pour themselves into their careers, not
kids. Richard Halverson, former U.S. Senate Chaplain, confessed he
should have spent more time with his kids when they were young. His
5-year-old girl once asked, ``Daddy, how come you are hardly ever
home with us?'' Hamrin heard that question when his son was 2, and
he determined never to have that regret.
</P>
<P>
   Love is spelled T-I-M-E. Block out time, say two to four hours
on a weekend, or keep a list of mini-adventures, one or two-day
excursions: to an historical site, a national park or trail, a zoo.
Spend one-on-one time with each child. Take a daughter out on a
``date'' such as a restaurant meal just with her. Or ask your
child, ``How would you like to spend 90 minutes together today?''
</P>
<P>
   3. Communicate Constantly and Creatively: Teens do want to talk
to parents, but when asked who they turn to for help when in
stress, dads ranked 48th on the list. ``If you listen when they are
little, they'll be talking when the subjects are important,'' says
Hamrin. ``If you don't listen now, you may never know when the
truly important things aren't being shared with you.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Partner with Mom: The most important gift parents can give
children is a healthy and vibrant marriage. Tell your kids that
divorce will never be considered. Dads should let moms choose what
is to be done together on a weekly evening out. Parents should
present a united front to children on all matters.
</P>
<P>
   5. Instill Basic Moral and Spiritual Values. ``Write down three
things you are willing to do to contribute to your child's
spiritual development,'' said Deacon Lee. ``It is important for
your child to know that you had to make a journey of faith what God
brought you through.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Establish My Fathering Legacy. ``If you want greatness in
life, do not look for fame, fortune or promotions, but spend a lot
of time with your children, who will live after us,'' says Hamrin.
``Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who finds delight in his
commands. His children will be great in the land.'' (Psalm 112:1-2)
</P>
<P>
   I was so moved by the day that on Father's Day I penned a
two-page letter to each of my three grown sons, asking forgiveness
for my own failures as a dad, praising them for their achievements
that make me proud, and to underscore how much I love them.

   (When last we left the intrepid columnist, he was asleep in a
diesel truck somewhere near Rochester, N.Y., with almost 2,000
miles remaining to his destination and three days to get there.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Day Three begins at 5:05 a.m. with a check of the load _ the
steamer is still secure _ a check of oil and engine coolant, and a
spot of what passes for breakfast under the arches. I have spare
oil and coolant in one of the storage bins behind the seat _ this
is not an extended cab, but there is plenty of storage space
nonetheless, with shelves and a net to secure stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The road west to Buffalo is lightly traveled, but traffic picks
up as I head southwest toward a corner of Pennsylvania and into
Ohio. Ohio, without doubt, has the best rest stops of any state
along its highways _ clean, nicely landscaped, offering picnic
areas, facilities for pets, weather info, and maps. I pull into one
for lunch _ peanut butter on oatmeal bread and my private-recipe
lemonade (add limes for extra zest).
</P>
<P>
   The wind is still brisk, and every time a semi passes, it sets
up a venturi effect between us that pulls the Ram toward it. I turn
off I-90 and head southwest across Ohio via I-71 to I-70. At
Montville, Ohio, I pull off for fuel, enter a Sunoco station, cut
too close to an overhead sign. I back, take the corner wider _ a
bystander signals that I am clear. I am not, and nudge the overhead
sign, one of four, and it slips its moorings. I back away from it
and it slides along the forward edge of the brand new trailer.
Damn!
</P>
<P>
   A couple of bystanders help me take the dangling sign down _ it
is held by a single bolt, thumb tight! _ lest it fall on someone.
In the process, the sign gets bent, the only damage to it. The
woman tending the counter is very sympathetic, very upset. She must
have an accident report; she will call the maintenance man to
assess things. I figure I'll slip the maintenance guy a few quid
for his trouble and be off.
</P>
<P>
   But maintenance guy doesn't show; a police officer does, who has
still more paperwork. From the sound of things, he is, if not the
sole proprietor, at least part of the ownership. ``Don't worry,''
he says, ``this is why we have insurance.'' Indeed, we have
Chrysler's insurance, the museum's insurance, and my insurance _
this could be a paperwork nightmare over a dented sign and a
scratched trailer. Refueled and properly recorded, I hit the road
again. Now it is raining.
</P>
<P>
   Construction looms everywhere. I-70 is a nice road where it
exists. I exit Ohio under the welcoming arch, enter Indiana. I-70
through Indianapolis is a maze. Public Radio keeps me company, but
changing stations as I move in and out of range is exasperating _
the guy who designed the radio (it had to be a man; no woman would
do this) forgot that somebody might have to use it in a moving
vehicle. Rockers and tiny buttons far removed from the driver are a
nuisance. Fortunately, the heater/AC controls were designed by
somebody else _ keeping comfortable in the Ram is a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   More fuel, another peanut butter break as we roll on into
Illinois. I shift to a northerly route to bypass St. Louis and
forgo the grand arch to save time and distance _ the Mississippi is
impressive. The Cummins diesel is singing to me; my eyes are
getting heavy as I cross into the hilly eastern end of Kansas _ nap
time.
</P>
<P>
   Once past the border hills, Kansas is a vast flat expanse broken
only by silos and oil derricks _ yes, they pump oil in Kansas. The
state has wheat and, as the signs proclaim for hundreds of miles in
advance of the place, it is _ in Russell, to be precise _ the home
of Bob Dole. Somewhere west of Teutopolis, Kan., I pull into a
motel with the trip odometer showing 1,333.4 miles traveled. I will
treat myself to a cold manhattan, a Kansas steak, and a good
night's sleep. Oh, yeah?
</P>
<P>
   The sign says beer and wine only, but the waitress announces
``there's none of that, either.'' Nor is there steak. I settle for
iced tea and roast beef _ it is an end cut the size of a small dog,
dry as a chip. Revelers in the night make me long for the peace of
the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling across Kansas next morning, I come upon the beaver. It
is dead on the side of the highway, the nearest tree more than half
a mile behind it, the nearest water a quarter mile ahead of it. I
figure it died of the commute. My God, Kansas goes on forever!
</P>
<P>
   Lunch sees the end of the lemonade, and the truck drones on
through the flat countryside _ uphill. I can find no telephones,
few places of habitation. At 1,994.6 miles, I pull into a rest area
for a long snooze. Another day done.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m., it's back on the road and into Colorado; eastern
Colorado is more of Kansas, high plains but with cows and suicidal
tumbleweeds. At 7:33 a.m., I pull into Seibert, Colo., which is
mainly a truck stop, park next to a semi, wave to the driver, and
enter a restaurant seeking breakfast. Some locals are having
coffee, two people are in a booth eating. I make eye contact with
the serving person and sit down. Nothing happens. More serving
persons appear, but do not serve _ nor speak to me. The locals are
eyeing me now, so I assume I have not become invisible. After 20
minutes, I walk out _ the serving persons watch me leave.
</P>
<P>
   It occurs to me that the truck driver parked outside is a black
man. Is this their problem? Did they refuse to serve him? Do they
think I'm with him? Does this stuff go on in Colorado? I decide to
ask him _ too late; his truck is showing tail lights as I exit.
</P>
<P>
   I refuel down the road from Seibert, breakfast on a peanut
butter sandwich. Roll on!
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the front range of the Rockies looms out of the mist
shrouding Denver, and I know I'm close. At Denver, I turn north on
38, heading for Estes Park; it is steep going now, but the Ram is
pulling _ gaining _ in overdrive. This truck is a pullin' fool.
</P>
<P>
   It is 11:45 a.m. Sunday, 2,331.4 miles distant and 7,500 feet
high as I park near the Stanley Hotel with the other carriers of
steam cars. For the next week, I will be ``treated'' to sun, snow,
rain, wind, and hail in an open steamer _ I elect to do the Trail
Ridge crossing over the Continental Divide (at 12,000-plus feet) in
an enclosed sedan.
</P>
<P>
   I plot the trip back on a more northerly route via I-80, and it
will prove uneventful _ I will be behind the raging thunderstorms
in Nebraska, ahead of the flooding in Iowa, and will beat the
Indiana train wreck by a whisker, battered only by the
kidney-killer washboard of concrete I-80 from Nebraska to Indiana.
But at a Denny's on I-90, I will again become invisible to servers,
this time in my quest for a cup of tea. Not at a table nor at the
counter will I prevail for service. I leave sans tea.
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, N.H., at the traffic circle, I will stop once
more for breakfast, my last attempt on the trip, and be overwhelmed
by the rapidity _ and the friendliness _ of the service. Tell me
again about cold New Englanders!
</P>
<P>
   The round trip encompasses 4,562.7 miles, consumes 379.797
gallons of 40 octane diesel fuel. The Ram, over 4,328.7 miles
measured, averages 11.974 miles per gallon pulling some 5,000-plus
pounds. In the course of it, I have increased my respect for
over-the-road truckers and Dodge trucks cum Cummins diesels. I have
seen a lot of America _ and I'm damn glad to be home.

COLORING THE SHADE WITH UNFAMILIAR FLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 5)  
 (JT)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many shade gardens demonstrate the popular misconception that if
you don't have hostas or impatiens, you can't have color after
trees leaf out. And yet, if you look closely when you walk through
native woodlands, you are bound to see colorful splashes of
flowers, foliage and berries scattered throughout the forest
greenery from summer well into fall.
</P>
<P>
   These native plants flourish without any fertilizers, pesticides
or pruning. I like that. So much so that I now decorate my shaded
beds and borders in central New Jersey with an abundance of natural
shade color. From Memorial Day to Thanksgiving, there is a
changing, attractive garden display that requires very little
maintenance, primarily watering during dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, however, many of these plants are unfamiliar to
gardeners. This is a shame, for they are widely adaptable and
provide color and interest over a long period of time. If you would
like more variety with less work in your shade garden, consider the
addition of one or more of the following.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUMPET HONEYSUCKLE &LR;  (Lonicera sempervirens) is a constant
throughout the growing season. After a lush spring bloom, its red
flowers open sporadically until struck by frost. Reaching 12 to 15
feet in shade, this vine is happy to clamber up a trellis fence or
scramble over a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I mention the word ``honeysuckle'' to visitors,
however, they gasp. Who would ever want such an invasive plant?
Well, I wouldn't and this isn't. Unlike the white-flowered Japanese
species, American honeysuckle is a very well-behaved presence in
the garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an old-fashioned one: George Washington grew it at
Mount Vernon. In full sun, it attracts scores of aphids, but they
do not like the coolness of shade. You should find that the less
direct the sun, the fewer the aphids on this handsome vine.
</P>
<P>
   The most regal plant in my garden is Snow Queen. It is a
six-foot-tall  &UR; OAKLEAF HYDRANGEA &LR;  (H. quercifolia) cultivar,
descended from a seedling spotted about 25 years ago by the
plantsman William Flemer 3d in Kingston, N.J. I use Snow Queen as a
focal point in a back corner area. In late June, gleaming white
flower cones shine among its large, oaklike leaves. By August, the
cones have aged to a light pink. In September, they turn a light
chestnut brown just as the foliage metamorphoses into a dark wine
red.
</P>
<P>
   Because my plant anchors a right angle created by fences, it is
protected from wind, and both the colorful leaves and the dried
flower heads hold on through much of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Montrose Ruby, a &UR; PURPLE HEUCHERA &LR;  hybrid with maroonish-purple
leaves mottled with silver, is another serendipitous plant. It was
discovered about 10 years ago by Nancy Goodwin on the grounds of
her former nursery in North Carolina. She believes it is a
spontaneous cross between flats of Heuchera americana Dale's Strain
and Heuchera Palace Purple.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many other purple heuchera hybrids have been
created, often with Montrose Ruby as a parent. All bear tiny summer
flowers on one- to two-foot-tall wiry stalks. While some are quite
beautiful for two or three years, they are short-lived in my
gardens. None in my experience have matched the longevity and ease
of care of Montrose Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   This plant is handsome from spring through fall and blends with
many different whites. In one of my beds, Montrose Ruby is at the
foot of the ivory-splashed leaves of  &UR; VIRGINIA TOVARA &LR;  (T.
virginiana Variegata). Thriving in sun or shade, the foliage on
this perennial emerges in late spring and forms two- to
three-foot-tall mounds that soften dark areas. In September, wiry
wands, flecked with tiny scarlet petals, appear.
</P>
<P>
   In another bed, the rich foliage of Montrose Ruby provides a
stunning complement to two perennials that bear bright white
flowers during the heat and humidity of August. These are  &UR; BIG
LOBELIA &LR;  (L. siphilitica Alba), which send up sturdy two- to
three-foot spikes that appear as restrained forms of foxgloves, and
 &UR; NODDING ONION &LR;  (Allium cernuum minor alba), a more diminutive
plant, reaching slightly more than a foot. When in bud, a clump of
nodding onion resembles a cluster of swans, with their long slim
necks and arching heads. The buds then open to umbrella sprays of
dainty flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WREATH GOLDENROD &LR;  (Solidago caesia) provides a final, colorful
touch to my shade garden's year. From mid-September well into
October, it produces upright two- to three-foot-tall golden wands
that form dancing slashes as they weave back and forth in autumn
breezes. Also known as blue-stemmed goldenrod, this little-known,
noninvasive perennial has purplish-blue stems that add subtle color
accent in summer.
</P>
<P>
   With all this natural color _ and the plants described here are
but a small sample _ you too may find that there is little room for
either hostas or impatiens in your shade borders.

CHURCH OF THE SUBGENIUS: EYES TO THE SKY AND TONGUES IN CHEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA YUEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorry folks, but the real fireworks start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the calendar of the Church of the SubGenius, Sunday's the day
when the world will end at 7 a.m. for all beings on Earth, except
for those who've paid their $30 to join the church. The saved, they
say, will be beamed up to sensual bliss by the space vessels of the
sex goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, probably not, the 10,000-member church acknowledges.
But at the very least, a highly orchestrated apocalypse will give
these pranksters a perfect excuse to party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's completely ridiculous that alien sex goddesses
are going to pick us up at 7 a.m. on July 5,'' said church's
business manager Steve ``Jesus Christ'' Bevilacqua from his Dallas
office. ``But it's also ridiculous that a person can walk on water,
and millions of people believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   SubGeniuses nationwide pouredinto Sherman, N.Y., last week for
an end-of-the-world orgy. On a clothing-optional campground,
followers of this Dallas-based church have already indulged in
blood wrestling (instead of mud wrestling), mass marriages (one
couple, hundreds of ministers), poorly played music, and lots of
sex (in preparation for the extraterrestrial nymphs). But come 7
a.m. &UR;  &LR; Sunday, eyes will turn upward for the fire in the sky. All
aboard for the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will either be sex and bowling and real good meals and
massages _ like on a cruise ship,'' Cambridge resident Dr. Y Foo
said of the flying-saucer paradise, ``or there will be personal
servants who will let you have whatever you want, like if you want
to be surrounded by 20 Cindy Crawfords. Or we'll be put in cement
cages, and we'll be chopped up to make us taste better as people
burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Bostonians and area college students, particularly
MIT techies, have denounced normalcy and invested blind faith in
Bob. He's the 1950s-esque clip-art icon of the well-groomed,
waxy-smiled man with a pipe. For $30, anyone can register to become
a card-carrying minister. Triple your money back, the church
promises, if you die and realize you haven't been eternally saved.
</P>
<P>
   In simplest terms, the church uses parody and humor to spread
the messages of carpe diem and free thinking. Any new members who
have taken Bob too literally are ``deprogrammed'' by church
veterans, who suggest they reread the books as satire. With
no-nonsense fervor, however, the church urges individuals to find
``slack,'' the freedom to pursue happiness and escape conformity.
Believers vow death to the Conspiracy _ the government, the Man,
the job, Starbucks Coffee, or anything else that infringes on one's
Bob-given right to slack.
</P>
<P>
   Parody or not, some members go to great lengths in service to
church. The Irreverend Friday Jones of Waltham, for instance, quit
her job at a video store in the name of Bob. A week before she left
for New York, Jones was sauntering around Central Square with an
uncanny glaze on her face. Storm clouds had cleared. The sun was
beaming and so was Jones, with a tranquil smile and faraway gaze.
``You just think, `This might be the last time I walk down this
street on a nice, sunny day,'' said Jones, who, like Foo, declined
to give her real name.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years of the church's twisted prophetical ramblings
will climax Sunday. July 5, 1998 was named doomsday 18 years ago,
when Bob dictated his message to ``sacred scribe'' and cofounder
Doug Smith, a.k.a. Rev. Ivan Stang of Garland, Texas. Stang has
since compiled Bob's message into books, pamphlets, and a Web page
at www.subgenius.com. ``Just like in other religions, it's not so
much that we love Bob; it's the idea of everyone else going to
hell,'' Stang said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Bob the world's greatest salesman, SubGeniuses have
eagerly bought into his spiel. More than 200 believers packed the
April ``devival'' party at the Middle East in Cambridge. Loads more
have recently jumped on the bandwagon because of the hovering
now-or-never deadline, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But the church's final countdown has alarmed some outsiders.
Kurt Kuerstiner of Tallahassee, has designed a Web site titled
``Please Help Expose Bob!'' and has sent literature to schools and
police departments, warning them of the cult's Armageddon. He fears
a troubled loner may take the joke too far. ``The deadline is
coming up, and I'm afraid someone's going to be dead on that
deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That SubGenius books are found in the humor section of Barnes &AMP;
Noble disguises the church's sinister hatred for the ``normals,''
Kuerstiner said. ``The church claims to be a parody,'' he said.
``That's why someone is afraid to come out against this thing; it
looks like he doesn't get the joke. It's the ultimate camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
   Church members insist they are not the next Heaven's Gate.
Rather than staging mass suicides, they would rather board the
spaceships alive. Explained Bevilacqua: ``The sex goddesses aren't
going to be that much fun without our bodies.''

IN BLACK, AND NO PLACE TO HIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 5)  
 (JT)  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a female disaster of the first order, up there
with meeting someone really cute and realizing you have lipstick on
your front teeth. Invited to the Museum of Modern Art's ``Party in
the Garden,'' one of the last blowouts on the spring black-tie
calendar, I decided to try my gown on ahead of time to check the
fit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very clingy number from three seasons past. But the
dress, once fashionably sexy, seemed badly out of date. Unlike this
year's sheaths that discretely skim the body, my hip-hugging,
low-cut design left nothing to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In a panic, and with only nine hours to go before the party, I
raced to Bergdorf Goodman, arriving just as the store opened at 10
a.m. I bolted to the escalator and landed at the Chanel boutique, a
safe haven for the fashionable in desperate straits.
</P>
<P>
   And as if the deity of good taste was smiling on me, the perfect
little black dress appeared before my eyes. It was a variation on
Audrey Hepburn's gown in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' made of wool
crepe with slender straps and a trumpet-flared skirt. It not only
fit to a T, but was also on sale.
</P>
<P>
   I sashayed into the museum that night with utter confidence, a
green cashmere sweater over my shoulders for an added touch of
oh-so-trendy nonchalance. But as the air kisses started to fly, my
self-assurance suddenly cracked. All around were radiant young
women in sugary-colored, diaphanous confections, the antitheses of
my little black look. You could practically hear the ``oohs'' and
``ahs'' around the 20-something sisters Jane Lauder and Aerin
Lauder Zinterhofer, both in Oscar de la Renta chiffon creations.
Aerin was a portrait in lemon yellow; Jane, in yellow and hot pink.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like a black hole in a galaxy of bright young sparklers.
The little black dress, I realized, might be suffering the same
fate of many great stars, collapsing under the weight of its own
history. Nearly 75 years after it was first introduced by Coco
Chanel _ a style that Vogue predicted would become the Ford of
fashion _ the little black dress is nothing more than a basic Ford
Taurus. Even though my dress was Chanel, without a color or even a
camellia to set it apart, it might as well have been from the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black dress is gone,'' Samantha Boardman, a medical
student who wore a knockout lavender Versace dress that night, told
me a few days later. ``You do get buried in black. You can
disappear in it. You are anonymous in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Walch, director of the Color Association of the United
States, which tracks color trends, put it succinctly: ``Black is
like Perrier, which did itself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the color issue has flip-flopped since the last time I
dressed up. Hothouse tones used to be a sure sign that either a
tourist or an aging socialite was on the loose. But these days,
festive evening finery is neither provincial nor passe. Like their
mothers before them, a younger generation of trend-setting social
women are now decked out in rainbow hues, infusing color with new
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For evening clothes, there has been a change,'' said Brooke de
Ocampo, 31, an associate at Sotheby's and a chairwoman of the New
York Botanical Garden's junior fund-raising committee. ``For day,
there's still a black T-shirt and khaki clam diggers. But when I
think of the last five black-tie events I've been to, I can't think
of any black dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, I don't get out enough.
</P>
<P>
   But I do read fashion magazines, and it is true that there
hasn't been a black evening gown on the cover of Vogue, W or
Harper's Bazaar in at least six months. At Bergdorf, I later
discovered, there was a full selection of black Versace and Armani
gowns on sale, but the colorful Oscar de la Renta racks had been
picked clean.
</P>
<P>
   Like the appearance of Christian Lacroix's pouf dress of 1987,
the last high point of conspicuous consumption before the current
pecuniary frenzy, this season's fashion extravaganzas seem an
expression of the bubbly economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rebirth of parties and festivities, our generation is
enjoying the glamour of dressing up,'' Ms. de Ocampo said. ``Black
does wonders for everybody, but it doesn't require much thought.
You tend to put on a color, it shows more imagination and
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness. Now my black dress was not only out of style, but also
a sign that I lacked guts. And all along I had thought that black
was a statement of female strength. It is no coincidence that the
black dress first emerged in the 1920s after the suffragist
movement won women the vote. Again in the '80s, as women ascended
the corporate ladder, black dresses were on the rise, their
popularity soaring in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 10 to 12 years, you've had the `Armani'
phenomenon, not that he isn't a wonderful designer,'' de la Renta,
the longtime standard-bearer of color, told me. ``When a
professional woman wanted to dress, she wanted to be taken
seriously, which meant not being noticed. Black is the least
memorable color. Women have outgrown all that. There is a whole new
generation of girls dressing in a pretty manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, director of creative product
development for Estee Lauder, called the recent explosion of color
a reaction against years of androgyny. ``People are maxed out on
minimalism,'' she said. ``They are looking for something feminine.
Floral fragrances and fabrics are popular. Pink chiffon, pink
lipstick, high heels and long hair are back.''
</P>
<P>
   As color returns, the daughters of the ladies who lunch have
rediscovered their mothers' favorite designers _ namely, de la
Renta, Bill Blass and Carolina Herrara, longtime devotees of a
luscious palette and feminine styles. ``For nighttime, Oscar and
Bill have very sleek and sexy things for me, as well as things that
would appeal to my mom,'' Ms. de Ocampo said. ``They'll do
something in a silk jersey, which is a sort of semi-retro Halston
look that has a certain moderness appealing to our age.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, de la Renta, Blass and Ms. Herrara are taking a cue
from their younger customers, particularly those who are family
members. ``My sister, Carolina Jr., is my mother's muse,'' said
Patricia Herrara, 24, a daughter of Carolina Herrara. ``Her designs
haven't exactly changed, but the fabrics are more fluid and there's
no more hard construction, which gives them a younger look.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta acknowledged the influence of his 29-year-old
stepdaughter, Eliza Reed. ``Eliza is very feminine, and she
influences my eye,'' he said. ``She has so many young friends, and
they all wear my clothes. I have these young customers, and I am
thinking of them. They're a whole new consumer and a very important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced of the rightness of pink, nint
green and baby blue after dark. ``All these women who are wearing
these sherbety colors, they're going to splash something like
summer strawberries on their light-colored dresses or look in the
mirror and say, `Oh my God, I look so fat,''' Amy Edelman, author
of ``The Little Black Dress,'' said. ``Color is a blip in fashion
history. There's been `death to black' before, but the black dress
will never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am glad to hear it. Because even though my Chanel
dress was 40 percent off, it cost plenty. I can justify the price
as an investment in a classic. But the best way to get my money's
worth, I figure, is to wear it to death.

THE NAVAJO CONTRIBUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. -- Formed by time and the wind, the majestic
50-foot stone circle for which this town is named overshadows
workers finishing a World War II monument. The memorial is also
circular, an eternal flame surrounded by a low sandstone wall and
flags of the US, the military services, and the Navajo Nation. The
names, now listed on cardboard, await enscription in stone.
</P>
<P>
   They were heroes long ago and the memorial has been slow
abuilding, but Navajos share two notable traits of that remarkable
World War II generation: a reluctance to boast and a refusal to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   No single group was more essential to victory than the ``code
talkers,'' Army and Marine Navajos who communicated in their own
language, baffling Japanese eavesdroppers in the Pacific. On
Guadalcanal, Guam, Saipan, Tarawa, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa,
code-breakers could not decipher this guttural language with a
complicated syntax and no known alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the enemy had known the language was Navajo, an inner
code disguised military movements. A tank was a turtle, a submarine
an iron fish, a hummingbird a fighter plane, a buzzard a bomber,
and bombs were eggs. Code-breakers could have thought the
conversation was about breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic ranks are dwindling. Narciso Platero Abeyta died in
Albuquerque June 22. After the war, he took up art and his
watercolors are displayed in museums in the Southwest and at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington. Another code talker, Carl
Nelson Gorman, who also became a renowned artist and taught art at
colleges, died in February. His son, R.C. Gorman, is a an artist in
Taos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo art, famed in rugs and pottery, is based on a
centuries-old love of nature so mystically powerful that it has
helped Navajos resist assimilation. Carl Gorman was born on the
reservation and was punished at a mission school when he spoke his
native language instead of English. His studio was in nearby Fort
Defiance, the headquarters of Kit Carson's expedition against the
Navajos in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   The famed Army scout starved out 8,000 Navajos in Canyon de
Muerto, then herded them 300 miles to a reservation at Fort Sumner
in New Mexico. The ``long walk'' has remained vivid in the Navajo
tribal memory. Yet in World War II, when the Marine Corps set up a
recruiting station in Window Rock, capital of the Navajo Nation,
the response was enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Pendleton in California, all-Navajo platoons trained,
then shipped out with their rifles and radios to the Pacific island
assaults. ``I thought I was going to die,'' Gorman said. He later
learned that ``Marines never die. They just go to hell and
regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Government policy kept the saga of the code-talkers secret until
1969, when they were finally recognized. In 1990, Kenji Kawano, the
son of a Japanese soldier, published ``Warriors,'' a photo essay on
the code talkers. David E. Patterson, a Marine code talker, told
Kawano, ``When I was inducted into the service, one of the
commitments I made was that I was willing to die for my country _
the US, the Navajo Nation, and my family. My language was my
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Navajos still resist assimilation but prosperity complicates the
effort. Petty scandals plague the tribal council, which now has a
symbol of the curse of modernity, a special prosecutor. At tribal
headquarters here, parking spaces are reserved for various
officials, an unhealthy sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Rez,'' as the reservation is called, covers 15 million
acres, the size of West Virginia. Policing it is hard work and Tony
Hillerman, the novelist whose mysteries make heroes of Navajo
Tribal Police, dedicates his latest book, ``The First Eagle,'' to
six tribal policemen killed in the line of duty. Hillerman helps
explain the respect for mystery in Navajo life. Bravery is part of
that mystery. The code talkers were true first eagles. Their
bravery helped preserve America's freedom.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On karaoke night recently at the Lansky Lounge on the
Lower East Side, a strange thing happened. A young woman in a
halter top who calls herself Princess was on stage finishing a
heartfelt performance of David Lee Roth's take on ``Just a
Gigolo,'' when out of the crowd, as if from a dream, emerged Roth,
the icon of pop metal rock himself.
</P>
<P>
   The former Van Halen crooner ascended the makeshift stage and
belted out the lyrics to his band's cover version of the classic
Beach Boys tune ``California Girls.'' Wearing tight leather
motorcycle chaps, blond mane streaming, he even unleashed a few of
his signature high kicks as the lyrics scrolled on a giant video
monitor behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd loved it. Russell Steinberg, the awestruck emcee,
broke in over the cheers. ``This is better than Pop-Up Video!'' he
said, referring to the VH-1 program that pokes fun at outdated
rockers like Roth.
</P>
<P>
   This truly odd moment _ a rock star performing a karaoke version
of his own recording _ was part of a reawakened interest among New
York hipsters in the sing-along pastime imported from Japan. Adam
Yauch of the Beastie Boys had a karaoke machine at his Manhattan
wedding in May, and the actors Mark Wahlberg, China Chow, Joaquin
Phoenix and Ben Affleck have all been washing up at the Wednesday
night karaoke party at Lansky Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed the loose-tie recreation of the 1980s had
been safely put to rest in church basements and suburban strip-mall
bars, karaoke is being revived by young downtown scene-makers,
along with so many other retro relics of the Reagan era. They are
frequenting new karaoke clubs, as well as infiltrating traditional
ones with a largely Asian clientele, partly as a rebellion against
the guest lists and staid lounges associated with 1990s night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the downtown culture is about pretension and
artifice,'' said Moby, a techno musician who likes to perform
karaoke versions of children's standards like ``Farmer in the
Dell.'' ``It's so nice to get together and be really stupid. Plus,
karaoke is cheaper than performing live because I don't have to pay
a drummer or a bassist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Bernstein brought karaoke to the Lansky Lounge, a small
club behind Ratner's restaurant on Delancey Street, two months ago.
``I got so sick of going out all the time and hearing people
network about their upcoming film or album,'' said Ms. Bernstein,
who originated her karaoke nights at SoHo's upscale Spy bar. She
moved to the more laid-back Lansky Lounge after Spy's owners
complained that her raucous crowd was scaring away the European
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   That raucousness, some say, is also causing problems with some
Asian karaoke patrons. The keg-party antics of some Western patrons
at traditional Asian karaoke bars has led to friction between the
two groups. Patterson Beckwith, a conceptual artist who belongs to
the collective Art Club 2000, recalled an evening when he and 30
friends were ejected from a Chinatown karaoke club after
improvising a hip-hop beat to Bon Jovi's ``Wanted Dead or Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hostess told us beat-boxing was not allowed and took the
mike away, even though I thought it sounded pretty good,'' Beckwith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmar Fillipson, 24, a deejay from Iceland, recalled a hostile
incident at Winnie's, a traditional karaoke club on Bayard Street
in Chinatown, where his mother was nearly pushed offstage by an
Asian woman for singing Neil Diamond's ``Sweet Caroline'' in the
wrong key. Fillipson said the Asian customers seemed antagonized
when he and his entourage started disco dancing to a karaoke opera
being sung by Asian customers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Liu, the karaoke jockey, or kayjay, at Winnie's, could not
recall the incident and said it didn't sound like something that
would happen at the club. She added, however, that Western
customers' behavior sometimes alienates Asian clients. ``Americans
get really drunk and like to swing the microphone and
break-dance,'' Ms. Liu said. ``Last year, there used to be more
Asians than Americans, and now it's the other way around. Most of
the regulars only come down during the week, because it's too rowdy
and crowded when there's a big group of Westerners on the weekends.
Asians like to sing very quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Village Karaoke, a club that opened last month at 27 Cooper
Square, on the corner of Fifth Street, hopes to attract both
groups. ``We're hoping to get customers from New York University,
the bars around St. Marks Place and the Japanese section of Ninth
Street,'' said James Sato, a co-owner, who runs several karaoke
bars in Koreatown in midtown Manhattan and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   His sprawling East Village establishment has 16 private rooms,
each painted a different color and decorated with the kind of
generic living room furniture often featured in a typical karaoke
video. Lyrics can be ordered in Japanese, Korean, Chinese and
English. At the end of each performance the screen flashes a score,
rating the performance from 1 to 100.
</P>
<P>
   Separate rooms may be one way to limit karaoke conflicts. Many
arise because Asians take karaoke more seriously than Americans,
said Casey Man Kong Lum, the author of ``In Search of a Voice:
Karaoke and the Construction of Identity in Chinese America''
(Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996). ``If someone doesn't try to
sing their best, Asians view that as letting down the entire
group,'' Lum said. ``So, if Westerners purposely mess up a song,
Asians might view that as selfish and disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum also stressed that it would be against karaoke etiquette to
become aggressive. ``It's more likely that it was just a case of
simple drunken stupidity and invading someone else's turf,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein said that frayed nerves were the exception, rather
than the rule, at her parties. And when tensions do flare, she
said, the cause is most likely simply mangled vocals. ``Karaoke is
a release, and people tend to get very emotional without even
realizing it,'' she said. ``Of course, drinking doesn't help
matters, but the reality that your song may not be well received is
a risk you have to be willing to take.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shoes are the mirror of the soul, according to many a
fashionista, but when a pair of Gucci horse-bit loafers sell for
$315, the price of self-revelation is, for many, tragically out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   That is why there is outlet shopping _ for fashion lovers with
more time than money, who don't mind journeying an hour or so out
of town to seek deep discounts in out-of-the-way designers'
clearinghouses.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is the promise that has fueled the outlet craze,
driving the industry to a record $13 billion in sales last year and
luring designers with the toniest of images, like Gucci, Giorgio
Armani and Prada, to join outlet pioneers like London Fog and Ann
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice the imagined savings are increasingly an
illusion, especially around New York City, where outlet malls like
Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y., and Tanger
Outlet Center in Riverhead, N.Y., are expecting throngs this
holiday weekend who would rather bargain-hunt than barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of New York-area outlets over the last
several months, combined with interviews with shoppers and retail
analysts, shows that outlet prices are often no better than sale
prices at Manhattan department stores and boutiques, and in some
cases, no better than full retail.
</P>
<P>
   That trademark Gucci women's loafer, for example, was priced at
$179 last week at the Gucci outlet at Woodbury Common, 55 miles
north of New York City. Meanwhile, at the Gucci store on Fifth
Avenue, the same shoe was on sale for $159. Moreover, the outlet
stocked the popular loafer only in navy and size 4{ _ suitable for
the smallest of women. The Manhattan store had a variety of colors
and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Brooks Brothers was selling a cotton dress shirt for
the same price, $39.90, at both Madison Avenue and Woodbury Common.
And at the Polo Ralph Lauren store at Clinton Crossing Premium
Outlets in Clinton, Conn., just off I-95, a twin sheet in the
Charlotte pattern cost $9.99 last week; at Bloomingdale's in New
York, it was $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed that the outlets are getting worse and worse,''
said Margaret Ryan, who was shopping at Clinton Crossing. In the
Liz Claiborne outlet, Ms. Ryan, a legal secretary, spotted the same
sandals selling for $34.95 that she had bought at Liz Claiborne on
Fifth Avenue for $34.95. Her only purchase: chocolate for the car
ride home. ``By the time you pay for tolls and gas, it's really not
worth it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Mona Elba, also a legal secretary, displayed two
white Gap T-shirts she had just purchased for $4.99, which a hang
tag said would fetch $6.99 at retail. But she pointed out that the
V-neck T-shirts were of a style not sold at regular Gap stores _ an
increasingly common outlet strategy, in which the outlets have
clothes custom-made, in less-expensive fabrics and styles, that
never appear at retail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bargains in the outlets anymore,'' Ms. Elba said.
``You're really better off waiting for sales at Macy's or Lord &AMP;
Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retail analysts would agree. ``Prices are escalating in the
outlets,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend
Report, a company in Upper Montclair, N.J., that tracks consumer
spending habits. ``It used to be that outlet prices were expected
to be, and in fact were, between 25 and 40 percent below what you
expected to pay in conventional department and speciality stores.
But over the years that spread between what you paid in the regular
stores and what you paid in the outlet stores has shrunk so much
that in some cases it's not even 10 percent below what you find in
ordinary stores.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday weekend, outlet stores are promising discounts
deeper than usual, as they do on all major holidays, to attract
vacationing shoppers. (Most outlets are near resort areas, to take
advantage of consumers' relaxed mood and full wallets.) But what
consumers might forget is that regular retail stores are also
holding big holiday sales. In many cases, the bargains are every
bit as good, especially considering that outlet-store merchandise
is often not the same quality.
</P>
<P>
   How has this come about? What has happed to erode the savings?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, success.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, when outlet mania first took hold, stores tended
to deliver on their promises of deep discounts. But with millions
of shoppers responding to the lure of bargains, the clearinghouses
have boomed _ there are some 350 designer outlet malls in the
United States, up from 300 in 1995. Woodbury Common, which began
with 100,000 square feet in 1985, added 70 new stores in just the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And explosive growth has meant that there is no longer enough
true outlet merchandise to go around _ unsold garments left over at
season's end in traditional stores, or designers' samples and
manufacturers' oversupply and canceled orders.
</P>
<P>
   True outlet merchandise fetches a higher price than it once did,
simply because of supply and demand. ``It's gotten more and more
competitive; everyone is trying to buy a bigger and bigger piece of
the pie,'' said Marcia Wilson, president of Daffy's, a 10-store
off-price chain in the New York area, which was one of the pioneers
in the business of buying manufacturers' overstock, along with
Loehmann's and Filene's, long before the outlet centers.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the demand for clothes for clearinghouses, designers and
other outlet chains have taken to making merchandise of lower
quality directly for outlets. The 39-store chain Off Fifth, a
spinoff of Saks Fifth Avenue, relies on the cachet of the Saks name
to lure customers, who may not realize that most of the goods in
the outlets have never graced a department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that 70 percent of the merchandise for Off
Fifth has never been in our retail store and is purchased directly
from the vendors,'' a Saks spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Saks is one of the only companies to publicly acknowledge this
widespread practice. Its spokeswoman said that outlet shoppers can
recognize merchandise from its retail stores if the price tags are
printed on both sides; tags printed on only one side indicate an
item has been bought directly from a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Direct-to-outlet goods, often carrying famous designers' labels,
are usually made of lower-quality materials or out-of-date fabrics.
Other corners are cut by using cheaper buttons and flimsier heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donna Karan has been doing that for years,'' Barnard, the
retail analyst, said. Ms. Karan's company declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Polo Ralph Lauren store on 72d Street and Madison Avenue,
a navy-and- white loafer called the Cambridge boasts a thick brown
sole. It normally costs $350, and is on sale for $299.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Polo Ralph Lauren outlet at Woodbury Common, a
loafer of almost identical styling is $149. But the upper is
thinner, as is the sole, and the heel seems less solid. A salesman
said the shoe was made expressly for the outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Most designers and retailers contacted declined to speak about
their outlet business, and analysts said this was largely from fear
of tarnishing their high-fashion images, like a blue blood's
disdain for a poor cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Polo Ralph Lauren did not return calls seeking comment. Gucci
and Burberry's declined to comment. At Donna Karan, a public
relations assistant said, ``We don't want to participate in an
outlet story.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of a major retail company with a chain of outlet
stores, who said that if her name was used she would loose her job,
acknowledged, ``The prices in the outlets are no better than the
sales, and in lots of cases, the retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my friends all talk about it,'' she added.

 (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the
Internet,'' by Michael Wolff (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25), takes its
title from a bit of business slang _ the term used to describe how
fast a start-up is spending money in excess of revenues to stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   But in this vivid insider's tale of the early Internet industry,
``burn rate'' works as a metaphor in other ways, too. It stands for
the blistering pace of change on the World Wide Web, where the
accepted business model for making a profit seems to change every
other month, along with who is hot and who is in the ash pile.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase also neatly symbolizes the extent to which a
struggling, money-losing Web enterprise (like Wolff's was in 1996)
will blow smoke and generate heat to hang on to its backers and
lure buyers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the author, who is a former journalist and
publisher (he created the popular ``Netguide'' books for an
Internet-wary public), ``Burn Rate'' is meant to clear away the
smoke, to be an ``anti press release'' about his own experience
with all this in the Internet's early days.
</P>
<P>
   Its narrative centers on six crucial months in the life of Wolff
New Media, the New York-based company that the author founded to
provide ``content'' on the Web. Eventually, the company, backed by
venture capitalists, created some guide sites and services _ for
example, an electronic guide to events occurring live on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But vision? Nah, unless you're talking about the kind needed to
read the small print in an initial public offering that could yield
personal profits.
</P>
<P>
   It is fast cash, rather than content, that seems of most
interest to Wolff and his investors. Like so many entrepreneurs
making the venture-capital cyberrounds, he wants his business to
``build brand, gain position'' and then cash in by being ``taken
out'' in an IPO for tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The reader comes in when the company's losses were triple its
sales, its burn rate was a half-million dollars a month and it had
enough cash to operate only six more months.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. The dreamed-of market valuation is right in line
with the rest of the Internet industry, which at the time tended to
price its companies at 20 times their revenues _ much higher than
in the plain old publishing world, Wolff says. And he,
acknowledging that he was ``human,'' ``greedy'' and ``fascinated,''
wants to be a ``great business story.''
</P>
<P>
   The story Wolff tells instead is compulsively readable _ despite
nagging questions about how he could remember the detailed and
entertaining dialogue that novelizes the account so well. (He says
he took notes throughout his adventure.)
</P>
<P>
   After a while, you stop dropping your jaw, as the author
describes the inflated claims of the cyberentrepreneurs, the
technological ignorance of some of his investors (a trait for which
he feels contempt) and the lies and distrust surrounding his own
partnership. (To stall the actions of an angry creditor on his
board, for example, he invents some open-heart surgery for his
father-in-law.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the frantic merger flirtations or money talks _
with Ameritech, The Washington Post and the Web-search provider
Magellan, which itself was ultimately bought by Excite. An account
of a dinner meeting with Magellan's principals, including scions of
the late media magnate Robert Maxwell, reads like a report on one
of the Mad Hatter's tea parties.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody talks the talk, but nothing happens. Nothing happens
in joint-venture talks with America Online, either, though Wolff
writes a hilarious, page-turning chapter about this drawn-out,
always-just-this-side-of-done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff New Media, meanwhile, begins to advertise its Internet
guides on Infoseek, another Web search engine. The deal: For each
user who types in the search word ``cigars'' (an upscale product,
Wolff reasoned), Wolff New Media pays Infoseek 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In return, a click-through banner ad for the company's latest
book shows up when the user's search results appear. The outcome?
Wolff winds up paying $666 for $110 in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate,'' follows Wolff to the point where, exhausted, he
writes himself a back salary check _ enough, he says, to finance
the writing of a book'' _ and leaves the company.
</P>
<P>
   The book is already taking some heat. In a recent article in The
San Francisco Chronicle, Isabel Maxwell, one of Robert Maxwell's
daughters, angrily objected to the author's account of the Magellan
undeal.
</P>
<P>
   And former Wolff employees _ some of the writers who pumped out
books about the Internet at the rate of one every 20 days _ told
The Village Voice, New York's downtown weekly, that the book
omitted their story, most notably, their agreement to defer
salaries during part of those tough six months. They hoped to be
rewarded in the event of an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Others may be unhappy, too, especially given Wolff's penchant
for name-calling. It's one thing to say America Online is
``dysfunctional'' in its lack of organization, another to give in
to the childish urge to characterize people as ``fat'' or ``ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in part, that's why this kiss-and-tell book is
revelatory: Its author is no better than anyone else in his
cybercast of characters, many of whom alternate, like adolescents,
between self-aggrandizement and self-pity. (A key exception, as
Wolff tells it anyway, is his wife, Alison Anthoine, who acts as
the company's lawyer and the drama's choric commentator.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this book's sharp perspective comes not from
distance but from being inside the swirl. ``Burn Rate'' has a
terrific feel for the crazy deals, the characters and the clashing
bicoastal cultures of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff has caught this business at a fascinating time _ when it
is less an industry than, to use his words, a ``hurtling fireball
of separate embers of ambition.''

   RELIGION-FREEDOM-COX (Undated) _ The Million Man March organized
by the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and the Promise Keepers'
Stand in the Gap rally of Christian men put religion symbolically
in the center of the nation's capital. But actions in the
legislative halls and courtrooms have been changing and refining
the definition of what freedom of religion, as expressed in the
First Amendment to the Constitution, really means. Here's a
snapshot of recent and pending legislation and court cases
affecting religious liberty. By Gayle White. Moved 7-2 for 7-4.

<P>
   TEACHER-MARRIAGE-NYT (White Plains, N.Y.) _ A Roman Catholic

who was dismissed from her job because she had married a divorced
Episcopalian who had never had his previous marriage annulled. By
Joseph Berger. Moved 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   AMISH-DRUGS-NYT (Philadelphia) _ Abner King Stoltzfus, 23, and
Abner Stoltzfus, 24, are anomalies in the federal criminal justice
system. They are the first two members of Pennsylvania's Amish
community to be arrested for involvement with cocaine and
methamphetamine. By Michael Janofsky. Moved 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-LETTER-NYT (Rome) _ In one of his sharpest rebukes to
liberal Catholics to date, Pope John Paul II on Tuesday made
changes to canon law aimed at stamping out debate on a wide range
of passionately discussed issues, including euthanasia and the
ordination of women. By Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-30.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-REACT-BOS (Undated) _ Pope John Paul II's effort to end
debate on such controversial issues as the ordination of women
through changes he made this week in canon law, will not succeed in
forcing obedience from the many Roman Catholics alienated from the
church, several theologians and scholars interviewed said. By Diego
Ribadeneira. Moved 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARCHAEOLOGY-HNS (Jerusalem) _ Breaking ancient clay pots
and carrying protest signs, dozens of angry archaeologists
demonstrated Wednesday over reports that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has promised an ultra-Orthodox party effective control
over the country's excavations. Archaeology has been at the center
of debate in Israel for years with the ultra-Orthodox vehemently _
and sometimes violently _ opposed to excavations in which they
believe Jewish graves have been found. By Deborah Horan. Moved 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   GREEK-ORTHODOX-BOS (Undated) _ Two years ago the nation's 2
million Greek Orthodox cheered the news that Metropolitan Spyridon
had been chosen to be their new archbishop. Today, however, there
is revolution within the Greek church, with people who once
supported Spyridon now formally demanding his resignation. What
started last year as criticism by some church activists of what
they considered Spyridon's autocratic style, has ballooned into a
full-fledged attempt by many deep-pocketed Greek Orthodox to force
the archbishop to step down. By Diego Ribadeneira. Moved 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-RELIGION-NYT (Undated) _ For most of the century people
have espoused the view that science and religion should be kept
apart to avoid the inevitable combustions. But to rational minds it
has always been troubling that there could be two opposing ways to
explain what is the same universe. Science and religion both spring
from the human obsession to find order in the world. But surely
there can be only one true explanation for reality: Life was either
created or it evolved. Prayer is either communication with God or a
psychological salve. The universe is either pervaded by spiritual
forces or ruled by nothing but physical laws. Now various groups
are seeking a resolution, including those involved in a recent
conference that provided a heavy religious bent. By George Johnson.

grandparents, have come from across the country to the
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, just west of this two-stoplight

Rather, the Boston Pops tradition now practiced in scores if not
hundreds of spots around the country, that the orchestra caps its
Fourth of July concert with Tchaikovsky's (undeniably non-American,
but who cares?) 1812 and some air-splitting rounds of cannon fire
along with fireworks. It all started with a quirky friendship
between two men: Arthur Fiedler, the late, legendary, curmudgeonly
conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra, and David Mugar, a
millionaire Boston businessman who has sponsored every one of
Boston's Fourth th of July concerts since it took on this explosive
form just 25 years ago. By Carey Goldberg.

Committee these days can expect a lecture on the sins of
``legislating from the bench'' or ``making law instead of
interpreting the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges who believe otherwise ``should resign to run for public
office _ at least then they would be accountable for their
actions.'' So said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who heads the
Judiciary Committee, a few weeks ago in a speech on the Senate
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at the Supreme Court, meanwhile, the justices
were wrapping up a term that included a striking amount of what a
disinterested observer might be tempted to call judicial
legislating. That there has been no call for the justices' mass
resignation, from Hatch or anyone else, indicates that beyond
ritual political incantations about judges lies a separate, tacitly
understood and widely accepted reality.
</P>
<P>
   By substantial majorities that cut across the ideological
spectrum, the justices in the term that just ended essentially
rewrote the law of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is
governed by, but nowhere described or even mentioned in, Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They defined the scope of the
attorney-client privilege, which Congress addressed only implicitly
in Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And the justices effectively immunized police officers for the
consequences of reckless high-speed chases, in lawsuits brought for
constitutional deprivations under the ancient Civil Rights Act of
1871.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone may have liked every result, but very few people
who follow the court could honestly profess to be shocked that
there was lawmaking going on.
</P>
<P>
   While the court's most noted role is to interpret the
majestically open-ended and opaque phrases of the Constitution,
about two-thirds of the docket consists of statutory cases. In
deciding these, the court routinely engages in what might be
described as making law.
</P>
<P>
   It supplies the interpretive principles and the rules for
practical application: Which side has what kind of burden of proof?
What amount of evidence is sufficient? It decides how laws apply to
situations that the Congress that passed them never anticipated. It
reconciles internal contradictions. It fills in all-important
statutory gaps attributable to congressional neglect or, often, to
deliberate omission in the face of political gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If justices stopped this kind of legislating from the bench, the
system might grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven by necessity,'' said Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a
University of Pennsylvania law professor. ``We are living in an age
of statutes with high political purpose that are broad on policy
and rhetoric but weak on subordinate detail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no institution other than the Supreme Court has both the
credibility and the responsibility to fill in the blanks, adding of
the justices, ``What service would they really be performing for
anyone if they talked at an equal level of generality?''
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, Chief Justice John Marshall who declared in
Marbury vs. Madison in 1803 that ``it is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.''
Still, there was something quite noteworthy, even a bit unsettling,
about how far the court took the practice in the past term.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding two sexual harassment cases, based on a law that
tells employers little more than ``thou shalt not discriminate,''
the justices crafted and included in each decision an identical
page of rules for establishing an employer's liability for the
harassing conduct of a supervisor. The decisions went beyond
defining sexual harassment in broadly prescribing how the legal
system should handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Employers could be held liable even for conduct they were not
aware of, and for conduct that did not cause any tangible
job-related harm to the victimized employee, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it added an important qualification: If there
was no harm, an employer could establish an ``affirmative defense''
against liability by having an effective anti-harassment policy in
place, and by showing that the complaining employee unreasonably
failed to invoke it.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined only by Justice
Antonin Scalia, complained about the court's ``whole-cloth
creation.'' But the tone of the majority opinion was not so much
activist as pragmatic. The seven justices in the majority,
including Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, recognized that their
own earlier, vaguely worded sexual-harassment decisions had failed
to give lower courts the guidance to navigate a legal regime that
was, after all, almost entirely judge-made.
</P>
<P>
   The court had seen enough of confusion in the lower courts to
know it was time to intervene, said Prof. Barry Friedman of
Vanderbilt University Law School. And he called attention to what
he said was an overlooked factor in supposedly free-handed
lawmaking by the Justices: the court's ``confidence that Congress
can talk back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These opinions typically contain invitations to Congress,
sometimes almost a tone of entreaty as if to say, here it is,
here's our best shot, somebody had to do this, but tell us if we
got it wrong,'' Friedman said in an interview. The court's
statutory decision-making provides ``a unique opportunity for
dialogue between Congress and the court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That a dialogue does take place is not just political science
theory. When the court changed course on civil rights in 1989,
issuing a series of newly restrictive interpretations curbing
federal civil rights laws, Congress responded with the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, which restored the legislators' original understanding
of the laws and even added new teeth to some of them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter addressed
that history in their majority opinions last month in the sexual
harassment cases. They noted that Congress could have used the 1991
law to express disapproval of the court's earlier sexual harassment
decisions along with the other civil rights rulings, but did not do
so, indicating that the court was on the right track in having
brought sexual harassment within the scope of federal civil rights
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its day-to-day business, Congress is quite comfortable with
the courts working out the details, as long as there remains a
basis in the text,'' said Professor Michael Dorf of Columbia Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguous statutory language can itself be seen as ``a kind of
delegation'' to administrative agencies and ultimately to courts,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the court has debated how closely, in interpreting
statutes, to hold Congress to the plain meaning of the actual text,
as opposed to gleaning whatever added information about Congress'
intent might be available from the legislative record. Justice
Scalia is the primary exponent of the ``textualist'' school _ still
a minority view, but an influential one.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the textualist approach may convey the
impression of passivity, of the court taking a back seat to
Congress. But in fact, it does not remove the court from the
business of lawmaking any more than any other approach to statutory
interpretation; it allows the court to ignore competing
interpretations contained in the legislative or administrative
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scalia's focus on the text often means that it's the court,
and the court alone, that is going to decide what the right answer
is,'' Dorf said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that a future judicial nominee, after listening
to a senator's lecture about not legislating from the bench, will
be tempted to counter with a paraphrase of Thomas Jefferson's ``We
are all Republicans _ We are all Federalists.'' But in comparison
to the standard homily, ``We are all judges _ We are all
lawmakers'' might be closer to the truth of how the system actually
works.

MEDICAL ACCOUNTS: MIXED REVIEWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Ind., Md., Ill., Texas)   (af)  
 By MARGARET O. KIRK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When medical savings accounts became available last year, Eric
R. Bryen, Matthew C. Dailey and Julie A. Griswold all signed up,
eager for the chance to save tax-free dollars for medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year later, the reviews are mixed. For Bryen and
Dailey, both self-employed, the accounts have worked well. Ms.
Griswold's experience has been decidedly less pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryen, 39, a lawyer in Farmington Hills, Mich., has watched his
medical savings account grow tax-free because he has opted not to
tap into it for medical expenses. ``I love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey, 36, an insurance broker in Indianapolis, has not been
able to build up any money because his family's medical expenses _
for the birth of a baby, as well as for some unexpected surgery for
his wife, Kathryn, 39 _ exceeded the amount he can deposit each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what the account did was save me federal and state income
tax on that money,'' Dailey said. ``It's definitely the program to
have if you are self-employed.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Ms. Griswold, 40, the plan has been a financial
disaster. One of four employees who signed up for the plan last
year at the Fields Group, an Indianapolis company that plans
corporate sales trips, Ms. Griswold had both pneumonia and
unexpected surgery in her first year, with expensive follow-up
treatments early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because her medical expenses began piling up before her account
accumulated much money, and because her yearly deductible for
coverage is $2,250, Ms. Griswold has already had out-of-pocket
expenses of roughly $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are healthy or if you make a lot of money, it's a great
plan,'' said Ms. Griswold, who earns about $26,000 a year and has
had to postpone further tests because of her medical bills. ``But
if things start to go wrong and you don't have a high income, it's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of these three people are important because
Washington is considering changes to the four-year pilot project,
created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which took effect at the beginning of 1997, was
intended for the self-employed and for companies with 50 or fewer
employees; it allows tax-deductible contributions to accounts that
can be tapped only for medical expenses. The accounts are set up at
banks or insurance companies and packaged with high-deductible
insurance to cover serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Initial interest was high _ the Employers Council on Flexible
Compensation once received as many as 1,700 phone calls in a week
requesting information. Consumers, however, have not rushed to
convert to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The law allowed as many as 375,000 people to participate by
April 1, 1997. But the Treasury Department estimates that only
100,000 accounts have been established.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of the participants has surprised industry experts,
too. Far fewer than expected small businesses are participating,
but more self-employed and empty-nesters starting home businesses
are, said Greg Scandlen, managing partner of Health Benefits Group,
a consulting firm in Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   At the Golden Rule Insurance Co. in Lawrenceville, Ill., nearly
72 percent of the 29,000 medical savings accounts are for families
with self-employed adult, said Tenna Merchent, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Early supporters of the concept, who saw it as a way for
consumers to help control health costs and have more choices, now
conclude that there are serious problems _ including the complexity
of the program's administration, the 50-employee cap at eligible
businesses and the high deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is not doing well,'' said Jack Strayer, vice
president for external affairs at the Washington office of the
National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas research organization
that helped originate the concept. ``I predicted that a million
policies would be sold by now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed,'' said David Wilson, president of the
Flexben Corp., of Troy, Mich., which manages benefits plans for
employers. Wilson is a director of the Employers Council on
Flexible Compensation, which lobbied for the initial legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the legislation was drafted for small employers only,
and the restrictive nature of the legislation itself, meant that it
was presented to the health care marketplace in an upside-down
approach,'' he said. ``The big players generally lead the
marketplace. That never happened in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical savings accounts (which have been available since the
early 1990s, but without the federal tax benefits) work like this:
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The consumer buys health insurance with a high deductible _
between $1,500 and $2,500 annually for an individual, and $3,000 to
$4,500 for a family.
</P>
<P>
   The policyholder must then establish a medical savings account
at a participating bank or mutual fund company. Contributions for
individuals can be a maximum of 65 percent of their deductible, or
75 percent for families. Either an employer or an employee can
contribute, but not both. Payments can be made in monthly
installments or in a lump sum at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Using checks drawn on those accounts, policyholders pay medical
bills and submit claims to insurers. Once the deductible is met,
plans often pay up to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, any money remaining in the account is
carried over to the next year. All contributions are deductible on
federal tax returns, and 25 states offer deductions, too. Interest
accumulates tax-deferred up to age 65 and in most cases is entirely
tax-free if used for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   After 65, money can be withdrawn with no penalty, though tax
will be due if it is not used for medical care. If the money is
withdrawn early for nonmedical expenses, there is a 15 percent
penalty and income taxes must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryen's case, he and his wife and two children are covered by
a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan plan with a $3,000 deductible;
each year, he can save 75 percent of that, or $2,250, tax-free in
his medical account.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance costs him $369 a month, a little higher than most
plans because he has several expensive options, like annual
physicals with no deductibles. And even though his family had about
$1,300 in medical expenses last year, Bryen paid for them out of
his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just letting it build up,'' said Bryen, who earns more
than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Griswold also thought her program would be a forced savings
plan. Her individual policy carries a yearly deductible of $2,250,
which means she could save 65 percent of that, or $1,463, tax-free.
Her employer pays for the insurance and contributes monthly to her
medical account.
</P>
<P>
   But constant medical problems made her wish she had never
switched from traditional health insurance. Her expenses for
pneumonia and surgery more than met her deductible for 1997 and
outpaced her employer contributions; she figures she paid at least
$2,000 of her own money for medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   And after January, when she again had to meet the deductible,
tests and treatments caused her to owe $2,250 more. ``I had to pay
all of that out of pocket, too, or work out payment plans,'' she
said. ``And now I'm putting off having another sonogram because I
don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Both examples reflect one of the main arguments against these
accounts _ that they are only for those healthy enough not to need
extensive care or wealthy enough to afford the steep deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Strayer agree that some program failings are
reflected in Ms. Griswold's case: the deductibles can be too high,
and they are the same for each participant, regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   To address some of these issues, several proposals are working
their way through Congress. Various changes being debated by the
House Ways and Means Committee and the Republican Health Care Task
Force would lower the deductible limit for both families and
individuals; allow both employer and employee to contribute
tax-free dollars, as with 401(k) accounts, and lift the restriction
on the size of businesses that can offer the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes, said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Ways and
Means Committee, ``would make the existing pilot a workable
pilot.'' Other changes under consideration would encourage banks
and insurers, which have been slow to market the plans, to
participate, Strayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 also created a medical savings
account for Medicare recipients, scheduled to begin in October,
which could give a higher profile to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a brand-new concept,'' Scandlen said. ``It is not
an easy thing to do.''

   TORONTO _ It's been fairly well demonstrated that Americans
aren't too swift when it comes to their own history _ as, for
example, when surveys show that most students can't place the Civil
War in the right century. Last week came striking new evidence that
Canada has historical amnesia, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably alarming enough, but true irony lay in one of
the reasons why Canadians forget: Many are confusing their heritage
with that of their famously forgetful yet culturally dominant
neighbor to the south.
</P>
<P>
   A new national survey showed that not only were half of
Canadians in the dark about basic facts of Canadian civics and
history _ some thought the singer Gordon Lightfoot wrote the
Canadian national anthem _ but that many misapprehensions by
Canadians were a result of cross-border cultural seepage.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who said, ``The medium is the message,'' some said it
was Bill Gates of Microsoft rather than the Canadian academic
Marshall McLuhan. And when asked in a multiple-choice question to
cite a phrase from Canada's Constitution, fewer than half correctly
picked ``peace, order and good government,'' while one in four
selected ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' from the
American Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in a week when many Canadians tend to meld Canada Day
(July 1) and the Fourth of July into one long holiday, the results
could not have been more worrisome to those in Canada who see
themselves as Dutch boys with fingers in a crumbling dike against
the flood tides of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? Penny-pinching school boards, dull history
teachers, the collapse of Western civilization _ many of the same
culprits familiar to Americans are targeted here. But in Canada the
criticism of media comes with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Rudyard Griffiths, executive director of the Dominion Institute,
which sponsored the history survey, said the myths put out by
Hollywood and the American entertainment industry are so powerful
that Canadians unwittingly adopt them as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the cultural leverage to tell our own stories,''
Griffiths said, ``and as a result you see a willowing of Canadian
cultural capital.''
</P>
<P>
   France, Britain and other nations have expressed similar
concerns about American cultural imperialism, but it was Canada
that organized an international conference of culture ministers
last week, and stubbornly refused to invite the United States to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers from 19 countries felt that only by acting in
concert could they fend off the forces that threaten cultural
diversity _ i.e., the folks who bring the world Mickey Mouse and
Rambo. Still, Canada received more sympathy than support from its
guests, who after all could go back to countries separated from the
United States by a wide ocean or a different language or both.
</P>
<P>
   Most Canadians, or course, have neither buffer. Not only do most
speak English, but upwards of 90 percent of them live within a
two-hour drive of the United States border. TV Guide and Time are
among the most popular magazines they read, and when a Canadian
foundation tried to boost Canadian heritage last year, it gave away
historical comic books at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest issue, Maclean's, the national news magazine,
takes a further stab at Canadian cultural heritage. And boy, it has
to hurt, though this was no doubt unintentional. From the 55
million Canadians who have ever lived (fewer than the number of
living Californians), the magazine selected as the single most
important one of all Gen. George Philias Vanier, a one-legged,
bilingual World War I hero and representative of the queen whose
entry in the authoritative Canadian Encyclopedia is but two
paragraphs long.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Vanier, the magazine seemed to have trouble rounding out
its top 10 list of heroes. Terry Fox, a one-legged runner who
raised funds to fight cancer, and Roberta Bondar, the first
Canadian woman in space, made it, as did an American Indian (!) and
two hockey players. When real-life heroes seemed to run short, the
magazine padded the list with imaginary Canadians: Evangeline,
Wordsworth's tragic Acadian heroine, and the ever perky Anne of
Green Gables.
</P>
<P>
   One consolation, if there is any here, is that cultural swords
cut both ways, especially when cultures are cheek by jowl. Jim
Carrey, Peter Jennings and countless other Canadians have risen to
the top of American entertainment and media. With free trade and
communications systems that ignore borders, the United States and
Canada can't help but get more entangled.
</P>
<P>
   And while Toronto routinely stands in for New York in Hollywood
productions, bags of trash no longer need to be spread around
Toronto's streets to give them that authentic look _ now that the
Big Apple has become more like Toronto and cleaned up its act.

   JAPAN-ECONOMY-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Den Fujita, one of Japan's most
successful and iconoclastic businessmen, is reveling in Japan's
economic woes. As the owner of half of McDonald's Japan, Fujita has
so relentlessly slashed prices of burgers, shakes and fries that
it's now cheaper to buy a Big Mac in Tokyo than in New York _ even
without the yen's recent tumble. Profits are soaring, and
Fujita-san is crowing. ``These bad times are a good thing for me,''
he said. ``No problems at all for us, not one.'' Fujita is a rare
bird these days, when most economists and world leaders see nothing
redeeming in Japan's skid into a recession that took hold last
winter and now threatens to undermine the already faltering
economies of the rest of Asia. By Stephanie Strom.

QUEST FOR THE TREASURE QUEST WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You think finding the correct answer hidden in Treasure Quest
that would win $1 million was difficult?
</P>
<P>
   You should try finding the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who spent the last two years playing the Sirius
Corp.'s CD-ROM game would like to find that person.
</P>
<P>
   But Sirius won't say if the person is a male or female, or give
out any other information. Moreover, it appears the winner wasn't
the first person to submit the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, I wrote about a software program that
contained a $1 million prize: Treasure Quest from Sirius Corp. of
Scottsdale, Ariz. Players who bought the $50 game had to solve an
intricate puzzle, made up of an estimated 1,200 clues, to find the
mystery hidden in Professor Jonathon William Faulkner's 10-room
mansion. Players went through the mansion collecting clues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the game's buyers are searching for something even more
elusive than the hidden treasure: the winner of the $1 million
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sirius President Richard Gnant has refused to fully identify the
winner, saying only that the prize was won by ``P. Dreizen of San
Francisco, California.'' The announcement was made in mid-May, and
a Web site which allowed players to pass along ideas about solving
puzzles and exchange clues was closed down soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Those who purchased the game might want to contact the Arizona
Attorney General's Office (602-542-4266). A story by Dennis Wagner
of The Arizona Republic reported recently that a complaint has been
filed with the office. The office will not confirm or deny that,
but if there is legal action taken, purchasers of the game may have
recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that it's a scam,'' Paul Wigowsky, told The
Republic. Wigowsky is an Oregon schoolteacher who filed the
consumer-fraud complaint. ``Unless we see the winner with our own
eyes, we won't believe it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no press release about the winner. No
picture-taking session. No address or no other confirmation. A note
was posted on the Treasure Quest Web site from the company saying
the answer to the mystery is, ``The Tree of Life.'' Searches for a
P. Dreizen in San Francisco's telephone books turned up a Pamala
Dreizen, who did not return a reporter's telephone calls over a
period of several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gnant insisted the Treasure Quest winner is a real person.
Losers, he told The Republic, ``are miffed because they didn't win.
We've maintained the integrity of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said the game rules don't require a public
notification of the winner, the rules clearly allow the company to
release the name: ``Entry constitutes permission (except where
prohibited) to use winner's name, likeness, hometown, biographical
information and any comments about the contest for publicity
purposes without compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that Gnant also refused to say whether
the winner was male or female, or how many others, if any, were
involved on Dreizen's winning team. He also would not release the
date of when the winning entry was submitted.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that ``P. Dreizen'' wasn't really the
first winner: ``Last week, Gnant acknowledged that Wigowsky solved
the riddle before Dreizen, but was disqualified because he did not
place a contest registration number in the appropriate place. `The
guy didn't follow the rules, so he didn't win Treasure Quest. I'm
sorry,' Gnant added. `Maybe I should have told him.' '''
</P>
<P>
   Gnant said the New York firm of Ventura Associates Inc., which
has handled contests for major companies, confirmed P. Dreizen as
the winner. The Republic article said Gnant's company has since
switched form computer games to marketing CD-ROM movies (which have
also been written about in this column) ``and he didn't want to
spend money on a victory bash.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the people who play these intricate puzzle games to
quickly figure out something else about the ``P. Dreizen'' winner:
Rearranged, the letters of his/her name spell out, ``End Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Possibly so. Words anagram into many phrases, some
of which seem to fit a theory. ``Sirius Corporation'' anagrams into
``So, I air corruptions.'' But the fact that the disgruntled
Treasure Quest players found ``End Prize'' in the prize-winner's
game is an indication of how resourceful and thorough they can be
when checking out leads.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic story said that now the contest is over, players
have started looking at Sirius' business. They've found the staff
has been reduced to a third of what it was _ a downsizing Gnant
said resulted from the change in the business (from gaming software
to CD-ROM movies). It has also closed its business offices and
moved its operations to a warehouse. Another Gnant business went
into bankruptcy several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other players found it odd that the name of the player who won
never popped up in the various chat rooms or bulletin boards where
players swapped information and hints. And they also wonder how a
complex game can be won by just one person. If more were involved,
it would seem they would want to come forward for the credit.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle solvers are wound up after working on Treasure Quest
for two years _ then being told they won't be able to learn much at
all about the winner. They have another puzzle to solve, and I'll
bet they'll work until they find out the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>

   TOKYO _ Den Fujita, one of Japan's most successful and
iconoclastic businessmen, is reveling in Japan's economic woes. As
the owner of half of McDonald's Japan, Fujita has so relentlessly
slashed prices of burgers, shakes and fries that it's now cheaper
to buy a Big Mac in Tokyo than in New York _ even without the yen's
recent tumble. Profits are soaring, and Fujita-san is crowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bad times are a good thing for me,'' he said. ``No
problems at all for us, not one.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujita is a rare bird these days, when most economists and world
leaders see nothing redeeming in Japan's skid into a recession that
took hold last winter and now threatens to undermine the already
faltering economies of the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking its medicine seven years ago when recession
loomed after the collapse of the real estate market, Japan
persisted in a policy of denial, keeping the economy stumbling
along with public works projects and lenient accounting rules that
allowed banks to paper over bad loans and corporations to dress up
their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   For all its dodging and feinting, Japan has become the pariah of
the global economy, which is itself under threat from a Japanese
economic meltdown. Japan is still the world's second-largest
market, and as such is an integral part of the global financial
system. If Japan sneezes, the world is liable to catch a cold.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists say there could be a silver lining in the
black clouds scudding across the Japanese economic horizon. The
nation's current credit crunch, weaker yen, higher unemployment and
lower prices, these economists maintain, actually present an
opportunity for an economic restructuring that would return the
nation to economic preeminence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential strong upside to Japan's downside,'' said
David Asher, a Japan scholar at Oxford University. ``Structural
adjustment will inevitably be painful and socially and politically
disconcerting. However, no pain, no gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Asher is by no means a wide-eyed optimist. He is the co-author,
with Andrew Smithers, of a damning portrait of the Japanese economy
published by the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns
Hopkins University. They argue that mountains of debt, falling
asset prices, increasing loan defaults, declining birth rates and
low productivity will turn Japan into an economic has-been if the
government persists in trying to hold off market forces and cushion
the economy's fall with more public works programs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the authors maintain, tighter bank lending and lower
prices should force Japanese businesses to become leaner and more
efficient. And rising unemployment need not be a cause for panic,
given Japan's demographics, changing workplace culture and the
rebound from the downsizing of U.S. businesses in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While a thorough economic revamping might be in Japan's
long-term interest, it would almost certainly clash with the rest
of the world's short-term interests; when the yen went into a free
fall last month, the American stock market retreated and exporters
around the world began toting up the losses they would suffer from
the coming flood of cheaper Japanese products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Japan had a hard landing but a fast bounce-back?''
said Kathy Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in
Tokyo. ``That would be good for Japan and ultimately good for the
rest of Asia, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the falling prices that thrill Fujita. For years, tourists
to Japan have dined out on tales of Japan's $200 cantaloupes and $6
strawberries, but Japanese housewives have had to live with the
reality of a $2 zucchini and $14 bag of rice. It's no wonder people
are flocking to McDonald's, particularly at a time when companies
are cutting bonuses and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese stand to benefit from lower prices for consumer
goods, Asher said, as well as lower land and asset prices. Once the
prices of property, real estate and other assets reflect their true
value, companies will be able to produce higher returns on their
investments, which in turn will lead to more investment and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The same thinking goes for tighter bank lending. Small and
midsize businesses have had difficulty getting loans from banks,
which are themselves scrambling to meet international standards for
capital and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcies have skyrocketed as individuals and small
entrepreneurs have found themselves unable to get loans, which in
the past they had used to repay old debts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that banks are breaking that vicious cycle and saying
no _ after years of saying yes with little regard for
creditworthiness or business rationale _ is an enormous step toward
a more realistic allocation of capital. It is an very painful
process, economists agree, but one destined to put the financial
system on sounder footing and make businesses leaner and more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of concern is unemployment, which is running at a
postwar high and is expected to continue rising. For decades, the
West has bemoaned Japan's system of lifetime employment and
seniority-based pay, but now that the system is breaking down, a
number of foreign economists are wringing their hands over its
demise and the accompanying layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Japan's social safety net is woefully
insufficient. Laid-off workers receive an average monthly handout
of about $360 at current exchange rates, according to Douglas
Ostrom, who has written extensively about Japanese economic reform.
And the government is far more likely to finance a new bridge or
railway track as an antidote to unemployment than commit money to
bolstering the welfare system, which is what many would like to see
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists say anxiety over Japanese unemployment
ignores the fact that the nation will face a labor shortage after
the turn of the century because of its low birth rates. Thus, the
majority of workers losing their jobs as the economy restructures
should eventually find new ones _ as long as the government fosters
programs to develop new skills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies slashed tens of thousands of workers from
payrolls in the early 1990s, but now the nation has one of the
tightest labor markets in memory. Because of Japan's low birth
rate, high education levels and cultural commitment to providing
work for those who want it, downsizing in Japan will probably be
far more gentle than it was in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as Japanese companies find themselves stretched by the
traditional pay system in which workers are paid based on seniority
and regardless of skills and performance, they are slashing
benefits like low-interest loans and transportation costs _
programs that have been regarded more as rights than perks. Some
companies are even scrapping the seniority pay system altogether
and moving toward merit-based systems.
</P>
<P>
   As for the yen, there is more than a little self-interest in the
howling from Washington and other nations for its recovery.
Japanese companies benefit from the yen's decline because their
products become cheaper, which hurts their foreign rivals. But
improved sales by Japanese companies are good for the Japanese
economy, which after all is what the world is pressing for. And a
healthier economy means a stronger yen, a stronger Asia and less
threat to America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Asher, for one, wonders if Japan is willing to swallow all these
pills, and if the rest of the world wants them to, knowing of the
short-term consequences for the global economy. ``One cannot help
but worry whether both the Japanese themselves and the world around
Japan are willing to accept two to three more bad years while Japan
reorients itself,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ The hottest holiday argument this weekend may be
over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day spent in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But there were Independence Days two centuries ago when the
consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed into bitter
disputes between rival political parties, exceeding even the
political passions that the early Republic displayed for the other
364 days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At a lecture this week in the National Archives, historian Len
Travers of the Massachusetts Historical Society described how the
day became ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic.
And in his book, Celebrating the Fourth (University of
Massachusetts Press, 1977), he recollects an era from the
ratification of the Constitution until the War of 1812 when, in
some cities, there was nothing nonpartisan about the Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, a fellow could be beaten for wearing the wrong
party's colors on his hat, and Boston routinely threw two separate
celebrations, each controlled by one of the two contending
political parties of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was like if today's Republicans, being the majority in
Congress, sponsored the nationally televised orchestral performance
this Saturday on the Capitol's west lawn (with pops conductor Erich
Kunzel, to be sure, plus Sha Na Na and other entertainers), while
President Clinton and the Democratic National Committee sang the
blues with Koko Taylor downtown by the Washington Monument
(supported in the parade by any marching bands that fell under
control of the commander-in-chief).
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, the parties were the Federalists, who
viewed the revolution as beginning with the Declaration of
Independence and ending neatly with the Constitution, and the
emergent Republicans, who saw a dynamic, continuing revolution and
who thrilled at its echoes in France.
</P>
<P>
   Although most American revolutionaries had hoped to avoid a
slide into partisanship, these parties, much like today's, often
sharply disagreed over economic and international policies. The
debate colored America's relations with England and France as those
foreign powers, still entrenched on the American continent, fought
for global dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston especially, these groups organized competing
celebrations, to a large degree transforming the Fourth of July
into an occasion for boisterous rallies for the party faithful,''
Travers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the rhetoric became more confrontational, July 4
sometimes carried with it an atmosphere of potential violence. By
1794, during negotiation of the Jay Treaty, which would have cast
in America's lot with Britain rather than with rival France,
something that Republicans opposed, Philadelphia's celebrations
verged on mayhem. But marching Republican tradesmen ultimately
retreated rather than fight the fully armed Federalist cavalry that
mobilized to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Boston was edgy, as crowds ransacked a British
vessel in the harbor two weeks before the Fourth. Had news of the
terms of the Jay Treaty not been delayed until July 6, Travers
wrote, bloodshed might not have been avoided there in 1795.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, symbols and sometimes fists went on for years.
One year, a Boston merchant with Federalist sympathies roughed up a
French diplomat who wore a tricolor cockade on his hat. The scrap
of cloth was a provocative political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   According to Travers, the very idea of making the Fourth a
holiday took hold in part because the political parties wanted more
people at liberty to attend the contending rallies.
</P>
<P>
   By 1800, the year of Thomas Jefferson's election to the
presidency, the Federalists were in disarray, but they still
controlled Boston's city government and the city's official
celebrations. By 1802, the Republicans were mounting regular
counter-celebrations and the competition persisted for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Federalist oratory reverberated in the Old South Meeting House;
the Republicans, not to be outdone, held their events at Faneuil
Hall, complete with Republican militia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1806, after the Republicans trounced the Federalists in
statewide elections, Boston's Federalist selectmen took revenge on
the victors with the news that Faneuil Hall was ``preengaged by the
federalists'' for Independence Day that year and the next year and
every year after. Driven out of Boston, the Republicans crossed the
Charles River and celebrated thereafter on Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the War of 1812, and the peace of 1815, did the
political winds shift enough to abate this partisanship. From then
on, Independence Day was mainly a nationalist event, Travers says.
</P>
<P>
   But he told his audience to listen carefully and think hard
about what modern Democrats and Republicans _ or for that matter,
speakers from third parties _ might say through the smoke of
Saturday's supposedly neutral barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-partisan was always the ideal,'' he told his audience
today. ``However, the subtext was often partisan, and I submit that
it often is, even today. Rituals have a purpose.''

   Why's everybody so down on the Internet? Sure, it's a refuge for
conspiracy theorists, bigots and perverts, but look at the bright
side: It also preoccupies jokesters and assorted knuckleheads with
entirely too much time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone's laughing. Consider Nike. After some
wisenheimer put out a false rumor on the Net this year, the
credulous sent the company's factory in Wilsonville, Ore., their
stinky old sneakers by the thousands in the expectation that they
would be redeemed for spiffy new athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And how'd you like to be answering the phones over at Gerber?
Contrary to another widely circulated Net rumor, the baby food
company is not _ repeat, not _ required to give every child born
between 1985 and 1997 a $500 savings bond as a result of a
class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to trace the source of such mischief as it
hurtles about via e-mail and group mailing lists. And who knows?
Some of the word-of-modem could actually be true. Or partly true.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. On the Internet, truth needn't take precedence over
humor. Examples (one factual) follow.

   Professor Miller: Today we will experiment with a new form
called the tandem story. The process is simple. Each person will
pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right. One
of you will then write the first paragraph of a short story. The
partner will read the first paragraph and then add another
paragraph to the story. The first person will then add a third
paragraph, and so on back and forth. Remember to read what has been
written each time in order to keep the story coherent. The story is
over when both agree a conclusion has been reached.

   At first, Laurie couldn't decide which kind of tea she wanted.
The chamomile, which used to be her favorite for lazy evenings at
home, now reminded her too much of Carl, who once said, in happier
times, that he liked chamomile. But she felt she must now, at all
costs, keep her mind off Carl. His possessiveness was suffocating,
and if she thought about him too much her asthma started acting up
again. So chamomile was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Advance Sergeant Carl Harris, leader of the attack
squadron now in orbit over Skylon 4, had more important things to
think about than the neuroses of an air-headed asthmatic bimbo
named Laurie with whom he had spent one sweaty night over a year
ago. ``A.S. Harris to Geostation 17,'' he said into his
transgalactic communicator. ``Polar orbit established. No sign of
resistance so far . . .'' But before he could sign off, a bluish
particle beam flashed out of nowhere and blasted a hole through his
ship's cargo bay. The jolt from the direct hit sent him flying out
of his seat and across the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   He bumped his head and died almost immediately, but not before
he felt one last pang of regret for psychotically brutalizing the
one woman who had ever had feelings for him. Soon afterwards, Earth
stopped its pointless hostilities towards the peaceful farmers of
Skylon 4. ``Congress Passes Law Permanently Abolishing War and
Space Travel,'' Laurie read in her newspaper one morning. The news
simultaneously excited her and bored her. She stared out the
window, dreaming of her youth. . . . ``Why must one lose one's
innocence to become a woman?'' she pondered wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   Little did she know, but she had less than 10 seconds to live.
Thousands of miles above the city, the Anu'udrian mothership
launched the first of its lithium fusion missiles. The dim-witted,
wimpy peaceniks who pushed the unilateral Aerospace Disarmament
Treaty through Congress had left Earth a defenseless target for the
hostile alien empires who were determined to destroy the human
race. Within two hours after the passage of the treaty, the
Anu'udrian ships were on course for Earth, carrying enough
firepower to pulverize the entire planet. With no one to stop them,
they swiftly initiated their diabolical plan. The lithium fusion
missile entered the atmosphere unimpeded. The President, in his
top-secret mobile submarine headquarters on the ocean floor off the
coast of Guam, felt the inconceivably massive explosion which
vaporized Laurie and 85 million other Americans. The president
slammed his fist on the conference table. ``We can't allow this! .
. . Let's blow 'em out of the sky!''

</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. DeVries:
</P>
<P>
   It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental
Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the
above referenced parcel of property. You have been certified as the
legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following
unauthorized activity:
</P>
<P>
   Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the
outlet stream of Spring Pond. A permit must be issued prior to the
start of this type of activity. A review of the Department's files
shows that no permits have been issued. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams
partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris and
flooding at downstream locations. . . . The Department therefore
orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this
location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   David L. Price

</P>
<P>
   &UR; The reply: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Price:
</P>
<P>
   Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to
respond to. . . . Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner
and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan. I am the legal
owner and a couple of beavers are in the (state-unauthorized)
process of constructing and maintaining two wood ``debris'' dams
across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for
nor authorize their dam project, I think they would be highly
offended to hear you call their skillful use of natural building
materials ``debris.''
</P>
<P>
   I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam
project. . . . I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you
could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their
dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination
and/or their dam work ethic. As to your dam request _ the beavers
first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of
dam activity _ my first dam question to you is: are you trying to
discriminate against my Spring Pond beavers or do you require all
dam beavers throughout this state to conform to said dam request? .
. .
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam
debris jams by interfering with these dam builders. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam
policy _ or once again both I and the Spring Pond beavers will
scream prejudice!

</P>

<P>
   A 40-year-old woman struggling to conceive a baby is told by her
doctor that the quality of her eggs is poor and the lining of her
uterus doesn't replenish itself well enough to sustain a pregnancy.
Is she fairly average, or is she disabled?
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last month that reproduction was a
``major life activity'' and that when a person's ability to
reproduce is substantially limited she (or he) meets the definition
of disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Bragdon vs. Abbott, actually had little to do with
infertility; it centered on a dentist's refusal to treat a woman
who was infected with the virus that causes AIDS. She was not
infertile, but had decided to forego childbearing because of the
danger of passing on the virus. So her reproduction was effectively
impaired, the court said, and she qualified for protection under
the act.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the infertile seized on the decision as a victory
for all people whose ability to procreate is impaired. It is the
legal wedge they need, they said, to win broader insurance coverage
for infertility treatments and to force employers to adjust work
schedules to accommodate the treatments.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say it is by no means certain that the courts will
make that conceptual leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a really strong tool for us,'' said Diane
Wachenhein, government affairs director for Resolve, a national
infertility advocacy organization. The treatments can be ``very
time consuming and debilitating,'' she said, adding that insurance
companies and employers often view them as elective and do not
cover them.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, several health-law experts said, is more likely to
prod employers to give employees time to undergo infertility
treatments than it is to push them to expand insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston
University's School of Public Health, said the case would force
businesses to accommodate the treatment schedules of infertile
people just as they now accommodate women who are pregnant or
recovering from childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance is another matter, he said, adding that the
disabilities act is not meant to create new rights. ``It provides
that you cannot be discriminated against,'' Annas said. ``Doctors
are not obliged to care for any disability for nothing, insurers
are not required to cover all disabilities for no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in terms of the new reproductive technology and what
businesses will have to cover, this ruling doesn't say anything. In
fact, it assumes that reproduction occurs the traditional way: a
man and a woman having sex and a woman giving birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with this case now part of the legal arsenal, experts
said many businesses might try to find a way to accommodate
infertile employees in order to avoid expensive, protracted
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Chicago agreed to cover infertility
treatments for its employees and to pay $1.5 million worth of
claims that had been denied over the previous 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement came after a judge ruled that infertility was a
disability under federal law. The case was brought by a Chicago
police officer, Anita Bielicki, who paid thousands of dollars for
infertility treatments that resulted in the births of two children.
Illinois is one of only a few states that mandate coverage of
infertility treatments, but because the City of Chicago was
self-insured, under federal law it is exempt from the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly and rightfully the Abbott case gives litigants a first
step,'' said Wendy Parmett, a professor specializing in health and
disability law at Northeastern University Law School who, with
Bennett Klein, represented Ms. Abbott in the Supreme Court case.
``And I do believe that many insurers' refusal to cover these
treatments, or setting caps on treatment, violates the letter and
spirit of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, legal hurdles remain.
</P>
<P>
   One key question is whether all infertility is an impairment
that is covered by the disabilities act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone whose fertility is impaired and is seeking
treatment falls within the parameter of this law,'' Ms. Parmett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unanswered questions, Ms. Parmett said, is whether
women in or near menopause should be considered disabled. ``The
term infertile is very broadly encompassing, but the ramifications
of this finding may not be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Annas suggests that one way to distinguish the disabled
infertile (for example, women in their 20's, or those whose ovaries
were removed because of cancer or other diseases) from those who
are infertile because of their age would be to create statistical
probability charts for becoming pregnant without assistance for
every age.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more than half the people at your age can't have a baby
without help,'' he said, ``then it's not a disability. It's the
norm.''

DISHWASHING THOSE BLUES AWAY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE SUNDAY JULY 5)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I am not a religious man, but I have a ritual that I
perform every day: I wash my breakfast bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem like much, especially in this age of dishwashing
machines and takeout food on paper plates, but my ritual has a long
and meaningful history.
</P>
<P>
   There was a year in my life when I didn't have a job. I lived
with friends in North Carolina and did their cooking and cleaning.
Every morning, after breakfast, I washed all the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   To others, dishwashing may seem a boring chore, but to me, it
was a time to regain contact with the eons. I could stand at the
sink with my hands in the steamy suds and stare out the kitchen
window at the leaves blown from their trees.
</P>
<P>
   I stared out the window as I worked, mentally walking down the
path behind the house past the tin-roof barn and the wide rolling
field where old Mr. Price grew beans and tobacco. On the far side,
there was a brook that meandered into a small ravine about a dozen
feet deep, wet on its north, sunless side, and dry on the south.
</P>
<P>
   And across the granite that forms the streambed as it cascades
through this ravine was a long white stripe of quartz, an igneous
dike where molten lava once inched up a joint in the surrounding
rock and cooled into quartz bright and shiny against the black of
the basalt streambed.
</P>
<P>
   And standing at the sink with my hands glossy with detergent, I
could travel upstream into myself the same way, finding,
eventually, the glistening evidence of my own deepest thoughts:
people I had long forgotten, places I hadn't remembered being,
songs I had sung with my grandmother, and sometimes even peace.
</P>
<P>
   And so I rinsed the hot soap from a dish with scalding water and
left it in the drain rack. I reached for the next dish and I
thought about other times I have washed dishes.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled the night my son was born. I had been at the hospital
for his birth, in the delivery room as he entered the world
screaming and miry. After I had taken the usual photos and Annie
went back to her room for some well-deserved sleep and the kid was
cleaned off and sent to the nursery, I drove home and found a
kitchen full of dishes, greasy and smeared, waiting to be cleaned.
Annie had been in labor almost two days and, though I had been with
her through most of it, I also had gone home periodically for
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Those dishes and the ones left over from the dinner at which she
started feeling her contractions were scattered all over the house.
I filled the sink with hot water and divided up the dishes from the
pots and set the plates and silverware into the sink to soak. Steam
rose from the suds.
</P>
<P>
   I remember that night; I was in knots, loaded with the new
responsibility of a child and desperate with the empty feeling that
my wife and I no longer could live together. I stuck my arm into
the water and my guts began to relax.
</P>
<P>
   I rinsed the first plate and my mind went blank _ the blankness
of meditation. My belly loosened and my teeth, which had been
gnashing through the nights as I slept for months, relaxed. I
rinsed the next plate, and it clicked against the first as I
settled it in the drain rack. Soothing.
</P>
<P>
   My problems were not solved, but I could look at the dilemmas I
faced without the desperation I had been feeling. My frenzy abated.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashing became my mantra.
</P>
<P>
   I recall camping with the redhead who succeeded my wife. We were
staying in an abandoned farmhouse in a hidden valley of the Blue
Ridge. Looking out over the balustrade, we saw the cliff across the
glade, the rocky stream that poured down the valley bottom, the
second growth in the old farm fields, millions of black-eyed Susans
swaying in the breeze. As the sun dropped behind the cliff, I took
our supper dishes down to the stream and washed them, scouring them
with sand from the creek bottom and rinsing them in the icy water.
Billions of fireflies made Fourth of July for us. I left the cold
dishes on a large rock to dry overnight.
</P>
<P>
   I recall once seeing a twisting globe of blackbirds rise from
the trees and stretch out like the Milky Way across the sky.
Hundreds of thousands of birds roosting took flight and spanned the
evening sky. I dipped the last pan into the darkened suds and
scrubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   When the student asked Zen master Chao-Chou for instruction, the
sage answered, ``Wash your bowl.'' All philosophies else try to
figure out logical ultimates, leaving us, at the end, only a
useless ash.
</P>
<P>
   No matter if Plato be right, or Whitehead, or Sartre, the one
action that we all share is ``washing our bowl.'' No matter if
everything Wittgenstein ever wrote is absolutely true, we must act
as if he never wrote anything. We still must wash our bowls. If
everything is explained, nothing is explained, and we are back on
square one. Better to wash your bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So, as I wiped the final grease from the stove top and wiped
down the counters and cutting board, I replaced the salt and pepper
in the middle of the table and wiped off the tabletop.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained was to rinse the dishrag and dump the greasy
suds down the drain, setting the washbasin out to dry. That
completed, I dried my hands on a fresh towel and began on one of
the day's other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Once, long ago, when I visited a friend, Judy Crawford, at her
mountain house up near the Plott Balsam mountains of North
Carolina, I cooked her a giant meal of coq au vin and I made French
bread. We had several friends over and feasted, making such a pile
of greasy dishes that we all agreed to let the mess sit overnight.
``I can't look at the kitchen tonight,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   I woke early the next morning and dressed and went downstairs to
the kitchen. It was a little after 6, and the sun was hours from
rising over the first peak. I filled the sink and started the
dishes. Boonie, her cat, crawled around my ankle, looking up at me,
squealing for milk. A few robins and a bluebird were scratching at
the ground outside the kitchen window. It was quiet _ calm and
silent. I finished every last dish before Crawford woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golly. You didn't have to do that,'' she said when she saw her
shining kitchen. No, I didn't have to, but I enjoyed it. I was at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what we do in our lives is frivolous _ watching TV,
fixing the car, reading books, waiting for the bus _ but the
washing of dishes is important: It is necessary. And it is
something humans have been doing since before the days when Abraham
lived in Ur. Washing dishes is part of being human. &QL;

<P>
   In the heart of the Serbian province of Kosovo, not so far from
Albania and pretty close to Macedonia, lies a hamlet called Kijevo.
Like other settlements in the area, it was a place where men spent
hours watching the traffic between Pristina and Pec while they
sipped coffee from little cups and ate sausages and yellow peppers.
Nearby, goats chewed the grass along the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a very dramatic place, which is why the pronouncement
last week from Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. diplomat who brought the
fragile peace to Bosnia, was so jarring: ``The most dangerous place
in Europe,'' Holbrooke called it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, two dozen Yugoslav policemen and 220 Serbian civilians were
besieged by Albanian rebels there, and the standoff was clearly
incendiary _ as is the larger conflict between the authorities in
Belgrade and the overwhelmingly Albanian population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it is not hard to envision how loss of Serbian life
in Kijevo might spur a punitive expedition by Yugoslav forces, an
intensification of guerrilla warfare and perhaps terrorism by
Albanians. And once fully ignited, violence in Kosovo, where two
million people live, could well grow into prolonged fighting as
devastating as that which shattered adjoining Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dangerous place in Europe? What could Holbrooke
have been thinking?
</P>
<P>
   There was a suggestion in his comments that the dangers now
focused in Kijevo were so broad in scope that Americans should take
a break from the indulgence of prosperity and the joys of
interleague baseball to pay attention to this peculiar corner of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Absurd as it seemed, tiny Kijevo was being portrayed as a
tinderbox that could inflame all Kosovo, and Kosovo was being cast
as the tinderbox that could bring fire and sword to the entire
Balkans. And this, the implication went, could endanger European
peace and accelerate a clash of religiously defined civilizations
that was predicted in the early 1990s by the Harvard political
scientist Samuel Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there was a hint that world order and stability
might be imperiled by this standoff between Albanians and Serbs in
a global backwater. That may appear preposterous to Americans,
particularly those who saw the film ``Wag the Dog'' and watched as
a fictitious U.S. president engineered a fictitious war with
Albania to divert attention from his personal woes. But, in fact,
there is logic, and plenty of history, behind the notion, which
serious analysts have been developing now for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The first link in the chain of events leading to widening
prospects of disorder is usually rendered as the speech by Serbian
leader Slobodan Milosevic in 1987, when he set Yugoslavia on the
path to its wars of dismemberment by urging the tiny minority of
Serbs in Kosovo to claim it as their own land, vital to their
history. According to the gloomiest analysts, the following events
are likely to flow from any full-scale war in which Kosovo's
Albanians, deprived of autonomy, now fight for independence:
</P>
<P>
   The first impact would be felt by Bosnia. Faced with the
possible loss of Kosovo, Serbia would be tempted to absorb the
Serbian entity within Bosnia, which is now an extremely fragile
balance of two ethnic units _ a Serb republic and a Bosnian-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bosnia's Serbs left, Bosnia's Croats would presumably not
be far behind, taking their own lands and joining them to Croatia.
That would leave just a sliver of a state, mostly Muslim, in
Bosnia, and it would presumably have no place to look for support
but to the primarily Muslim Albanians and Turks, and to the Islamic
world in general.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if the Albanian rebels in Kosovo gained independence,
or even if they sustained their resistance, there would be great
consequences for all Albanians beyond Kosovo. In Albania, there
would certainly be strong impulses to help embattled ethnic kin.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is poor, divided and weak, but with its mountains and
long seacoast it has a long tradition of moving contraband. So the
involvement of Islamic forces in Kosovo would not be inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, too, has a large Albanian minority and, as in Kosovo
and Albania, the Albanians there have had one of the highest birth
rates in Europe. This has brought a demographic upsurge, and with
it a national awakening. In multi-ethnic Macedonia, the Albanians
have clamored for a university of their own and greater guarantees
of language rights. An impulse toward a greater Albania, uniting
the lands where Albanians live, would intensify in the event of an
independence struggle in Kosovo. Macedonia might even break up.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario could lead to a long-feared general Balkan war,
recalling the two Balkan Wars between 1911 and 1913 that set the
stage for World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Other analytic strands of the contemporary slide into a Balkan
doomsday envision the military involvement of Greece, which does
not want a divided Macedonia on its borders, and Turkey, which has
been training Albania's army. Finding themselves on opposing sides
of a shooting war would have obviously momentous consequences for
Greece and Turkey. The next domino, in this line of thinking, is
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Further compounding the dangers is the perceived role of
religious blocs in the unfolding tensions. In a controversial book,
``The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1996), Huntington forecast a world in which
religiously based divisions would become the fault lines of new
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Since most Albanians are Muslim, those hostile or suspicious of
them have tended to think of them and portray them as Islamic, even
though there are Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Albanians,
too. At the same time, the largely Orthodox Russians have
gravitated toward traditional support for their fellow Orthodox
Serbs. On the other side, the growing alliance of Turks and
Albanians also at some level reflects the coming together of
coreligionists.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the claim that a small town in the middle of
Kosovo that hardly anybody had ever heard of was the most dangerous
place in Europe _ more dangerous than Belfast, more dangerous than
Chernobyl, more dangerous than Moscow or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Absurd? Probably. Unrealistic? Not at all.

DISHWASHING THOSE BLUES AWAY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE SUNDAY JULY 5)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I am not a religious man, but I have a ritual that I
perform every day: I wash my breakfast bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem like much, especially in this age of dishwashing
machines and takeout food on paper plates, but my ritual has a long
and meaningful history.
</P>
<P>
   There was a year in my life when I didn't have a job. I lived
with friends in North Carolina and did their cooking and cleaning.
Every morning, after breakfast, I washed all the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   To others, dishwashing may seem a boring chore, but to me, it
was a time to regain contact with the eons. I could stand at the
sink with my hands in the steamy suds and stare out the kitchen
window at the leaves blown from their trees.
</P>
<P>
   I stared out the window as I worked, mentally walking down the
path behind the house past the tin-roof barn and the wide rolling
field where old Mr. Price grew beans and tobacco. On the far side,
there was a brook that meandered into a small ravine about a dozen
feet deep, wet on its north, sunless side, and dry on the south.
</P>
<P>
   And across the granite that forms the streambed as it cascades
through this ravine was a long white stripe of quartz, an igneous
dike where molten lava once inched up a joint in the surrounding
rock and cooled into quartz bright and shiny against the black of
the basalt streambed.
</P>
<P>
   And standing at the sink with my hands glossy with detergent, I
could travel upstream into myself the same way, finding,
eventually, the glistening evidence of my own deepest thoughts:
people I had long forgotten, places I hadn't remembered being,
songs I had sung with my grandmother, and sometimes even peace.
</P>
<P>
   And so I rinsed the hot soap from a dish with scalding water and
left it in the drain rack. I reached for the next dish and I
thought about other times I have washed dishes.
</P>
<P>
   I recalled the night my son was born. I had been at the hospital
for his birth, in the delivery room as he entered the world
screaming and miry. After I had taken the usual photos and Annie
went back to her room for some well-deserved sleep and the kid was
cleaned off and sent to the nursery, I drove home and found a
kitchen full of dishes, greasy and smeared, waiting to be cleaned.
Annie had been in labor almost two days and, though I had been with
her through most of it, I also had gone home periodically for
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Those dishes and the ones left over from the dinner at which she
started feeling her contractions were scattered all over the house.
I filled the sink with hot water and divided up the dishes from the
pots and set the plates and silverware into the sink to soak. Steam
rose from the suds.
</P>
<P>
   I remember that night; I was in knots, loaded with the new
responsibility of a child and desperate with the empty feeling that
my wife and I no longer could live together. I stuck my arm into
the water and my guts began to relax.
</P>
<P>
   I rinsed the first plate and my mind went blank _ the blankness
of meditation. My belly loosened and my teeth, which had been
gnashing through the nights as I slept for months, relaxed. I
rinsed the next plate, and it clicked against the first as I
settled it in the drain rack. Soothing.
</P>
<P>
   My problems were not solved, but I could look at the dilemmas I
faced without the desperation I had been feeling. My frenzy abated.
</P>
<P>
   Dishwashing became my mantra.
</P>
<P>
   I recall camping with the redhead who succeeded my wife. We were
staying in an abandoned farmhouse in a hidden valley of the Blue
Ridge. Looking out over the balustrade, we saw the cliff across the
glade, the rocky stream that poured down the valley bottom, the
second growth in the old farm fields, millions of black-eyed Susans
swaying in the breeze. As the sun dropped behind the cliff, I took
our supper dishes down to the stream and washed them, scouring them
with sand from the creek bottom and rinsing them in the icy water.
Billions of fireflies made Fourth of July for us. I left the cold
dishes on a large rock to dry overnight.
</P>
<P>
   I recall once seeing a twisting globe of blackbirds rise from
the trees and stretch out like the Milky Way across the sky.
Hundreds of thousands of birds roosting took flight and spanned the
evening sky. I dipped the last pan into the darkened suds and
scrubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   When the student asked Zen master Chao-Chou for instruction, the
sage answered, ``Wash your bowl.'' All philosophies else try to
figure out logical ultimates, leaving us, at the end, only a
useless ash.
</P>
<P>
   No matter if Plato be right, or Whitehead, or Sartre, the one
action that we all share is ``washing our bowl.'' No matter if
everything Wittgenstein ever wrote is absolutely true, we must act
as if he never wrote anything. We still must wash our bowls. If
everything is explained, nothing is explained, and we are back on
square one. Better to wash your bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So, as I wiped the final grease from the stove top and wiped
down the counters and cutting board, I replaced the salt and pepper
in the middle of the table and wiped off the tabletop.
</P>
<P>
   All that remained was to rinse the dishrag and dump the greasy
suds down the drain, setting the washbasin out to dry. That
completed, I dried my hands on a fresh towel and began on one of
the day's other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Once, long ago, when I visited a friend, Judy Crawford, at her
mountain house up near the Plott Balsam mountains of North
Carolina, I cooked her a giant meal of coq au vin and I made French
bread. We had several friends over and feasted, making such a pile
of greasy dishes that we all agreed to let the mess sit overnight.
``I can't look at the kitchen tonight,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   I woke early the next morning and dressed and went downstairs to
the kitchen. It was a little after 6, and the sun was hours from
rising over the first peak. I filled the sink and started the
dishes. Boonie, her cat, crawled around my ankle, looking up at me,
squealing for milk. A few robins and a bluebird were scratching at
the ground outside the kitchen window. It was quiet _ calm and
silent. I finished every last dish before Crawford woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golly. You didn't have to do that,'' she said when she saw her
shining kitchen. No, I didn't have to, but I enjoyed it. I was at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what we do in our lives is frivolous _ watching TV,
fixing the car, reading books, waiting for the bus _ but the
washing of dishes is important: It is necessary. And it is
something humans have been doing since before the days when Abraham
lived in Ur. Washing dishes is part of being human. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A monopolist is big and bad. He has the muscle to dictate prices
and bully competitors and consumers, both of whom are powerless to
resist the monopolist's will.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Microsoft Corp., accused by the government of being a
monopolist, and its new computer operating system, Windows 98,
which will play a starring role in the monopoly case that the
Justice Department will present to a federal judge in September.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 went on sale 10 days ago and, according to PC Data, a
market research firm, the early results are quite respectable _
about the same as the first days of sales for its predecessor,
Windows 95. Still, since there are now about 300 million machines
running earlier versions of Windows _ more than twice the number
when Windows 95 was introduced _ the early sales are not a runaway
success.
</P>
<P>
   Monopolist perhaps, but Microsoft cannot utterly control the
pace at which its new products are accepted in the marketplace.
There are many stragglers in the Microsoft-led march of technology.
The company's biggest competitor is often itself, as consumers keep
using old Microsoft products instead of adopting the new ones _ a
phenomenon that curbs the company's freedom to raise prices, oddly
becoming one line of defense in the monopoly case.
</P>
<P>
   Industry predictions of how well Windows 98 will sell vary. But
most analysts expect that the number of people who will spend $89
to put Windows 98 on their old machines _ called the upgrade
market, as opposed to new machines that will have Windows 98
already installed _ to be roughly 40 percent below the level for
Windows 95, comparing both products in their first year.
</P>
<P>
   Eying such numbers, some analysts say they see little evidence
that Microsoft looks, walks or quacks like a monopoly. ``Look at
those low upgrade percentages,'' said Robert Levy, a senior fellow
at the libertarian Cato Institute, ``and it hardly demonstrates
coercive monopoly power, which is what the antitrust laws are
concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government is to win its antitrust suit, it must convince
the courts that Microsoft is indeed a monopoly and that the company
has abused its monopoly power to stifle competition. ``The
government could lose this case on the monopoly power issue
alone,'' said Charles Rule, a former head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, who is an adviser to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Market share, pricing power and the ability to restrict
competition are three key factors the courts typically take into
account in determining whether a company has the market muscle of a
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that even though it holds about 90 percent of
the market for personal computer operating systems _ the software
equivalent of a machine's central nervous system _ it faces
competition on every front. Its rivals range from other operating
systems, like Apple's Macintosh and Linux, which is distributed
free on the Internet, to other software products that seek to
undermine the central role of Windows in computing _ like
Netscape's program for browsing the World Wide Web and Sun's Java,
an Internet programming language.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft regards itself as constantly under assault and any
position of market strength to be fleeting, as Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in
March. ``The fact that we have kept our prices very low, about 3
percent of the price of a PC, is because of the competition,''
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   The price-restraining competition comes not only from outside
rivals but also from within. Windows 95 is the most popular desktop
operating system in use today, but only by a slight margin over
older versions of Windows. By the end of 1997, according to
Dataquest, a market research firm, Windows 95 was in use on 145
million machines worldwide while 140 million machines were running
versions of the earlier Windows 3 _ mainly 3.0 introduced in 1990,
and 3.1 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to convince a large share of computer users to buy its
more recent operating systems, Microsoft thus loses sales of both
newer versions of Windows and its newer software applications from
word processors to games, which are tailored to run on Windows 95
and now Windows 98. ``The slow move from the Windows 3.x family is
perhaps the biggest thorn in Microsoft's side,'' said Chris LeTocq,
an analyst at Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   If the company raised the price of Windows to consumers, even
fewer computer users would upgrade their machines. ``Microsoft is
in essence competing with itself, and that inhibits its ability to
raise prices,'' noted Rule, the Microsoft adviser.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many students of modern software markets say the
company protests too much. Microsoft, they say, may not resemble an
old-style monopolist, but it is a high-tech model of the same
species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has a huge market share, it can push people around,
it enjoys monopolistic profits and venture capitalists will not
invest in an area that Microsoft is in _ all those things speak to
its dominant market position and its market power,'' said Steven
Salop, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. ``I
don't think the Justice Department is going to have any trouble
proving Microsoft is a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, it seems, share that view. When asked if they
thought Microsoft was a monopoly or not, 53 percent of those
surveyed in a New York Times/CBS poll last month replied that
Microsoft was a monopoly, while 30 percent said it was not.

<P>
   In 1888 a U.S. diplomat-turned-adventurer named William
Woodville Rockhill set out to explore Tibet, a territory he
described in his journal as ``a very imperfectly known portion of
the Chinese Empire.'' It still is.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin engaged
in a public exchange on the subject last week, they spoke for two
diametrically opposed lobbies. One, drawing on a largely Western
vision of Tibet, sees a Himalayan Shangri-la waiting to be freed
from beneath the Chinese boot. The other imagines a territory
rescued from a dark and brutal theocracy by a modernizing
government in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither perception, most scholars say, accurately reflects the
unique culture that flourished, and still struggles to survive, on
the high-altitude Tibetan plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet, a nation that produced one of the world's great medieval
empires, striking fear in enemies from Central Asia to the heart of
China in the eighth century, did not later develop into a modern,
ultimately industrialized nation-state as its counterparts in
Europe did. Nor did it sink into the long decline of once-great
Islamic civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   It became instead a demilitarized, decentralized, isolated
country in the shadow of Mongolian and Manchu rulers but dominated
by its Buddhist monasteries and lama-kings trying to rule over a
collection of quarreling sects. Some of the more hot-headed
followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, now blame
the religious powers who disarmed the country for its weakness in
the face of Chinese might.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet had all but disappeared for a thousand years before
19th-century explorers cajoled their way to Lhasa, the capital.
Their heirs are the seekers of the late 20th century, who have
mined Tibet, or perhaps an imagined Tibet, for its nonviolence,
spirituality, meditative arts and herbal medicines. Many, spurred
by Hollywood's recent films on the subject, have found a cause in
the exiled 14th Dalai Lama, driven from his sanctuary in Lhasa by
the advancing Chinese army in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the Dalai Lama was arriving in India, another
school of thought had seized the imagination of influential
intellectuals. Promoted by Beijing and by Westerners who became
enamored of Mao Tse-tung's 1949 revolution, the new vision served
to justify the Chinese invasion of Tibet that followed by painting
the Tibetan monastic leadership as feudal, oppressive and living on
the backs of serfs.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for historical analogies, the revisionists fell back
on familiar European themes, said Christopher Beckwith of Indiana
University, a linguist and historian of Tibet and China. Friends of
China could also draw on accounts _ including Rockhill's _ of
slavery and bonded labor, of vast, corrupt monastic fiefs and
abbots who were likely to steal horses. Tibetan monasteries were
usually _ and many still are _ breathtakingly filthy, occasionally
ramshackle places where a traveler may find the iconography
fascinating but the welcome pretty thin, if not hostile, and the
monks less than industrious at any pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Tibet was no paradise, then or now,'' Beckwith said.
``But it certainly wasn't anything like the image, which was
directly taken from Western medievalist views of medieval Europe.
That's almost a classicist view: When the classical world fell,
there was darkness and barbarians crawling around on the ground
gnawing bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thurman of Columbia University, a professor and former
Buddhist monk who is considered the leading American expert on
Tibetan Buddhism, said the movement to relegate Tibet to the Dark
Ages was a byproduct of hearts broken by Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Russian writers began to write about what a monster he
was, leftist writers and journalists in the West sat down and
conspired, basically,'' he said. ``They said: `Look, the
international movement, the idealistic movement, is going to the
dogs and there is no example of any decent thing that's happened
because of socialism or communism, and Mao may be the one who is
going to do it right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Westerners who glossed over the violence perpetrated on Tibet by
the Chinese, Thurman said, also invoked anti-papal sentiments of
Northern European Protestants. ``They basically presented the
Tibetans as kind of Catholics,'' he said. ``They had red robes,
they had lush rituals. To the Protestant-minded European
population, it was perfect to align them with the corrupt Borgias _
princes of the church in all their horrible debauchery and murder
and intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic
serfdom in Tibet in centuries. The label was again a Eurocentric
one. In 1879, an Indian scholar who had spent his life in the
Himalayan area, Sarat Chandra Das, traveled to Lhasa and studied
the social order. He found no trace of bonded servitude. He
described a place (unlike caste-ridden India) where ``the rich may
bestow their daughters on the poor; the daughter of a poor man may
become the bride of the proudest noble in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Tibet's detractors operate on politically inspired myths,
the champions of Tibetan independence also have their fantasies.
The country was underdeveloped, its people often rapacious and
warlike. Tibetan Buddhism is a robust, earthy religion, far less
philosophical and pacifist than many of its Western practitioners
would like to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a Buddhist theory of war, of self-defense, and there
is also a kind of theory of surgical violence,'' Thurman said.
``The optimal, ideal thing is nonviolence. But sometimes you have
to do a little violence to prevent a larger violence. The Buddhists
have thought about this and they are not simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Buddhism has not inevitably made the societies it
dominates nonviolent. Monks in Sri Lanka have joined or supported
extreme Sinhalese nationalists who murdered thousands of ``class
enemies'' in the 1980s. Cambodia's Buddhist society produced the
Khmer Rouge. A nominally Buddhist military junta rules Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Childs, a Tibetan-speaking anthropologist who recently
spent a year living in a Tibetan Buddhist village just over the
border in Nepal, said romantics in search of otherworldliness often
failed to notice the powerful role of economics in religion among
Tibetans, who must survive a harsh environment.
</P>
<P>
   His village, 12,000 feet high on the Tibetan plateau, was
dominated by lamas _ married men, not celibate monks _ who believed
they had inherited their place in society from the last Tibetan
emperors. That gave them spiritual and social influence. But they
had turned their high prestige into economic advantage. In return
for blessing houses, families and livestock, they were repaid in
goods or labor, allowing them to prosper at the expense of their
spiritual charges.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tibet has been studied mostly by religious specialists,
Childs said, Westerners have lost the ability to look at it
pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's annoying that people want to make it into one thing or
another _ it's a Shangri-la, or it's a depraved place,'' said
Beckwith. ``It was a normal country. It was a real culture. It
still is, though unfortunately in a sad state now. It had
everything from human virtue down to the depths of depravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesang Tseten, a Tibetan writer living in Katmandu, said some
Tibetan exiles have begun to complain that the reality of their
life has been overtaken by Hollywood. ``It's true Tibet has been
imbued by Western imaginations of the subject,'' he said. ``Does
this mean we're going to be bound by how others see us?'' Not, he
said, if Tibetans themselves ``get a little real.''

WHITNEY MUSEUM CANCELS KAREN FINLEY EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Whitney Museum of American Art has canceled ``The
Great American Nude,'' an environmental exhibition featuring the
visual and performance art of Karen Finley that had been scheduled
to open in December.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made on Thursday by Willard Holmes, the
Whitney's acting director. ``It was not just a financial decision,
but finances had something to do with it,'' he said. ``We had to
reduce the amount of programming because in April we go into the
Project of America,'' a series of major shows dealing with the
history of art in the United States in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the decision had nothing to do with the content of
Ms. Finley's contribution or any other part of the exhibition. Nor,
he said, was the cancellation related to a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling last week against Ms. Finley and three other performance
artists.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the court upheld a decency test for the
awarding of federal arts grants. Artists have suggested that
institutions like galleries and theaters might use the decision as
a means to limit their artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Healy, Ms. Finley's gallery representative, said that
Adam Weinberg, the curator of the museum's permanent collection,
had told him on Wednesday that the Whitney was unable to raise the
money _ from $300,000 to $400,000 _ needed to put on the show.
</P>
<P>
   But Healy expressed surprise at the Whitney's ``insensitivity''
in deciding to cancel it. He suggested that actually ``this would
be a good time to mount an exhibition in defiance of the ruling,''
and he called the cancellation ``a little too bizarre to be a
coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the exhibition had been the idea of David Ross,
the outgoing director of the Whitney, and that Ross had been in
charge of the financing. Weinberg and Eugenie Tsai had been
scheduled to be the curators of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said that Weinberg had informed him that the museum was
preparing a letter to Ms. Finley expressing its disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of ``The Great American Nude'' exhibition would
have been Ms. Finley's ``Go Figure,'' an installation of a class in
life drawing. Continuing through museum hours, the life class would
have been led by Ms. Finley, who would herself have been one of the
artists' models.
</P>
<P>
   Any member of the public visiting the museum would have been
eligible to take part as an artist in the class and Ms. Finley
would have been available to criticize the work. This part of the
exhibition was to be a re-creation of a show that Ms. Finley had
presented last year at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the class at the Whitney would be paintings,
drawings, sculpture and photographs of nudes from the museum's
permanent collection. Ms. Finley's own paintings and drawings were
also to be displayed, possibly with works by emerging artists whose
work is not in the Whitney collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finley had also been planning a performance event to take
place during the exhibition, probably a takeoff on Marcel Duchamp's
``Nude Descending a Staircase,'' to be portrayed by the artist in a
stairway at the Whitney. Healy had been planning a concurrent
exhibition of Ms. Finley's work at his gallery, the Thomas Healy in
the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Finley has shown her paintings (of flowers as well as nudes
and other subjects) and has had art installations at various
museums and galleries around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing the way the decision was made,'' she said on
Thursday, adding that the cancellation would be extremely damaging
to her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitney is the leading museum for American art in this
country and the world,'' Ms. Finley said. ``By not having my show,
the museum is saying, `She can't be funded, and our board can't
fund her.'''
</P>
<P>
   She indicated that she believed other museums would take that as
a guideline for future exhibitions.

   SEASIDE HEIGHTS, N.J. _ Eventually, somebody is going to figure
out a way to implant advertising messages directly into the human
cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, Patrick Dori has come one small step
closer to a universe of ubiquitous advertising. He has invented a
device to print ads directly onto a beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my best idea ever _ 5,000 imprints of Skippy Peanut
Butter jars covering the beach!'' Dori crowed the other day, as the
first wave of July 4 beachgoers gawked at his brainchild: a
steamroller-like contraption, towed behind a municipal
sand-grooming tractor, that stamps a continuous four-foot-wide
strip of ads in the sand like a notary public gone berserk with his
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Dori had to yell to be heard above the shriek of sea gulls and
the lawn-mower mutter of a Piper Cub airplane drifting up the coast
towing a banner advertising a long-distance phone deal. On the
boardwalk behind him, more advertising glared like battle colors.
</P>
<P>
   Billboard advertising was invented around the turn of the
century to siphon disposable income from the masses pouring into
East Coast seashore havens like Brooklyn's Coney Island and New
Jersey's Atlantic City. (Airplane ads became popular in the 1950s.)
So perhaps it was appropriate that Dori christen his invention at
this bustling seashore town on the central New Jersey coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dori, the owner of an advertising and promotion company called
Beach'n Billboard, said the idea of building a rolling machine to
impress messages in the sand ``came to me literally in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I woke up and started drawing,'' he continued. ``Of
course, I then had to consider, who are you going to get to pay for
this?''
</P>
<P>
   After making a prototype machine, he approached Bestfoods, the
New Jersey-based food giant that owns the Skippy brand, and got a
contract. Seaside Heights was the first municipality to agree to
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now a swath of panels alternating the messages ``Skippy Peanut
Butter'' with ``Please Do Not Litter'' seem to stretch into
infinity on the town's long beach _ that is, until the crowds
trample it back into sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an opportunity to deliver a message in a way that
no one has ever done before,'' said Mike Lyon, the promotion
director for the company's grocery brands, who attended last week's
launch. ``I'm here looking at thousands of families with kids. If
they're on the beach thinking of Skippy, that's just what we
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Dori said other big commercial beach towns around the country
have expressed interest, and Lyon said Bestfoods was game for
beach-ad expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many seashore towns disdain the kind of commercialism
that runs rampant in New Jersey's boardwalk towns and other
beach-front meccas like Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Ocean City, Md. The
California Coastal Commission, for example, recently vetoed a plan
to erect so-called sun-shelter kiosks on beaches in Los Angeles
County, which would have been paid a fee for beach maintenance by a
company that planned to cover the kiosks with ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ads in the sand would seem to offer competition for airplane
banners. But the flyboys and flygirls shrugged off the new
diversion on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be competition, except that people walk all over
the ad,'' said Bob Bunting, the owner of Ocean Aerial Advertising
in Ocean City, Md., which uses about a dozen modified Piper Cub
aircraft to tow banners _ some as big as 30 feet by 100 feet _ over
seashore towns in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beach, people hear an airplane and they look up,'' he
added. ``That's what people always have done. Who looks down to see
an ad being stepped all over?''
</P>
<P>
   James Butler, vice president of Aerial Sign Co. in Hollywood,
Fla., which has 45 aircraft and books most of the big national
brand accounts that now dominate the airborne business, also
scoffed. ``You mean the sand ads aren't in color?'' he asked. ``I
was picturing something you could actually see.''
</P>
<P>
   Dori, who received a patent last week for his sand-embossing
device, takes the ribbing jovially. ``When I first told people
about this, they laughed and said I was out of my mind,'' he said.
``They aren't laughing now. I'm ready to roll.''

FUNERAL A COMPROMISE OF TRADITIONS FOR NAVAJO FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE SUNDAY JULY 5)  
 By BETTY REID  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BODAWAY, Ariz. _ The wind whipped our faces as we left my
father's grave on a ridge known to my family as ``the place where
the dirt roads go up a hill.''
</P>
<P>
   It is surrounded by holy sites: the jagged pink Echo Cliffs to
the east, the snow-capped San Francisco Peaks to the south, Blue
Tobacco Mountain ridge to the west and a gray butte called Long
Mountain to the north.
</P>
<P>
   This view belonged to my late father, Willie Reed Sr., for 69
years. He herded sheep, roamed the cliffs and prayed to the Holy
People. Now it cradles his body. He died Feb. 28, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if the dust storm erased my dad's life from
Bodaway, where he grew up a shepherd, a yei-bi-chei dancer, a
migrant worker, a railroad worker and a construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheii (grandfather) has a great view. You did the cool
thing,'' my then-11-year-old daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Navajos, I straddle two worlds, modern and
traditional. I follow the Earth-based traditional faith of Hozho, a
state of beauty and harmony. Yet Christianity has seeped into the
daily lives of my extended Navajo family.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing I had known prepared me for the conflict between the two
faiths when my father died. For four years, I've wrestled with my
feelings until I could finally write about them.
</P>
<P>
   After the phone call from a Flagstaff nursing home where my
father stayed for three years, I remember racing from Phoenix to be
with him.
</P>
<P>
   As outlines of saguaros and car lights flew by, I grieved in
darkness, my truck speeding north on Interstate 17.
</P>
<P>
   I cursed at two gods who I believed failed to help my father
ward off Parkinson's disease. While my dad's body withered over the
years, I prayed to God and the Holy People to stop the tremors,
restore his strength.
</P>
<P>
   I blamed the God I was introduced to at age 7 at Tuba City
Presbyterian Church in the mid-1960s. A Wednesday-evening Bible
teacher told me that if I didn't believe in God I would burn in a
place called hell.
</P>
<P>
   Burned into my mind are images of the Christian hell that look
like scenes from movies I watched as a child in the government-run
school. Vivid pictures of a bloody Jesus Christ splayed on the
cross gave me endless nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   My father introduced me to the Holy People, their philosophy and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   He told me my goal is to live in a state of Hozho _ a concept
that embodied beauty, stability and order within my life.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in Navajo philosophy is a laundry list of ``don'ts''
and taboos to respect. If one adheres to them, Hozho is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Navajo rules are: avoid contact with dead bodies,
don't stare straight into a person's eye, never drive away from a
coyote that crosses your path without sprinkling corn pollen in his
tracks and never say harsh words because they have the power to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   According to my father, I lived with the Holy People who show
themselves as lightning, dawn, rain, wind, snow, water and fog.
</P>
<P>
   My father breathed and lived Navajo philosophy and religion,
which he learned from Dan Long Reed, his late uncle.
</P>
<P>
   With the power of two religions on my side, how could my father
die?
</P>
<P>
   I conjured up reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I asked too much of the Christian God when I crammed for
college finals and escaped with a B instead of an F. I figured the
Presbyterian God understood college. How was I to explain English
101 to the Holy People?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe God was punishing me for holding onto my Navajo beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Holy People were punishing me because I didn't
cover my eyes quickly when I went to a bloody shooting scene while
on the police beat for ``The Phoenix Gazette'' before my father's
death. I had the radio reporter describe the scene to me while I
blocked the sight with a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was my chosen profession. I write for newspapers and
through the power of written words, have stung plenty of Navajo and
non-Indian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Recriminations and rememberances filled my thoughts as my
siblings and I sat at the table in my aunt's hogan and planned my
dad's funeral. We chose my brother William, an eloquent speaker and
a Stanford graduate, as the family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I decided that my father should be buried in
Bodaway instead of the community burial plot in Tuba City. My
father grew up among an extended family around Bodaway and raised
us east of the Grand Canyon, gnarled land covered with purple sage
and plunging canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Journeys to the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado
rivers were common for my father. He would take his soft leather
corn pollen pouch, stand at the edge of the canyon, sprinkle pollen
into the canyon and pray to the wind gods.
</P>
<P>
   The idealist in me also asked that we bury him next to his
uncle, Dan Long Reed. My father buried him in the crevice of a rock
in the 1940s without much fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The others agreed. We would bury my father next to his uncle.
The task involved cracking a hole in granite using a jack hammer,
shovel and pick.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, two people quietly wrapped the body in
sheepskin, placed it in a rock crevice, isolated themselves for
four days and cleansed themselves during a purification ceremony.
The site was never revisited.
</P>
<P>
   The belief is that a corpse taints the living and has the power
to inflict physical and emotional pain. But modern ways are
changing Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1800s, missionaries &UR; and schools have converted
hordes of Navajos to Christianity. Many Navajos tossed aside their
beliefs in the Holy People and taboos about the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believed that Jesus was the answer because
Christianity wasn't as scary as Navajo religion. Attending church
also wasn't as expensive as the Navajo ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Night Way Chant, a curing ceremony, can cost as
much as $700 for food, supplies and help.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Navajo funerals are places where hundreds of family
members and friends gather to mourn the dead. It is usually
followed by a Christian burial outfitted with a priest, a church
choir and a eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that has rubbed off on my family.
</P>
<P>
   My sister suggested spending $2,000 for a top-of-the-line
casket. I shuddered, thinking of the mortician's promise that it
would preserve my dad's body for years.
</P>
<P>
   William and I argued it would be better if he returned to the
earth as quickly as possible. She agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A simple wood casket would do.
</P>
<P>
   We took the semitraditional burial plan to my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about a eulogy and a prayer?'' she bluntly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer?'' I asked, throwing a glance at my brother.
</P>
<P>
   My father believed in the Holy People and never saw the inside
of a church.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt my dad would recognize God. Besides, God might toss him
out of the heavens for dancing the yei-bi-chei dance, a curing
ritual to Navajos but ``heathen's ceremony'' to the church that
taught me about God.
</P>
<P>
   But my mother, rooted in traditional ways for most of her life,
has seen many Navajo Christian funerals. A prayer and eulogy were
now part of the culture in which she lived, while my brother and I
clung to what we considered sacred ways.
</P>
<P>
   By then the fight was worn out of me. Mother would have her way.
</P>
<P>
   We took the burial proposal to the extended family of Manygoats,
Bitter Water and Deer Water clans, again at my aunt's hogan. We
heard grumbling among our army of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my Christian Navajo relatives protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You forgot God in all of this,'' said my uncle's wife, glaring
at us. ``Your father deserves a Christian burial. While you were
away at college, I prayed for him once at sheep camp. I ordered him
to run around the hogan and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   She claimed God had miraculously healed his body. ``He did take
God to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone mumbled in Navajo that we forgot to include my aunts and
uncles when we were making burial plans.
</P>
<P>
   William and I glanced at my mother.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, a petite shepherd in a velveteen shirt and a calico
skirt, stood. I had seen her cry only once, after my father took
his last breath at the nursing home. Tears rolling down her brown
cheeks, she told my brothers and me not to weep because my father
raised us well.
</P>
<P>
   My mother also turned to my sobbing daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know much about death,'' she said. ``Your heart is
young. Learn how to be strong, carry a vision. Look at the world as
though you were looking, not one butte away, but 10 buttes away.
Those are your grandfather's words.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, my mother stood before the crowd of relatives, tears on her
cheeks, and asked the Christian faction to remember tradition and
respect first word.
</P>
<P>
   In the Navajo creation story, when First Man and First Woman
spoke, their words carried out plans and forbid change. First word
was so powerful, as my dad told me, that it created Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children spoke first word,'' my mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Our Christian relatives calmed down. Although many are Christian
converts, many cling to or respect the old faith.
</P>
<P>
   Before my Christian relatives spoke, my brother quickly offered
a game plan to the group.
</P>
<P>
   We compromised.
</P>
<P>
   On the Navajo reservation, there is a third religious group
called the Native American Church, a group that blends Christian
and Navajo beliefs. Peyote is used as a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, my mother sought comfort within that faith and had
a relative in the church.
</P>
<P>
   He blended Navajo and Christian prayer at my father's panoramic
grave site. As my father's body was lowered into granite near the
spot my clan knows as ``the place where the dirt roads go up a
hill,'' I thanked him for giving me strength and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I'll wake up at dawn in Phoenix and say a prayer to the
Dawn People. Although I can't see the twilight made of dawn and the
hissing freeway silences prayers, in my idealistic mind I envision
my father sitting on that ridge with his uncle, Dan Long Reed.
</P>
<P>
   They are creating new Navajo songs. &QL;

frugal travelers, east Asia is now more accessible than ever.
Tumbling currencies due to Asia's economic woes have resulted in
deep discounts on airfares, hotel rooms and package tours. With
intra-Asian travel at a near halt, airlines and tour operators are

at Mexico's beautiful Quintana Roo coastline _ called Xcacel and
considered one of most important turtle nesting grounds in the

poachers. But soon, they fear, their work will be obliterated. The
state government has quietly sold much of Xcacel to resort hotel
developers, despite a covenant that was signed to protect it and
years of effort to have it declared a federal reserve. Soon, the
turtles could be greeted by as many as 1,500 hotel rooms jammed
onto the small beach, producing glaring lights that would drive the
turtles away. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS. MOVED

FUNERAL A COMPROMISE OF TRADITIONS FOR NAVAJO FAMILY

   BODAWAY, Ariz. _ The wind whipped our faces as we left my
father's grave on a ridge known to my family as ``the place where
the dirt roads go up a hill.''
</P>
<P>
   It is surrounded by holy sites: the jagged pink Echo Cliffs to
the east, the snow-capped San Francisco Peaks to the south, Blue
Tobacco Mountain ridge to the west and a gray butte called Long
Mountain to the north.
</P>
<P>
   This view belonged to my late father, Willie Reed Sr., for 69
years. He herded sheep, roamed the cliffs and prayed to the Holy
People. Now it cradles his body. He died Feb. 28, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if the dust storm erased my dad's life from
Bodaway, where he grew up a shepherd, a yei-bi-chei dancer, a
migrant worker, a railroad worker and a construction worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheii (grandfather) has a great view. You did the cool
thing,'' my then-11-year-old daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Navajos, I straddle two worlds, modern and
traditional. I follow the Earth-based traditional faith of Hozho, a
state of beauty and harmony. Yet Christianity has seeped into the
daily lives of my extended Navajo family.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing I had known prepared me for the conflict between the two
faiths when my father died. For four years, I've wrestled with my
feelings until I could finally write about them.
</P>
<P>
   After the phone call from a Flagstaff nursing home where my
father stayed for three years, I remember racing from Phoenix to be
with him.
</P>
<P>
   As outlines of saguaros and car lights flew by, I grieved in
darkness, my truck speeding north on Interstate 17.
</P>
<P>
   I cursed at two gods who I believed failed to help my father
ward off Parkinson's disease. While my dad's body withered over the
years, I prayed to God and the Holy People to stop the tremors,
restore his strength.
</P>
<P>
   I blamed the God I was introduced to at age 7 at Tuba City
Presbyterian Church in the mid-1960s. A Wednesday-evening Bible
teacher told me that if I didn't believe in God I would burn in a
place called hell.
</P>
<P>
   Burned into my mind are images of the Christian hell that look
like scenes from movies I watched as a child in the government-run
school. Vivid pictures of a bloody Jesus Christ splayed on the
cross gave me endless nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   My father introduced me to the Holy People, their philosophy and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   He told me my goal is to live in a state of Hozho _ a concept
that embodied beauty, stability and order within my life.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in Navajo philosophy is a laundry list of ``don'ts''
and taboos to respect. If one adheres to them, Hozho is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Navajo rules are: avoid contact with dead bodies,
don't stare straight into a person's eye, never drive away from a
coyote that crosses your path without sprinkling corn pollen in his
tracks and never say harsh words because they have the power to
kill.
</P>
<P>
   According to my father, I lived with the Holy People who show
themselves as lightning, dawn, rain, wind, snow, water and fog.
</P>
<P>
   My father breathed and lived Navajo philosophy and religion,
which he learned from Dan Long Reed, his late uncle.
</P>
<P>
   With the power of two religions on my side, how could my father
die?
</P>
<P>
   I conjured up reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I asked too much of the Christian God when I crammed for
college finals and escaped with a B instead of an F. I figured the
Presbyterian God understood college. How was I to explain English
101 to the Holy People?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe God was punishing me for holding onto my Navajo beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Holy People were punishing me because I didn't
cover my eyes quickly when I went to a bloody shooting scene while
on the police beat for ``The Phoenix Gazette'' before my father's
death. I had the radio reporter describe the scene to me while I
blocked the sight with a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was my chosen profession. I write for newspapers and
through the power of written words, have stung plenty of Navajo and
non-Indian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Recriminations and rememberances filled my thoughts as my
siblings and I sat at the table in my aunt's hogan and planned my
dad's funeral. We chose my brother William, an eloquent speaker and
a Stanford graduate, as the family spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   My sister and I decided that my father should be buried in
Bodaway instead of the community burial plot in Tuba City. My
father grew up among an extended family around Bodaway and raised
us east of the Grand Canyon, gnarled land covered with purple sage
and plunging canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Journeys to the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado
rivers were common for my father. He would take his soft leather
corn pollen pouch, stand at the edge of the canyon, sprinkle pollen
into the canyon and pray to the wind gods.
</P>
<P>
   The idealist in me also asked that we bury him next to his
uncle, Dan Long Reed. My father buried him in the crevice of a rock
in the 1940s without much fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The others agreed. We would bury my father next to his uncle.
The task involved cracking a hole in granite using a jack hammer,
shovel and pick.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, two people quietly wrapped the body in
sheepskin, placed it in a rock crevice, isolated themselves for
four days and cleansed themselves during a purification ceremony.
The site was never revisited.
</P>
<P>
   The belief is that a corpse taints the living and has the power
to inflict physical and emotional pain. But modern ways are
changing Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1800s, missionaries &UR; and schools have converted
hordes of Navajos to Christianity. Many Navajos tossed aside their
beliefs in the Holy People and taboos about the corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believed that Jesus was the answer because
Christianity wasn't as scary as Navajo religion. Attending church
also wasn't as expensive as the Navajo ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Night Way Chant, a curing ceremony, can cost as
much as $700 for food, supplies and help.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Navajo funerals are places where hundreds of family
members and friends gather to mourn the dead. It is usually
followed by a Christian burial outfitted with a priest, a church
choir and a eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that has rubbed off on my family.
</P>
<P>
   My sister suggested spending $2,000 for a top-of-the-line
casket. I shuddered, thinking of the mortician's promise that it
would preserve my dad's body for years.
</P>
<P>
   William and I argued it would be better if he returned to the
earth as quickly as possible. She agreed.
</P>
<P>
   A simple wood casket would do.
</P>
<P>
   We took the semitraditional burial plan to my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about a eulogy and a prayer?'' she bluntly asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer?'' I asked, throwing a glance at my brother.
</P>
<P>
   My father believed in the Holy People and never saw the inside
of a church.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt my dad would recognize God. Besides, God might toss him
out of the heavens for dancing the yei-bi-chei dance, a curing
ritual to Navajos but ``heathen's ceremony'' to the church that
taught me about God.
</P>
<P>
   But my mother, rooted in traditional ways for most of her life,
has seen many Navajo Christian funerals. A prayer and eulogy were
now part of the culture in which she lived, while my brother and I
clung to what we considered sacred ways.
</P>
<P>
   By then the fight was worn out of me. Mother would have her way.
</P>
<P>
   We took the burial proposal to the extended family of Manygoats,
Bitter Water and Deer Water clans, again at my aunt's hogan. We
heard grumbling among our army of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my Christian Navajo relatives protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You forgot God in all of this,'' said my uncle's wife, glaring
at us. ``Your father deserves a Christian burial. While you were
away at college, I prayed for him once at sheep camp. I ordered him
to run around the hogan and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   She claimed God had miraculously healed his body. ``He did take
God to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone mumbled in Navajo that we forgot to include my aunts and
uncles when we were making burial plans.
</P>
<P>
   William and I glanced at my mother.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, a petite shepherd in a velveteen shirt and a calico
skirt, stood. I had seen her cry only once, after my father took
his last breath at the nursing home. Tears rolling down her brown
cheeks, she told my brothers and me not to weep because my father
raised us well.
</P>
<P>
   My mother also turned to my sobbing daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know much about death,'' she said. ``Your heart is
young. Learn how to be strong, carry a vision. Look at the world as
though you were looking, not one butte away, but 10 buttes away.
Those are your grandfather's words.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, my mother stood before the crowd of relatives, tears on her
cheeks, and asked the Christian faction to remember tradition and
respect first word.
</P>
<P>
   In the Navajo creation story, when First Man and First Woman
spoke, their words carried out plans and forbid change. First word
was so powerful, as my dad told me, that it created Navajos.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children spoke first word,'' my mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Our Christian relatives calmed down. Although many are Christian
converts, many cling to or respect the old faith.
</P>
<P>
   Before my Christian relatives spoke, my brother quickly offered
a game plan to the group.
</P>
<P>
   We compromised.
</P>
<P>
   On the Navajo reservation, there is a third religious group
called the Native American Church, a group that blends Christian
and Navajo beliefs. Peyote is used as a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, my mother sought comfort within that faith and had
a relative in the church.
</P>
<P>
   He blended Navajo and Christian prayer at my father's panoramic
grave site. As my father's body was lowered into granite near the
spot my clan knows as ``the place where the dirt roads go up a
hill,'' I thanked him for giving me strength and wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, I'll wake up at dawn in Phoenix and say a prayer to the
Dawn People. Although I can't see the twilight made of dawn and the
hissing freeway silences prayers, in my idealistic mind I envision
my father sitting on that ridge with his uncle, Dan Long Reed.
</P>
<P>
   They are creating new Navajo songs. &QL;

<P>
   With a wave of a wand and a mayoral proclamation, New York
City's welfare system is vanishing. Job centers are replacing
welfare offices. Financial planners are replacing caseworkers. And
the entire bureaucracy is morphing into the Family Independence
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the same workers still do business in the same
buildings, but the city has been infected by a name-changing frenzy
that has been sweeping the country. Massachusetts' Department of
Public Welfare is now the Department of Transitional Assistance.
Florida's welfare program is now the Work and Gain Economic
Self-Sufficiency Program.
</P>
<P>
   And in two weeks, the American Public Welfare Association, a
trade group that represents social service agencies, will
officially shed the word welfare from its letterhead for the first
time in 66 years.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when work is prized and welfare disparaged, many state
and local officials are scrubbing their programs and groups clean
of words tainted, rightly or wrongly, by the sour smell of failure.
As Liz Krueger, an advocate for the poor, said somewhat sadly: ``We
have made welfare a four-letter word in this country. Everyone is
running as fast as they can away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the new language of welfare seeps into public
consciousness, it has caused some people to wonder what is behind
the new names. Are they merely euphemisms for business as usual? Or
do they illuminate a whole new world? In one sense, the names
reflect a nation transformed by time limits for public charity and
work requirements for those who receive it. They send a powerful
message to the poor about the change in government expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But these names are also meant to carry a politically potent
message to voters who will never step into a welfare office but
whose discontent with the status quo helped propel an overhaul in
welfare policy. In this sense, the words underscore the desires of
politicians and officialdom to project a perception of change _
even if little actually changes _ as they try to curry favor with
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a message to people on welfare? Yes,'' said Robert
Lieberman, assistant professor of politics and public policy at
Columbia University. ``But my suspicion is that the naming of
programs is directed more at voters, certainly on the part of the
elected, who are choosing the way they want their policies to be
read.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman recalled a similar name change in the 1960s when the
federal welfare program was called Aid to Dependent Children.
Criticized for discouraging marriage by supporting only single
mothers, federal officials began providing help to couples. While
the vast majority of checks continued to flow to single women, the
name became Aid to FAMILIES with Dependent Children.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, public disapproval of the welfare mother
whose children and grandchildren rely on public assistance helped
persuade Congress to change the rules and the name again. Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families was born. At the state level, Texas
created the Workforce Commission to oversee its welfare programs.
Michigan dubbed its welfare agency the Family Independence Agency.
And Utah started calling its offices ``employment centers'' and its
welfare recipients ``job seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shrewd kind of move,'' Lieberman said of the linguistic
shift. ``Who can be against personal responsibility or family
independence or temporary assistance or any of these things?''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where two more welfare offices were converted
into job centers last week, the names encompass both radical change
and political posturing. At the centers, poor people are told to
look for jobs, not welfare, and to lean on relatives, not charity.
</P>
<P>
   The shift has resulted in a staggering change: While 60 percent
of the people who walked in the door once ended up on welfare, now
only about 10 percent do. The rest decide to get by on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new names send positive messages to clients and
caseworkers that the world of welfare is changing in profound
ways,'' said Elaine Ryan, a director of the American Public Welfare
Association, which will soon be called the American Public Human
Services Association to reflect a wider membership and revamped
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Adrianne Flemming, who runs the new job center in Brooklyn
with her team of financial planners, likes to say: ``In the welfare
offices, we were handing out fish. In the job centers, we're
teaching people how to fish.''
</P>
<P>
   But while New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proudly touts the
conversion of welfare offices into job centers, he declines to say
how many people actually leave those with jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a draft memo included in a training manual for workers
describes employment as a ``secondary goal'' at the job centers.
The ``primary goal,'' the memo says, is discouraging the poor from
applying for public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor say the whole naming process sounds
suspiciously like sloganeering that will appeal to voters but help
few welfare recipients find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can change my name to the division of workforce development,
but if there are not enough jobs out there for the people who walk
in my door, none of that matters,'' Ms. Krueger said. ``Does it
mean more poor people are getting jobs in New York City? I don't
think so. It's a lot easier to change a name than to create jobs
for people.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials insist, however, that finding jobs for the poor
is still the program's primary goal. They vow it will be emphasized
as New York transforms all 31 of its welfare offices into job
centers over the next year. The new signs and letterhead are
already on order.
</P>
<P>
   But as the painters paint and the printers print, will no one
mourn the passing of a familiar word? Gary Weeks, who headed the
name change committee for the American Public Welfare Association,
thinks not. He found little nostalgia among members who wanted a
new look to reflect the growing importance of health services along
with the shift in welfare thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we lost anything,'' said Weeks, who runs
Oregon's welfare program. ``No one was on a soapbox for keeping the
terminology.''

FRANCE WINS IN SHOOTOUT, 4-3, AS LAST ITALIAN KICK HITS CROSSBAR  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ Luigi Di Biagio's penalty kick ricocheted
off the crossbar, and as the Italian midfielder tumbled backward
with an anguished expression on his face, the French players rushed
forward to share their relief with goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   After 120 minutes of sophisticated defensive soccer, a handful
of legitimate opportunities and no goals, this fratricidal World
Cup quarterfinal between the host nation and the nation where many
French soccer stars earn fine livings in lira had come down to
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' said French coach Aime Jacquet Friday night,
moments after his team had beaten Italy, 4-3, on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Only Italian coach Cesare Maldini will have the chance to rest.
The French will play again on Wednesday in the semifinals against
the winner of Saturday's quarterfinal match between Germany and
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Italians must face the fact that for the third
consecutive World Cup they were eliminated after faltering in the
nerve-jangling, oft- unsatisfying exercise _ the shootout. In 1990,
Argentina defeated them in the semifinals after penalty kicks. In
the 1994 final against Brazil, Roberto Baggio was the last Italian
to shoot and sent the ball flying over the crossbar. Di Biagio, who
has been one of the Squadra Azzurra's finest performers in France,
came closer to his target, but the result was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose three times on penalty kicks is a travesty,'' said
Baggio, who made his penalty kick Friday night but still ended up
on the losing side.
</P>
<P>
   Di Biagio was not the only player to miss. Defender Bixente
Lizarazu, the second French player to shoot, had his tentative shot
stopped by Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca. But Italy's
advantage would prove very brief, because on its next attempt,
Barthez smothered a shot by Demetrio Albertini.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put the counter back at zero,'' said Barthez, a relaxed
sort who was laughing with a French assistant coach before the
first penalty kicks were taken. ''I didn't get worried. I just knew
we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After French defender Laurent Blanc beat Pagliuca to give France
a 4-3 advantage, Di Biagio, the last of Italy's five designated
penalty shooters, walked forward. Di Biagio, a 27-year-old late
bloomer who stars for AS Roma, struck the ball with his right foot
toward the center of the goal. Barthez had guessed wrong and dived
to his left. The crowd of 80,000 was screaming too loudly for
anyone but Barthez and Di Biagio to hear the sound of the ball
striking the crossbar, but a groan was surely heard throughout
Italy and a roar throughout France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Di Biagio said. ``It doesn't make me feel any
better to know that other great players have done the same thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we are cursed a little bit,'' Cesare Maldini said.
``But I'm proud of my players. They gave everything they had.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no fourth World Cup title for Italy, the nation
whose first division has been the sport's most important and
competitive laboratory in recent decades. The question is whether
France can win its first. Though two French administrators were
instrumental in launching the World Cup in 1930, their nation has
never advanced past the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   This will be France's fourth chance, having failed in 1958, 1982
and 1986. The pivotal player for France in 1982 and 1986, Michel
Platini, is now president of the World Cup organizing committee,
and he watched Friday night's match from the stands with French
president Jacques Chirac at his side. What the two presidents saw
was a team with a serious problem _ the inability to put the ball
in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the French team in 1994, after their stunning
failure to qualify for the last World Cup, Jacquet has been
searching for strikers capable of capitalizing on the opportunities
that Zidane is so adept at creating. Though the French scored nine
goals in their first-round matches, they have managed to score only
one goal against stronger second-round opposition, Paraguay and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, despite Jacquet's decision to start a third defensive
midfielder, Christian Karembeu, the French did not play as
conservatively as their opposition. They pushed forward from the
start, sending defenders into the Italian half regularly and asking
Karembeu to play a more offensive role than usual with the national
team. They had two good chances in the first six minutes, and their
best chance of the match at the end of the first half when Youri
Djorkaeff found himself alone in front of Pagliuca, his teammate at
Inter Milan, but shot wide left.
</P>
<P>
   Djorkaeff and Pagliuca had been teasing each other about this
potential matchup since the World Cup draw was conducted in
December, and there were many such reunions on the field Friday.
During regulation, Zidane was marked by Gianluca Pessotto, his
teammate at Juventus of Turin. In all, 11 of the 22 players on the
French roster have played or are still playing in Italy, and it is
clear that the likes of Desailly, Lilian Thuram and French captain
Didier Deschamps have put their grand tour to practical use.
</P>
<P>
   The French no longer play like the ``Brazilians of Europe,'' as
Platini's generation was dubbed. But they play defense superbly,
and they won the majority of the duels against the Italians, whose
best chance came at the end of the first period of overtime when
Baggio got underneath a lobbed pass near the French goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Baggio, who had replaced an ineffective Alessandro Del Piero
in the 67th minute, sent his volleyed, right-footed shot wide of
the goal, and the French crowd roared on. France had not lost to
Italy in 20 years _ not since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina _ and
that surprising streak would not come to an end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have equaled what the older generation did: the generation
of Platini,'' said Deschamps. ``Now, we all hope we can do
better.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Like sailors flocking to safe ports, mutual fund investors have
long turned to bonds whenever stocks appear dangerously close to
imploding.
</P>
<P>
   But what are the nervous to do when the safest bonds around _
benchmark Treasuries _ have soared in price?
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Asia's fractured economic machine have caused
investors _ especially those overseas _ to pull money out of
certain stock and bond markets and pour it into United States
Treasury bonds. So prices have risen and yields _ which move in the
opposite direction of prices _ have sunk to 30-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 30, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
was just 5.62 percent, compared with 6.78 percent one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The safety-conscious as well as the yield-hungry investor cannot
help but wonder if it's time to forage elsewhere. And if so, where?
</P>
<P>
   Funds that invest in corporate bonds, it turns out, may carry
the most value now. These bonds pay a higher yield than Treasury
securities because the risk of corporate default, of course, is
greater than that of a default by the United States government.
</P>
<P>
   The yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds is the
widest it has been in five years and, given the economy's strength,
the risk of default seems limited for investment-grade bonds. With
inflation low, the yields look quite nice.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, companies have issued a mountain of new debt,
taking advantage of low rates to finance capital improvements and
to refinance older debt. That has left the market flooded and
helped keep prices down _ a situation that, in correcting itself
over time, is likely to benefit bond investors.
</P>
<P>
   The big risk is the economy. Potential buyers have been worried
that corporate earnings are on the verge of a long snooze. If
earnings decline, the prices of corporate bonds will fall, too,
leading to lower total returns, even if dividends stay steady.
</P>
<P>
   Oversupply is also a problem in the municipal bond market, which
has been second after Treasuries in investor safety. To be sure,
after an uninspiring first four months of the year, munis rallied
in May, as stocks stumbled and as investors snapped up the first
half of the largest muni bond sale ever _ $7 billion in Long Island
Power Authority bonds. Demand for these bonds, and their unusually
rich yields, effectively drained money from other munis.
</P>
<P>
   The glut remains a problem, with more issues on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for high-income investors looking for the best returns
after taxes, municipal bonds may be the way to go. There has been a
solid improvement in credit quality: Half as many issues were
downgraded in 1997 as in 1996. The good news can be attributed to
the booming economy and a surge in local tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the last year, yields on municipal bonds, relative to
taxable bonds, have narrowed significantly. According to Richard J.
Moynihan, head of tax-exempt fixed-income investing at the Dreyfus
Corp., the typical insured 20-year muni gives investors 91 percent
of the yield of a 30-year Treasury bond, up from about 81 percent a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   For people in a 31 percent income tax bracket, ``that's roughly
equal to the 7.50 percent yield they might get with a taxable
security,'' he said. ``And there aren't too many triple A-rated
securities on the taxable side that return 7.50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside, however, is that munis are less likely to
appreciate, so their total return may be weak.
</P>
<P>
   For investors in munis, he recommends longer-term issues. ``When
it comes to short-term munis _ say five-year issues _ the market is
fully priced relative to Treasuries,'' he said. ``Beyond that _
going out 10 years or more _ then these bonds continue to be very
cheap relative to Treasuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bought the longest-term issues were rewarded last
quarter. The best-performing bond funds had long maturities,
including the American Century-Benham Target Maturity funds,
several Vanguard long-term funds and T. Rowe Price U.S. Treasury
Long-Term.
</P>
<P>
   What about investors who are looking for even better values than
corporate and muni issues, as well as potentially higher yields?
Les Nanberg, the chief fixed-income officer at Massachusetts
Financial Services, says the best opportunities are in high-yield
junk bonds and emerging-market bonds, not surprisingly the riskiest
areas of the bond world.
</P>
<P>
   He says yields on junk bonds are now 3.5 percentage points more
than Treasuries, on average, while emerging-market bonds average
about 6.5 percentage points more.
</P>
<P>
   After registering nifty price gains for months, junk bonds are
now trading at two-year lows. Funds that invest in junk bonds
posted a slight loss on average in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the news was worse for most emerging-market bond funds. On
average, they lost more than 8 percent in the latest quarter,
according to Morningstar. Among the bottom performers were Phoenix
B Emerging Markets Bond and Merrill Lynch American Income.
</P>
<P>
   ``If investors can live with the volatility of these bonds,
they'll be rewarded,'' Nanberg said, ``although they're clearly not
for everyone.'' Anticipating more volatility, he is shying away
from most of Asia but spots value in Poland, Bulgaria, and other
Eastern European countries, as well as Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   What about junk bonds? Again, Nanberg is treading carefully,
focusing on companies that meet at least one of three criteria:
they are leaders in their industries, are benefiting from a strong
economy or are benefiting from recent acquisitions. One company
that he expects to benefit from the strong economy is BE Aerospace,
which makes replacement parts for aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Roger E. King, a senior portfolio manager for high-yield
securities at Dreyfus, says the news on the high-yield front isn't
all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are no panic sellers,'' King said, ``so we're
in a kind of controlled downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, King advises investors to choose issues with very
short maturities, to guard against changes in interest rates and
the junk market's current volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the greatest risk in bonds today may be credit risk,
said John F. Poole, the head of fixed-income group at Mellon
Private Asset Management. ``We don't think the economy is about to
collapse,'' he added, ``but we think that individual companies may
be at risk.''

SEDONA, FLAGSTAFF HOPE TO START NEW `ASHLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE SUNDAY JULY 5)  
 By KYLE LAWSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - Two cities, asking the same question, a little
afraid of the answer they'll hear. Can Arizona's high country
support a pair of Shakespeare festivals?
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour's drive through some of the West's most spectacular
scenery separates Flagstaff and Sedona but, in many ways, they are
planets apart. Flagstaff is pines and lingering snowfields on
14,000-foot peaks. Sedona is brilliantly colored monoliths erupting
from a high desert garden of yucca and ground-hugging juniper.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff is a university town where the nightlife throbs to a
blues and country beat, while crowds jostle their way from brew pub
to pizza joint. Sedona is an upscale destination resort, priding
itself on glitzy shops and more than 40 art galleries, but
reluctantly admitting that the sidewalks swallow themselves along
with the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   Both claim an affinity for the arts, neither would be adverse to
a little more coin finding its way into civic coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But a theatrical festival is a theatrical festival: an
amalgamation of plays, directors, actors, designers, cultural
snobbism and P.T. Barnum antics. If you've seen one, you haven't
seen them all, but you've seen their like _ and is it worth braving
Oak Creek Canyon's switchbacks to double-cast your collection
during a vacation or a weekend getaway from Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, ``competition'' is not a word that muscles its way
into conversation with the principals of Flagstaff's Grand Canyon
Shakespeare Festival, which began its third season Friday, and
Sedona's Shakespeare Sedona, which kicks off its inaugural event
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it lingers at the edge of hearing, an echo of nervousness.
Even in its third year, the Flagstaff celebration is a financial
babe in comparison to the West's great classical fiestas: the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Ore., and the Utah
Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   And if Sedona doesn't at least break even by summer's end, its
second season could be a stillborn dream.
</P>
<P>
   If neither thinks of the other as a threat, each is aware that
seats must be filled _ and if someone's must be empty, well, better
yours than mine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the atmosphere is upbeat and optimistic. Actors,
artistic directors and chamber managers talk about building a
cultural state of mind in northern Arizona that will produce a sort
of circle tour of the arts. Tourists will be steered from the Grand
Canyon's vistas to Sedona's red rocks, with a stop for a lively
comedy here, a stirring tragedy there.
</P>
<P>
   And seriously big revenues everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Dunlop of the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce points out that,
last season, the Ashland festival attracted 364,602 patrons, the
majority of whom were tourists. Overall, the area's economy
benefitted in the amount of $90.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ashland started with nothing, unless you count sagebrush.
Flagstaff and Sedona are on the doorstep of one of the country's
most popular national parks. Both towns have airports, Flagstaff
has an Amtrack station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what has happened elsewhere, the potential here is
enormous,'' Dunlop says.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't escaped the attention of Frank Miller, president of
the Sedona-Oak Creek Chamber of Commerce, as to just who patronizes
these things. Statistics for Ashland and Cedar City indicate that
audience members are predominately middle-to-upper-management,
well-educated types who spend money. A great deal of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very target-specific in our promotions . . . we are
looking for those extended-stay, high-value visitors who have the
time and will take the time to spend money in our community,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a festival will encourage this, and at the
same time enhance the reputation Sedona has as a center for the
arts in the Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   He breaks into a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, if we're telling people they should stay here for
four or five days to do the area justice, we'd better have
something for them to do on those four or five nights that go along
with the days.''
</P>
<P>
   If planning were performing, the Sedona event would have a
slight edge on the Flagstaff festival, but while Sedona's founders
were lining up backers, the Flagstaff people stopped talking and
started doing.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the bones of the defunct Northern Arizona University
Repertory Theatre, the Grand Canyon Shakespeare Festival welcomed
its first audiences in 1996. Initially, it was a university
endeavor, staffed primarily by faculty members and students.
</P>
<P>
   This year, NAU's president Dr. Clara Lovett, an avid supporter
of the festival concept, brought in Wayne Watkins to head up the
event. Watkins, a NAU grad, returned to Flagstaff to found Arizona
TheatreWorks, an Equity operation that is one of the state's arts
success stories. Known for his almost obsessive professional
standards, Watkins immediately set about hiring a staff of actors,
directors and designers from Phoenix, New York, Los Angeles and
other stage centers.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Kubzansky was brought from Los Angeles to direct
``Twelfth
</P>
<P>
   Night,'' Daniel Bryan Cartmell from the same city to helm
``Macbeth'' and Roger Michelson from New York to supervise ``The
Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   As often is the case with festivals, the directors have multiple
responsibilities, with Cartmell playing Prospero in ``The Tempest''
and Michelson portraying the title role in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other actors include the Phoenix area's Kathy Fitzgerald, who
met and married Michelson while she was starring in ``Swinging On A
Star'' on Broadway; and Tucson's Ben Stewart, familiar for his many
roles with Arizona Theatre Company.
</P>
<P>
   Like Watkins, Sedona's Jared Sakren has impeccable connections
to the theater world. A founding member of John Houseman's Acting
Company and later one of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's
whiz-kids, he made good use of his Rolodex in luring Greg Leaming,
associate artistic director of New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre, to
create ``The Macbeth Project,'' along with actor Patrick Page
(``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dracula``) to play the witch-bedeviled
Scottish chief in what promises to be an innovative reassessment of
Shakespeare's thriller.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sakren will direct ``The Comedy of Errors'' and
Page will present ``Passions' Slaves,'' his one-man revue of
Shakespearean characters, to round out Sedona's playbill.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Sakren's most important connection may prove to be
his partnership with Jill Patterson, director of theater at
Sedona's Verde Valley School, one of the Southwest's most
prestigious boarding institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a Yale graduate, had been hired by Verde Valley's
headmaster Saul Benjamin to enhance the school's already impressive
arts program. It soon was decided that one of the best ways to do
that would be to establish a summer festival that included among
its attractions a conservatory whose faculty would include the
festival staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare Sedona Institute, which makes its debut this
week (week of July 5) along with the festival, has been accredited
by Prescott College and already is attracting an international
student body.
</P>
<P>
   The scheming isn't all serious. Flagstaff has the edge on Sedona
for goofy promotions: among Grand Canyon marketing director Cindy
Wynn's ``talker-uppers'' are a contest to choose the pet that looks
the most like Shakespeare and a competition to find the man whose
legs look the best in a kilt.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Flagstaff seems the most festival-conscious of the
two cities, which Wynn admits is, to some degree, a reflection of
its seniority. Banners hang from lamp poles along the main streets
and every other shop window seems to display a poster.
</P>
<P>
   Community cooperation is extensive. The Aboretum at Flagstaff
has planted a garden outside the theater that contains plants
mentioned in Shakespeare's plays; Bookman's Used Books and Records
is sponsoring a series of lectures and a sonnet competition; the
Late for the Train Cafe is baking Bard Tarts and GingerBard Cookies
for wenches to sell during the greens show that precedes each
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone misses the message, Wynn is organizing noisy
opening night parades to lead playgoers to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the West's other Shakespearean festivals, which boast
open-air stages, the Arizona events are indoors _ at least for now.
Flagstaff's performances are at the Clifford E. White Theatre on
the NAU campus. Sedona is dividing its run between the theater at
Verde Valley School and the auditorium at Red Rock High School.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling dice with the weather, as Wynn wryly puts it, is still
very much a dream for Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk is slight. Everyone agrees it would be a great idea
but that's as far as it gets,'' she says. ``They want to wait and
see if the festival grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk is more substantial in Sedona, perhaps because Verde Valley
School is no stranger to outdoor events. It is home to the annual
Sedona Jazz on the Rocks Festival and, every summer, singer Jackson
Browne stages a concert to raise funds for the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it would take money to build a suitable amphitheater
and that's money we would rather spend on high-quality casts and
productions,'' Patterson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our goal is to convince people they don't have to
go to Cedar City or Ashland to see great Shakespeare. They can see
it right here in Arizona. You don't need a fancy stage when you've
got Cathedral Rock right outside.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last week, from faraway California, Monica Lewinsky
watched her former best friend, Linda Tripp, take center stage in
Washington as marquee witness for Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Ms. Lewinsky harbors bitter feelings toward Ms.
Tripp, who secretly taped 20 hours of their intimate conversations
and then took her suspicions of a sexual relationship between Ms.
Lewinsky and President Clinton to Starr, would be a ``gross
understatement,'' according to one close associate of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's father, for one, calls Ms. Tripp ``a pathetic
specimen of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruptured relations between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp, who
became acquainted while both were working at the Pentagon in 1996,
is but one of many friendships blown to smithereens during Starr's
six months of digging into allegations of White House sex and
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that should be inured to scandal by now, the Lewinsky
imbroglio has strained old social customs and upended many long
friendships. The capital, after all, has long prized its tradition
of having partisan warriors spar by day and sip cocktails together
by night. Even at the height of Watergate, Republican White House
aides kept their social backchannels open to their Democratic
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, hardly a Georgetown dinner for 12 can be had without
open warfare breaking out when the topic of the president and the
intern is broached. Some hostesses have made it known when
invitations are issued that Topic A is verboten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schism this has created is extraordinary,'' observed Sally
Quinn, the author and hostess. ``It's shattered the social fabric
of Washington and turned the place into a walking war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The war zone extends beyond the Beltway to other environs
touched by the Lewinsky imbroglio. The personal debris floating in
the scandal's wake already extends from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Los Angeles, lawyer William Ginsburg, dismissed last
month as Ms. Lewinsky's attorney, is no longer a trusted family
friend. (Ginsburg once shared on television his happy memories of
kissing baby Monica's inner thighs, which he called ``those little
poulkes.'')
</P>
<P>
   The California malpractice specialist had been hired to
represent Ms. Lewinsky in the first frenzied hours of Starr's
inquiry precisely because he was an old friend of her father,
Bernard Lewinsky, an oncologist. But all the Lewinskys grew
disenchanted with both Ginsburg's lawyering and his addiction to
appearing on television. Large and unitemized legal bills have
further inflamed the ill will, according to one lawyer representing
the Lewinsky family.
</P>
<P>
   The lines between the White House and George Stephanopoulos, who
is about to unsheathe his memoirs in New York, have also gone cold.
President Clinton is said by White House aides to be furious over
his former adviser's critical television commentary on the Lewinsky
matter ( Stephanopoulos is a regular contributor to ABC's Sunday
public affairs program, ``This Week'').
</P>
<P>
   The animosity felt for Stephanopoulos, who says he feels obliged
to speak truthfully as a television analyst, go beyond the
president and include White House adviser Rahm Emmanuel and other
veterans of the 1992 Clinton campaign who worked closely with the
former aide-turned-author.
</P>
<P>
   The silent treatment has not been the only means of expressing
hurt feelings and anger over the investigation. In the middle of an
upscale Richmond supermarket, Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer, had an angry confrontation with her former best friend,
Julie Steele, whom Ms. Willey had pressed to back up her account of
having received an unwanted grope from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey and Ms. Steele, who have both been called before
Starr's grand jury, were once so close that their families
vacationed together. But ever since Ms. Steele failed to back up
Ms. Willey's story to a journalist, the two women have not been on
speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been much speculation over whether the Starr
investigation ruptured relations between Clinton and his best
friend, Vernon Jordan. Jordan has been called before Starr's grand
jury repeatedly (he made what was expected to be his final
appearance last month) to answer questions about the help he gave
Ms. Lewinsky finding a lawyer and a job.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has defended the propriety of his help to Ms.
Lewinsky, has not been seen much in public with the president, with
whom he used to enjoy frequent golf outings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Jordan did resurface at the White House at
a state dinner for the president of South Korea. And the Clintons
will be vacationing next month in Martha's Vineyard, where Jordan
is a mainstay of the island's social set.
</P>
<P>
   The frosty feelings are hardly limited to the figures directly
involved in Starr's probe. Some of the journalists who are covering
the Lewinsky saga are also at each other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist and legal analyst Stuart Taylor Jr. worked from 1989
to last year for Steven Brill, the author of a scathing article
about Starr and the Washington press corps. In the maiden issue of
Brill's Content, Brill's new magazine, he called Taylor, who had
recently attended a party for one of Brill's daughters, ``the
complete anti-Clinton partisan.'' In his own column in the weekly
magazine National Journal, Taylor responded, accusing Brill of
taking an unfair ``potshot'' and defending his criticisms of
Clinton as objective, not partisan. The two have not spoken since
the debut of the magazine, and Taylor's column referred to their
friendship in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinn said she expected more relationships to fray as the
investigation slogs on through a long, hot Washington summer.
``This is worse than even the final days of Nixon,'' she said. ``No
one has come out of this with all their friendships intact.''

CONFIDENT FRENCH LOOK AHEAD AND DREAM OF WORLD CUP GLORY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Victory is sweet, even as a result of penalty kicks, and
for the French soccer team it is particularly so because to win
against Italy in the World Cup is to begin to overcome the nagging
inferiority complex that stems from never having won this trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The French players did their best to hide their self-doubt
before Friday's match, but it was obvious enough. After all, Italy
had won the trophy three times. Italy has what is almost certainly
the best league in the world. In the striker Christian Vieri, Italy
had the tournament's most prolific scorer. And, quite simply, ``la
squadra'' is a soccer-playing myth while ``les bleus'' have often
been a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Dessailly, France's commanding central defender, summed
up his team's sense of having proved a point. ``The fact is the
Italians are just a touch pretentious,'' he said after the game.
``We wanted to show them something. We wanted to prove to them that
our game has real quality too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieri in tears. Italian captain Giuseppe Bergomi in tears. The
man who missed the last penalty, Luigi di Biagio, paralyzed with
grief. The agony of a nation for which soccer is more of a passion
than it will ever be in France. All this meant nothing to Dessailly
and the other French players basking in the glow beyond Italy's
long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Dessailly, like several members of the French side, has honed
his game in Italy, playing five seasons for AC Milan, where he was
known simply as ``il gigante negro'' _ the black giant. During a
bad season for Milan this year, he was much criticized, but, like
the entire French defense, he has been magnificent since the World
Cup began.
</P>
<P>
   France has conceded just one goal in five matches _ a record of
which even Italy, long reputed to run the most watertight defenses
in the world, would approve. Friday, Dessailly and his fellow
defenders _ Laurent Blanc, Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu _
shut out Vieri, something no team had done up to now. They turned
star Italian striker Alessandro Del Piero into a pale and lonely
figure who was eventually substituted. And they allowed the great
Roberto Baggio just one chance that he sent inches wide of the
post.
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is a defense that yields goals as readily as a
desert yields water. In a sense it was crafted in Italy: Blanc once
played there, Thuram still does and Dessailly is only now moving
from Milan to England's Chelsea. Can it at last secure France its
coveted trophy? Several French players remarked Friday that the
team had now reached the same stage in the competition _ the
semifinal _ that the great French side of the 1980s twice reached.
``We have now equaled our elders,'' said captain Didier Deschamp
with quite evident relief.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a very different French squad. In the 1980s France
was led and inspired by brilliant midfielder Michel Platini, now
the president of the French organizing committee for this
tournament. It was a team full of fantasy, originality and
outrageous talent, a side that readily scored goals but was
inclined, at the crunch, to concede too many.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, in the semifinals of 1982 and 1986 against Germany,
France bowed out, conceding five goals in the two matches. The
hosts of this year's tournament seem unlikely to be as generous
this year. But a terrible doubt lingers over the French ability to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Zinedine Zidane, who plays for the Italian club Juventus, has
taken over from Platini as the French playmaker. He is as creative
as Platini, but, unlike Platini, he seldom scores goals. Up front,
France has tried a succession of strikers, without settling on a
lineup. Young Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet have both scored
goals against lesser opponents in the opening games, but the only
came on as substitutes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What France needs is a Vieri. Short of that, it needs its
veteran goalscorer, Yuri Djorkaeff, who plays for Inter Milan, to
recover his touch and stop squandering good chances as he did twice
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But with its new Italian realism, learned by many in the Italian
league, France may find just one goal per game is enough to get the
team home. Before a home crowd, and with the old doubts fading like
bad dreams, that may not be asking too much.

NEED AN ISM? TRY TARANTINISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 5)  
 (JT)  
 By VIJAI MAHESHWARI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   It was a Thursday night at From Dusk Till Dawn, a nightclub that
takes its name and inspiration from the 1996 vampire western
written by Quentin Tarantino, much of which unfolds in a topless
bar south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   A pouty, curvaceous woman in a white gown leaned against one of
the Mayan-inspired columns that dot the upscale Moscow club, while
on a screen behind her ran a tape loop of selections from the work
of Tarantino, Russia's favorite American auteur.
</P>
<P>
   When the images segued to a scene from the final reel of ``From
Dusk Till Dawn'' _ showing topless dancers morphing through special
effects into blood-sucking ghouls _ the pouty woman, a stripper,
went into action. She led a middle-aged businessman out of the
audience and undressed him to his underwear while a deejay cranked
up the volume. Instead of sprouting fangs, she capped off her act
by casually opening her gown to stand fully naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose this place because of the name _ we loved the film,''
said a physician who was celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary
at the club with his wife. Earlier, a male dancer had partly
disrobed the wife, a schoolteacher. ``We've been living together
for 20 years, but we can still enjoy a strip show,'' she said.
``Now that's very Tarantino, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Moscow night life in the late 1990s. America might
have Elvis; Russia has found Tarantino, the writer and director who
has been embraced for his dark irony, gaudy violence and
glamorization of hoodlums with awful taste. Many Russian lovers of
his work say it is more reflective of their own country's culture
than America's.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters from the island of Sakhalin near Japan to Orenburg in
the Urals show Tarantino's more obscure films, while the ``Pulp
Fiction'' soundtrack is piped into trains and planes. Teen-age
girls lop their hair into Uma Thurman bobs and dance the twist from
the ``Pulp Fiction'' scene in Jack Rabbit Slim's diner. Moscow
hipsters imitate Tarantino's nerdy, owl-eyed look. Most notably,
the director's world has inspired a generation of nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cater-corner from the Kremlin is a smoky basement speak-easy
called Four Rooms, named after the 1995 film starring Tim Roth as a
Hollywood bellboy, to which Tarantino contributed one of four
segments. Although the club has few links to the film other than
its name and layout _ it has four rooms arranged railroad style _
the cachet of the name alone has served it well. One Friday night,
the disco was packed with a cross section of Moscow's bright young
things.
</P>
<P>
   A young man in a ``Reservoir Dogs'' T-shirt and dark sunglasses
made two V's with his fingers across his eyes as he danced. ``He is
not American _ he's got a Russian soul,'' the man said of
Tarantino, shouting to be heard over the Dick Dale surf-guitar
soundtrack. His dance partner, a spandex-clad young woman with a
heroin chic look and skyscraper platform shoes, added, ``His
characters like to wander, shout and shoot _ just like us
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Valery Novak, an owner of the club, who came up with the name,
was less in thrall to the director. ``It was just accidental,'' he
said of the club's name. ``The name just happened to fit our
original design concept for the club.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he discounted the Tarantino connection, Novak
admitted trying to lure the director to last year's grand opening.
Sasha Markvo, a publicity agent and model who persuaded Alexander
McQueen to show his fall collection in a Moscow subway station last
year, went so far as to call an assistant to Tarantino in Los
Angeles. ``I told him Moscow was even crazier and bloodier than his
films,'' Ms. Markvo said. ``But he couldn't come. He had to go to
Cannes.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Russia seems to have an opinion about Tarantino.
``He made bad taste hip,'' said Aleksandr Kulish, the editor in
chief of the Russian edition of Premiere, the film magazine. ``And
for a country where `trash culture' was taboo for almost 70 years,
his ironic films were an eye-opener.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulish noted that Tarantino's influential ``Pulp Fiction''
opened in 1994, just as many Russians began to revere lowbrow over
highbrow culture _ Solzhenitsyn lost favor to pulpy detective
writers, for example, and gaudy mafiosi in gold chains and flashy
German automobiles replaced dissidents as underground heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fit right in with the zeitgeist,'' said Max Friedman, an
American party promoter who has spent five years in Moscow. ``He
made all the greasy, sly characters of the new Russia _ kiosk
owners, drug dealers, gangsters, molls _ feel glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   From Dusk Till Dawn, which opened in November in central Moscow
and serves Cognac at $250 a glass, is contemplating a Tarantino
fashion show. Dmitri Troitsky, a Russian filmmaker, pointed to
bull-neck gangsters with wafer-thin dates, some of whom were
snickering at scenes from ``Reservoir Dogs'' playing on the club's
screen. ``Russian gangsters are works in progress, just like their
Tarantino counterparts,'' Troitsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino's latest film, ``Jackie Brown,'' was promoted in
Moscow almost as heavily as ``Godzilla'' in New York. Bootleg
videos circulated in the weeks before the American premiere of
``Jackie Brown'' on Christmas in 1997. At one private viewing in an
apartment, the picture was so streaked and grainy that Los Angeles
looked more like Moscow _ dark, snowy, chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, ``Jackie Brown'' was a box-office flop in Russia.
``It was too plot-driven _ not quite edgy or funny enough for
Russians,'' said Kulish, the Premiere editor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Tarantino craze may have crested. On the outer edge
of Moscow, Jack Rabbit Slim's, the city's first Tarantino-theme
nightclub, is well past its heyday. One weekend night it was nearly
deserted. When the first line of ``Pulp Fiction'' _ ``Everybody
move _ this is a robbery!'' _ was broadcast over the sound system,
nobody stirred.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to come here just because of the name,'' said
Andrei Malinkov, the manager. ``Now they hardly come at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at From Dusk Till Dawn, business is considerably better.
Still, the owners seem to be anticipating a change in fashion. They
are planning to convert part of their establishment to take
advantage of another American style _ the cigar bar.

THREE STRATEGIES, ONE OUTCOME: A SPRING THAT CAME UP ROSES 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bitter spring quarter for many a mutual fund manager,
but it was a very sweet season for others. How did some managers
land at the top of the fund performance lists? Different tacks
worked well for different managers.
</P>
<P>
   Here, some of the winners talk about their strategies _ from
short-selling to big bets on technology and European stocks _ as
well as their outlooks for the rest of the year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael B. Orkin, manager of Caldwell &AMP; Orkin Market
Opportunity, might be called Doom-and-Gloom. His fund, based in
Atlanta, landed the No. 12 position on the list of best-performing
United States diversified funds in the second quarter, with a 10.1
percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is attributable to Orkin's short-selling, which
involves betting on a decline, rather than an increase, in the
price of a stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a short sale, investors sell shares that they have borrowed
from a broker, betting that they can replace the stock at a lower
price. Orkin has benefited so much from the practice that he plans
to raise the 40 percent cap on short positions in his fund to 50
percent or 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe eventually the stock market will have a significant
and long-lasting setback,'' Orkin said. ``I'm talking about bear
markets that happen once in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so downbeat? Orkin faxed a reporter a 10-page missive to
explain his reasoning. The gist of it? ``People don't believe the
markets can drop,'' he said. ``Massive complacency is becoming
firmly established.''
</P>
<P>
   Orkin's solution is to mix stock purchases with short sales.
``The criteria for both is we look for change; an acceleration in
earnings growth; management change, usually correlated with
restructuring, or industry changes like supply or demand for
semiconductor chips or oil exploration and development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A long position, Ames Department Stores, which rose 24.6
percent, helped his second-quarter return. Orkin calls Ames, which
accounts for 1.9 percent of the $247.1 million fund, ``a discount
retailer that's executing its strategy well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ames emerged from bankruptcy, reorganized under new management
and is faring well because economic growth has left consumers with
money to spend, he said. Ames sells for 16 times 1998 earnings,
which analysts expect to grow 15 to 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Orkin declined to name companies that the fund is shorting but
said he was playing two themes: companies with exposure to Asia and
companies that offer subprime loans.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum investment for the fund was just raised to $100,000,
from $10,000. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big technology bets did the trick for the Janus 20 portfolio,
which, as its name implies, holds just 20 stocks. The fund is
managed by Scott W. Schoelzel, who took over when Thomas F. Marsico
left Janus Capital to open his own shop in January.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, which surged 37 percent in the second quarter,
helped push Janus 20 up to first place for the quarter among
diversified funds, and Schoelzel remains bullish on the company: It
now accounts for 8 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the systemic advantage that they enjoy from their
direct-sales model,'' Schoelzel said. ``The company also has
negative working capital, because they get their customers' money
immediately but they don't have to pay their suppliers for 60 to 90
days.''
</P>
<P>
   And Schoelzel is also excited about the fact that Dell is moving
into selling higher-margin servers and notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which ran up 53.9 percent, also played a big
part in the outperformance of Janus 20. It accounts for 6 percent
of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like America Online because of the rate at which it's
signing up subscribers, advertisers and E-commerce partners,''
Schoelzel said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also been able to increase some of its
advertising rates, which Schoelzel said would help drive up America
Online earnings more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Schoelzel's winners weren't all of the wired variety. Home
Depot, at 3 percent of the fund, rose 22.8 percent in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the large stores, Home Depot is on the verge of
rolling out Expo stores, a high-end format for clients of designers
and architects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoelzel remains bullish on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we're in a secularly declining inflation environment
and, as a result, a fairly benign interest rate environment,'' he
said. ``The move in financial assets has many years to run.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A love affair with Europe landed the $420.8 million Federated
International Small Co. fund, managed by Tracy P. Stouffer, in
third place on the list of diversified international stock funds
for the second quarter. The fund returned 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stouffer's charter is flexible. She must only stick with
companies with capitalizations of $1 billion or less and stay
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 35 percent of the fund was invested in emerging
markets. This year, the total is zero, which, of course, served her
well as those markets swooned. The fund's holdings in Europe teeter
at 96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this mix, or lack thereof, has to do with Ms. Stouffer's
mandate to hold small-capitalization stocks, which are suffering
mightily outside of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting any small-cap effect in emerging markets
because all the companies are becoming smaller and smaller, the
result of shrinking prices and currency erosion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   European small-cap stocks have thrived, Ms. Stouffer said,
because of a general flight to smaller-sized companies in reaction
to the Asian problems. ``Small companies tend to do business
locally, so they're somewhat of a safe haven,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They also tend to have low levels of debt, if for no other
reason than that few lenders will give them loans. Moreover, they
are benefiting from a trend toward outsourcing among big companies
of their noncore businesses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stouffer plans to stay invested in Europe for now. ``I don't
think it's time to move into the emerging markets,'' she said. ``I
don't think the Asia problems will be resolved quickly, and small
companies are beneficiaries of European growth and the EMU,'' she
added, referring to European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   The fund holds 185 companies. Among the largest, all well under
2 percent of the fund's assets, are Cofir, a Spanish holding
company with hotel and wine businesses; Creyf's, a temporary
employment company in Belgium, and Telepizza, a Spanish pizza
delivery chain.

IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BE JAPANESE AT YAOHAN PLAZA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 5)  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (JT)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Badtz Maru pops up everywhere at Yaohan Plaza, the
riverfront Japanese mall in Edgewater, N.J. His pudgy cartoon
features glower on miniaturized note pads and canvas backpacks, and
he puffs himself up importantly on a child's lunch box, where he
caught the eye of Yeohlee Teng, the Malaysian-born New York
designer, who goes professionally by her first name only.
</P>
<P>
   She was instantly smitten by the doughty Japanese warrior
penguin, and in no time at all she whisked him from his shelf and
whirled him off in a merry little waltz.
</P>
<P>
   Badtz Maru is one of myriad attractions at Yaohan Plaza, a mecca
for homesick Japanese residents of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Greenwich,
Conn., which appeals as well to New York City shoppers, who need
only to cross the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are drawn by the Food Plaza, the cavernous, hypertidy
supermarket that anchors the mall, its aisles lined with okono
miyaki, a savory cabbage; shrimp-filled pancakes, which are Japan's
fast-food equivalent to hamburger; sticky rice balls wrapped in
seaweed; pickled ginger and plums, and what may be the largest
assortment of Japanese snack foods outside Tokyo, from curly
salmon-color fritters to roasted green peas.
</P>
<P>
   Novelty hunters are just as likely to enjoy the Specialty Plaza,
with its compact mini-boutiques of Shiseido and Poli cosmetics and
the promise of ferreting out any number of hot fashion commodities:
knee-length kimonos that might have marched straight off Dries van
Noten's runway, loose-fitting drawstring judo pants, or the
thick-soled thongs that inspired Prada's high-end versions of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But today, fashion was surprisingly low on Yeohlee's agenda. A
passionate recreational shopper, she approached an afternoon's
outing at Yaohan like a tourist on a photo safari. ``What I like
about shopping is the feeling of discovery, the sense that you
might find something, stumble on it unexpectedly,'' she said.
``It's that emotional element of fun and surprise that conventional
stores have taken away _ they're so vigorously directed toward
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Canon Elph in hand, she stalked her quarry: the exotic, the
eccentric and the surreal. At Mars New York, a toy shop, she
snapped a spark-spewing tin dragon and an assortment of doll-size
hair ornaments, before buying a pair of white cotton socks
embroidered with the features of a polar bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably wear these to work and see who notices,'' the
designer said, straight-faced, never mind that her day-to-day
uniform, a close-fitting T-shirt or turtleneck, black trousers and
work boots, is devoid of fanciful touches.
</P>
<P>
   She sailed on past small cylinders of gift wrap no larger than
tall candlesticks, past wands of hair mascara in strident shades of
violet, gold and orange _ ``We'll try these out later,'' she said _
and on toward three bath-toy babies arranged on a shelf next to a
white ceramic chick on the lid of a cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
   She considered this composition. ``Very Jeff Koons,'' she said
deadpan, before moving on to the adjacent handbag store.
</P>
<P>
   There, her eyes lighted up at the sight of a patent-leather
shoulder bag stenciled with the motto ``Ethos Is a Group of
Fashion, Ethos Our Mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah-ha, a Jenny Holzer bag,'' she announced, a winking allusion
to the artist famous for her provocative slogans on billboards.
</P>
<P>
   There's a surprising loopiness in Yeohlee's choices, coming as
they do from a designer better known for her rigorous simplicity
and disciplined cut than for her sense of the burlesque. She treats
fashion as a form of soft architecture, and her fluid, minimalist
creations are perfectly at home in pristine gallery spaces.
(Several, in fact, were in Berlin this summer for ``Clothes and
Enclosures,'' an exhibition that will travel to Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, next month.)
</P>
<P>
   But Yeohlee herself was at home in the mall, darting as giddily
as Eloise among the shelves, riveted by their meticulously
engineered displays no less than by their contents. Her taste for
geometry propelled her from pyramids of teapots, cups and saki
pourers to a rack of thongs trimmed in velvet and polka-dot ribbon.
``I love the graphics of these,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was on to Kinokuniya, a bookshop that also carries
novelties like sumo-wrestler trading cards and Japanese fashion
magazines. Postcard-size paperback books momentarily caught her
eye, their cryptic English titles _ ``Angel Baby Cupid,'' ``Loose''
and ``Seven'' _ making her laugh. Near the shop's exit she stopped
in her tracks, fascinated by a display of origami paper. The small,
squarish sheaves of blue, green and orange reminded her of her
girlhood in Penang. ``I used to make little origami boats out of
these and float them in the monsoon rains,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear she had retained that toddler's sense of play when,
moments later, arriving at the Food Plaza, she zigzagged down
aisles so wide that a small aircraft could have landed in them.
``Just look at these,'' she exclaimed, snatching up clear
self-sealing plastic packets of ringo kyuri and kyo no kaori
(pickled cucumber), tinted, respectively, in green and inky purple.
``I love the colors.'' She was fascinated, too, by the festive
pastries: rice and bean confections sculptured like irises, and
sweetened rice balls elegantly cloaked in cherry leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Energized after sampling a few, she headed for Washu, a bedding
store, attracted by stacks of futons, five-toed cotton
slipper-socks and audaciously patterned kimonos. Plucking a
knee-length, fan-decorated kimono from a rack, she draped it on
Vanessa Verbeeck, her design studio model and companion of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as cabana wear, don't you?'' Yeohlee said, stepping
back to admire her handiwork. ``You'd put it on to lounge by the
pool while you waited for someone to bring you one of those
cocktails with a little paper umbrella stuck in it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had spent the best part of the afternoon indulging her inner
child, but now the pragmatist in her took over. ``This kimono is
pure cotton,'' she said. ``It has pockets, and it's
one-size-fits-all, very efficient. I like that. For me it fulfills
a lot of requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   She applies similar standards to her own collection, most
tellingly her gently structured urban nomad coat, made of
stormproof nylon bonded to alpaca. Cut to wrap like a komono, it is
simple and ample enough to be worn by a man or a woman. ``I really
pump into the things that I make as many uses as possible,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was captivated by subtleties that revealed themselves only
on close inspection. Pouncing on a red-rim black-lacquer tray, she
announced: ``See, this one has a nice grain. Not every one does.''
And then she added in a stage whisper: ``Look, $12.50. I'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the mall's food court, with its view across the Hudson
River to Riverside Park, Yeohlee pondered her latest acquisition
over a bowl of tempura and soba noodles. Rather than matching the
tray with something as obvious as a set of red lacquer bowls, she
decided, she would use it as an accent beneath her collection of
1950s Finnish glassware.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as she had at Yaohan Plaza, she was not certain
which, if any, of the afternoon's impressions would filter into her
designs. ``You might go to western Pennsylvania, but you wouldn't
come back and do an Amish collection,'' she said. ``Still, you
might do a narrow black pant that is slightly cropped,''
</P>
<P>
   A fashion influence, when it does occur, tends to turn up in the
details. ``Who knows?'' she said, grinning broadly. ``Maybe I'll
have Badtz Maru in my clothes next season.''

   A Rebuke and Setback For Starr's Inquiry
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that surprised even the defendants, a federal
judge decided that Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr went too far
when he obtained the indictment of Webster Hubbell, his wife and
two tax advisers on tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson dismissed the criminal case, ruling that
prosecutors had both exceeded their jurisdiction and reneged on a
pledge to grant Hubbell, a former close aide to President Clinton,
immunity in exchange for thousands of records about Hubbell's
business dealings.

   A Hint of Leniency in Nigeria

   Nigeria's new military leader took what may be the most
significant step so far to reverse the abuses of his predecessor,
the late Gen. Sani Abacha.

   The current leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, promised United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan that all remaining political

Nigerians think won a presidential election in 1993 that Abacha's
government aborted.

   Florida, the Firestorm State
</P>
<P>
   Fires burning across Florida since Memorial Day raged out of
control, literally casting a pall over the Fourth of July. More
than 100 homes were burned and tens of thousands of people were
forced to evacuate. Damage along the ravaged north and central east
coast of the state was certain to rise as firefighters were
thwarted by gusty winds and temperatures of more than 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The fires closed nearly 100 miles of Interstate 95, the major
highway along the East Coast, and a smoky haze obscured the sky as
far away as Miami, 250 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, severe summer storms wreaked havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The eastern half of the United States, from Vermont to
Minnesota, Georgia to Iowa, was bullied floods, tornadoes or
mudslides. At least 26 people died. A West Virginia mother had her
4-month-old baby swept out of her arms by a raging flood. A
Minnesota farmer died when lightning struck his pitchfork. And an
Ohio woman whose car was submerged in water managed to use her
cellular phone to call her husband in the minutes before she died.

   Soccer Coaches Under Fire for Lighting Up

frustration.
</P>
<P>
   His grievance? No, it's not rough World Cup play. Or what goes
on when British fans get out of control. It's what goes on on the
sidelines: Coaches don't just fume, they smoke _ constantly, and in
full view of TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In the victory over England, Argentina's coach, Daniel
Passarella, even ran toward the field holding a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's group worries that this sort of thing will tarnish
soccer's reputation. But they bump smack into the fact that ``no
smoking'' simply doesn't translate into most languages.

Cup to France? He recently died at 74 of lung cancer.

Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. But now, the Pentagon
announced, new genetic tests have made his identity known.

   The serviceman was 1st Lt. Michael Blassie, an Air Force pilot
shot down over South Vietnam in 1972, near a village called An Loc.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 2,087 Americans missing from the war, but with
science making identification of even the smallest remains
possible, it now seems unlikely that any of them will take
Blassie's place in the Tomb.

THE NEXT RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 05 1998)  
 (Includes ``A century of American business cycles'' text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great certainties of life at the end of the 20th
century is the flow and ebb of the business cycle. Every once in a
while, somebody proclaims that a new era has arrived, or, better
yet, that the cycle is ended. But the pattern of expansions and
contractions, recognizable in its essentials, rolls along
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   The main uncertainty: What event will trigger the next downturn?
The Asian crisis? Is it already in the works?
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Shocks: What Causes Business Cycles?'' was the subject
of a conference held by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston last
month on Cape Cod. These regional Federal Reserve Bank meetings are
getting harder and harder to conceptualize, as conferences
proliferate and competition among host organizations heats up. No
serious researcher wants to write a paper to be tucked away in a
volume published by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   So the regional banks must either choose high-brow topics
(e.g., &UR;  &LR; the San Francisco bank, whose 1996 conference proceedings
on ``Managing Capital Flows and Exchange Rates,'' has just been
published by Cambridge University Press); or make them very
practical (e.g., the Chicago Fed's regular May conference on bank
deregulation); or simply make them topical (e.g., the Kansas City
Fed's August junket to Jackson Hole, Wyo., where the schmoozing and
silly-season maneuvering in the press is more important than
anything that's written down).
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Cod conference last month was a model of how the Boston
bank fits into the system. With Boston's dense university network _
Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University,
Northeastern University, and Boston College, plus the headquarters
of the National Bureau of Economic Research _ the city is
economics' Mecca, not to mention a world center of money
management. The bank's idea was to connect the top end of the
banking community to developments at the frontiers of economic
research, however briefly.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was the ``real business cycle'' literature that
for a decade has pursued the possibility that economic fluctuations
stem from restructuring among production technologies instead of
traditionally identified fiscal and monetary factors.
</P>
<P>
   Thus conference-goers heard a report on a highly sophisticated
thought-experiment by Yale University's Christopher Sims designed
to gauge the ability of monetary policy to affect the course of
events. They heard, too, an historiographic essay by MIT economic
historian Peter Temin on the causes of American business cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Few newspaper readers need to worry much yet about Sims's work,
though in due course it is likely to prove invaluable in
scrutinizing the rules that central banks adopt to pursue their
policies. ``The overall conclusion might be that the aim of good
monetary policy should be to make monetary policy unimportant to
the business cycle, and that postwar US monetary policy has largely
succeeded in this respect,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Temin, in sorting though the causes ordinarily assigned to
each of the 24 recessions since 1890, produced a model of writing
about economics for the intelligent layperson that deserves a wide
circulation. He prepared the kind of table (which appears with this
column) that makes for good Sunday newspaper reading as well.
</P>
<P>
   With data produced by Christina Romer of the University of
California at Berkeley, he divided the history of the business
cycle during the last century into three periods of eight cycles
each, then proceeded to classify their causes.
</P>
<P>
   His ostensible target was the laugh-line caricature of his
colorful MIT colleague, Rudiger Dornbusch: ``None of the US
expansions of the past 40 years died in bed of old age; every one
was murdered by the Federal Reserve.'' His deeper topic was that
thorny question: How much discretion does a central banker really
have?
</P>
<P>
   Temin divided his busines cycles into four distinct types.
Either they were real shocks _ domestic ones (such as the
debt-ceiling recession of 1958, the Vietnam winddown recession of
1970), or foreign (such as the Armistice depression of 1921 and the
two oil price hikes of the 1970s). Or else they were monetary
shocks _ domestic (such as the budgetary stringency following the
payment of the second Soldier Bonus of 1937, the unanticipated
monetary tightening of 1960, the Volcker battle against inflation
in 1981) or foreign (such as the Panic of 1907 or the external gold
drain that led the Fed to tighten sharply in 1931).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each of the three periods exhibits its own special
characteristics: Those from 1890 until World War I tended to be
frequent and abrupt; those of the years between the wars were
unprecedented in their severity, ``contractions'' rather than
``panics.'' The business cycle of the postwar years lived up to its
reputation: gentler, less frequent events, in general deserving of
the term ``recession.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper itself dwells mainly on the four largest cycles: the
short, sharp depression following 1920, and the three phases of the
Great Depression of the 1930s. The next largest cycle occurred in
1973, when the oil-producing nations quadrupled the price of crude
oil overnight, and the Fed tightened to limit the resulting
inflation. A useful appendix contains short narratives of the 10
smallest cycles of the past century.
</P>
<P>
   Temin's punchline had to do with adding the cycles up after
enumerating them. There are about the same number of real and
monetary causes, slightly more real, he found. When he added up the
lost production (the number of months it took for production to
return to its previous peak) stemming from each, the balance was a
little less even: Real shocks, domestic and foreign, led to 25.8
months of lost production, while monetary shock of both sorts cost
the economy a total of 44 months of output. His conclusion: There
is no support at all in the literature for Dornbusch's harsh
indictment of the Fed. There are many causes of the business cycle,
not just one.
</P>
<P>
   As the economists went on debating the intricacies of
interpreting time-series data, I found my mind wandering back to
the present day. What clue did Temin's table offer those of us who
are worried mainly about the current expansion, now into its eighth
year? Suppose that the world economy entered a new and different
era starting about 1989, for example, as different from the past as
was the period beginning in 1945 from that of 1914; what might be
conjectured about the pattern the business cycle is likely to
exhibit during the next 25 years?
</P>
<P>
   The best recession, it is generally agreed, is a short and
shallow one, like the still-mysterious decline that accompanied the
Gulf War in 1991. Suppose the US economy is in for a widely spaced
series of these _ three or four relatively mild events in the next
quarter century?
</P>
<P>
   What, then, about the timing of the next event? At one point, I
doodled in 1999 on my table. Benjamin Friedman, a wiser man than me
_ he was at Morgan Stanley before he returned to Harvard as
professor of money _ looked quizzical, penciled 2001, and shrugged.
It seemed as good a guess as any, and better than most.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flood watches were posted Friday morning for southeast Texas as
a tropical disturbance over the Gulf of Mexico came ashore.
Saturday, the moisture-laden system will douse parts of central and
south Texas with heavy rains, heightening the risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms, possibly severe, will erupt from western Nebraska
to eastern Montana and Wyoming as moist air flowing from the
southeast behind a cool front stalled over the Middle West is
forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Farther east along the front,
clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop from south
Nebraska to the lower Ohio Valley as humid, warm air rises rapidly
after intercepting the front.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, will forge
east from the upper Ohio Valley into West Virginia and western
Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon as a jet stream disturbance
lifts increasingly humid air arriving on southerly winds. Showers
and storms will then scale the central Appalachians and head toward
the Middle Atlantic Seaboard later this evening and tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will escort a slow-moving
cool front into western New England and western New York on
Saturday afternoon and evening. The phalanx of showers and storms
will press toward the New England Coast on Saturday night and early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hit-or-miss showers and thunderstorms will erupt along a
sea-breeze front pressing into eastern Florida from the Atlantic.
Rains will be spotty and lightning from storms could spark
additional wildfires. &QL;

<P>
   Focus: Record Peak Wind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A severe thunderstorm lashed the airport at Jacksonville, Fla.,
with a gust of 77 mph Thursday, setting an all-time record peak
wind for July. Despite Jacksonville's coastal location, hurricanes
do not figure prominently on the city's list of strongest winds.
Like a turtle withdrawing into its shell for protection, the
coastline near Jacksonville bows as far west as any point on the
entire East Coast. Indeed, Jacksonville lies farther west than
Pittsburgh, Pa. Thus, most northward-curving hurricanes either hit
south Florida or pass safely to the east over the ocean.  &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) -The Chevrolet Astro is a box on wheels, a simple,
rugged device that has more in common with the Chevy van of the
'60s than it does with the popular front-drive minivans of today.
</P>
<P>
   As a rear-drive van with a truck frame, the Astro (and its
General Motors Corp. sibling, Safari) is also a survivor. It's the
last of its breed now that Ford Aerostar has gotten the ax. All the
other small vans are hybrid minivans, based on car chassis and
pulled by their front wheels, including Chevy's own Venture and
Ford's Windstar.
</P>
<P>
   Because Astro's handling and driveability are subpar compared
with the carlike minivan herd, some drivers brand it a throwback.
Indeed, the Astro seems to have missed the minivan revolution,
soldiering on with the clumsy handling, body sway and bounding ride
of an earlier generation of vans.
</P>
<P>
   But that's missing the point. The Astro is not trying to be a
car with cargo space, like the front-drivers, but a small truck
that can be used like a car.

   Astro is slightly bigger and significantly stronger than the
competition, with greater cargo capacity and enough towing muscle
to handle a 5,500-pound trailer, which would include many boats and
horse trailers. That's the beauty of the Astro and Safari, allowing
them to be used like full-size vans without the driver having to
shoulder such a big, unwieldy vehicle through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are those drivers who like the driving feel and
security of a truck, rather than the softer ride of a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful V-6, truck frame and rear-wheel drive provide the
extra towing and cargo utility, and many Astros serve as work
trucks and delivery vans. Our test Astro, an upscale LS version,
was equipped with optional all-wheel-drive, increasing its
usefulness on dirt roads and under snowy conditions, as well as
enhancing its maneuverability on slick surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the ride height and a certain level of roughness,
drivers and as many as seven passengers, depending on
configuration, should find the interior of the Astro as
accommodating as any minivan. The wheel wells intrude on foot space
up front, but cargo space behind the rear bench seat is superior to
the minis.
</P>
<P>
   The optional rear ``Dutch door'' tailgate is a mixed blessing.
Although it provides improved access for loading and unloading, it
can be a pain to open or close with your hands full. Also, Astro
and Safari fall short in the door wars, providing no second door on
the left side for rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The front-end styling changes lack the panache and individuality
of the old design.
</P>
<P>
   Cornering this high-profile truck can be dicey, requiring
moderation in speed and adding to the sense of driving a big van.
The steering is relatively quick, which seems odd considering the
limited handling capabilities. The brakes are effective, with
standard anti-lock technology.
</P>
<P>
   The driver sits high above the asphalt, requiring an extra
built-in step for climbing aboard, and some people may feel that
they're piloting a big cargo van rather than a lightweight truck.
The dashboard is high and the windshield seems small.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is sensibly designed, with simple, accessible
gauges and switches in familiar Chevy style and configuration. The
upgraded stereo with CD, which included rear-seat controls, sounded
great. Seating is comfortable, though the bench seat in the back
has limited legroom, and there are plenty of nooks and cubbies for
stowage.
</P>
<P>
   The Astro and Safari have been around since the early days of
minivans, and although they are clumsy and rough riding, they do
provide an alternative for people who need extra space, cargo
capacity or towing strength. And in that respect, they pretty much
stand alone. &QL;

HOW TO FOLLOW YOUR DREAM _ AND STILL EAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday being Independence Day, imagine being free to follow
your heart's desire when it comes to a career.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us has tucked away a mental picture of the work we'd
really like to do _ if only we didn't feel obligated to bring home
a certain salary.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a whole cottage industry of books, tapes and
seminars on finding your true calling.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you already know what your true calling is, you just
don't know how to make enough money to live while doing it? How do
you ``follow your bliss'' and still eat?
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jacobson can tell you. A New York-based singer, writer,
Cantorial student and mother, she is also a self-taught expert at
the art of the ``survival job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Jacobson, 31, has parlayed her experiences into a guide
called, ``Survival Jobs; 154 ways to make money while pursuing your
dreams.'' (Broadway Books, 1998, $14.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always looking for something more interesting,
high-paying and flexible than waiting tables,'' she said, of her
days as a starving artist. During one period, she was so broke
she'd walk 40 or 50 blocks to save subway fare.
</P>
<P>
   By her count, Jacobson has already worked at about 27 part-time,
flexible jobs while pursuing her creative interests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she talked to dozens of other artists, actors, and
creative types to gather other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a book that includes jobs from seasonal accounting
to secret shopping that are flexible, and even fun. But most
importantly, they leave you time to do your ``real work.'' The key
is to find jobs that match your personality and your needs using
skills you've already got, or can get quickly, she said. If you
need your days free for auditions, or you do your best writing in
the morning, then look for jobs you can do in the evenings. Some
jobs with maximum scheduling flexibility include limousine driver,
airport employee, real estate appraiser, concierge, or focus group
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   If you're trying to break into show biz and want to network, try
being a script reader, casting session camera operator, location
manager, cruise ship performer, box office manager, or personal
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   There are jobs for all personality types. If you're not shy, you
could be an audience recruiter, city tour guide, food demonstrator,
makeup artist, or _ for the truly uninhibited _ an artist's model.
If you'd rather be your own boss, try managing apartments, becoming
a massage therapist, operating a mail-order business, or doing
event-planning.
</P>
<P>
   The guide tells people how to break in, how much they can expect
to earn, and the pros and cons of each job.
</P>
<P>
   Take catering, for example. The benefits of working for a
caterer are a decent salary (up to $18 an hour) and the chance to
see varied locations, and meet interesting people. The food is
good, too. Hours are flexible, usually nights and weekends.
Drawbacks are the physical demands, and unsteady nature of the
work. To break in you usually need restaurant or food experience,
and a tuxedo uniform.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not your cup of tea, you could try open-house sitting
for Realtors. Sitters hand out information about the property to
visitors. The pay is $8 to $10 an hour. Hours are usually weekends.
Benefits _ you can catch up on your reading or correspondence
during slow times. Contact real estate companies to get started.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Jacobson did time as a karaoke performer for
corporate parties and even a stint as a matchmaker's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a glorified telemarketer,'' she said. ``I had to ask
people all kinds of personal questions and get them to sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those interviews, however, that gave her the idea
for one of her favorite survival jobs _ walking dogs for other
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can easily make $500 per week, part-time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's experiences led her to self-publish a book and lead
seminars, (survival job no. 96) on making money for actors. Her
self-published venture ended up as a Book of the Month Club
selection, and eventually landed her a publisher (Survival job no.
136 _ freelance writer.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, when she talks about survival jobs, it's not just to
starving artists. There are all kinds of people who want more
flexible work arrangements, she said. Students, new parents, and
retirees are all looking for ways to make money without
compromising their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Many people start a survival job, and discover they love it
enough to do it full-time, she said. Others work several survival
jobs at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of freedom from having your income from more
than one source,'' she said. ``Never give up on your dreams. There
are so many fun, creative, interesting ways to make money, there's
no reason to work at a job you despise.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Sandal Chase
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a mad scramble,'' said Ellen Tien, a writer in
Manhattan, who is the envy of her friends for snaring not one, but
two pairs of Hermes' most sought-after sandal _ the Quebrar. The
wooden-heel sandal, a luxury take on the classic Dr. Scholl's, came
out this season in black, gold, maroon and natural for $195 at
Hermes boutiques. By now, they're virtually sold out. But hopeful
shoppers still drop by the store at 57th Street (Fifth Avenue) to
scoop up a returned pair or dial Hermes shops from California to
Paris. Ellen Niven, Hermes' publicity director, suggests calling
the Hermes help line, (800) 441-4488, to track down Quebrars ``in
whatever corner of the world they're left,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a Snip and a Snack
</P>
<P>
   ``One part salon, one part cafe, one part cocktail lounge.''
That's the official description of Tonic, a mixture of unisex hair
salon and cafe, which opened six months ago at 107 Norfolk St.,
between Delancey and Rivington Streets. It is the latest consumer
space turned into a place to hang out, like gym restaurants and
bookstore-coffee bars. John Sarefield, an owner of Tonic, explained
the logic of making a salon the first and last destination of an
evening. ``You go to a salon or a cafe to gossip,'' he said. ``You
go to a salon to look good, then to a cafe to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A glass wall separates the sipping from the snipping. Haircuts
are $55, and a lunch of a turkey Reuben sandwich and chips is $5.
Besides Indian-style tea spiked with St. John's wort, the cafe also
offers movies on Mondays, comedy on Tuesdays and music Wednesdays
through Fridays. There are weekly swing-dance lessons, tarot and
numerology readings, massages and book groups.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons include locals, who showed up one recent movie night
in anything from Rollerblades to suede clam diggers, and uptowners
drawn by this summer's sold-out jazz series. Nor is Tonic alone.
White, a salon in Miami Beach has a sidewalk cafe, and so does the
Burke Williams Salon in Los Angeles. Tonic's hair-salon is open
Wednesday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; weekends, 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. Appointments: (212) 358-7501.
</P>
<P>
   Online Shop With Attitude
</P>
<P>
   For those times when a style-minded young woman has nothing to
wear and no time to trek to the stores, Laura Eisman created
Girlshop, a new Web site with nine online ``boutiques''
(www.girlshop.com). Ms. Eisman offers only her favorites: Pixie
Yates, Amy Chan Handbags, Selima Optique, Ellen for Le Corset
Lingerie, Tony &AMP; Tina nail polish and other designers who appeal to
``stylish urban girls ages 18 to 35,'' she said. ``It's like making
a trip to SoHo without leaving your office.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike more staid online shopping sites, Girlshop projects a
sassy charm with clothing descriptions like ``cleavage city for
anyone with a generous bra size'' for a strapless dress by Jussara
Lee. The site's logo shows a bemused shopper wearing only blue
underwear, floral shoes and a red purse. For fashion emergencies,
there is same-day delivery service in Manhattan. A ``Show a
Friend'' feature allows browsers to e-mail an image of a possible
purchase for a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Online sample sales are in the works, and by the end of summer,
a registry will be available to inform loved ones of good ideas for
gifts, along with a search feature, which will scan boutiques
looking for, say, the perfect black bootleg pants.
</P>
<P>
   The Message Is the Logo
</P>
<P>
   Stylish urbanites are turning toward Mecca. Mecca, U.S.A., that
is, a line of T-shirts, jeans and other sportswear that is winning
over young logo lovers once faithful to Tommy Hilfiger and Polo.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Harrell, 26, head designer of Mecca, said the brand name
is not a religious statement. ``We look at Mecca as a state of
mind,'' he said. ``Our customers like to affiliate themselves with
status. You get tired of seeing Polo and Tommy. We filled that
void.'' Mecca, started in 1995, has been followed by other
urban-inspired lines like FUBU (For Us, By Us) and Enyce. Mecca
began by selling hip-hop clothes in Brooklyn and Harlem and spread
from there. ``They're worn by snowboarders and surfers,'' said Ting
Mintz, a fashion commentator on ``Inside Design,'' a cable
television show. Harrell said Mecca is also popular in London and
Japan. T-shirts sell in New York for $22 to $28 at Foot Locker,
Champs, Dr. J's, Jimmy Jazz, and Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   A Peep Into the Pi Perplex
</P>
<P>
   Why pi? New Yorkers may be forgiven if they're perplexed to see
that the mathematical symbol used for calculating the area of a
circle has been stamped on sidewalks all over the city. The
graffiti are the work of Darren Aronofsky, a filmmaker, who has
found an unusual way to promote ``Pi: the Movie,'' his thriller,
which opens July 12. The film, about a mathematician who unlocks
the secret of the stock market, is only one piece of an unlikely pi
trend. ``The Joy of Pi,'' a book by David Blatner (Walker &AMP; Co.,
1997) includes a history of attempts to calculate the infinite
number (3.14159265 etc.), pi jokes and odd factoids. For instance,
Spock of ``Star Trek'' once foiled an evil computer by ordering it
to ``compute to the last digit the value of pi.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to smell like the president of the math club,
Parfums Givenchy is releasing Pi, a men's fragrance, in the United
States in the fall. The French perfumer describes it as ``a salute
to the sex appeal of intelligence.'' Still baffled by the pi craze?
``People are looking for keys to uncover the secrets of life,''
Aronofsky offered. ``Pi is being rediscovered as a way to look at
the universe and find possible answers to the eternal questions.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second quarter was pretty rocky for equity managers, but not
for Investment Advisers Inc. of Minneapolis and two of its
previously obscure and undistinguished mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   From out of nowhere, the IAI Balanced fund gained 10.8 percent,
making it the seventh-best performer in the quarter of all stock
funds listed in the tables in The New York Times and the best
domestic hybrid fund over all. A sister fund, IAI Value, which is
too to be listed, did even better, rising 24.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, numbers like those would prompt a fund manager to
crow. Yet the managers in Minneapolis have refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for their silence, the sudden spurt in the
fortunes of IAI, which is owned by Lloyd's TSB Group PLC, should
serve to remind investors of a mutual fund truism: numbers alone
rarely tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of these funds, the sharp rise seems to stem largely
_ and perhaps almost entirely for the Value fund _ from investments
in a tiny, money-losing telecommunications company, Pathnet Inc.,
which filed a proposal in early May with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   That filing holds great potential for shareholders of the IAI
funds, but also a great deal of peril.
</P>
<P>
   When IAI managers recalculated the worth of their Pathnet
holdings to reflect the possibility of the initial public offering,
IAI Value's net asset value ballooned by 28 percent (italics)in a
single day.(end italics) IAI Balanced rose by 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But putting a value on stock not issued is problematic and the
estimate used by the fund managers could be way off. Moreover, the
stock offering may not occur at all. And if it does, the terms of
the funds' investments restrict managers' ability to quickly sell
their stakes and thus their chances to capitalize on any early
bounce in the stock's price.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, as of early May, Pathnet securities represented 26
percent of the Value fund's holdings, an extraordinarily high
percentage for one security, let alone an illiquid one.
</P>
<P>
   The IAI managers seem to understand the delicacy of their
situation. Value fund shareholders were told of the increased
valuation of the Pathnet holdings in a May 12 supplement to their
prospectus that was crammed with caveats. They were also told that
the Value fund was closed to new investors. The Balanced fund,
which has a much smaller holding in Pathnet, remains open.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Pathnet filing, Value had generally underperformed its
peer group of small-cap value funds since its inception in 1983.
Balanced had more or less tracked its peers over its life.
</P>
<P>
   The Value fund, which invests primarily in equities that its
managers see as undervalued, had about $27 million in assets at the
end of March. The Balanced fund, which has a diversified portfolio
of stocks, bonds and short-term money instruments, had just over
$32 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The funds' share prices shot up in early May, after Pathnet's
proposal to offer to the public as much as $100 million worth of
stock in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although no target prices were mentioned in the filing, board
members at both funds felt compelled to restate the value of their
Pathnet holdings, although they have not disclosed specific
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Pathnet is not the only closely held security in the Value
fund's portfolio. As of May 11, the fund said, just over 36 percent
of its assets were nonpublic securities, and thus illiquid.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's managers went to great lengths detailing just how
risky the position in Pathnet is. The supplement listed 15 risk
factors, including the possibility that the public offering, to be
managed by Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Bear,
Stearns, might not happen.
</P>
<P>
   All of these points raise questions. Investors might find it
useful to know, for example, how the IAI managers got interested in
Pathnet in the first place, not to mention the other illiquid
securities in the Value fund's portfolio. (Pathnet is the only such
holding in the Balanced fund.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the funds, however, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   IAI is no stranger to venture capital investing. The company has
been raising money for such investments for 15 years, including
about $200 million for private venture funds, and it has placed
another $74 million of venture capital in some of its 15 mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   R. David Spreng, who heads the venture capital operations at
IAI, manages the private equity investments in the Value and
Balanced funds. He also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing with the SEC, Pathnet identifies IAI as having
been a stockholder from the moment of its birth as a company, in
August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might also wonder why a public fund is investing in
private placements. The IAI funds are hardly the first to do so.
``I can think of a number of funds, like Third Avenue Value, Equus
2 and Warburg Pincus Post Venture Capital, that have 5 to 10
percent of their assets in venture capital investments,'' said
Russel J. Kinnel, equity editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. But
such funds have had uneven track records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they work out well; sometimes they don't,'' said A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. ``The key
is to know your fund and to see if it has a history of successfully
investing in these sorts of products. If it does, then you could
perhaps say there is a repeatable skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what happens to the two IAI funds, and to IAI Value in
particular, will depend on how effectively the funds' boards have
valued the Pathnet securities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prospectus supplement, the Value fund said it
used a ``fair value'' methodology to assess its holdings in Pathnet
and other illiquid securities. A spokeswoman declined to provide
further details.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Killian, a portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital in
Greenwich, Conn., said fund boards are under no obligation to
disclose their valuation techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair value is the amount the fund might reasonably expect to
realize upon its current sale,'' she said. ``There is no single
standard'' for determining that value, she added. In other words,
it may be a shot in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that investors who choose to hold onto their IAI
funds will be left sitting with the current, sharply higher
valuation for some time. Yet there is little prospect that the
funds will be able to cash out in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The Value fund prospectus notes ``substantial
restrictions'' regarding its sale of Pathnet stock. The offering
underwriters ``have the ability to request that the fund not sell
or otherwise transfer stock during the 180-day period following the
effective date of the IPO,'' the supplement said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnel of Morningstar, said, ``It is quite unusual for a fund to
have this amount of its assets tied up for this long a period.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the IAI funds turn out to be more than one-quarter wonders?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the boards' minutes show this was a thoughtful pricing
decision, and that they had ample evidence to back it up,'' Lipper
said. ``If they don't, they could be wide open to potential
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   This much is sure. Investors in IAI Value, who in early May held
a diversified portfolio, now have a quarter of their money tied up
in what appears to be a speculative initial public offering, one
that may be effectively tethered to the fund for the near term.
There is nothing wrong with that, of course, as long as the
investors are aware of the risks.

<P>
   Ani DiFranco won't admit to any hidden messages in her new
album, ``Little Plastic Castle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really the way I write or think,'' DiFranco says.
``In my songs, I'm really just chronicling my experiences and
perceptions as I stumble through the world. Each album is like a
year in the life of Ani DiFranco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any message, it's about questioning everything in
the world and coming up with your own answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover of DiFranco's new CD depicts three goldfish, one
bearing the smiling face of DiFranco, swimming around a tiny
plastic castle in a fish bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say goldfish have no memory,'' DiFranco sings. ``I guess
their lives are much like mine/ And the little plastic castle/ Is a
surprise every time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Plastic Castle'' is the 12th album DiFranco has
released on Righteous Babe Records, the tiny label she founded at
age 20 in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco's grass-roots feminism and her powerful, poetic blend
of folk and rock have brought her an ever-widening audience.
Collectively, her albums have sold more than 800,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Her self-made career could be a model for the giant recording
labels she has spurned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen-year-old girls are basically what made the Beatles,''
DiFranco said. ``The people who market music have strayed from that
demographic for a long time, but now they're getting back to it.
They're realizing what a market force it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 13-year-old girls of today are a lot different than
they were in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFranco's last album, ``Living in Clip,'' was a stunning
collection of live recordings. If ``Living in Clip'' taught her
anything, it was that her studio albums lacked the dynamic punch of
live concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of putting together the live album was very
enlightening,'' DiFranco said by phone from a tour stop in
Pennsylvania. ``After listening to a whole lot of really
rough-and-ready live tapes, I realized that my songs sound much
better on stage than they do on albums.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Little Plastic Castle,'' DiFranco also invited more
collaboration with guest musicians. Among them was trumpeter and
avantgarde composer Jon Hassell, who has worked with the Talking
Heads, Brian Eno and k.d. lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge fan, so I called him and said, `Hi, it's little
Miss What's-her-face. Wanna play on my record?' ''
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise, Hassell said yes. In the studio, DiFranco let
the tape run for a half hour while she and Hassell performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about a 30-minute jam that went down, during which I
spoke the words to a poem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Pulse,'' the album's 14-minute closing track.
</P>
<P>
   Other collaborators on ``Little Plastic Castle'' included
bassist Sara Lee and drummer Jerry Marotta of the Indigo Girls'
band, as well as bassist Jason Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer is backing DiFranco on her current tour, along with
drummer Andy Stochansky and organist and accordionist Julie Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   While DiFranco is on the road, a dedicated staff keeps Righteous
Babe Records running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army back in Buffalo has really grown in ranks the last
couple of years,'' DiFranco said. ``There really are a lot of cool,
talented people there that kind of make it happen. (Fans) don't
realize what goes down at that place, just to keep a teeny little
record label running.''

CLINTON PRAISES JIANG AS LEADER WHO COULD BRING CHINA TO
DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton Friday called Jiang Zemin, the
president of China, a visionary leader who could be the figure who
brings China to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a news conference that closed his nine-day trip to
China, gave what amounted to a vigorous personal endorsement of the
Chinese president, saying Jiang had the imagination needed to
transform China from a single-party Communist state to a
pluralistic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The president also praised Premier Zhu Rongji, architect of
China's current economic policies, saying, ``There's a very good
chance that China has the right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sounded increasingly hopeful about China's future as
his trip progressed, offering his most optimistic assessment of the
nation's political prospects just before departing to return to
Washington to celebrate Independence Day. But Clinton's words could
come back to haunt him should repression in China harden, leaving
Clinton open to the charges that he was taken in by a seemingly
open Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there will ever be democracy in China, Clinton
said, ``Oh, yes. I believe there can be, and I believe there will
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what I would like to see is the present government, headed
by this president and this premier, who are clearly committed to
reform, ride the wave of change and take China fully into the 21st
century and basically dismantle the resistance to it,'' he added.
``I believe they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The president answered questions for 43 minutes, most of them on
his trip to China but others touching on the troubled Japanese
economy, the prospect of violence in Ireland this weekend and the
continuing ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered an overwhelmingly positive summation of his
five-city journey through China.
</P>
<P>
   He said that profound differences remained between China on the
United States on questions of individual liberty, and he warned
that powerful forces still oppose change here.
</P>
<P>
   But he defended his engagement with the Chinese leadership as
the course most likely to yield progress on a range of issues from
human rights to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The coming months and years will tell whether these few days in
early summer were the beginning of a positive new epoch in
relations between the United States and China or merely a sidestep
in an ambiguous relationship. There are groups in both countries
with a political investment in confrontation rather than
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton and Jiang say or do as their nations' leaders,
they are but one part of a complex interplay between two diverse
and dynamic societies, a nexus that will be shaped as much by
transnational corporations, the media, the church, and even the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to reflect that diversity in his appearances here,
meeting with villagers, middle-class homeowners, young
entrepreneurs, scholars and students.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the president's schedule was any session with
outspoken opponents of the government. Clinton defended that
decision Friday, saying that he sought to deal with human rights
concerns in China ``in a way most likely to yield progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best to meet with people who represented all elements
of Chinese society,'' Clinton said. ``The decisions I made on this
trip _ and, I remind you, the first trip by an American president
in a decade _ about with whom to meet and how to handle it were
basically designed, were based on my best judgment about what would
be most effective in expanding human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said that Clinton did not want to
risk retaliation against those who met with him and that he
believed that pressing Jiang to release groups of political
prisoners would be more effective than a theatrical encounter with
dissidents.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking weary from a grueling schedule, said in his
opening remarks that his trip to China _ the longest of his
presidency to a single country _ had shown him ``the glory of
China's past in Xian, the vibrancy of its present in Beijing and
the promise of its future in Shanghai and Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to
appreciate the remarkable transformation that is underway in China,
as well as the distance still to be traveled,'' the president said
in the news conference, held in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt
hotel in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly was struck by the city's wealth and vitality, and
said the region, which reverted to Chinese control just a year ago,
could be the model of China's development.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his most extensive assessment of Jiang and Zhu, praising
them in elaborate language.
</P>
<P>
   The president said of Jiang: ``After I met with him for the
first time, I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming the
leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because he's
a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigor
for his age, or indeed for any age. And I think he has a quality
that is profoundly important at this moment in history when there's
so much change going on. He has a good imagination. He has vision.
He can visualize. He can imagine a future that is different from
the present.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton acknowledged that Jiang has
``constituencies'' who oppose him and who distrust U.S. motives in
engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Clinton said: ``I hope more of them understand that
America wishes China well, that we are not bent on containing China
and that our human rights policy is not an excuse for some larger
strategic motive. It's what we really believe. We believe it's
morally right, and we believe it's best for them as a practical
matter over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question, he noted that ``democracy is a
universal aspiration,'' an answer to Jiang's assertion that China's
history and culture have led it to different definitions of human
rights from those accepted in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The president welcomed the recent release of several well-known
dissidents, but said that he now looked to Beijing to release whole
classes of prisoners. He particularly cited the 150 people still
held on charges related to the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations that were brutally put down by the government in
June 1989. He also called on Beijing to release an unknown number
of prisoners held for political activities that the government has
declared no longer criminal.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had raised with Jiang charges that China imposes
abortion on women to enforce China's one-child policy. ``They all
say the same thing,'' Clinton said. ``They say that that is not
Chinese policy, and it violates Chinese policy.'' Clinton added
that his view was that ``there may be an insufficient monitoring of
what's being done beyond the capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offended many in Taiwan this week when he repeated
Beijing's preferred formulation of U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which
Beijing considers a breakaway province. But he defended his
decision, saying that he had not changed the substance of U.S.
policy, which is to oppose Taiwanese independence and support
peaceful reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I did the right thing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from a reporter from the Irish Times,
Clinton deplored the recent burnings of churches in Ireland and
called for high-level talks among Catholic, Protestant and British
authorities in advance of the annual sectarian marches scheduled
for this weekend that have led to violence in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered tempered praise for a package of banking and
financial reforms announced by Tokyo in recent days. He said that
Japan's economy had substantial underlying strength and expressed
hope that the recession there would bottom out soon and growth
would resume ``in a reasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, the president offered nothing beyond a hope that
Belgrade would show restraint. ``There is some uncertainty about
who is willing and who is not willing to even negotiate about it,''
Clinton said. ``And we're working on it as best we can.''

JOHN FOGERTY: COUNTERCULTURE ROCKER RECLAIMS HIS HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Northern California has a river delta, but it's
nothing like the one depicted in the stage set John Fogerty used
here at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. As evocative of
humidity as the Sacramento River delta near Fogerty's hometown, El
Cerrito, replete with friendly-looking alligators, tin shacks and a
devilish moon, the scene was also unabashedly fake.
</P>
<P>
   It served as a tacit acknowledgment that the mythic Southern
narrative Fogerty has explored since the late 1960s, the riverboat
dream of ``Proud Mary'' and the voodoo hallucination of ``Born on
the Bayou,'' was a tall tale from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   This admission hardly diminished Fogerty's commitment to that
landscape, which he is celebrating with a new live album and a tour
dominated by classic songs from his years leading Creedence
Clearwater Revival. As the counterculture's most avid roots rocker,
Fogerty understood that the blues-based language of the crossroads
was mobile enough to penetrate the consciousness of any American.
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty made blues-based rock his own by matching
bluegrass-inspired speed with juke joint languor, taking both up a
notch with a young rocker's passion. He excavated the Southern
themes that connected to his own life in a working-class community
and the alienation that led to the tumult of the 1960s. A song like
``Green River,'' one of many he performed from the Creedence era,
is typically universal: Fogerty may have been imagining Louisiana
when he wrote its riff, reminiscent of the 12-bar blues, and its
lyric about dank magical waters, but he touched on the menacing
mysteries at the edge of every town where the privileged and the
dispossessed uneasily reside.
</P>
<P>
   The menace in Fogerty's writing enriches it, but in concert he
emphasized its brighter tones. Partly, he was toasting himself.
After many years during which legal conflicts over ownership and
personal bitterness caused him to ignore his greatest songs, he has
reclaimed them.
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty's awareness of his own talents as a songwriter and
guitarist was obvious; his band stayed almost entirely in the
background as he took extended solos on nearly every song,
strutting around the stage and unleashing killer leads that
recalled another resilient counterculture hero, Neil Young.
</P>
<P>
   Often his act grew too heavy, for example, when he mugged and
gestured, pretending to take requests, or led fans through a
sing-along on ``Those Old Cotton Fields Back Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty could use some onstage time in the foggier corners of
the bog, since that's where myths grow richest. Yet the crowd of
New Yorkers who cheered his corny comments didn't miss the shadows.
They were just happy to be transported back to the swamps of
Fogerty's, and their own, invention.

FLAWS OR VALUE IN CLOSED-END FUNDS? 
</HEADLINE>

and Net asset value will be sent to NYT graphic clients.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By RICK GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With closed-end funds developing a reputation as a dysfunctional
branch of the fund family tree, shareholder activists have grown
restive. That's fine with some analysts, who feel that helps make
many such funds look like bargains as of late.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their mutual fund cousins, which continually offer new
shares for sale, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares
that trade in the same way as the stocks of ordinary companies.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons _ high management fees, tax liabilities, lack
of marketing or just generally poor performance _ the market value
of closed-end fund shares is often less than the net asset value, a
gap known as the discount.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, even as the stock market has advanced, that
discount has stubbornly remained or widened at many equity funds,
goading activist shareholders to rebel with lawsuits and proxy
fights seeking to evict managers. Closed-end funds that invest
abroad, particularly in economically ravaged Asia, have suffered
steep losses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely because of these problems that the $150
billion closed-end fund industry appears to offer interesting
opportunities for investors. In the view of some market
strategists, the industry's problems have left the shares
underpriced.
</P>
<P>
   Following are four closed-end fund situations _ and selected
funds _ in which industry experts say investors may find bargains: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many other funds with the words ``emerging markets'' in
their names, the Emerging Markets Infrastructure fund was hurt in
the latest round of Asian economic problems and is trading near its
52-week low, at a discount of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the slide is based more on perception than reality. The fund
has little money in Asia, but has more in Eastern Europe, the
Middle East and particularly Latin America, with heavy emphasis on
Brazil, where privatization of telecommunications and energy
companies is expected to reward investors.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's chief investment officer, Richard Watt, is credited
with minimizing its Asian exposure _ the fund has more money in
Israel than in Taiwan, its biggest Asian holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has managed to steer clear of the downdraft,
with the exception of the contagion effect,'' said Doug Beck,
senior global equity funds analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Porter, a senior analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said
the discount, combined with increased potential for growth in
places where the fund has invested, meant that ``there's almost a
double discount.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April, the board of the Mentor Income fund cut the monthly
dividend for the first time in 36 months to reflect declines in
seven-year Treasury bonds. The cut, to 6 cents from 7 cents a
share, alarmed investors who had bought the fund because of its
concentration in high-quality debt securities and its objective of
producing high monthly income.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders reacted by selling aggressively. As a result,
Mentor's discount increased to more than 14 percent. Thomas
Herzfeld, chairman and president of a Miami investment firm that
specializes in closed-end funds, said he expects the discount to
narrow to 5 percent as investors conclude that the selloff was
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had here was very typical behavior when a dividend is
cut,'' he said. ``Investors immediately sell shares, thinking
something's wrong, and they generally wind up selling them too
cheap.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year-old Dessauer Global Equity fund, founded by John
Dessauer, a fund commentator, offers a unique provision, known as a
``hard trigger,'' aimed at eliminating any discount. The fund will
automatically convert to a mutual fund if, starting in December,
the shares trade at a discount of at least 5 percent on the last
business day of any week and for each of the next 14 business days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that the fund's share price cannot linger
at a deep discount for long,'' Dessauer, who is also co-manager of
the fund, wrote in the annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The discount was recently as wide as 8.1 percent, which may
prompt investors to buy in, knowing that it is guaranteed to go to
zero. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin fund, run by
Herzfeld, is that it invests entirely in companies likely to
benefit from economic advances in the Caribbean, particularly if
relations between Cuba and the United States are normalized.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's biggest investment is Florida East Coast Industries,
which has risen 20 percent this year. The company operates a
railway that, after normalization, would virtually monopolize
shipments of Cuba-bound American goods to Florida ports.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is highly sensitive to news events. Last March, for
example, when President Clinton eased some provisions of the
35-year-old ban on commerce and financial aid to Cuba, the shares
shot up, going from a 10 percent discount to a 13 percent premium.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have since weakened to a 6.8 percent discount. But
Herzfeld said he was confident that the shares would go to a
premium again.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that Herzfeld might be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund invests in a way that no other fund invests and that
no index can possibly measure,'' said Gregg Wolper, the closed-end
fund editor at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in
Chicago. ``But it hasn't done a bad job of stock-picking.''

CRACKER JACK: A CLASSIC IN SEARCH OF ITS FORMER GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Neb., Ohio)  (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphics clients.

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Ill. _ Poor old Cracker Jack. After more than 100
years in the marketplace, becoming the snack-food industry's
version of a national treasure, it has been suffering a credibility
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the peanuts. One consumer from San Juan
Capistrano, Calif., complained in an April letter to the company
that he had counted just five peanuts in his jumbo box of Cracker
Jack. ``Did the machinery goof up,'' he inquired, ``or has the
profit margin taken its toll?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you sell this as `Original Cracker Jack,''' demanded a
Florida couple, who wound up with no peanuts at all, ``when it is
only two-thirds of the original recipe?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of letter-writers criticized Cracker Jack for tasting
stale or even burned. And then, the crowning indignity: ``When I
got home, I opened the box and searched, and searched and searched
for my toy surprise,'' reported a woman from Omaha, Neb. ``I got a
different surprise ... NO PRIZE inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the tone of the mail, Cracker Jack's image, an
image historically so wholesome and all-American that it rated a
mention in the lyrics of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game,'' appears
headed the way of the daytime World Series game.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing that downfall is the challenge facing Frito-Lay, the
Pepsico division that acquired Cracker Jack from Borden Foods in
October, as it begins an all-out effort to rejuvenate this
venerable munchie.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Cracker Jack represents a tiny part of
Frito-Lay's business _ less than 1 percent of a projected $7.5
billion in 1998 sales _ but hopes are high. If all goes as planned,
said Beth Struckell, a vice president in charge of Cracker Jack, by
1999 sales should be four times the current $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Frito-Lay expects to do this with new packaging, better
distribution, marketing aimed at children and, yes, more peanuts.
It vows to have better prizes, and to get them into nearly every
box. But one thing it will not do _ fearful of alienating longtime
fans _ is risk a New Coke-type fiasco by tinkering too much with
the basic formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is, here's a brand that's been around forever,''
said Bill Pecoriello, an analyst who covers Pepsico. ``Frito-Lay is
going to be able to leverage its distribution system, and it will
also put its brand marketing behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, Frito-Lay executives concede, they have to fix the
quality issues and other problems dragging Cracker Jack down in the
marketplace. In the year ending May 24, sales plunged 25 percent
from a year earlier, according to Information Resources Inc., which
monitors supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchandisers like
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Borden, which took over Cracker Jack in 1964, insists
that its stewardship was actually pretty good. ``We were proud of
what we'd done with the brand, particularly over the last couple of
years,'' said a spokeswoman, Lynn Anderson. ``The technology we had
in our factory was rather advanced in insuring that there was a
prize in every package.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people at Borden's headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, were sad
to see Cracker Jack sold, along with Eagle Brand Condensed Milk and
some other well-known brands _ all part of a decision to focus
mostly on pasta and sauces. ``Our aim,'' Ms. Anderson said, ``was
to find somebody who could leverage the equity in the brand and for
whom it was a good fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Jack's new owners, confident that their sprawling
distribution network can easily deliver to stores of every size,
say it would be unwise to mess too much with a product that had
been a success for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing Cracker Jack would be the wrong thing to do,'' said
Ms. Struckell, who clearly admires much of what its inventors and
subsequent owners did to promote the snack, using everything from
little plastic toys to coupons and children's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Jack, according to a Borden pamphlet, rose from the
ashes of Chicago's Great Fire of 1871. F.W. Ruckheim, a German
immigrant who was among the thousands who came to the city to help
clean up the damage, began selling popcorn from a street corner in
his spare time. By 1893, when Chicago held its first world's fair,
Ruckheim and his brother, Louis, had come up with the recipe for a
concoction of molasses, peanuts and popcorn that they hawked to
millions of fairgoers. But it was not named _ legend has it _ until
1896, when a salesman sampled some and shouted, ``That's a cracker
jack!''
</P>
<P>
   Around 1918, cashing in on people's patriotism, Sailor Jack and
the rest of the packaging took on a red, white and blue color
scheme. ``In essence, we don't want to change,'' Ms. Struckell
said. ``We're not repositioning Cracker Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, nostalgia alone will not quadruple sales next year,
especially when only 7 percent of American households buy Cracker
Jack, and do so, on average, fewer than twice a year, according to
Frito-Lay's research. ``Consumers told us the reason they didn't
buy it was they couldn't find it or didn't see it,'' Ms. Struckell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the distribution problems will be relatively simple,
given Frito-Lay's elaborate array of trucks, vans and salespeople
who already know how to get products onto store shelves. So she and
her Cracker Jack marketing team have zeroed in on improving
quality, introducing a foil-lined, four-ounce bag along with the
traditional one-ounce cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   The bag has been test-marketed in the Chicago and Dallas areas,
and will be available nationwide by the end of this month. It is
supposed to keep the popcorn fresher, Ms. Struckell said, and just
in case, the freshness expiration date is clearly marked in the
upper-right-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   The company has begun using puffier popcorn, although the
coating for it has not been changed. There are more peanuts, at
least 20 to a four-ounce bag, and Frito-Lay has even started
packing the bags into shipping cartons upside down, which is
supposed to increase the likelihood that the peanuts won't be
concentrated in the bottom of the bag _ another thing that
irritates consumers. ``They liked that nut,'' Ms. Struckell said,
``but they wanted more, and they wanted them distributed more
evenly through the eating process.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Somewhat radically, Frito-Lay is trying to put Cracker Jack
alongside Oreos and M&AMP;M's, not other brands of sweetened popcorn.
Sales of popcorn snacks are growing, although still dwarfed by
cookies and candy in the American diet, according to NPD, a
research company. So Frito-Lay is seeing that it is placed not only
in the snack food aisle _ in the Chicago area, it is hung on the
sides of the big racks displaying Fritos, Tostitos and Baked Lay's
_ but also in the candy section.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a snackable treat, for hand-to-mouth, mindless nibbling
opportunities,'' Ms. Struckell said. ``People can continue to eat
it and not feel satiated. If you eat a whole bag of M&AMP;M's, you feel
disgusted with yourself.'' Ingredients like popcorn and peanuts
evoke health to many people, while chocolate is clearly a high-fat,
high-calorie choice, she added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, much of the marketing will be addressed to
young children, seeking to introduce them to a product many of them
may not have heard of. Frito-Lay's ``Planet Lunch'' marketing
program, which now consists of small bags of Lay's, Fritos and
other salty snacks, will feature small bags of Cracker Jack before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Making Cracker Jack appealing to children is a project Frito-Lay
takes extremely seriously. At a focus group in Northfield last
month, a group of fidgety 7- and 9-year-old boys, several of them
in Chicago Bulls T-shirts, were asked to rate a series of toys and
activities the company may use for prizes. ``Will this, like,
affect the company?'' asked a boy named Bradley, who, like the rest
of the group, had a good time with a folded-paper racing car that
could be blown around the conference table, but scorned a paper dog
tag and a bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups will eventually produce a list of possible prizes
(the car is already included in some Cracker Jack packages), which
will be tested again with other focus groups over the next several
months. Prize quality is a chief concern: The idea is to create
about five minutes of entertainment, which is not an easy task
given the short attention span of America's savvy children. ``It
was an ongoing challenge,'' Ms. Anderson said of Borden's
experience, ``particularly when you consider what kids are
confronted with in terms of stimulation on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Prize delivery is a separate issue _ and a thorny one. ``The
prize is part of the whole product expectation,'' said Ms.
Struckell, who has been trying to minimize the odds of someone not
getting a prize. ``We have been able to get the rate up to 99.7
percent,'' she said, ``but that means 3,000 people out of a million
aren't going to get that prize.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cracker Jack meets next year's optimistic sales goal _ 250
million bags and boxes _ that would mean 750,000 disappointed
customers. ``We will work to continually improve it,'' Ms.
Struckell said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, that whole question set to music in the old Jack
Gilford commercials _ ``What do you get when you open the top and
look inside and smack your lips and turn it over and spill it
out?'' _ will end with a different answer, one marketers won't find
so appealing.

CHAIRMAN SEEKS TO END UNCERTAINTY OVER CENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time Cendant Corp. announced in mid-April that it had
uncovered accounting irregularities that would reduce 1997 earnings
by as much as $115 million, Walter Forbes, Cendant's chairman, has
kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   And because Forbes' former company, CUC International, which was
merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant, was responsible for the
problems, investors have been questioning whether Forbes will take
over as chief executive in the year 2000. That is when he is
supposed to switch jobs with Henry Silverman, the chief executive
of Cendant and former chairman of HFS. The unusual agreement was
part of the merger of the two companies in December.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes said in an interview this week that speculation about
changes in Cendant's management succession was needlessly weighing
down the stock, which has recovered little since it dropped in
mid-April by 46 percent in one day, wiping out about $14.4 billion
in value. On Thursday, the shares closed at $21.5625, well below
their closing 52-week high of $41.375 in early April, shortly
before the announcement of the accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, questions remain about the accounting irregularities,
and they are expected to be answered by an audit report to be
completed this summer that will determine exactly how much the
company's 1997 earnings will be reduced. But Forbes said there
should be no question about his role in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to assume that I'm going anywhere, and I intend to
be CEO,'' said Forbes, a soft-spoken executive, who added that he
had maintained his low profile because that has always been his
style. ``I will be out talking more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people will be listening. Some Cendant shareholders have
said they are uncertain who will be running the company in two
years. David Brady, a senior portfolio manager at Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham, an investment firm that owns 5.5 million Cendant shares,
said that at a meeting with institutional shareholders in Chicago
in late May, Cendant managers said Forbes had indicated that he
might not be interested in the chief-executive job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, there is a lot of ambiguity as to who is going to
run the company in the year 2000, and I think that is true with
many institutional investors,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cendant, James Fingeroth, said the company
``could not account for why institutional investors may have
received that impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he had never suggested that he might not want the
chief executive job. To deprive him of the job, 80 percent of
Cendant's 28 directors _ 14 each from CUC and HFS _ would have to
vote to dismiss him. In that event, Forbes would be entitled to a
severance package that includes a lump-sum payment of $25 million
in cash, as well as a $10 million cash retirement benefit. Forbes,
however, said that he had the support of all the former CUC
directors on the Cendant board.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Silverman said the board ``has taken
zero action on any issues of governance or succession pending the
report of the audit committee,'' which is due this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Opinion varies among Cendant investors about whether Forbes
should become chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sit, a vice president at Sit Investment Associates in
Minneapolis, which owns 1.3 million Cendant shares, said there
should be no change in the current succession plan, although he,
like many others, said he was awaiting results of the audit to
learn the exact nature and extent of the accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Vergin, a portfolio manager for the Lutheran
Brotherhood, which owns 1 million Cendant shares, said he would be
skeptical about the company's prospects if Forbes were to take over
as chief executive as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe that he's going to come back and
run the company after this,'' Vergin said, referring to reports of
the accounting problems. ``It was his company, and he should have
known about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said last week that he did not know about the accounting
problems, which involved the way certain parts of Cendant's
business, formerly run by CUC, booked revenues and expenses. He
added that Cendant was not the first company to restate earnings,
and that such problems were difficult if not impossible to spot
from his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody who really thinks about it would expect
anybody at my level to know about it,'' Forbes said. ``I'm not an
accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cendant dismissed Cosmo Corigliano, a Cendant executive vice
president and former chief financial officer of CUC, shortly before
the accounting problems were announced. The company also announced
in April that two other top former CUC executives would resign from
Cendant: Kirk Shelton, one of the company's six vice chairmen, and
Amy Lipton, executive vice president and deputy general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he and Silverman continued to have a productive
business relationship. They decided to switch jobs in the year
2000, rather than follow the practice at other merged companies,
where co-chief executives are appointed, because ``we just felt
that co-anything is difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes added that at the time of the merger he expected to stay
with the company for five years, during which an internal candidate
would likely emerge as a logical successor.

SAMPRAS, IVANISEVIC BATTLE THEIR WAY TO SEMIFINAL VICTORIES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ They did it differently, but both had to do
it the hard way when it came time to fight their way into the
Wimbledon finale, a showplace where Pete Sampras and Goran
Ivanisevic last sent and stared daggers at each other back in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras buckled down and broke the host nation's heart by
ruining its dream of sending a homegrown gladiator on to ultimate
glory at Wimbledon. With his emotional 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 semifinal
defeat of Tim Henman, Sampras, already the custodian of four
Wimbledon trophies, is now one victory from equaling Bjorn Borg's
record five titles here, as well as tying Borg and Rod Laver's
overall collection of 11 slam crowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was playing Tim and the crowd, so obviously I
was going to show a little emotion,'' said Sampras, who hurled a
racquet into the stands after a Henman serve caused it to crumple
in the second game of the third set and later let go with a war
whoop after breaking Henman to claim that pivotal third set in its
12th game.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras' friendly battle with Henman, who failed in his
attempt to become Britain's first male finalist in 60 years but did
manage to steal the first set of the tournament from the defending
champion, was a minor epic compared to the three-hour, 22- minute
war with Richard Krajicek that sent Ivanisevic into his first slam
final in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, not known for his staying power in long matches,
refused to wilt and wound up breaking the spirit of Wimbledon's
1996 champion in a five-set potboiler that didn't end until the
Croat forced his victim to net a backhand volley on match point of
the final set's 28th game. Weary but wired after testing his
survival skills in a 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7(5-7), 15-13 semifinal, the
esoteric Ivanisevic, who talks to God when net cords fall in his
favor, is now one victory away from capturing his first slam
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play in the finals, I've been there, and I know
I just have to keep up with him, keep up and not let my mind go,''
said Ivanisevic, who insists he's armed himself mentally, with an
infusion of self-control, and physically, with the usual arsenal of
aces, to invalidate his reputation as the most talented player
never to collect a slam.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras leads his rivalry with Ivanisevic by a 10-6 margin and
hasn't lost to the Croat on a grass court since the 1992 Wimbledon
semifinal.In their straight set 1994 Wimbledon final and again in
the 1995 semifinals, Sampras had the last word.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't daunt the 26-year-old Croat: ``I want to play
Pete in the final,'' he said. ``He's going for the record, I'm
going for my first one, so he wants to win as badly as me. And I
think he's going to be nervous like me.'' But after his two-hour,
24-minute demolition of the 23-year-old Henman, Sampras isn't
likely to be as tired as the Croat.
</P>
<P>
   Friday it took Ivanisevic 28 aces, 120 successful sprints to the
net, three match points, and a 5-for-6 conversion rate on his break
chances to finally foil Krajicek, whose revival from the cusp of
extinction in the 4th set, where the Croat blew two match points on
his own serve, produced a 5th set that was, in Ivanisevic's
opinion, ``a horror thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic was serving for the match at 5-4, 40-15 of the 4th
set when, after having an apparent ace recalled as a let cord, he
glared up at the sky and stuck out his tongue and briefly lost his
tunnel vision. Krajicek saved the first match point with a slashing
backhand volley, and Ivanisevic undermined himself on the second
with a doublefault and went on to lose the game and the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Goran; the only thing that's predictable about him is
that he's unpredictable,'' said Krajicek, who was already on his
way to the net to shake Ivanisevic's hand when the unofficial ace
at match point was downgraded to a let cord.
</P>
<P>
   Once the 9th-seeded and sore-kneed Krajicek, who came into this
semifinal complaining that he ``wasn't a Marine'' but started to
play like one in the tie breaker, won the fourth set with a crisp
forehand volley, he found himself back on level ground in the match
for the first time since it started. And then, when he broke
Ivanisevic to take a 3-2 fifth set lead, he found himself in front
after two hours, 22 minutes of scrambling. But Krajicek's supremacy
was shortlived: four points later, Ivanisevic had broken the
Dutchman and knotted matters at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the final set, where Ivanisevic had the edge by serving first
but made life rough for himself with seven doublefaults, it was
Krajicek who encountered smoother sailing during his service games:
23 of his 42 aces were delivered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke me, I broke him, and since then I never saw somebody
serving like that in my life,'' said Ivanisevic, who set a
Wimbledon record last year with 46 aces in the second round. ``I
mean, it was just `Boom!' and I couldn't even react; even when I
picked the right side, I couldn't reach it. And I just said to
myself, `he has to miss a couple of first serves' and that's what
happened at 14-13.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final game, Ivanisevic crackled out a down-the-line
backhand pass to gain his third match point, and Krajicek, who
appeared discouraged about his ability to sneak out of a crisis at
15-40, netted a backhand volley and shook the Croat's hand for
real. Unlike Sampras, who tactfully refrained from joyful racquet
tosses and the like after downing the poker-faced Henman, the
exhausted yet exhilarated Ivanisevic hoisted his racquet, his
towels, and everything else that was within reach into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to hang in there mentally, and that's maybe the
difference between Goran this year and a couple years ago,'' said
Sampras, who sensed his own match with Henman was virtually over
once he took a two sets to one lead. ``When I won the third set, I
knew I had him,'' said Sampras, who broke Henman for the set with a
full-blown backhand pass that forced a netted backhand volley.
After building up an untroubled 5-3 lead in the final set, Sampras
used a 134 mph ace, his 16th of the match, to pound his point home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the finals, so my form has to be pretty good,'' said
the four-time champion, who complimented Henman as a future
Wimbledon champion. ``He'll eventually win this tournament one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But not this year.

MEDICARE REVAMPS SYSTEM OF PAYING NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Pa., Md., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government took a big step this week to make the business of
caring for elderly patients less lucrative, a setback for
hospitals, some nursing homes and home-care services. But oddly,
under cost-reduction rules that took effect July 1, Medicare
patients are likely to spend more days, not fewer, in nursing homes
and beds for acute care in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping patients longer will mean more money for efficient
nursing homes, which will now be paid on a per diem rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the new system will be costly for some hospitals. It will be
harder for a hospital to increase revenues from Medicare by
shifting patients from acute care to skilled nursing units within
the hospital. Medicare will now pay a per diem fee, instead of
paying on the basis of nursing-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare will also penalize hospitals that discharge certain
types of patients too quickly, as measured by national averages of
length of stay.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the big nursing-home chains are
prepared and even eager for the change, which Congress enacted last
year in the Balanced Budget Act. It will phase in day rates over
four years, replacing the old cost-based system. ``It's an
opportunity to make a clean profit by delivering the product for
less, rather than `run your costs up and we will pay you more,'''
said Jean Swenson, a health-care analyst at BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two big hospital companies, Vencor Inc. and Tenet
Healthcare, reduced their earnings estimates and said the Medicare
changes were partly responsible. Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the
biggest hospital chain, said it had adjusted estimates to take
account of the changes, ``but it clearly has cost them money,''
said Geoffrey Harris, a health-care analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Medicare plans to wring about $16 billion
over five years from its payments for care at home, the place where
most older people insist they want to stay. Deep cuts for home care
last January are already compounding other major problems for the
biggest home-care companies, Apria Healthcare and Olsten Corp.
Shares of Apria, where the chief financial officer resigned last
month, plummeted by more than 50 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home-care industry is in a state of chaos; the companies
are losing money like crazy,'' said John Hindelong, a vice
president of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   He said the exception was Lincare Holdings, a tightly controlled
company that has prospered despite Medicare cuts for its specialty,
home treatments for breathing ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated savings of $9.5
billion over five years from the changes in skilled-nursing
payments. The office said Medicare payments for nursing care were
$12.2 billion in 1997. That was about 10 percent of the industry's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The federal-state Medicaid program pays nearly half of
nursing-home bills but some states, flush with budget surpluses,
have loosened up on payments for Medicaid. And the Medicaid cuts in
last year's Balanced Budget Act will initially hurt hospitals more
than nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, for a change that is supposed to promote efficiency,
chains that formerly had high costs, like Beverly Enterprises, the
biggest nursing-home chain, will be rewarded, as the nursing-home
day rates, called prospective payments, are phased in over four
years. The new payments, which can be delayed to next January for
most publicly traded nursing chains, will initially be tied to a
company's costs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing chains like Health Care and Retirement that had lower
costs in 1995 may not do as well, Hindelong said. However, Health
Care and Retirement, which is merging with Manor Care, another
efficient chain, gets most of its revenue from private,
nongovernment insurers. ``Eventually they will all have to get
their costs down,'' he said, ``and all the publicly traded
nursing-home companies will be fine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hindelong recommends Beverly, based in Fort Smith, Ark. ``The
stock is cheap,'' he said, at only 14 times his estimate of next
year's earnings, compared with an average of 22 times estimated
1999 earnings for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, Beverly has cut back to 600 nursing homes
from 1,200, reduced the proportion of low-paying Medicaid residents
and hired its own rehabilitation therapists instead of relying on
outside specialists, like Novacare Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new payment system is a challenge for Novacare, an
independent provider of rehab services in nursing homes,
assisted-living centers and hospitals. Although there will be
higher per diem rates for Medicare patients who get certain types
of therapy, the institutions will try to spend as little as
possible on therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Novacare expects to reduce costs by repeating what it already
does to attract younger, managed-care patients in outpatient
clinics: assigning licensed therapists to supervise groups of
patients, rather than one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care economizing will spread to nursing homes, said Ms.
Swenson at BT Alex. Brown, as more Medicare participants join
health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends Novacare, based in King of Prussia, Pa., and
among the nursing chains, Genesis Health Ventures, based in Kennett
Square, Pa.; Integrated Health Services, based in Owings Mills,
Md.; and Centennial Health Care, a smaller company based in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harris at Salomon Smith Barney said the cuts reflected ``a
fundamental philosophical shift'' in government policy.
``Historically,'' he said, ``Medicare said that seniors were
entitled to certain benefits. The costs were measured and increased
each year. But with the Balanced Budget Act, the government is
shifting to a defined-contribution mentality much like corporate
America _ looking at dollar amounts and saying if costs go up
beyond a certain limit, the consumer will pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate payer is the Medicare recipient,'' Harris said.
``As in corporate America, employees are increasingly bearing the
cost.''

TOKYO TALKS OF TAX CUTS, BUT VAGUELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto suggested Friday that
Japan might adopt permanent tax cuts in an effort to revive the
economy and calm the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's suggestion, coming one day after Japan announced a
plan to cleanse onerous debts from its banking system, would
delight many investors. It would also please the U.S. government,
which has urged permanent tax cuts and other far-reaching measures
to strengthen the Japanese economy and reduce the risk that the
recession here will spread around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto's comment was vague, and on Wednesday, Kanezo
Muraoka, chief Cabinet secretary, temporarily chilled expectations
of a tax cut by saying that it would be discussed only after
parliamentary elections on July 12. Many foreign officials have
also learned to be wary, believing that Hashimoto sometimes is in a
position to promise more economic measures than he can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that tax-system reform will be implemented on a
permanent basis, rather than in the form of a temporary tax cut,''
Hashimoto told a news conference in Kumamoto, where he was
campaigning for July 12 elections in southwestern Japan. ``I
believe this will materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto said in April that the government would carry out a
one-time income tax cut of about $15 billion, atop a similar tax
cut earlier this year and another one effective in a couple of
months. On Friday, however, Hashimoto made no mention of the size
of the possible new tax cut, or whether the government would simply
turn the current temporary cuts into permanent ones. Some
economists are also skeptical that any tax cuts will be permanent,
because they say the government will be forced to raise taxes in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hashimoto's comments lifted the benchmark Nikkei
225 stock-market index, which was down at the opening by 160
points, the morning after the government disclosed a blueprint to
tackle the nation's bad debt problem. The index closed Friday at
16,511.24, up 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, from Thursday's close.
Other Asian markets finished lower, but the turnaround in Japan
helped European stock markets rally. U.S. markets were closed in
observance of Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   The yen zigzagged, rising to 138.20 yen against the dollar after
Hashimoto's remarks. The yen had weakened to 141.03 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's stock market has risen for eight straight days, partly
in anticipation of a tax cut and hopes that the government's
blueprint, called the Total Plan, will clean up the bad loan mess
in much the same way that the United States solved the crisis in
the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. Indeed, the plan
resembles the mechanism established by Resolution Trust Corp. in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   But doubts began to arise Friday about exactly how much the
program will accomplish. Japanese newspapers expressed concern that
the bridge bank system, the centerpiece of the Total Plan, may not
apply to large banks at the heart of Japan's financial system.
Instead, the plan, which envisions the creation of government-run
banks that would temporarily take over the business of failed banks
to help prevent chaos in the system, may be used only in regional
areas, for medium-sized or small financial institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mainichi Shimbun, a major daily newspaper, said in an analysis
Friday that it was not so clear if there would be series of bank
failures. It said that a bridge bank might only be used in the
failures at the regional level, with assets of several tens of
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the United States, bridge banks were never applied to
major bank failures,'' it said. It added that one reason was that
it would be extremely hard to find a buyer for a financial
institution with assets of several hundred billion dollars in a
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Finance Ministry officials Friday reaffirmed the
government's policy of ``too big to fail,'' which is essentially an
assurance that it will not let large institutions go under. The
government has bad memories of the collapse last November of
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, an event that provoked a sudden shortage
of money in the nation's banking system and fanned fears of a
financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge bank system would work in two stages. The government
would first appoint special administrators to run a failed
institution and to support healthy borrowers of the failed bank
while it searched for a merger partner. If that did not work, then
the collapsed bank's business would be taken over by a bridge bank
created with public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said Friday that in theory the plan could
certainly be applied to any institution, but that in practice it
was more likely to be used in the failures of regional
institutions. Analysts also echoed that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Total Plan may include the largest banks, but the real
purpose is the small, secondary regional banks,'' said Brian
Waterhouse, financial analyst at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. ``The
major 19 banks have the largest number of loans, but smaller banks
have a graver danger of going under.''
</P>
<P>
   One Japanese banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the process of devising the Total Plan and bridge bank system was
driven by Japanese politicians, who mainly have their regional
constituents in mind. The failure of a regional bank has a huge
impact on that region's economy, particularly on the ailing
companies that borrowed from that bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see greater instability,'' James Fiorillo,
banking analyst at ING Barings Japan, said of the Total Plan's
impact. ``It's not a straight and narrow road forward. It's going
to be bumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been particularly sensitive to the markets
recently, in light of the beating last month that certain bank
shares, such as those of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank and
Nippon Credit Bank, have suffered. And it has criticized foreign
financial analysts in the past for publicly singling out the names
of weak institutions.

COMMENTARY: JERUSALEM AS LEVITTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ So the Israeli government announces plans to extend
the authority of the Jerusalem municipality over the hills and
towns, primarily to the west and southwest of the Israeli capital.
It says this is to improve city planning and services. The United
States denounces this as a provocation that could derail peace
talks. The Palestinians howl in protest. The United Nations moves
to censure Israel. But behind the scenes, everyone is still asking:
What is this Israeli move really about? Annexation? Provocation?
Better bus service?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be none of the above. According to the Society
for the Protection of Nature in Israel _ which knows every hill,
forest and stone in the areas to be brought under this greater
Jerusalem umbrella _ what this is most about is real estate
development. We're talking Donald Trump, not Trumpeldor (a famous
early Israeli pioneer).
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade the Nature Society has been fighting
successfully to limit development in the terraced hills and Jewish
National Fund forests to the west and southwest of Jerusalem,
explains Yoav Sagi, its chairman, who, along with Israel Kimhi, a
former Jerusalem city planner, and Avram Shaked, the organization's
conservation coordinator, gave me a tour of this area where
Jerusalem is to be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now much of this land is controlled by the state and it
is designated as forest and parks, with some open spaces reserved
for farming,'' says Sagi. ``In accordance with the national plan,
you can't build on these lands, except with great limitations. We
have managed to freeze many real estate projects in these areas, to
protect the Judean Hills, the parks and nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move now to expand the boundaries of Jerusalem appears to
us as an effort to get around these restrictions,'' adds Sagi. ``It
seems that the real estate powers are hoping that if the authority
for development of these open spaces is shifted from the national
planning administration to Jerusalem municipal control, it will be
easier to get the restrictions on building lifted _ because of the
high cost of housing within Jerusalem's current boundaries, the
influence of developers on city planning, and because of the
political incentive to build Jewish Jerusalem. And once you get
your hands on green areas like this, and turn them into real
estate, you are talking about big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate money has been known to find its way into political
campaigns in Israel, noted Sagi, and some people are not above
using nationalism to mask their real interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Nature Society is fighting this urban sprawl everywhere. If
you planted a tree in the hills between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,
visit it soon. It may not be there much longer, because by 2020 the
area from Haifa to Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is likely to become ``one
big urban megalopolis,'' said Kimhi. ``We build here like we are
living in Australia _ more is better, bigger is better,'' adds
Sagi, ``but we're not Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to stop, though. If current population trends
continue, Israel, outside the Negev Desert, will soon be one of the
most densely populated countries in the world. This population
explosion, coupled with the poor use of land inside Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem _ which results in these cities' building outward instead
of upward _ is increasingly devouring the biblical landscape. The
Golden Arches of McDonald's now dominate a prominent hill as you
enter Jerusalem. If there were no Arab-Israeli conflict, the next
big Israeli political party would surely be called ``Green Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel can never limit Jewish immigration. But unless it gets
much more sensitive about sustainable development, something
essential to Zionism is going to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every project that is approved against the national plan, and
destroys open space, destroys part of Jewish heritage _ the
biblical landscape of David and Solomon's day,'' said Shaked. ``The
Bible refers to the vineyards of Ben Shemen. Today Ben Shemen is
the biggest highway interchange in the country. We still speak
about `The Land of Israel' in metaphysical terms, but we forget
about the actual land.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Sagi: ``We have to change the culture here from conquering
the land to preserving the land. Because if Israel should one day
become a normal country, with no more wars, what will sustain us
here is the quality of life and connection to the land. But if we
keep to this trend, we will have no quality of life and no land to
be connected to.''

NEW MOMS GRAPPLE WITH RETURNING TO JOB, STAYING HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR USE SUNDAY JULY 5)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - When her daughter Shaelyn was born March 8, Cynthia
Ellershaw had every intention of returning to work when her 12
weeks of family medical leave was up.
</P>
<P>
   Not going back to work ``was something I never considered,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband had emigrated from England 12 months earlier
and in the interim purchased and furnished a north Phoenix home and
bought a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrived here with two suitcases and carry-ons and got
pretty far into debt,'' she said. ``We needed my check to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the money, Ellershaw loved her job as a team leader with
a Scottsdale computer training firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best job I ever had,'' she said. ``The work was
very rewarding, there were very good opportunities, and the company
was very supportive of the work I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As the date when she planned to return to work approached,
however, Ellershaw found herself trying to justify staying at home
with Shaelyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't face the prospects of leaving my daughter,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her dilemma was complicated by her boss, who suggested she could
be up for a department manager job when she returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had been my goal since I joined the company, and it would
have meant a lot more money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellershaw's dilemma is not unique. Most women and their families
wrestle with their consciences, finances and egos when facing the
prospects of returning to work after having or adopting a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Some, particularly single parents, have no choice but to
continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   Others find work more rewarding than full-time parenthood and
willingly return.
</P>
<P>
   Still others find a compromise that works for them. The
important thing, according to Renee K. Frost, a certified marriage
and family therapist in Tempe, is to realize that there are gains
and losses in any choice and a family should be willing to live
with them,
</P>
<P>
   Ellershaw was able to find a way to spend her days with Shaelyn
and still contribute to the family finances. That required putting
her career on hold and taking a part-time job at a bank, processing
checks from midnight to 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely made the right decision,'' she said. ``I can
always go back to my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It was money that helped make up her mind. After considering the
cost of day care ($100 to $150 per week), the expense of an
additional car, work clothes, lunches and other expenses, Ellershaw
concluded there would be practically nothing left of her paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make sense to put in all that effort, be away from
Shaelyn and have nothing to show for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about day care and the guilt of having someone else
rear her daughter also helped her decide to work from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard stories about abuses and neglect and about high
turnover of staff,'' she said. ``This scared us a lot, even though
we knew there were good people out there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellershaw found support for her decision in an unlikely place _
the Internet. Before she made the decision to stay home, she
connected with parentplace.com, a Web-based support group for
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been able to talk to other women in my situation and
all of a sudden there were women from all over the world trying to
find their way through the same thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone reaches the same decision. Some women, particularly
single parents, simply can't afford not to work.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for them, employers are increasingly stepping up
with assistance in the form of flexible schedules, telecommuting
options and subsidized child care. Some are even setting up
in-house day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Petersen, managing principal at Buck Consultants' Phoenix
office, said a recent survey, conducted by the employee benefits
consulting firm, indicated that about 10 percent of the country's
large employers are offering some form of day-care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Circle K parent Tosco Marketing, for example, is building a
day-care center as part of its new corporate headquarteres under
construction in Tempe, and American Express offers child-care
referral services and encourages parents to telecommute and
job-share.
</P>
<P>
   PCS Health Systems in Scottsdale doesn't directly subsidize
day-care costs, but it does allow employees to pay for it with
pre-tax dollars. It also picks up the tab for the care of a sick
child and provides facilities where nursing mothers can express
milk during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Arlie Russell Hochschild, a sociologist at the University of
California at Berkeley, set out to write a book about such vanguard
corporate policies. She expected to find that workers were
increasingly taking advantage of the programs and staying home with
their children.
</P>
<P>
   What she found became fodder for a controversial book called
``The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work.''
Instead of embracing the family friendly benefits, Hochschild found
that fathers and mothers weren't taking advantage of them. Instead,
at all levels, from hourly workers to professional staff, they were
consistently choosing work over home.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Hochschild points out that the workaholic behavior
is a Catch-22. The more we work, the more rushed and unpleasant
home life becomes, she says. The more rushed our home life, the
more we escape into work where we can relax _ and get paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   And, although work has become more nurturing in one sense, it
also has become more demanding in others. The Human Resources
manual may outline flex time and paternity leave options,
Hochschild says. But the reality is that requesting any is
discouraged. Commitment is equated with long hours.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Kitterman, Tosco Marketing's vice president of safety,
considered staying home after her daughter was born last May. But
although her family could survive comfortably on just her husband's
income, Kitterman elected to return to work at the end of her
family medical leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always enjoyed working,'' she said. ``I have been given a
lot of opportunities and a lot of responsibility, and I like that.
I like the challenge I get from working.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitterman has a nanny who comes to her home to care for her
daughter Abbey, and her husband, a consultant, is often home during
the day. The personal attention her daughter receives during the
day made it easier for Kitterman to make the decision to return to
work. But she acknowledges she struggles with feelings of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in my position goes through that,'' she said.
``You wonder if you made the right decision. I think I did. I think
I am a better parent working outside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellershaw acknowledged she sometimes misses work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the responsibilities and the opportunities,'' she said.
``But there is nothing like staying at home and being a part of the
development of this human being you brought into the world.'' &QL;

MEDICARE REVAMPS SYSTEM OF PAYING NURSING HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The government took a big step this week to make the business of
caring for elderly patients less lucrative, a setback for
hospitals, some nursing homes and home-care services. But oddly,
under cost-reduction rules that took effect July 1, Medicare
patients are likely to spend more days, not fewer, in nursing homes
and beds for acute care in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping patients longer will mean more money for efficient
nursing homes, which will now be paid on a per diem rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the new system will be costly for some hospitals. It will be
harder for a hospital to increase revenues from Medicare by
shifting patients from acute care to skilled nursing units within
the hospital. Medicare will now pay a per diem fee, instead of
paying on the basis of nursing-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare will also penalize hospitals that discharge certain
types of patients too quickly, as measured by national averages of
length of stay.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say the big nursing-home chains are
prepared and even eager for the change, which Congress enacted last
year in the Balanced Budget Act. It will phase in day rates over
four years, replacing the old cost-based system. ``It's an
opportunity to make a clean profit by delivering the product for
less, rather than `run your costs up and we will pay you more,'''
said Jean Swenson, a health-care analyst at BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two big hospital companies, Vencor Inc. and Tenet
Healthcare, reduced their earnings estimates and said the Medicare
changes were partly responsible. Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the
biggest hospital chain, said it had adjusted estimates to take
account of the changes, ``but it clearly has cost them money,''
said Geoffrey Harris, a health-care analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, Medicare plans to wring about $16 billion
over five years from its payments for care at home, the place where
most older people insist they want to stay. Deep cuts for home care
last January are already compounding other major problems for the
biggest home-care companies, Apria Healthcare and Olsten Corp.
Shares of Apria, where the chief financial officer resigned last
month, plummeted by more than 50 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home-care industry is in a state of chaos; the companies
are losing money like crazy,'' said John Hindelong, a vice
president of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   He said the exception was Lincare Holdings, a tightly controlled
company that has prospered despite Medicare cuts for its specialty,
home treatments for breathing ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated savings of $9.5
billion over five years from the changes in skilled-nursing
payments. The office said Medicare payments for nursing care were
$12.2 billion in 1997. That was about 10 percent of the industry's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The federal-state Medicaid program pays nearly half of
nursing-home bills but some states, flush with budget surpluses,
have loosened up on payments for Medicaid. And the Medicaid cuts in
last year's Balanced Budget Act will initially hurt hospitals more
than nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, for a change that is supposed to promote efficiency,
chains that formerly had high costs, like Beverly Enterprises, the
biggest nursing-home chain, will be rewarded, as the nursing-home
day rates, called prospective payments, are phased in over four
years. The new payments, which can be delayed to next January for
most publicly traded nursing chains, will initially be tied to a
company's costs in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing chains like Health Care and Retirement that had lower
costs in 1995 may not do as well, Hindelong said. However, Health
Care and Retirement, which is merging with Manor Care, another
efficient chain, gets most of its revenue from private,
nongovernment insurers. ``Eventually they will all have to get
their costs down,'' he said, ``and all the publicly traded
nursing-home companies will be fine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hindelong recommends Beverly, based in Fort Smith, Ark. ``The
stock is cheap,'' he said, at only 14 times his estimate of next
year's earnings, compared with an average of 22 times estimated
1999 earnings for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, Beverly has cut back to 600 nursing homes
from 1,200, reduced the proportion of low-paying Medicaid residents
and hired its own rehabilitation therapists instead of relying on
outside specialists, like Novacare Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new payment system is a challenge for Novacare, an
independent provider of rehab services in nursing homes,
assisted-living centers and hospitals. Although there will be
higher per diem rates for Medicare patients who get certain types
of therapy, the institutions will try to spend as little as
possible on therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Novacare expects to reduce costs by repeating what it already
does to attract younger, managed-care patients in outpatient
clinics: assigning licensed therapists to supervise groups of
patients, rather than one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care economizing will spread to nursing homes, said Ms.
Swenson at BT Alex. Brown, as more Medicare participants join
health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends Novacare, based in King of Prussia, Pa., and
among the nursing chains, Genesis Health Ventures, based in Kennett
Square, Pa.; Integrated Health Services, based in Owings Mills,
Md.; and Centennial Health Care, a smaller company based in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Harris at Salomon Smith Barney said the cuts reflected ``a
fundamental philosophical shift'' in government policy.
``Historically,'' he said, ``Medicare said that seniors were
entitled to certain benefits. The costs were measured and increased
each year. But with the Balanced Budget Act, the government is
shifting to a defined-contribution mentality much like corporate
America _ looking at dollar amounts and saying if costs go up
beyond a certain limit, the consumer will pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate payer is the Medicare recipient,'' Harris said.
``As in corporate America, employees are increasingly bearing the
cost.''

PAKISTAN'S SOLE BREWER COPES WITH NATION'S CURBS ON ALCOHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `f' code)

<P>
   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan _ Very few Pakistanis are able to greet
visitors by asking them, as Minoo Bhandara does, ``Can I offer you
coffee, tea or beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is banned for the 97 percent of Pakistanis who are
Muslims. Christians and members of other religious minorities may
buy it in strictly limited quantities at licensed outlets, and then
only with official permits.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, Bhandara has a unique job. He is the chief
executive of Murree Brewery Co., which for half a century has been
Pakistan's only producer of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Besides beer, the company produces 16 liquors, including
varieties of rum, brandy, vodka, gin and whiskey. One Murree
subsidiary makes glass containers, and another produces soft drinks
and condiments. Beer, however, is the company's traditional, and
still most important, product.
</P>
<P>
   With prospects for domestic growth obviously quite limited,
Bhandara has begun to look elsewhere. After determining that there
are 6,500 grocery stores in Britain run by South Asians, most of
them from Pakistan, he has decided to begin selling his beer there.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas sales are to begin this summer, aimed principally at
the expatriate market. If the expansion is successful, there are
plans to extend sales to Toronto and New York, both of which have
large populations of Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
   Because Pakistani law prohibits the export as well as import of
alcoholic beverages, Murree has made a deal to have its beer
produced at a small brewery in Austria that now produces a local
brand called Kapsreiter. British and Austrian diplomats recently
visited the Murree brewery here to sample the product and wish the
enterprise well.
</P>
<P>
   Murree beer has its roots in the British colonial era. The
company was founded by Britons in 1861 outside the Punjabi town of
Murree. The first brewery was destroyed by an earthquake in 1925,
and the second was burned to the ground by a Muslim mob in 1947,
the year Pakistan gained independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Today the brewery in Rawalpindi is the center of the company,
which is publicly owned and has stock trading on the Karachi
exchange. Bhandara, 61, a former member of Parliament and
occasional newspaper columnist who professes the Zoroastrian faith,
has spent his entire working life in the company. His family owns
about 45 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since '47 it's been a bumpy ride,'' he said in his paneled
office, which with its dark cabinets, high-backed wicker chairs and
19th-century calendars feels like a throwback to colonial days.
``We prospered and did well in the first years after independence,
when there was a more liberal and progressive interpretation of
Islam. But toward the latter part of the 1970s Islamic winds began
blowing from the Caspian Sea to the Indus.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1947 partition that created India and Pakistan out of
what had been a single British colony, Murree was distributed
throughout the Indian subcontinent. Beginning in that year, it
could be sold only in East and West Pakistan, and the market shrank
again after 1971, when East Pakistan seceded and became Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol was officially illegal but widely available in the years
after independence, with doctors allowed to issue certificates
asserting that their patients needed it for medical purposes. The
1979 prohibition is more strictly enforced, but it, too, is evaded.
Many non-Muslims make a tidy profit by selling alcohol to their
Muslim friends. It is sometimes said that the only people in
Pakistan who do not know how to find liquor are foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For Murree, however, the last 50 years have been a downward
spiral. ``We have a great past in front of us,'' Bhandara said
wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the company's $11 million in annual income comes from
alcohol sales, and half of the alcohol it sells is beer. It
produces 200,000 cases annually. There are four types, one with 4.5
percent alcohol; another, called Murree Classic, with 5.5 percent,
and two that are nonalcoholic. Hops are imported from Germany, and
malt for the whiskey comes from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Murree has 350 full-time employees and another 125 or so who
work part time. Some hide the truth about where they work. The
American-trained quality-control manager, for example, tells
friends that she works for a soft drink company.
</P>
<P>
   In a large, cool basement, whiskey is aged in oak casks.
Upstairs, where the liquor is bottled and packed, government agents
walk about suspiciously, often searching employees to insure that
not a single bottle escapes the plant illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bhandara is naturally unhappy that much of what he
produces is contraband for 97 percent of the population here, he
accepts the reality stoically. What continues to irritate him,
however, is that retailers who are licensed to sell his alcohol are
all Muslims and are the biggest winners in his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punjab has a population the size of the United Kingdom and
there are only seven licensed outlets for alcohol,'' he said. ``One
of these retailers can make more profits, especially
under-the-table illegal profits, than we as the manufacturers can.
We make peanuts by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discrimination of the Pakistani and Punjab governments is
also clear when you see that Christian families that were in the
liquor retailing business for 150 years are now destitute while
their successors are Muslims who supposedly disapprove of this
business. The Islamic religious court here has ruled that it is
un-Islamic for Muslims to be selling liquor, but the government is
ignoring that decision just like it ignored the decision that
charging interest is un-Islamic. It seems economic interests are
paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Bhandara is focusing his attention on his
export plans. He expects to send 50,000 cases of his beer to
Britain over the next 12 months, with the first bottles reaching
the shelves this summer. ``I am sure there is a niche for us,'' he
said. ``A lot of South Asians remember the Murree name very
fondly.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been one wild ride. Only an unmitigated bull could have
scooped up every dollar from the red-hot stock market during the
last five years as the Dow Jones industrial average flirted with
the 9,000 mark from the mid-3,000s.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the theory of diversifying investments has not paid
off. Carefully balancing big stocks with smaller ones, or American
issues with international issues, was a waste of time. Investors
would have been better off sweeping their money into the Vanguard
Index 500 fund and going to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Although the five money managers who began managing hypothetical
retirement portfolios for The New York Times in July 1993 have all
made money, even the best of them could not approach the returns on
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. Moreover, only one manager
posted a gain for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fund picks of the top-performing manager, Sheldon Jacobs,
who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., returned a
cumulative total of 126.98 percent from July 7, 1993, when the
contest began, through the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
lagged behind the group with a return of 75.78 percent. By
contrast, the Vanguard S&AMP;P index fund rose 185.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But who possibly could have expected that? Eric M. Kobren,
president of Kobren Insight Group in Wellesley, Mass., conceded
that he certainly did not. Yet investors who as a result shifted
the bulk of their assets into an S&AMP;P index or large-capitalization
stock fund made a mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current valuation of the S&AMP;P 500 vs. other security
classes makes for a compelling argument in favor of
diversification,'' he said. ``I'm not suggesting that investors run
for the hills, but I certainly wouldn't abandon the diversified
approach in today's environment.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment is echoed by the other four advisers. They are
sticking to their guns and in most cases even increasing their
portfolio allocations to the small stocks and international issues
that have been left behind during the last five years' stampede of
big American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Five years, after all, seems much longer tracked quarter by
quarter than when viewed as part of a long-term financial plan,
Evensky said. And he noted that the dominant stock group changes
significantly depending on the five-year period examined, providing
an argument for diversification.
</P>
<P>
   For example, foreign stocks shone in the five years between June
1983 and June 1988, returning an annual average of 34.9 percent,
compared with 14.4 percent for the S&AMP;P, Evensky noted.
</P>
<P>
   Had he used November 1990 through November 1995 as his
benchmark, his portfolio would be concentrated in small stocks,
which trounced the S&AMP;P's 17.2 percent average annual return with a
return of 22.1 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several managers drew a lesson from their last five years'
experience: use more index funds in various asset categories
instead of trying to select the single best manager in each
particular category.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term case for using index funds gets stronger all the
time, because it's getting tougher to find good active managers,''
Jacobs said. Also, index funds tend to hold stocks for longer
periods than other funds, leading to fewer realized capital gains
and therefore smaller tax bills for long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   The managers cautioned investors to temper their expectations.
``The market cannot rise 20-plus percent year after year,'' Kobren
said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each
quarter by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. of Summit, N.J. It
excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes, because most
retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five
managers can choose any fund open to new investors. From the
outset, they were asked to pick portfolios that would grow for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   In first place for the quarter was Jack A. Brill, a San Diego
money manager who picks ``socially responsible'' funds. Brill's
portfolio rose 1.39 percent in the second quarter, despite a 13.26
percent decline in the Parnassus fund, which accounted for 10
percent of his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He plans to replace Parnassus with Calvert Capital Accumulation,
because Parnassus is very volatile, presumably because of its 50
percent position in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Brown, the Calvert manager, uses the
``growth-at-a-reasonable-price'' approach and has outperformed the
average mid-cap fund since assuming management in April 1997, Brill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brill is also replacing Citizens Global Equity with MMA Praxis
International to increase his overseas exposure. Europe and other
countries, he said, could outperform the American stock market over
the next three to five years. He gained more international exposure
by reducing Dreyfus Third Century to 10 percent of his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs came in second place in the quarter, although his
portfolio slipped 0.6 percent. He is getting rid of Fidelity Real
Estate because, he said, the market is fully priced. He is also
selling Yacktman fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has performed below the average growth and income fund for
five years now,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   He is shifting the entire proceeds into Vanguard Total Stock
Market, bringing it up to nearly one-third of the portfolio. ``The
S&AMP;P 500 index fund is a bet on large stocks,'' he said. By
contrast, he noted, about 30 percent of Total Stock Market is
invested in small- and mid-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kobren, whose all-Fidelity portfolio dropped 1.37 percent, came
in third, as small-cap stocks and real estate issues lagged behind
the bigger stocks. Concerned that his exposure to real estate
investment trusts may be high, Kobren is selling half of his
position in Fidelity Real Estate and putting the proceeds into
Fidelity Spartan Government Income, a high-quality bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the beating that small stocks have taken in the last few
months, Kobren is sticking with Fidelity Small-Cap Stock. ``We are
confident that manager Paul Antico can uncover superior companies
and deliver the numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky, whose portfolio fell 2.58 percent, took fourth place
for the quarter. He is sticking with his funds going forward.
``Rapid changing of managers tends to reduce returns,'' he said.
``My portfolio is well diversified and run by world-class managers,
so no changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Dziubinski, who edits Morningstar Fund Investor, also
plans no changes to her portfolio, even though she came in last
with a quarterly loss of 4.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
   She calculates that just over half of her portfolio is invested
in American stocks, about a third in foreign stocks and the balance
in a mix of cash, bonds and miscellaneous investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've placed a good chunk of change in poorer-performing areas
overseas that have a mean game of catch-up to play,'' she said.

CONCERN GROWS OVER ONLINE DATA-COLLECTION FROM CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a World Wide Web site for young investors developed by
Liberty Financial Cos., children can play a trivia game that tests
their knowledge about investing, learn how to open a savings
account with the guidance of a cartoon character named ``Murphy the
Magician,'' or participate in a contest where prizes include a
digital video camera.
</P>
<P>
   In order to enter the contest, however, they must complete a
survey asking their age and sex and whether they have ever received
savings bonds, stocks, mutual funds or gold coins as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company says that the survey is intended to
help the operators of the Web site design appropriate content for
its visitors, and that the information is not saved, given out to
others or used for marketing. ``From our perspective, this site was
meant to be an educational site for the benefit of kids and parents
who want to teach about economics,'' said Porter Morgan, a senior
vice president for Liberty Financial, an asset management company
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media
Education, an electronic-media public interest group based in
Washington, the site is symptomatic of what she views as a big
problem: the ability of commercial Web sites to gather detailed
information from children without their parents' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is happening, as one person said, under the
radar of parents,'' Ms. Montgomery said. ``They don't know what
questions are being asked of their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Montgomery is worried that even if sites are not
currently exploiting the information they request, they could do so
in the future _ devising, for example, promotions aimed at a
youngster based on what site operators have figured out about his
or her tastes. ``What I see developing is a highly commercial
medium where collection of personal information from children could
become routine to create personalized advertising,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns have become a big topic in Washington and in the
technology industry. Last month, officials at the Federal Trade
Commission recommended legislation that would put curbs on the
online collection of information from children under the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a coalition of about 50 companies and
organizations, including America Online, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T,
announced the formation late last month of the Online Privacy
Alliance, an industry group that aims to protect children's privacy
online.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this concern follows a recent Federal Trade Commission
study that found that almost half of all Web sites aimed at
children have made little effort to explain their
information-gathering practices to their young visitors, and that
most fail to notify parents when children are asked to give out
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted in March, looked at 212 Web sites
selected from Yahooligans, a popular Web directory for children. It
found that 88 percent of the sites surveyed collected identifying
details like names or postal or e-mail addresses from children. At
the same time, only 23 percent advised children to seek their
parents' permission before giving out personal information. And
only 7 percent indicated that they would notify parents of their
information-gathering practices.
</P>
<P>
   To Mozelle Thompson, an FTC commissioner, the findings were
dismaying, and not just because of their implications for
children's privacy online. Thompson fears that these privacy
concerns will restrain the growth of electronic commerce. ``We
don't think that growth will be realized if consumers don't feel
comfortable and safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say exactly how many commercial sites have
been set up to attract the estimated 10 million American children
online today. But Elizabeth Lascoutx, director of the Children's
Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus,
estimates there are thousands.
</P>
<P>
   They range from sites developed by cereal companies to those
posted by banks, broadcasters and toy makers, according to Regina
Joseph, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications, a new media
market research company based in New York. Typically, Ms. Joseph
said, the purpose of such sites is to develop ``brand awareness''
while providing entertainment for children.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites ask for identifying information and other data
in a variety of ways. For example, the trade commission report
says: ``Some sites require children to answer questions about their
interests in order to register or become eligible to win prizes. In
other cases a site may use `imaginary' characters to request more
information from children, have children sign a `guest book,'
solicit information to create home pages for children, invite
children to participate in chat and electronic pen pal programs,
require children to register with the site for updates and
information, and offer prizes and other incentives for completing
surveys and polls.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, online publishers insist, there are simple
explanations for the information gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at a site run by Warner Brothers, the studio
division of Time Warner Inc., visitors can send electronic
postcards with characters from Looney Tunes or the recent animated
children's movie ``Quest for Camelot'' _ but only if they supply
their names and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Sackler, vice president for law and public policy in
the Washington office of Time Warner _ one of the members of the
new Online Privacy Alliance _ said the information was requested
simply so that the recipient of the card knows who it comes from.
He said the names and addresses were not saved or used in any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he asserted, the site is aimed at teen-agers 15 and
older. But Sackler later said site operators would probably begin
inserting notices on electronic postcards that might attract
younger children, advising them that they should not give out
information without asking their parents, a practice that is used
at other Time Warner children's sites like Sports Illustrated for
Kids.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, site operators argue that a site that may appear
to be for children is, in fact, intended for older eyes. For
example, Scurvyboy, posted by the nonprofit citrus marketing
cooperative Sunkist Growers, offers an online hockey game and
features the adventures of a hapless secret agent who believes
space aliens want to steal the earth's supply of oranges. Ms.
Montgomery of the Center for Media Education criticized the site's
``smoothie contest,'' in which, for the chance to win a blender,
contestants fill out forms that ask two questions about eating
habits and request such information as a name and address.
</P>
<P>
   But Gee Wynands, a spokeswoman for Sunkist, which is based in
Van Nuys, Calif., said the criticism was unfair, because the site,
although listed in Yahooligans, is meant for 19- to 27-year-olds,
not younger children. ``They probably wouldn't even get it,'' Ms.
Wynands said.
</P>
<P>
   If such is the case, Ms. Montgomery said, information collectors
should make it clear that the site is intended for older children
or adults. ``At least disclose the target age group and let parents
judge if they think that's true,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies have developed stringent policies on gathering
information from children. For example, children under 18 who visit
Walt Disney Co.'s Web site and try to enter a sweepstakes promoting
a coming children's movie are told they must get their parents'
permission. The site also attempts to make sure children have
received their parent's go-ahead by alerting parents by e-mail when
their children have registered with the site.
</P>
<P>
   And if Mom and Dad do not want their children to enter the
contest, they can let the site know by e-mail.

PINETOP PERKINS JAZZ REVIEW: USING ONLY WHAT IS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five days before his 85th birthday, the blues pianist
Pinetop Perkins appeared at Chicago Blues on Thursday night like a
wily sage who knows how to make silence eloquent. Perkins, who was
a mainstay of Muddy Waters' band, has the entire blues vocabulary
in his fingers, from boogie and shuffle bass lines to florid
barrelhouse trills and filigrees. He can splash chords around or
riffle up and down the keyboard, but without good reason, he
doesn't; he plays with a ruthless economy.
</P>
<P>
   For a solo during ``How Long Blues,'' Perkins dispensed nothing
more than one note, a pause, three rippling chords down, three
arpeggios up and a low plunked note. But every one of them was in
the exact spot to yield as much ornery bluesiness as possible.
</P>
<P>
   While Perkins doesn't have a striking voice, he used it just as
cunningly to sing about his Mississippi birthplace, chicken shacks,
mojo power and women. Some verses were half sung, half spoken, with
the words tucked in at the beginning of a phrase. But when Perkins
sang about lost love, he could raise his voice just slightly and
linger over a melodic turn, suddenly transforming a line from
offhandedness to desolation.
</P>
<P>
   George Kilby Jr. on guitar and his band, the Coolerators, who
have backed Perkins for a decade, kept the music lean and pushy.
Uptempo tunes kicked along; stop-time parts, like the ones in
``Caledonia,'' were absolutely exact. Two saxophonists played
sinewy riffs and broad-shouldered solos as Perkins goaded them with
just one chord per measure. And Kilby squeezed out blues lines and
traded licks with Perkins, whose lessons in pithiness have been
taken to heart.

TIE THAT BONDS BASEBALL, TV IMPROVED BY ESPN CREATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The marriage of baseball and television technology has always
looked more like an arranged affair than a natural union of
compatible parties.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the altar you have the most traditional of
sports, a game that burrows ever deeper into its past to hold onto
the retro look _ with throw-back uniforms, asymmetrical ballparks
and lily-white front offices.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite, you have TV, steadfastly dragging the game and its
fans into the present with helmet-cams, miked-up coaches and
hitter's hot zones.
</P>
<P>
   Purist that I am, I prefer grass fields, neighborhood ballparks
and $4 box seats, but the realist in me has come to accept
retractable domes, luxury suites and $3 hot dogs as the costs of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   I've also come to believe that, at its best, the technology TV
offers baseball can educate fans, especially casual baseball
watchers, increasing both their appreciation and interest in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example is ESPN's Bat Track, which will be on
display again tomorrow night when the network airs the Rangers game
at The Ballpark against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Hall of Fame second baseman-turned TV baseball
analyst Joe Morgan, Bat Track measures the bat swing speed of
selected hitters during televised games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat speed'' has come to be a more commonly used term in recent
years. Broadcasters, writers and fans as well as scouts and coaches
now employ it when talking, for example, about a hitter's ability
or inability to catch up with a high, hard one.
</P>
<P>
   But how many casual fans really had any idea whether a fast
swing is always better than a slow swing, or which major-league
hitters have fast bats and which have slow ones?
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of Bat Track, Morgan has helped enlighten the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quicker the bat, the longer the hitter can wait to
recognize the pitch,'' Morgan explains. ``In doing so, he's going
to have a better chance to drive the ball. To be a good hitter, you
need either bat speed or strength; the great hitters have both.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bat speed is very much like pitch speed,'' Morgan adds. ``The
fastest pitchers are not necessarily the best pitchers. Similarly,
the hitters with the fastest bats aren't necessarily the best
hitters. Instead, the better hitters are the ones who make more
adjustments at the plate. For example, on an inside fastball, you
need to use all of your bat speed. On a changeup away, you need to
slow down your bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan notes that a Mark McGwire, like a Nolan Ryan throwing a
fastball, can overpower a pitcher with his bat speed and strength.
``But a hitter like \RSan Diego's\S Tony Gwynn makes adjustments;
he has several bat speeds.'' Gwynn's approach, Morgan notes, is
similar to that of Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of bat speeds taken by Bat Track shows just how
different swings can get different results. Ken Griffey Jr., for
instance, homered with a bat speed of 97 mph. But San Francisco's
Bill Mueller also homered, with a 77-mph cut. Meanwhile, Houston's
Jeff Bagwell fanned, even while employing a 91-mph rip.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Indians-Yankees game, Morgan pointed out that Manny
Ramirez took a 94-mph cut on a Hideki Irabu fastball _ his best
swing _ because he was sitting on a 3-1 count. He homered. In his
next at-bat, Ramirez took a slower swing, largely because he was
down in the count and not looking fastball. Because of his
strength, he homered again.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers may dismiss such technologically derived data, calling
it the stuff of ``seamheads'' or techno-geeks. But there's nothing
wrong with using technology if it contributes to the fan's greater
understanding of the game, especially at a time when baseball
interest is about as wide as an outfield but as deep as a
chalkline.
</P>
<P>
   Go to The Ballpark this weekend and you'll find the stands
jammed as usual. But see how many are avidly watching the game,
really paying attention and not just gnawing on turkey legs,
sucking down lemon chills and cheering the dot races.
</P>
<P>
   Providing casual fans more information might not deepen their
interest; they may have to play the game for that. But it can't
hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all TV technology has provided a clear benefit to
baseball. The only thing we learned from the ballyhooed hot
zone/cold zone hitting graphic was that batters like their pitching
belt high and over the middle of the plate, and that they don't
like it up and in or down and away.
</P>
<P>
   But the good stuff, like Bat Track, offers information that is
otherwise unavailable to fans and helpful to understanding the
nuances of the game. It shows that even an arranged marriage can
have a happy outcome.

 &HT;    Florida fighting fire with best equipment
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- As wildfires continue to blaze across
Florida, firefighters are using everything they've got.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 fire engines were flown from California in a massive,
$18 million air-lift, said Florida Unified Command spokesman Steve
Parsons. And another 20 bulldozers were scheduled to arrive from
Texas on Friday, adding to more than 400 that depleted supplies
around the Southeast. So much equipment has arrived, in fact, that
workers are finding it impossible to keep a tally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the country's sky hook helicopters _ huge choppers
used to hoist air-conditioning units onto skyscrapers _ are now in
Florida lugging water.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 aircraft are being used and 150 fire engines,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firefighting in Florida is not real conducive to large numbers
of crews as we do in the western United States. It's a lot swampier
and muckier,'' said Dick Mangan, a program leader for the Rocky
Mountain Research Station's Missoula Lab, the nation's leading fire
research center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's an equipment operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what an operation: A handful of converted bombers that drop
thousands of gallons of fire-retardant; the Superscooper, an
amphibious 1,400-gallon water bomber from North Carolina that skims
lakes and rivers for water to spew on fire; and ``water tenders,''
tanker trucks that hold massive amounts of water to resupply fire
engines in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also have equipment to start back-burns and destroy
fuel: ping-pong balls filled with the chemical used in anti-freeze,
which they have not yet used, and hand-held drip torches. A flying
drip torche that attaches to helicopters is also available, Mangan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Special gear worn by firefighters protects them from fire and
cuts heat stress. Shirts with billowy sleeves and pants are made of
light-weight Nomex, a material manufactured by Dupont. The material
is fire-resistant so firefighters trapped in a fire can survive 15
to 20 minutes, Mangan said.
</P>
<P>
   Many firefighters also have shelters, grimly dubbed
`shake-and-bakes'. The small aluminum pup tents are packed in waist
packs that can be shaken out in 15 seconds, weigh under three
pounds and can fit two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects 95 percent of radiant heat, so if you have 1,000
degrees of temperature, this thing would absorb only 50 degrees of
it,'' Mangan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of the country's 67 hotshot crews, 20-member teams
considered the best firefighters in the nation, have also arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the crews that are digging the lines and get as close
as you can get,'' said James Stone, spokesman for the National
Interagency Fire Center, the clearing house that routes all the
teams and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But even such advanced equipment does little good without the
cooperation of nature, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it all comes down to two things. Number one, the
weather has got to change and when the weather changes, that allows
firefighters to get in close,'' said Greg Thayer, a fire
information officer for the Florida Unified Command. ``And three
things are required to burn anything. Fuel, oxygen and heat. If a
firefighter can take away one of those three things, then the fire
will go out.''

 &HT;    Pine needles prove to be perfect fuel for Florida wildfires
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The answer to why Florida keeps burning
is below our feet and above our heads.
</P>
<P>
   Slash pines, with needles that decompose slowly, longleaf pines
and others pack flammable resin and have air between needles that
allow them to burn quick and hot. Some get so hot neighboring trees
``will just kind of explode. It will turn red and blow up into
flames,'' said Greg Thayer, fire information officer for the
Florida Unified Command.
</P>
<P>
   Below, brush is even more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have been plotted moving at 30 to 40 mph,'' he said.
``Once it starts moving and has a high flame length, it will create
its own wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what grows in central and southern Florida is perfect
fuel for wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Florida pine forests have an open canopy that allow
needles and scrub to dry quickly, making fire possible within a day
of rain, studies show. Hardwoods often stop fires, but when fires
get hot enough (upwards of 1,300 degrees), hardwood ignites as
well. Routine burning helps keep down the fuel, but most areas no
longer do controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Jacksonville officials ``have been doing under-burning
for five to six years and they noticed when the fire moved through
there, it did not just pick up and run. It smoldered around and
didn't have ground fuel to carry it to the next tree,'' Thayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eons ago, fires typically burned pine forests every two to three
years, usually ignited in June with heavy lightning when most
vegetation is dry and burns quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, roads, canals and firefighters quickly extinguish those.
</P>
<P>
   Studying wildfires, why they burn, how they burn, what their
smoke does to the environment and to our health has engaged
scientists around the world. Scientists from around the world are
gathering this month in Canada's Northwest Territory to study crown
fires, the most dangerous fires that light the tops of trees and
allow wildfires to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, U.S. scientists completed a 7-year study of the
effects of wildfire smoke on firefighters and surprisingly found it
caused no long-term health effects, said Dick Mangan, fire program
leader for the Missoula Technical and Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   While smoke depresses the immune system temporarily, they found
it caused only short-term problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nose runs, eyes water and you hack and cough sometimes
for a couple of days,'' he said. ``In a real severe season of 90 to
100 days when they're out all the time, it can be a two to three
month period where they get the crud.''

FRANCE ELIMINATES ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Thus was daring rewarded. L'audace,
l'audace, and all that. France's soccer team kept pushing and
risking and pushing some more before 77,000 at the Stade de France
Friday afternoon. Les Bleus pushed for 90 minutes, then 30 minutes
more.
</P>
<P>
   And then, when it came down to penalty kicks, their crossbar
pushed, too _ pushed Luigi DiBiagio's shot over and out, pushed
Italy out of the World Cup and France into a semifinal date here
Wednesday with either Germany or Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel utterly wiped out,'' coach Aime Jacquet declared, after
his squad had prevailed, 4-3, in the shootout after the match had
ended in a 0-0 draw. ``But in the end, the best team won.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight time that the Italians had been
eliminated in a shootout _ they lost to Argentina, 4-3 (after 1-1),
in the 1990 semifinals and to Brazil, 3-2 (after 0-0), in the 1994
final. ``It is a curse,'' shrugged coach Cesare Maldini, who
thought it might be the Azzurri's day after keeper Gianluca
Pagliuca had saved Bixente Lizarazu's bid on the second French
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's what happens to teams that deliberately play not
so much to win as not to lose. The Italians, who consider 0-0 a
perfect game, play a counterattacking style as a matter of national
tradition. They mark and tackle and thwart and grab and wait for
the error, the lapse, the loss of form or focus. Then they go for
the knockout.
</P>
<P>
   It works most of the time _ the Azzurri played six 1-0 or 0-0
matches in Cup qualifying and lost none and they beat Norway, 1-0,
to get here. It works until they have to take the long walk, one at
a time, to the penalty spot. ``In penalty kicks, it's about keeping
your nerve,'' said Jacquet.
</P>
<P>
   The French, who ousted Brazil in their last Cup shootout in
1986, were the cooler hands Friday. After keeper Fabien Barthez
brought them back even by blocking Demetrio Albertini, their last
three shooters all cashed in. When DiBiagio's ball slammed off the
bar dead center and sent soaring into space, Les Bleus linked arms
at midfield and jumped up and down in giddy disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   The French have waited a dozen years to get back in the Cup, and
they believe they'll never have a better chance to win it than they
do now as hosts, with tens of thousands of fans singing ``La
Marseillaise'' as a fight song. They knew they couldn't beat the
Italians by sitting back and waiting, so they went after them as
soon as Scottish referee Hugh Dallas blew the opening whistle.
</P>
<P>
   With playmaker Zinedine Zidane, back after a two-game
suspension, dashing and dishing all day, the French kept surging
upfield. They took 24 shots to Italy's seven. They got 13 corner
kicks to Italy's two. And yet it came to nothing, just as the
French had feared it might.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were 3-0-1 against the Azzurri with three
shutouts in their last four matches, Les Bleus were bracing for the
match as if it were a final. Seven of them play in Italy's Serie A,
and they know the Italian mindset and style by heart. ``Only one
thing matters to the Italians,'' French captain Didier Deschamps
had said before the match. ``And that's winning, no matter how.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the French set up housekeeping in the Italian end,
the Azzurri were on them like freestyle wrestlers, wrapping arms
around chests, putting knees into thighs, sliding feet between
legs. Of France's 24 shots, only seven were on goal. ``The French
tried to attack,'' said Maldini, ``but they were never all that
threatening. I don't think our goalkeeper had much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   France did have chances. Zidane put a ball wide in the fourth
minute. Youri Djorkaeff barely missed with Pagliuca down just
before the half, then watched Pagliuca block him point-blank with a
minute left in overtime. But most of the time, the Les Bleus were
high and wide. Most of the time, their corner kicks sailed long or
were headed away.
</P>
<P>
   Their nightmare was that after all the daring, all the risk, the
Italians would seize on 10 seconds of 120 minutes and tear out
their hearts. And it almost happened.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Baggio, the man who'd missed Italy's last penalty kick
in the Rose Bowl and given the Cup to Brazil, slipped into the area
a dozen minutes into overtime and launched a volley that missed the
upper far corner by inches, as Baggio covered his face in dismay.
The Azzurri never got another chance.
</P>
<P>
   So it came, again, to penalties. Zidane, the man of the match
for Les Bleus, drilled his to the lower left side. Baggio matched
him. Then, as the French watched in horror, Lizarazu was thwarted.
But Barthez, whose shaved head his mates rub for luck, denied
Albertini and it was even.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they made them after that _ David Trezeguet, then
Alessandro Costacurta, Thierry Henry, then Christian Vieri, Laurent
Blanc and then ... DiBiagio tried to roof his shot and the clang
was heard all the way to the Spanish Steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hardly seems fair to lose the World Cup in this way,'' said
DiBiagio, who lay on his back with his hands over his face as
Barthez came leaping and exulting off the line and all of France
leaped and exulted with him. ``And to feel in some way responsible
is a dreadful feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBiagio has plenty of company _ the Italians have missed six
penalties in their last three Cup shootouts. Eight years ago in
Naples, Aldo Serena was the man on his knees in torment at the end.
Four years ago in Pasadena, it was Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this is the third time for me and it leaves a
very bitter taste,'' said Baggio, who has been on the field for all
of them. ``Penalties are the worst way of all to lose.''

OLDER GERMAN TEAM DOESN'T LACK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ The Germans have been rapidly growing older
during the World Cup finals. It has nothing to do with overexposure
to sun in their Cote D'Azur training camp, where they can find
refuge in their $450 per day hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But by adding Lothar Matthaus to the lineup, the average age of
the starting team has incresed to 30.6 years. This might not be a
promising sign for the future, but the Germans seem as dynamic as
any team in the quarterfinals, certainly more attack-minded than
Croatia, their opponent in Lyon tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaus set a record for World Cup appearances when he replaced
Olaf Thon in the second half of the second match against Yugoslavia
in Lens. This might have seemed an act of desperation by coach
Hans-Hubert (Berti) Vogts, who had dropped Matthaus from the team
two years ago, knowing he had viable successors in 1996 European
Footballer of the Year Matthias Sammer, Jens Nowotny, and Thon.
This also illustrates the depth of talent in Germany, regardless of
age _ a former European player of the year is replaced by Matthaus,
world player of the year in 1990 and '91.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the move would pay off was demonstrated as
Germany visibly galvanized after scoring twice in the second half
to tie the Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaus plays the libero role, which was first interpreted by
Franz Beckenbauer in the 1970s and has been the linchpin of the
German philosophy since. The position requires experience,
leadership qualities, an ability to dictate the terms of the game,
and an innate sense of when to attack, when to defend.
</P>
<P>
   German liberos are usually athletic marvels, and Matthaus
exemplifies this, going strong into a World Cup record 25th game.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are his bionic teammates: goalkeeper Andreas Koepke
is 35; Jurgen Klinsmann 33; Thomas Helmer 33; Thomas Hassler, Ulf
Kirsten, Jurgen Kohler, and Thon 32; Stefan Reuter 31. The heir
apparent libero, Nowotny, is only 24, which might be why he was cut
from the team before the finals began.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a rematch of the 1996 European Championships
quarterfinal match in Manchester, won by Germany, 2-1. The Croats
felt cheated in that game because striker Davor Suker's goal was
negated by a questionable offside and Sammer scored the winner in
another controversial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia might have protested more, but the Croats have strong
feelings of gratitude toward Germany, which was the first to
recognize their independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the surprise of the tournament,'' Suker said. ``But
this is not enough for us. Sure, Germany is the favorite, but the
favorites do not always win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we, two years later, are more mature than we were at
Manchester.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croats are also missing two of their top players _ Sasho
Cvitanovic, dropped by coach Miro Blazevic after a training camp
dispute, and Alen Boksic, who is injured. With a population of 5
million, Croatia is not as capable as Germany of finding top-level
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   This contest could be decided by the strikers, Croatia's
``Sukerman'' against Germany's ``Super Sub.''
</P>
<P>
   Suker has scored 32 goals in 38 games for the national team and
110 goals in Spain for Seville and Real Madrid. Bierhoff has been
among the top scorers in Italy's Serie A with Udinese in recent
years, and will move to Milan this season, but was not considered a
starter on the Nationalmannschaft until this tournament, despite
scoring the winning goal in overtime in the Euro '96 final against
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia is still becoming accustomed to having a national
identity. Meanwhile, Matthaus has been playing since the Tito Era.
His first World Cup was Spain '82. He marked Maradona in Germany's
championship game loss at Mexico '86, captained the team which won
Italia '90, then left the team soon after USA '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost two finals and I won one,'' Matthaus told La
Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I would like to even the count.''

GERMANY TO PROBE REFUGEE CASH FLOW TO ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The German Foreign Ministry has asked ``all relevant
authorities'' to investigate whether money donated by Kosovo
Albanian refugees in this country is being used in Kosovo to
purchase weapons for a separatist rebel movement there, the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ministry spokesman Markus Ederer Friday said that Germany would
consider such a use of funds to be a violation of a UN resolution
banning weapon sales to either side in the Kosovo dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If money collected here is going to the UCK (the Kosovo
Albanian acronym for the rebels) to purchase arms, then we have to
look into that,'' said Ederer.
</P>
<P>
   While Ederer would not say which arm of the German government
would carry out such a probe, it is likely to be the Ministry of
Interior.
</P>
<P>
   He also added that the German government has called on Kosovo
Albanian leaders to halt fund-raising because of suspicions that
money has been forcibly collected from Europe's large Kosovo
Albanian refugee community. ``We have no proof, but we have hints
that it is happening,'' Ederer said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Boston Globe reported that Kosovo Albanians in
Germany and Switzerland were donating hundreds of thousands of
dollars to funds established to aid Kosovo. Many of those
interviewed said they gave a percentage of their income to these
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   One fund, the ``Fatherland is Calling'' does give its money
directly to the Kosovo Liberation Army, according to its director,
Ibrahim Kelmendi. Kelmendi told the Globe that money he raises goes
to the rebel movement ``and I guess they use it to buy weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations have increased dramatically as fighting has
intensified in the Serbian province, he said. Kelmendi, who also
heads the Democratic Associaton of Albanians in Germany, said
fellow refugees ``had saved up a lot of money, and now they are
spending their savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other funds are overseen in Germany by exiled members of
the Kosovo government. Kosovo was stripped of its political
autonomy in 1991 by Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, and many
political leaders have fled since then to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a spokesman for the exiled leaders, Rexher Bajrami,
denied that any money was going to the rebels. He said all of the
money is being used to support the educational system in Kosovo as
well as for medical and other humanitarian purposes. Bajrami added
that the government has recommended that Kosovo Albanians give an
estimated three percent of their income to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fund is recognized by the German revenue authority as a
nonprofit, and the money is being used to soothe the situation back
home,'' Bajrami said.
</P>
<P>
   But the exiled prime minister, Bujar Bukoshi, had earlier told
the Globe that the money being raised was ``to help Kosovo with all
means'' and would not comment on whether funds went to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo government has called for peaceful protests, not
violence, to settle the question of Kosovo's future. Kosovo
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population,
want independence from Serbia. While the international community
does not support its quest for independence, it has chastised
Serbia for its brutal crackdowns in Kosovo against the rebels that
left many civilian dead and over 60,000 ethnic Albanians uprooted
from their homes there.

CHINA IS ELATED OVER CLINTON'S 9-DAY VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 &HT;    
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese, from the top leaders to the man in the
street, were elated with the nine-day visit by an American
president who struck many here as vibrant and empathetic.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that President Clinton lectured China, gently but
firmly, about the merits of freedom, called the bloody 1989
crackdown on demonstrators wrong and praised the Dalai Lama, who is
usually portrayed here as a villain. He seemed to come as a
respectful friend.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin's startling, self-confident decision to
allow Clinton to speak on live television only added to the sense
of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the view of most people here this signals a new acceptance
of China after 1989,'' said Zhang Xiaojin, an international
relations expert at the People's University.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, facing mounting complaints at home that it is
coddling the Chinese at the expense of American values and
interests, and the Chinese, who want American trade, investment,
technology and respect, had congruent interests in this state
visit. That was to improve China's image in the United States,
showing its diversity and social changes and growing freedoms in
the personal realm.
</P>
<P>
   In that, the visit appears to have been a success. And it was
President Jiang's insight to recognize that a major concession,
like the televising of his news conference with Clinton and
Clinton's Beijing University speech, was needed to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prevented Clinton from coming back with egg on his
face,'' said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The visit has certainly bolstered the status here of Jiang.
Equally important, it gives a boost to the many other pragmatic
officials, from Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on down who believe that
the success of their transition to an advanced, market-oriented
economy depends on better ties with the undisputed economic and
political superpower, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the paucity of diplomatic breakthroughs at the summit
meeting, the friendly, tactful demeanor of Clinton, and Jiang's
bold decision to loosen temporarily the usual tight controls on
political discourse, helped create a happy feeling about
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   But elation is hard to follow, and the Chinese could be in for
morning-after dismay when the unresolved differences rear up again.
</P>
<P>
   These include America's huge and growing trade deficit with
China and its refusal to consider Chinese admission to the World
Trade Organization until painful changes are made to open markets.
American concerns over political and religious freedoms may have
been muffled this week, but China is not about to become a liberal
democracy, and concerns about weapons proliferation have not yet
been fully satisfied either.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its own economic cycle, its efforts to revamp the
vast state-run economic sector and the Asian financial crisis,
China may be in for a rough economic period in any case. Seeing no
rush of American trade and investment and high technology, some of
this week's cheering citizens here may become disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old-guard Communist hard-liners in the government who
might lead an anti-American reaction seem to have been routed from
real influence over the last year by Jiang and the pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials and experts, sounding quite like American
officials on the subject, say they hope that the good will and
low-profile technical ties forged by the reciprocal state visits
will help the two countries live through their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems are still here,'' said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of the
Foreign Affairs College in Beijing. ``But I think both sides now
understand each other better.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope, in Beijing as well as in the White House, is that an
overarching sense of partnership will enable these two giants to
avoid dangerous conflict _ a military confrontation over Taiwan
being the worst case _and to reap mutual economic benefits. The
American officials, rightly or wrongly, also believe that by
engaging China they will nudge Beijing to become more open and
democratic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chinese people, like Americans, are pondering the meaning of
President Jiang's decision to allow the televising of an extended
discussion of Tibet, human rights and the 1989 killings in and
around Tiananmen Square. It was done in the most tentative of ways:
there was no announcement beforehand, insuring a small
Saturday-noon audience, and Clinton's most direct words on 1989 and
the Dalai Lama and democracy were not reported in the official news
media.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how this limited but genuine public airing will
play out _ whether the government will feel emboldened to allow
more free debate at home, whether people's expectations of free
speech will change.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt about the short-term gains, for China as
well as for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost to China was relatively small compared to the
benefits,'' said Yasheng Huang, a Chinese-born political economist
at the Harvard Business School. ``The American public and media
were happy with the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept the costs for China down, and avoided a more
defensive reaction, by holding back on some sensitive topics, said
MacFarquhar of Harvard. For example, he might have spoken about
Taiwan's heady democracy, or pointed to the student-led downfall of
President Suharto in Indonesia as a grim example to the Chinese
leaders, who brook no political opposition themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In his final-day remarks in Hong Kong, Clinton seemed to credit
China's leaders with a stronger commitment to radical political
change than they have ever revealed to their own countrymen. He
said Jiang and Zhu were ``the right leadership at the right time''
and are ``clearly committed to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is an accurate assessment of these longtime
Communists whose reforms, so far, seem more designed to save the
party's rule than to destroy it, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Clinton's American-style politicking may change a
new generation's expectations of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton was widely admired for his directness, quick
wit and frankness,'' said Zhang, the People's University professor.
``Most importantly, he stood out here in his youth.''

   HONG KONG _ President Clinton offered a glowing endorsement
Friday of President Jiang Zemin of China as a man of
``extraordinary intellect'' capable of guiding his country through
historic change. Clinton also predicted that democracy will one day
be a way of life in China.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference here as the last official act in
his fast-paced and controversial nine-day diplomatic mission,
Clinton said he has been witness to a ``remarkable transformation''
in the Chinese economy and lifestyle, one he said will continue
under Jiang's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' Clinton said, when asked by a reporter if democracy
could ever come to China. ``I believe there can be and I believe
there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jiang, with whom he dined twice last weekend, Clinton said:
``I have a very high regard for his abilities. After I met with him
the first time I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming
the leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because
he's a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of
vigor for his age, or indeed, for any age.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``He has a good imagination. He has vision, he
can visualize, he can imagine a future that is different from the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's parting words displayed a significant admiration for
the leader of a communist regime that routinely suppresses public
opinion, arrests dissidents, and refuses to admit wrongdoing in the
massacre of thousands of protesters in Tiananmen Square nine years
ago. To that end, his friendliness toward Jiang may prove fodder
for those on Capitol Hill who oppose his policy of engagement of
China.
</P>
<P>
   With the news conference over and the last meeting finished, at
8:26 p.m. Friday, Clinton, his family and the exhausted US
delegation left on Air Force One for Washington from the new Hong
Kong International Airport, refueling at a military base in Alaska
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Clinton did caution that change may not come as
rapidly to China as some Americans might like. And to that end, he
stopped short of predicting democracy would come to China in his
lifetime, asking the rhetorical question, ``Do I think a woman will
be elected president of the United States? I do. Do I know when it
will happen? I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Clinton defended his decision not to
meet with political dissidents in Beijing last weekend as a
diplomatically prudent tactic that would aid his ultimate cause of
bringing more rights to the Chinese masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions I made were based on my best judgment on how to
be most effective on expanding human rights,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he wanted to relay a public messages to the dissidents
whom he failed to meet, Clinton said: ``My message is the US is on
your side and we did our best. We think that it's going to take a
lot of discipline and a lot of effort, but we believe that this
strategy is the one most likely to advance the cause of free speech
and free association and free expression of religious conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual moment, Clinton came close to expressing regret
for his harsh criticism of former president George Bush's China
policy in the 1992 presidential campaign, a time when he accused
Bush of ``coddling dictators'' in the aftermath of the Tiananmen
Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter if he did ever have the occasion to regret
his campaign stance, Clinton said he believed the United States
needed to be ``clear and unambiguous in our condemnation'' of the
massacre. But he went on to cite Bush's ``genuine concern'' in
maintaining a relationship with China, and added, ``I think any
president would say that once you've served in this job you
understand a little bit more the nuances of all policies than you
do before you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one question in the 40-minute news conference addressed any
of the myriad scandal issues being pursued in Washington by
Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and that one question
focused on Jiang's assertion last Saturday that China played no
role in trying to influence the 1996 US elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, reporters focused almost entirely on foreign policy,
spending most of their time on China but also asking questions on
Japan, Cuba, and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of Northern Ireland, Clinton said he has had ``good
long talks'' with Irish leaders over the last few days, as the
marching season begins, bringing with it the potential for further
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred to a series of arson attacks on Catholic
churches in Northern Ireland, saying, ``I feel personally horrible
about what has happened to the churches.'' He compared the arson to
church burnings in the United States two years ago and during the
civil rights movement, then added, ``I would just plead to whoever
was responsible for this for whatever reason, you need to take the
churches off the list, and you need to take violence off the
list.''
</P>
<P>
   On China, Clinton said the United States had a ``profound
interest in a partnership with the world's largest country.'' He
said the nation was well on its way to ``defining and honestly and
openly dealing with areas of differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he asked Jiang to cooperate with investigators
pursuing information on campaign fund-raising practices. Jiang had
said last week that he conducted his own investigation into whether
Chinese government officials funneled campaign contributions to
Clinton, and determined they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Clinton returned to the theme of China's capable
leadership steering the country through historic change during a
time when cellular telephones and stock issues are becoming
emblematic of a more open, more market-oriented society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that leaders of vision and imagination and courage
will find a way to put China on the right side of history and keep
it there,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said, ``There remain powerful forces resisting
change, as evidenced by continuing governmental restrictions on
free speech, assembly, and freedom of worship. One of the questions
I have tried to frame on this trip for the future is how do we deal
with these issues in a way most likely to promote progress. The
answer I think is clear: dealing directly, forcefully, but
respectfully with the Chinese about our values.''

NEED A CASTLE? TRY GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEEBURG, Germany _ With its commanding lake view, immense stone
hall, and more bedrooms than the real estate sales force can
remember, Schloss Seeburg resembles a Walt Disney creation _ not to
mention an investor's dream at $99,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the castle roof is dotted with gaping holes. Pigeons live in
its hallways. Ten families are tenants in its outbuildings. The
town elders must approve all development plans. It is no surprise,
then, that industrial magnates are not rushing to invest the $10
million necessary to make this east German castle livable again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Seeburg goes under the auctioneer's gavel Saturday,
experts say it will find aa buyer. But chances are, he or she will
not be from the west, but from the Communists-turned-capitalists of
Germany's former east.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Germans seem to have the money now,'' says Sabine Pentrop
of the Treuhand Liegenschaftsgesellschaft, the agency charged with
selling former Communist assets. ``And they have no dreams. They
know this is no fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a fairy tale ending, though, to the violent saga of
east Germany's castles, which were seized first by the Nazis, then
by the Russians, and finally by the East German communists. Now,
some of these behemoths are returning to local ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Few would have predicted this in 1992, when 118 of east
Germany's most stately castles were put up for sale. Under the
terms of unification, they could not be returned to the families
who once owned them. Nor could the German government afford to keep
them, given their estimated $281 million annual upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Many expected wealthy Americans, hungry for a piece of Europe,
would snap up the stately homes. That is why, in 1994, a marketing
campaign billed them as ``Fairy Tales For Sale.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood magnates did not materialize. Americans were put
off, among other things, by Germany's strict historic preservation
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one American has bought one,'' says Pentrop. ``Not even
Michael Jackson wanted to buy one of our castles.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a few wealthy west Germans came hunting. One aristocrat
bought back his family's castle, Schloss Kannenberg. An unlanded
aristocrat, Count von Rehbinder bought a castle that he is
transforming into a equestrian riding school.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the east Germans who have bought castles are
businessmen, combining new-found capital with socialist heritage,
have been the most successful in proposing ways for castles to be
developed that local communities would approve.
</P>
<P>
   These buyers are not looking to live in the castles or make them
Michelin-star hotels. Instead, they're talking about music
retreats, children's camps, and even business headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others proposed hotels, but we were providing jobs,'' says
Gisela Schroth, who bought Castle Koetteritzsch, east of Leipzig,
as the future headquarters of her family construction business.
``And we have the motivation to say we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Motivation is a requirement. Renovating these castles is no easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   At Schloss Seeburg, years of communist neglect have left their
mark. The driveway is choked with weeds. The walls still bear faded
posters from the FDJ, the Communist youth organization.
</P>
<P>
   A clock in the hallway is stopped at 12:00. The coal heating
doesn't work. The castle's rooms, turned into shabby dormitories,
reflects its days as a Nazi youth camp and then a training school
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, nothing works,'' concedes Michael Kneb, an
assessor, standing in Seeburg's dusty main hallway. ``But this is
better than average. There are some that have no roofs.''
</P>
<P>
   Families today still picnic in the Seeburg's grounds, as they
more or less have since it was built in the eighth century. Not
surprisingly, locals are nervous about the new owners and what the
castle will become.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the Columbian or Russian mafia were interested in
buying it,'' says Franz Graf, the 64-year-old caretaker. Graf's
family worked at Seeburg in pre-war days, his grandmother as a
gardener and his mother as a cook.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever buys Schloss Seeburg also becomes the landlord for the
10 families living in its outbuildings. When potential buyers react
with dismay to the news that the tenants cannot be evicted, auction
house representative Martina Stein tries to reassure them. It's
extra income,'' she says brightly.
</P>
<P>
   And these castles eat up money. Of the 79 castles which have
sold since 1992, buyers have invested a total of $29 million the
Treuhand estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Sven-Erik Hitzer, an east German travel agent who bought Schloss
Thuermsdorf near Dresden in 1997, estimates he will need $3 million
to renovate the 50-room castle, formerly used as a labor union
vacation camp. But he hopes to recoup the money by turning the
place into a historic rental property.
</P>
<P>
   It was that populist ideal that appealed to town elders, who
rejected a bid from another buyer to transform the castle into a
golf hotel. ``Somebody once calculated that 0.002 of all people
live in a castle,'' says Hitzer. ``But anybody can rent this castle
and feel like they are the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all easterners are thrilled that their neighbors are buying
local castles. Schroth grew up in the village of Sermuth, where
Castle Koetteritzsch is located, but was snubbed by some when she
became its landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the older men came up to me, grabbed my pocket, and
said, ``Show me, where are your millions?'' recalls Schroth.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Castle Koetteritzsch is in anything but fairy tale
condition. But there is a Cinderella quality to Schroth's story.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she played outside the castle walls, and dreamed of
living in its peaked tower. But that vision was not to be as she
grew up under communism. Castle Koetteritzsch was the headquarters
of a local agricultural association.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed after the Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood in the courtyard with a woman from the Treuhand,
discussing who would buy the castle,'' says Schroth. ``And she said
to me, ``What about you?''
</P>
<P>
   She gathered up the family earnings and argued she could make
the castle an expanded headquarters for the family construction
business, which employs 120 in Sermuth. Even though her bid was
less than a prospective owner from California, Schroth got the
castle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she has opened a small pub on the grounds. Flower boxes
hang outside the renovated apartments in the former stables. More
renovations are underway on the main castle, for the business
headquarters and employee housing.
</P>
<P>
   And Castle Koetteritzch, once again, belongs to a local.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so special that we were able to do this,'' Schroth says,
whose family settled in Sermuth in the 1600s. ``We're keeping this
castle in the community.''

FIREFIGHTER PILOTS `TRYING TO STOP A HURRICANE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ From the cockpit of his World War II-vintage
airplane, Andrew Brucker has seen more of Florida's smoky nightmare
than anyone else _ a familiarity has bred a reluctant respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mother Nature is just having her way,'' said Brucker, who
has been dropping 2,000 gallons of red-stained fire retardant on
the ruinous wildfires several times a day since May 27. ``It's just
like trying to stop a hurricane. We can't do it. It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brucker is a soldier in an army of firefighters who are using
water and chemicals, bulldozers and shovels, sweat and prayer to
combat walls of flame and towers of smoke that have turned parts of
the Sunshine State into a blackened moonscape under perpetually
ashen skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen fire behavior so severe that the fire's created its
own thunderstorms and lightning,'' said Brucker. ``That's the first
time I've ever seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado native and an 18-year veteran of aerial firefighting,
Brucker was the first of what is now a team of pilots here,
arriving more than four weeks ago and working 14-hours shifts
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   His red-and-white Douglas DC-4 aircraft, built in 1944 and used
during the Berlin Airlift, is pumped full of ammonium
polyphosphate, a commonly used agricultural fertilizer, that is
mixed with water stored in 5,000-gallon plastic water tanks on the
tarmac of the airport here.
</P>
<P>
   These chemical bombing runs of Brucker and his colleagues,
directed by US Forestry Service and Bureau of Land Management
officials, are designed to preserve the perimeter of fires that are
moving with terrifying speed in unpredictable directions.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a smaller plane, Brucker flies at 150 miles per hour
and is just 150 feet above the ground when he pulls a lever to
release a surrealistic stream of red relief before returning to the
airport to repeat the routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is trying to keep individual houses from
burning down,'' the pilot said before his first run Friday. ``And
we can be somewhat successful. We can herd the fire around
particular sites sometimes. But as far as stopping these fires, the
only thing that's going to do that is rain. You just can't stop a
hurricane. When these fires are putting off the same energy as
low-yield nuclear bombs _ over a minute instead of a second _ that
power is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The work done by Brucker and his colleagues has been so
appreciated here _ where it was 100 degree Friday and so smoky some
pedestrians wore protective masks _ that their last runs on
Thursday night were hailed by 300 residents who stood on the end of
the runway and waved and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dangerous gesture because any aircraft aborting a
landing may have plowed into them. But Brucker said it put a human
face on a fire that is impersonal from treetop level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes on a human dimension when people's houses are burning
down,'' the gray-haired pilot said. ``We tend to depersonalize
things today. In the lexicon of disaster reports, it's not
somebody's house that's burning down, it's a `structure' that's
threatened. I kind of resent that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brucker, who has fought fires in Alaska's magnificent wilderness
and in the Snake River Canyon in Idaho, said that Florida's
wildfire of the century is providing a lesson on what happens when
man seeks to harness nature's sometimes untamable domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view my job more and more as not putting out forest fires
per se but protecting people's homes who have bumped up against the
forest,'' Brucker said. ``We call it the urban interface. We've put
out every fire ever started almost without fail, and we're seeing
the consequences of that policy. Forests don't get to go through
their natural burning-down process that they need to go through. I
can imagine how devastating I'd be if my house burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you, there aren't enough airplanes in the world
to put these fires out.''

WATER (Undated) - People across the Valley _ and across the country
from Simi Valley, Calif., to Webster, N.Y. _ say TCE silently is
attacking their neighborhoods. They say the solvent used by
industrial companies for years is making people ill, and sometimes
killing them. But despite years of litigation involving millions of
dollars in attorneys' fees, proving a connection between the two
has been nearly impossible. Defendants in most lawsuits involving
TCE appear to have gained the upper hand. By CHRIS FISCUS. Story

RAINBOW (Springerville, Ariz.) - A frenzied beat rises from dozens
of pounding drums as a milling, tie-dyed crowd of Rainbow warriors
dance and sing, wildly proclaiming their message of freedom,
harmony and togetherness. Long hair flying, bare feet caked in
dust, and dressed in a motley array of colors, the latter-day
hippies look as though they've come through a time warp from the
'60s. Young people dressed as flower children mingle with grizzled
Woodstock veterans. As if on cue, most of the crowd huddle for a
lengthy group hug with a cast of thousands voicing a collective
``om'' in the fading light. It's a strange and unlikely scene on
this isolated Alpine meadow deep in the Ponderosa pines where more
than 17,000 men, women and children, plus thousands of wandering
dogs, have come for the 27th annual Rainbow Family of Living Light
National Gathering. By BOB GOLFEN.Story will move in the ``A''

General Motors Corp. sibling, Safari) is also a survivor. It's the

 &HT;    Pine needles prove to be perfect fuel for Florida wildfires
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The answer to why Florida keeps burning
is below our feet and above our heads.
</P>
<P>
   Slash pines, with needles that decompose slowly, longleaf pines
and others pack flammable resin and have air between needles that
allow them to burn quick and hot. Some get so hot neighboring trees
``will just kind of explode. It will turn red and blow up into
flames,'' said Greg Thayer, fire information officer for the
Florida Unified Command.
</P>
<P>
   Below, brush is even more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have been plotted moving at 30 to 40 mph,'' he said.
``Once it starts moving and has a high flame length, it will create
its own wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, what grows in central and southern Florida is perfect
fuel for wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Florida pine forests have an open canopy that allow
needles and scrub to dry quickly, making fire possible within a day
of rain, studies show. Hardwoods often stop fires, but when fires
get hot enough (upwards of 1,300 degrees), hardwood ignites as
well. Routine burning helps keep down the fuel, but most areas no
longer do controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Jacksonville officials ``have been doing under-burning
for five to six years and they noticed when the fire moved through
there, it did not just pick up and run. It smoldered around and
didn't have ground fuel to carry it to the next tree,'' Thayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eons ago, fires typically burned pine forests every two to three
years, usually ignited in June with heavy lightning when most
vegetation is dry and burns quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, roads, canals and firefighters quickly extinguish those.
</P>
<P>
   Studying wildfires, why they burn, how they burn, what their
smoke does to the environment and to our health has engaged
scientists around the world. Scientists from around the world are
gathering this month in Canada's Northwest Territory to study crown
fires, the most dangerous fires that light the tops of trees and
allow wildfires to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, U.S. scientists completed a 7-year study of the
effects of wildfire smoke on firefighters and surprisingly found it
caused no long-term health effects, said Dick Mangan, fire program
leader for the Missoula Technical and Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   While smoke depresses the immune system temporarily, they found
it caused only short-term problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nose runs, eyes water and you hack and cough sometimes
for a couple of days,'' he said. ``In a real severe season of 90 to
100 days when they're out all the time, it can be a two to three
month period where they get the crud.

 &HT;    Rehashes of ashes? No _ it's just dust
 &HT;    By Jodi Wetuski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The new haze hovering over parts of Texas is not
the smoky-brown variety that comes from south-of-the-border fires,
but one caused by dust particles that have floated all the way from
the Sahara Desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to Austin and I thought, `Is it just me or is it
hazy?'' said Zoe Rascoe, air program manager for the Waco office of
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. ``It's very
likely (Saharan dust) is what we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sahara, located in northern Africa, the wind whips up
dust storms every few days, said TNRCC meteorologist Bryan Lambeth.
In the winter, this dust sails over the Atlantic Ocean to Europe,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the summer, the same winds that bring hurricanes to the
Gulf Coast carry the dust to the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This occurs several times each summer, Lambeth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably always happened,'' he said. ``But it's much
easier to document now'' thanks to satellites and high-tech
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The first Saharan dust cloud of the summer swept through South
Texas on Sunday, Lambeth said. It peaked in North and Central Texas
on Tuesday, and it's fizzling out now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though this week's Saharan dust measurements have caused a
slight reduction in visibility, this particular cloud isn't the
worst one meteorologists have seen, Lambeth said. Last summer
produced more noticeable ``Saharan Dust Episodes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are likely paying more attention to this dust episode
because of a heightened public awareness of air quality issues,
brought on by the recent fires in Mexico and Central America,
Rascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican smoke haze has people pretty sensitive,'' Rascoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those fires, which have been brought under control in recent
weeks, burned for months. They churned out vast amounts of smoke,
prompting a few public health alerts across Texas for the elderly,
children and people with respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saharan dust isn't a big health hazard, Lambeth said.
It's mainly a concern for people with mold allergies, because mold
spores can hitch a ride with the dust particles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of dust traveling so many miles to Texas is amusing
to some TNRCC officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's the first `Saharan Dust Episode' of the season,
but it's the first one of my life,'' said Rascoe, claiming she
wasn't aware of the phenomenon until this summer. ``I assumed (the
dust) was from West Texas.''

BEATING SURVEILLANCE: DON'T CARE, JUST LAUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A large orange box on wheels with a video camera on
top was chasing random people down Astor Place and up Third Avenue.
The box was videotaping the people it pursued. Their reaction? They
laughed. Then they watched the box turn on its wheels and chase
someone else down the street.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't afraid or annoyed. They seemed almost tickled about
having their privacy violated. Why? Maybe because they didn't see
it as a serious invasion. Maybe because they were used to
surveillance cameras. Maybe because they were nervous. Maybe
because attacking a funny-looking box doesn't look good on film.
It's like hitting Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of the camera-on-a-box, Michael Waters, 33,
standing with his remote control device in his hand, spotted an
attractive woman approaching in a short skirt. ``Get her, get
her!'' he ordered the box. ``Yes!'' She ran away from the box, into
the street, and on the opposite corner she collapsed in mock
terror. The camera retreated, keeping its lens on her all the
while.
</P>
<P>
   Waters admitted he could never get away with this in person. But
because it's a silly box with a police light on top, ``no one is
rough on it.'' Oh, there are some exceptions. ``One guy punched at
it,'' Waters said. ``But he felt really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters and his brazen camera seem to be part of a trend: ironic,
artistic surveillance. How can you distinguish it from ordinary
surveillance? The intention is different. Mock surveillance is
intended to be subversive, even comical, and it has no practical
purpose. Clearly Waters was not out to police people with his
camera. He was just having fun. Nonetheless, he did plan to show
his videotape on public access television, and he wasn't asking
anyone for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance is out of hand. Walk into an apartment lobby and
you are on camera. Ride on an elevator and the guards in the lobby
watch you adjusting your pants. Get some money from a cash machine
and you'll be caught on film counting your bills. Don't try hiding
outdoors. Busy intersections are under 24-hour surveillance. There
are cameras in public squares. Don't bother destroying them.
They'll only catch you on tape doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the only way to respond to so much surveillance is with
more surveillance. You watch me, and I'll watch you watching me. As
artist Julia Sher put it, surveillance art is ``the art that
watches back.'' The trouble is, it is hard to distinguish mock
surveillance from real surveillance. Ms. Sher admitted that
surveillance artists share a bond with the police, since they are
both trying ``to find things that are invisible'' and they are both
using real surveillance equipment. In other words, surveillance
artists may be subversive but they are also part of the grand
surveillance machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 18th century, British political philosopher Jeremy
Bentham came up with what he called ``a simple idea in
architecture,'' a plan for a modern prison called the panopticon
(from the Greek word ``panoptes,'' meaning ``all-seeing''). At the
center of this circular penal compound would be a tower with
windows that could peer into every prisoner's cell. It was to be,
in other words, a system of total surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Bentham, who saw it as a painless penal colony, said, ``To be
incessantly under the eyes of the inspector is to lose in effect
the power to do evil and almost the thought of wanting to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosopher Michel Foucault wasn't exactly won over. He agreed
with Bentham that in a system of total surveillance, ``there is no
need for arms, physical violence, material constraints. Just a
gaze.'' But in echoing Bentham's analysis of the panopticon, he
emphasized its sinister aspect. In the end, Foucault said in the
1970s, each individual will internalize this gaze ``to the point
that he is his own supervisor . . . exercising this surveillance
over, and against, himself.'' The presumption of surveillance would
make real surveillance unnecessary. Every person would be a
prisoner of his own watchfulness.
</P>
<P>
   These days there is so much surveillance, both serious and
subversive, that we appear to be living in a panopticon. Take, for
a small example, Manhattan's Washington Square. At the south end of
the park two surveillance cameras have been installed to help with
the policing of the park. Just across the street, outside the Grey
Art Gallery, two more surveillance cameras, ironic ones, have been
installed by the artist Julia Sher to coincide with the exhibition
there, ``Police Pictures: The Photograph as Evidence.'' The cameras
alternate between looking into the park and looking into the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   In June, during a symposium on public art and public space
sponsored by New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, a
handful of surveillance artists gathered for a daylong meeting on
surveillance, voyeurism and scopophilia (the love of looking).
Naturally, the meeting was videotaped. Anyone who wanted to ask a
question had to do it on camera and into a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Novakov, an art historian and the author of ``Veiled
Histories: The Body, Place and Public Art,'' argued that modern
surveillance, the practice of scoping out city streets to detect
crime before it happens, began with men's fear of women. Before the
19th century, she said, city streets were for men alone and women
stayed home. It was when the first department stores opened, and
women started venturing into the streets, that men started
snooping. Fearful of being ensnared by the wrong sort of woman,
they wanted to know how to tell the prostitutes from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Novakov said, they depended on the flaneur, the
man about town who was there to see and be seen, to tell them who
was who. But eventually the flaneur's role was usurped by
photography. And the art of detecting potential deviants was taken
up by physiognomists like Francis Galton. Galton, whose photographs
are on view in ``Police Pictures,'' classified people according to
facial features and even created composite photographs of criminal
faces to ferret out the crucial characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   After the physiognomists, the business of surveillance was taken
up by detectives and would-be detectives, Ms. Novakov said. Wearing
miniature cameras in their hats, vests and cravats, they took
pictures of people on the street without being noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the role that was played by the flaneur, the physiognomist
and the detective has been taken by the surveillance camera.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that artists have gotten into the business of
surveillance. But many surveillance artists, well versed in
Foucault, have decided that if they are going to be watched, they
are darn well going to watch as well. They won't take all this
surveillance lying down.
</P>
<P>
   At the symposium, Ms. Sher, the surveillance artist responsible
for the two cameras in Washington Square, got up before her
audience like someone at an AA meeting and said: ``I am an artist,
a voyeur and a street person. My mother was a housewife and a
voyeur.'' Then she went on to describe her work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sher, who used to install security systems for a living
before she became a surveillance artist, has created a series of
museum pieces called ``Security by Julia.'' She has set up
``surveillance sex beds'' that videotape people watching
pornography while lying down on them. She has set up video monitors
in museums to show the faces of passers-by on giant monitors and to
caption their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're our own surveyor and surveyed,'' she said, so we might
as well be well equipped. Luckily there is plenty of gear now
available: battlefield viewing devices, U-2 aircraft data-gathering
instruments, face-tracking systems, time-lapse recorders, cameras
that strip off your clothes to show what you look like naked and
noninvasive devices that look inside your organs to see if you're
hiding any drugs. She loves them all.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Sher sat down, more surveillance artists came forward.
Laura Kurgan, an architect, told how she had made use of the global
positioning system to track herself walking along the roof of a
museum in Barcelona for a project called ``You Are Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Labat, another surveillance artist, reported that he had
just finished shooting a ``Hooters'' video. One camera was trained
on some men having a fistfight outside a Hooters restaurant.
Another, showing the mats where the stunt men were falling,
indicated that the fight was a fake. The third camera was focused
on the people inside Hooters who were watching the event through a
window.
</P>
<P>
   Have these artists overcome surveillance with surveillance or
have they simply expanded the great panopticon? It's hard to tell.
But there is one thing that may save us all from being prisoners of
our own constant watchfulness: surveillance overload. If everybody
is videotaping everybody else, who cares anymore? No one will have
time to watch all this stuff anyway. Face it, it's unbearably
boring to watch an elevator monitor for more than 10 minutes. In
fact, it's not appreciably different from standing on a street
corner waiting for something to happen.
</P>
<P>
   For the panopticon to work, for people to be ready to police
themselves in a guardless prison, it is not enough for everyone to
believe that they are being watched every moment of the day. They
must care. It's not the cameras themselves but the fear of the
cameras that turns people into what Foucault called ``docile
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if you happen to see a friendly-looking orange box on
wheels, whatever you do, don't run.

BRAZIL KEEPS IT TOGETHER, DEFEATS DENMARK, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NANTES, France _ Brazil has demonstrated flair, style, and a
tendency to self-destruct during the World Cup finals. But the
Selecao gained credibility and enhanced its self-belief, and
finally got in the rhythm of (itals)jogo bonito(unitals) in
rallying to overcome Denmark, 3-2, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mastered the game and showed our qualities,'' said
Brazilian defender Cafu, who will be suspended for Wednesday's
semifinal at Marseilles against the winner of
Argentina-Netherlands. ``This is the spirit of our game _ we always
keep control of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both coach Mario Zagallo and forward Bebeto redeemed themselves
after several days of intense criticism, as Zagallo made successful
adjustments and Bebeto scored the first Brazil goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a victory of willpower, a victory of a team that
knows how to win,'' Zagallo said. ``Brazil showed what the game
should be like in the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians reacted positively after surrendering an early
goal, eventually devising a defense to halt Michael Laudrup, and
opening room for Rivaldo to take over the midfield and score twice.
</P>
<P>
   The open play rewarded a festive crowd dominated by yellow-clad
Brazilians and augmented by red-clad Roligans, the Danes' opposite
of hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   The Laudrup brothers inspired the first goal, by Martin
Jorgensen, less than two minutes into the match. Peter Moller raced
past Junior Baiano on the left, nutmegging him on the way to the
edge of the penalty area, where he was fouled by Dunga. Michael
Laudrup quickly slipped the free kick to brother Brian, who went
toward the end line and drew the ball back to Jorgensen in front of
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Nigeria, which fell behind Denmark and continued to make
defensive tactical mistakes in a 4-1 second-round defeat, the
Brazilians retaliated in a cohesive, inspired manner. In other
words, they made certain the ball went to Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the first 10 minutes, Ronaldo struggled to elude the
marking of Glasgow Celtic defender Marc Rieper. Then, Ronaldo
retreated toward the center circle, took a pass from Dunga, and on
his first touch of the game went left, then cut the ball back with
his left foot. Bebeto stepped over the ball, touched it toward the
edge of the penalty area, and shot low just as Jan Heintze and
Thomas Helveg closed in.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo's first chance to go directly at the goal midway through
the half was halted from behind by Brian Laudrup, who could have
been cautioned, or even ejected. But referee Gamal Ghandour allowed
play to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians increased their intensity, pressing forward as
the Danes attempted to clear. Dunga stole from Helveg, laid off to
Ronaldo, who slipped the ball to Rivaldo on the left. Rivaldo, who
helped Barcelona win the Spanish championship last season, drew
goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel to the edge of the goal area, then
chipped over him into the far side of the goal for a 2-1 edge in
the 26th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Laudrup continued to threaten, setting up Moller for a
clear shot in the 35th minute. But Moller stumbled just inside the
penalty area and squandered the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark tied in the fourth minute of the second half as Brian
Laudrup roofed a missed bicycle kick clearance by Roberto Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Brazil responded. Dunga, who struggled to keep pace with
the Danes defensively, controlled the pace from defensive midfield.
He waited until Denmark had opened space in the midfield, then
found Rivaldo 50 yards from goal. As soon as Rivaldo faced the
goal, Schmeichel retreated and the Danish defenders allowed Rivaldo
to carry forward unhindered for another 15 yards. Schmeichel,
respecting Rivaldo's long-range shot, failed to cut the angle as
Rivaldo drilled a low drive into the right corner of the goal in
the 15th minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Rivaldo took over Leonardo's role and took
command of the midfield, once trapping a long pass on his chest,
then dribbling through three defenders into the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   But the Danes persisted, and Rieper barely missed off a
33d-minute corner and a header off the bar in the final minutes.
Zagallo added defensive reinforcements Emerson and Ze Roberto, but
even then the Brazilians continued to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team was fantastic, almost as good as the world
champions,'' Denmark coach Bo Johannson said. ``I didn't think my
players were that good.''

 TRUCKLIKE ASTRO IS ROUGH, TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) -The Chevrolet Astro is a box on wheels, a simple,
rugged device that has more in common with the Chevy van of the
'60s than it does with the popular front-drive minivans of today.
</P>
<P>
   As a rear-drive van with a truck frame, the Astro (and its
General Motors Corp. sibling, Safari) is also a survivor. It's the
last of its breed now that Ford Aerostar has gotten the ax. All the
other small vans are hybrid minivans, based on car chassis and
pulled by their front wheels, including Chevy's own Venture and
Ford's Windstar.
</P>
<P>
   Because Astro's handling and driveability are subpar compared
with the carlike minivan herd, some drivers brand it a throwback.
Indeed, the Astro seems to have missed the minivan revolution,
soldiering on with the clumsy handling, body sway and bounding ride
of an earlier generation of vans.
</P>
<P>
   But that's missing the point. The Astro is not trying to be a
car with cargo space, like the front-drivers, but a small truck
that can be used like a car.
</P>
<P>
   Astro is slightly bigger and significantly stronger than the
competition, with greater cargo capacity and enough towing muscle
to handle a 5,500-pound trailer, which would include many boats and
horse trailers. That's the beauty of the Astro and Safari, allowing
them to be used like full-size vans without the driver having to
shoulder such a big, unwieldy vehicle through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are those drivers who like the driving feel and
security of a truck, rather than the softer ride of a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful V-6, truck frame and rear-wheel drive provide the
extra towing and cargo utility, and many Astros serve as work
trucks and delivery vans. Our test Astro, an upscale LS version,
was equipped with optional all-wheel-drive, increasing its
usefulness on dirt roads and under snowy conditions, as well as
enhancing its maneuverability on slick surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the ride height and a certain level of roughness,
drivers and as many as seven passengers, depending on
configuration, should find the interior of the Astro as
accommodating as any minivan. The wheel wells intrude on foot space
up front, but cargo space behind the rear bench seat is superior to
the minis.
</P>
<P>
   The optional rear ``Dutch door'' tailgate is a mixed blessing.
Although it provides improved access for loading and unloading, it
can be a pain to open or close with your hands full. Also, Astro
and Safari fall short in the door wars, providing no second door on
the left side for rear passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The front-end styling changes lack the panache and individuality
of the old design.
</P>
<P>
   Cornering this high-profile truck can be dicey, requiring
moderation in speed and adding to the sense of driving a big van.
The steering is relatively quick, which seems odd considering the
limited handling capabilities. The brakes are effective, with
standard anti-lock technology.
</P>
<P>
   The driver sits high above the asphalt, requiring an extra
built-in step for climbing aboard, and some people may feel that
they're piloting a big cargo van rather than a lightweight truck.
The dashboard is high and the windshield seems small.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is sensibly designed, with simple, accessible
gauges and switches in familiar Chevy style and configuration. The
upgraded stereo with CD, which included rear-seat controls, sounded
great. Seating is comfortable, though the bench seat in the back
has limited legroom, and there are plenty of nooks and cubbies for
stowage.
</P>
<P>
   The Astro and Safari have been around since the early days of
minivans, and although they are clumsy and rough riding, they do
provide an alternative for people who need extra space, cargo
capacity or towing strength. And in that respect, they pretty much
stand alone. &QL;

HENMAN FALLS TO SAMPRAS, DISAPPOINTING BRITONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pete Sampras had more than just Tim Henman to overcome
in the Wimbledon semifinals. Over 16,000 fans jammed into Centre
Court Friday to root for their countryman against the defending
champion.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras ignored the English partisans to post a 6-3, 4-6,
7-5, 6-3 victory over Henman in what the world's No. 1 ranked
player termed a ``very intense'' match.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal point came in the third set, when Sampras broke in
the 12th game to take it on his third set point, which came when
Henman belted a backhand volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised my level just a bit, hitting some good shots, and
that was the key to the match,'' said Sampras, in search of his
fifth Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of sets, we both had our moments, but in the
third set we both tightened up our tennis and it really came down
to me raising my level. That was the key and I knew that and I
think he knew that too.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was especially helpful to Henman in the second set.
``That's when the crowd had an opportunity to get behind me,'' said
the 12th-seeded Henman. ``They're the ones giving me a boost and I
think put him under a little added pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was more emotional than usual, arguing several times
with the umpire about what he thought were inconsistent calls by
Cyclops, the machine which determines whether serves are good or
not.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras, as usual, had his serve working with 16 aces to
Henman's seven. Henman, who had won just 50 percent of his second
serves, had 10 double faults to Sampras's seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a difference between us, it was probably our second
serves,'' said Sampras. ``His second serve probably let him down a
bit. I know Tim as a person and he'll work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decisive fourth set, Sampras notched the only service
break to go up, 3-1, and breezed from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was playing Tim and the crowd, so I was going to show
a little more emotion than usual and I did after that third set,''
said Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Henman said he didn't feel as though he let his country down by
not reaching the final. ``I've said all along that when I'm
winning, I'm not playing for the nation,'' he said, ``so when I
lose I'm not letting anyone down. When I'm on the court, it's about
myself. I win and I lose. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goran Ivanisevic defeated Richard Krajicek, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7
(5-7), 15-13, in the other semifinal, with the final set taking 77
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth straight time that Ivanisevic has defeated
Krajicek, the 1996 champion and ninth seed.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, Wimbledon runnerup in 1994 and 1992, had two match
points in the 10th game of the fourth set, but couldn't put
Krajicek away.
</P>
<P>
   Each had one break in the fifth set (Wimbledon plays out the
last set rather than going to a tiebreaker).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the 28th game, another break came, when Krajicek
netted the ball on a serve-and-volley backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic benefitted from serving before Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I was hoping was going to help me; it's easier to serve
first,'' Ivanisevic stated. ``I was enjoying the fifth set. I just
said, `OK, now you're going to be cool, you're not going to talk
too much, you're not going to talk at all, and just keep your mind
on what you have to do today, and you're going to win it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Invanisevic had been the forgotten player on the tour. But here
he is now, the No. 14 seed in the Wimbledon final.

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To hear John J. Brennan tell it, there's really nothing much
afoot at the Vanguard Group, the giant fund company he heads.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard definitely does not intend to join the rush to build a
financial services conglomerate, he said. Discount brokerage
services ``are never going to be a dominant part of what we are.''
Selling financial advice, he said, ``is not a core business.''
Overseas expansion? ``An experiment,'' Brennan responded. And
trouncing the competition ``is not a subject we talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are not what we do,'' Brennan, Vanguard's
chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview at the
firm's rural corporate campus near Valley Forge, Pa. ``My job is to
keep people focused on what it is that made us successful in the
first place,'' namely, ``a high value, client-first philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Brennan is simply trying to lull the competition to
sleep. Despite his protestations, Vanguard is moving aggressively
to expand its fledgling efforts in overseas markets and in such
businesses as discount brokerage, annuities and financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, those efforts are likely to lessen
Vanguard's reliance on its popular stock index funds significantly
while challenging a flotilla of bigger competitors in a broad array
of fields.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vanguard's mutual fund business, which has $400 billion
under management, it is setting a blistering pace for its rivals.
So far in 1998, the company has taken nearly as much money into its
stock and bond funds as Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments
and the American Funds combined.
</P>
<P>
   And since the beginning of the decade, Vanguard's market share
has grown at twice the rate of Fidelity's, to 8.5 percent at the
end of April, according to the Financial Research Corp., a data
gatherer in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Vanguard's growth has come from its stock-index funds.
Its most popular offering is the Index 500 portfolio, which by
simply seeking to match the stock market's performance has beaten
the returns of 9 out of every 10 American stock funds during the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months alone, that performance and the flood of
new cash flowing to the Index 500 fund have added $30 billion to
Vanguard's assets under management, which by itself is more money
than is managed by fund companies like Strong Funds, BancAmerica
Robertson Stephens or Gabelli Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Yet index funds tell only part of the story. Three out of the
top five of Vanguard's biggest-selling stock funds last year were
actively managed portfolios. The company is grabbing a growing
portion of the market for 401(k) and similar retirement plans. And
in the second quarter, Vanguard surpassed the Franklin Templeton
Group as the largest manager of bond mutual funds, up from No. 5 at
the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think Vanguard's hegemony is of the passing kind, like
that of so many other financial service giants, may well be
surprised. Because of its intense emphasis on keeping costs low,
``the advantages that Vanguard has are enduring,'' said Don
Phillips, president of Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who's in a better position to offer good bear market funds
_ bond or money market funds _ than Vanguard?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Vanguard turns greater attention to other parts of the
financial services business, investors are likely to benefit from
the same approach of low cost and convenience that Vanguard took to
mutual funds. At the very least, such moves will challenge
competitors to lower costs and improve service.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives in brokerage, financial advice and international
activities that Vanguard is so aggressively pursuing are not
entirely new. But chances are that relatively few Vanguard
customers know about them. That is because Vanguard has taken a
determinedly low profile in all of its businesses outside of funds.
</P>
<P>
   The policy goes back to the insistence of Vanguard's founder,
John C. Bogle, that the company not tamper with the source of its
success.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the position taken by Bogle, then the company's
chairman, when Vanguard started its discount brokerage business in
1983. He promised the board he would not spend any money marketing
the service except to Vanguard shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vanguard will actively seek to have investors bring more of
their nonfund assets to Vanguard. By fall, it plans to offer
on-line trading of stocks and bonds, according to James H. Gately,
the managing director who oversees Vanguard's Individual Investor
Group. Vanguard will also expand the offerings of funds from other
companies in its Fund Access program, which is similar to the fund
supermarket programs offered by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., Fidelity and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard also plans to step up the marketing of its financial
advisory services, particularly to retirement-plan investors.
Already, such services come in several forms. Investors can pay
$500 for one-time assessments of their portfolios or for estate
planning services. Or, for annual fees of 0.65 percent of assets or
less, investors can receive ongoing investment guidance from
Vanguard consultants. That compares with a typical financial
planner's fee of about 1 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of Vanguard's retirement-plan customers now
also have individual accounts with Vanguard, Gately said. Vanguard
hopes to increase that eventually to between one-third and
one-half.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, plenty of other firms offer discount brokerage,
financial planning and on-line trading services. What makes
Vanguard's moves so important is that it has already proved that
its low-cost approach can give it a major share of a highly
competitive business. That has been the history in the market for
retirement plans, in which Vanguard has become a top choice among
the corporate treasurers who oversee such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's share of the market for 401(k) retirement programs
has grown to 9.4 percent last year from 7.9 percent two years
earlier, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston consulting firm.
That is little more than half of the percentage held by Fidelity,
whose share has grown even faster, to 18.9 percent last year from
15.8 percent two years earlier. But Vanguard remains solidly in
second place among all retirement-plan providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As 401(k) sponsors try to reduce costs over all, they have
taken up the battle cry of index management,'' with its lower
costs, said Karina Istvan, a consultant at Cerulli.
</P>
<P>
   And Vanguard's prices are, famously, among the lowest in the
industry. Since 1986, the average expense ratio for Vanguard's
funds has declined to its current level of 28 basis points _
equivalent to $2.80 for each $1,000 of investment _ from about 45
basis points. That compares with the industry's average expense
ratio of $12.40 for each $1,000 of investment.
</P>
<P>
   What allows Vanguard to keep costs so low, and gives it a
competitive advantage that few rivals can match, is its unusual
corporate structure. Unlike any other major mutual fund company,
the Vanguard Group is mutually owned, meaning that it is owned by
the shareholders of the funds it manages.
</P>
<P>
   While companies like Fidelity seek to profit from providing
their services to funds, the Vanguard Group is committed to
providing its services to the Vanguard funds at cost. That gives it
a powerful edge, especially since it seems unlikely that any other
profit-seeking rival would want to follow its lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure is far more flexible than it might seem. The
company can spend as it sees fit because its board decides what
``cost'' is. If, for instance, Vanguard's board were to approve the
offering of 24-hour toll-free phone service to shareholders _
something it has opposed doing in the past _ the cost would be
incorporated into the funds' expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Big capital projects, which require large sums of money,
generally require extraordinary financing measures. In 1992, for
example, when Vanguard decided to build its own office complex on
200 acres of land it had bought in Malvern, Pa., rather than
continuing to rent space, the company asked shareholders of its
funds to approve the expense. At the time, Vanguard estimated that
the move would save investors $6 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual system of providing services at cost, however, also
raises a challenging question. Will the company have access to the
capital it will need to grow?
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard answers yes. ``We've never felt capital-constrained,''
said F. William McNabb III, a managing director who oversees
Vanguard's Institutional Investor Group. If the company increased
its 28 basis-point average expense ratio to just 33, ``that would
provide roughly $200 million a year in incremental money to spend
on service and technology,'' McNabb said.
</P>
<P>
   The parsimony in the funds' expenses is completely in keeping
with Vanguard's philosophy and culture, forged over the company's
23 years by Brennan's mentor, Bogle, who remained the company's
chairman until his retirement early this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Bogle served as the public face of Vanguard, his
anti-establishment rhetoric often making him the fund industry's
most vehement critic, Brennan easily slipped into the role of
detail man. He joined Vanguard in 1982 from S.C. Johnson &AMP; Son, the
maker of household products like Windex, Raid and Drano, where he
was a planning associate.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning as an assistant to Bogle, he took on the chief
financial officer's role in 1985, rising to president in 1989 and
chief executive in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when he was named chairman, the transition from
Bogle's command was completed. But Brennan is only beginning to
emerge in investors' minds from the shadow of Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a profile of huge importance within the mutual fund
industry, and we have a great depth of talent to maintain and
enhance that profile,'' Brennan said. ``Am I and will I be the
demonstrative leader of the company? Absolutely. But we're in no
rush to run out and start putting people's faces in ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his hair is fully gray, Brennan's still-boyish looks,
even at 43, bring to mind a collegiate student-body president more
than the chairman of one of the country's biggest
financial-services companies. He is the picture of probity, in a
white button-down shirt (no cufflinks, of course) and tasseled
loafers (an indulgence, perhaps).
</P>
<P>
   Fund industry insiders have long known Brennan as a steel-willed
competitor. He runs as many as 10 miles a day, more when he's
training for one of the few marathons he runs each year. Obsessed
with the details of performance, he checks statistics each day on
how quickly Vanguard's telephone representatives are able to
respond to callers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And his interest in the minutiae of the business extends down to
interactions with employees. Few events are as hoped for, or as
feared, as the arrival of one of Brennan's handwritten notes,
penned in his trademark green ink and commenting on some aspect of
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping those employees satisfied will be an increasingly
difficult task for Brennan as Vanguard grows. Exporting the esprit
de corps of the Pennsylvania headquarters to new employees in
Charlotte, N.C., and in Phoenix, where Vanguard recently opened
large service centers, or abroad makes the job even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vanguard's management structure is very flat for a
company its size, with 8,000 employees overseen by 10 managing
directors and just one intermediate level of management. That might
give the average employee little opportunity for upward movement.
</P>
<P>
   This situation appears to have been a factor in a recent rash of
defections in the fixed-income department. Several senior traders
and at least one upper-level portfolio manager left for rival
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Ian A. McKinnon, the managing director for the fixed-income
division, said he believed that the competition for talent in the
fund industry had led to some of the departures in the last year.
But he acknowledged that in a company with few layers of
organization, advancement can be slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our portfolio management staff has been in place for a long
time,'' McKinnon said. ``People in the next level down in the
organization get impatient. Some of those people availed themselves
of the chance to manage money elsewhere. If someone is offering an
opportunity like that, a reasonably ambitious person is going to
give it consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vanguard branching out, more opportunities might emerge
within the company, too. For instance, Vanguard is moving to use
its growing expertise in retirement plans to develop overseas
business, first in Australia, then in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're very optimistic about the global expansion
opportunities at Vanguard,'' said Jeremy G. Duffield, who is
overseeing the company's Australian effort. And as the world's
fifth-largest market for corporate- and government-sponsored
pension plans, Australia provides plenty of opportunity for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard will not be operating its overseas businesses in
entirely the same fashion as it does its United States fund group,
said Michael S. Miller, a managing director who oversees planning
and development. They will be priced to earn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do overseas we have got to do on a for-profit
basis, showing a return to our U.S. shareholders,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   What could tie an anchor to Vanguard's ambitious plans? A major
downturn in the American stock market. Some industry experts
surmise that such an event, after an extended period of fervor for
the Index 500 fund among investors, could severely test Vanguard's
long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vanguard Index 500 fund has become a proxy for the
Vanguard Group in the minds of many investors, much as the Magellan
fund did for Fidelity,'' said Burton J. Greenwald, a fund industry
consultant in Philadelphia. ``When the Magellan fund
underperformed, the perception that something was amiss at Fidelity
clouded all of their funds, despite the fact that many of the
Fidelity funds continued to furnish superior results. Vanguard is
susceptible to the same risk if the market falters.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, those worries have not slowed Vanguard's growth a bit.
The company continues to exceed its peers significantly in
gathering assets, raising the inevitable question of whether, or
when, it will push ahead of Fidelity to become the largest American
fund company.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, Brennan firmly declares his indifference. ``I
would not be surprised to see two firms merge, leaving us further
down the list from No. 2,'' he said. ``As long as we do the right
thing for our clients, it isn't a goal for us.''

BOSTON POPS TRADITION NOW STRETCHES ACROSS THE COUNTRY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just a modest cultural note for all the patriots whose
hearts will swell and ears will ring to the sky-lighted explosions
of the 1812 Overture on Saturday night: It all started here.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Revolution _ though that, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Boston Pops tradition now practiced in scores if not
hundreds of spots around the country, that the orchestra caps its
Fourth of July concert with Tchaikovsky's (undeniably non-American,
but who cares?) 1812 Overture and air-splitting rounds of cannon
fire along with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a quirky friendship between two men: Arthur
Fiedler, the late, legendary, curmudgeonly conductor of the Boston
Pops Orchestra, and David Mugar, a millionaire Boston businessman
who has sponsored every one of Boston's Fourth of July concerts
since they took on this explosive form 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Mugar and Fiedler bonded partly because they shared an
eccentric love: driving around the city listening in on police
radio traffic and hustling to the scenes of fires. When Fiedler
mentioned to Mugar that he was concerned about the dwindling
attendance at the Pops concerts at the Hatch Shell, the stage that
sits like a giant open clam next to the Charles River, Mugar
devised a pyrotechnical plan and provided the money to implement
it.
</P>
<P>
   Mugar persuaded Fiedler to offer the 1812 Overture, replete with
howitzer fire and the church bells Tchaikovsky had written into the
score. And, he said, ``I came up with the idea, just by luck, I
guess now, of having fireworks at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugar said he told Fiedler he was not sure the explosive ending
could be coordinated well, to which Fiedler replied, ``Oh, don't
worry about it, just let all hell break loose at the end of the
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The public loved it, to the point that just two years later, in
the bicentennial celebrations, an estimated 400,000 people gathered
for Boston's Fourth of July concert, gaining it entry into the
Guinness Book of World Records as the best-attended classical
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance _ which depends heavily on the weather _ has never
matched that record, though organizers have hopes for this year,
given last year's audience of 375,000. More sound towers and, for
the first time, giant television screens have been added.
</P>
<P>
   If the concerts have not been getting bigger, they have been
getting more technologically ambitious and complex. Ken Clark, a
Boston-based fireworks artist, has begun creating pyro-musicals
that use exactly timed bursts to mirror the music, painting the sky
in time with it. This year, his display, which is being kept secret
beforehand, is to last a half-hour, up from 25 minutes last year.
</P>
<P>
   And so fireworks that cost perhaps $10,000 in the early years
now cost around $200,000, said Mugar, who owns several malls,
hotels and other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   On a barge loaded with mortars in the middle of the Charles,
Clark said on Thursday that technology has so progressed that a
one-second fireworks effect that would once have taken two crews
half a day to wire up can now be done with a swipe and click of a
computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to marking the 25th anniversary of the 1812
fireworks, Saturday's concert is likely to mark the end of a
tradition. Mugar and his nonprofit organization, Boston's Fourth of
July, have been paying pretty much the entire bill for the party,
nearly $1 million this year. He has finally said that his pockets
are not bottomless.
</P>
<P>
   Probably next year, he said, he will seek the kind of discreet
sponsorship that another Boston tradition, the Boston Marathon,
has, with company logos here and there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The change goes a bit against the grain. Peter Fiedler, Arthur
Fiedler's son, who cues the cannons at the concert, recalled that
one year, an advertising blimp ``flew over the Esplanade during the
concert and David went berserk'' because he did not want the event
commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   But injections of money would allow the Boston Pops to bring in
ever greater stars as guest performers, he said, and allow ever
more advanced technological feats, possibly including a giant
television screen mounted on a barge in the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, asked about the direction in which he would like to take
the concerts, Mugar, their executive producer and an unabashed
aficionado of the logistics involved in such huge events, mentioned
a homey vision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has always seen the Pops concerts as gigantic
versions of the town picnics, oompah band concerts and little
fireworks displays in smaller locales. So, maybe someday, he said,
``I think it'd great if we could give everybody free hot dogs and
Cokes and ice cream. Something real American.''

LONDON'S HISTORIC OLD VIC WINS REPRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `e' code)  
 (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LONDON _ The Old Vic, one of the world's most famous stages, has
been spared its final curtain by the 11th-hour creation of a
charitable trust to preserve it as a theater.
</P>
<P>
   Put up for sale in December, the Old Vic faced a July 1
deadline, and London's theater world had been horrified by rumors
that the highest bidders were contemplating turning the
180-year-old hall that gave birth to the National Theater and the
Royal Opera and Ballet into a shopping mall, a bingo parlor or a
nightclub for lap-dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue turned on a successful fund-raising campaign prompted
by a plea from British Culture Secretary Chris Smith and the
willingness of David and Ed Mirvish, the Canadian brothers who have
owned the Old Vic for the last 16 years, to accept much less than
the asking price of $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trust is buying the theater for $5.8 million, $2.5 million
of which it has raised since February and turned over to the
Mirvish brothers on Thursday. It has 21 months to raise the
remaining $3.3 million through a public appeal to complete the
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   An annex that had been part of the original offer was sold for
$1.8 million this spring to the National Theater for use as
workshop and rehearsal space.
</P>
<P>
   Smith made his own appeal in a speech at the Olivier Awards
dinner in February when the Mirvishes were honored for their
stewardship of the theater and the investments they made in its
restoration and upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't rush into a disposal of the Old Vic,'' Smith said
then. ``Give all the rest of us a chance to come forward with good
high-quality proposals for its future as a theater, with a vital
role to play in London's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the new Old Vic Theater Trust is Alex Bernstein,
the former chairman of the Granada entertainment group, and the two
principal members are Stephen Daldry, director of the Royal Court
theater, and Sally Greene, the London theater manager and owner.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce the commercial risk of putting on
high-quality drama, the trust will charge no rent to the companies
whose shows it puts on its stage and will share box office profits
with those companies. The trust will be able to maintain the
building and cover its running costs by renting out its oversize
rehearsal rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Daldry said he looked forward to bringing to the Old Vic shows
from places like the Donmar Warehouse, the Almeida and the Royal
Court that are eager to extend the commercial life of their
successful productions. ``The new charitable status of the Old Vic
will place it in a position to stage the best work in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first production to benefit will be a revival of ``Amadeus''
starring David Suchet and Michael Sheen that is to open in October.
The production is being presented by Sir Peter Hall, the former
director of the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company,
and there is sweetness in that selection. The Old Vic's last
resident occupant was Sir Peter's repertory company, which rotated
13 shows _ a mixture of classics and new works _ for a year, giving
10 performances a week with such stars as Felicity Kendal, Michael
Pennington, Geraldine McEwan and Alan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The company moved out in December with an emotional curtain-call
farewell after a final performance of ``King Lear.'' With the
entire cast and backstage crew standing behind him, Sir Peter
tearfully told the audience that he thought no one would be found
to keep the Old Vic alive as a theater and feared the historic
space would become an amusement park attraction offering ``a
theater experience along the lines of the `London Dungeon.''' He
added, ``I hope to heaven that this is not true, but we are a daft
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-seat theater, on a rundown block near Waterloo
Station, opened in 1818 as the Royal Coburg. It was intended for
people who lacked the income or the disposition to go to plays
across the Thames in the traditional West End theater district.
</P>
<P>
   It became known as the Old Vic in 1833 when it was renamed the
Royal Victoria. The nickname stuck when its formal name changed in
1879 to the Royal Victoria Coffee Music Hall and its programming
took on the uplifting mission of providing ``purified entertainment
with no intoxicating drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Its heyday began in 1919 when Lilian Baylis became its manager
and made the Old Vic a place for serious drama and Shakespeare. A
penny-pinching tyrant who famously fried sausages in her box, she
would go on stage herself and plead, ``God, please send me good
actors, but send me cheap ones.'' She began the companies that
became the Royal Opera and Ballet at The Old Vic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the actors and actresses captured in its footlights were
Laurence Olivier, Alec Guinness, Ellen Terry, Tyrone Guthrie, Sybil
Thorndike, Ralph Richardson, Michael Redgrave, Peggy Ashcroft,
Richard Burton and Vivien Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Gielgud, 94, said this week that he appeared at the Old
Vic as an extra while in drama school and had his first stage
success there as Richard II in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The National Theater made the Old Vic its home for 13 years
until moving in 1976 to its present location in the riverside South
Bank complex.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Mirvishes, the theater staged 80 plays, with
particular successes during the artistic directorship of Jonathan
Miller from 1987 to 1990 and the recent revival of the classical
repertory under Sir Peter Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``All theatergoers love the Old Vic for its place in the history
of British theater,'' Bernstein said after signing the deal
Thursday. ``Our task is to ensure its future becomes as important
as its past.''

FIREFIGHTER PILOTS `TRYING TO STOP A HURRICANE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITUSVILLE, Fla. _ From the cockpit of his World War II-vintage
airplane, Andrew Brucker has seen more of Florida's smoky nightmare
than anyone else _ a familiarity has bred a reluctant respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mother Nature is just having her way,'' said Brucker, who
has been dropping 2,000 gallons of red-stained fire retardant on
the ruinous wildfires several times a day since May 27. ``It's just
like trying to stop a hurricane. We can't do it. It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Brucker is a soldier in an army of firefighters who are using
water and chemicals, bulldozers and shovels, sweat and prayer to
combat walls of flame and towers of smoke that have turned parts of
the Sunshine State into a blackened moonscape under perpetually
ashen skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen fire behavior so severe that the fire's created its
own thunderstorms and lightning,'' said Brucker. ``That's the first
time I've ever seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado native and an 18-year veteran of aerial firefighting,
Brucker was the first of what is now a team of pilots here,
arriving more than four weeks ago and working 14-hours shifts
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   His red-and-white Douglas DC-4 aircraft, built in 1944 and used
during the Berlin Airlift, is pumped full of ammonium
polyphosphate, a commonly used agricultural fertilizer, that is
mixed with water stored in 5,000-gallon plastic water tanks on the
tarmac of the airport here.
</P>
<P>
   These chemical bombing runs of Brucker and his colleagues,
directed by US Forestry Service and Bureau of Land Management
officials, are designed to preserve the perimeter of fires that are
moving with terrifying speed in unpredictable directions.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by a smaller plane, Brucker flies at 150 miles per hour
and is just 150 feet above the ground when he pulls a lever to
release a surrealistic stream of red relief before returning to the
airport to repeat the routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing now is trying to keep individual houses from
burning down,'' the pilot said before his first run Friday. ``And
we can be somewhat successful. We can herd the fire around
particular sites sometimes. But as far as stopping these fires, the
only thing that's going to do that is rain. You just can't stop a
hurricane. When these fires are putting off the same energy as
low-yield nuclear bombs _ over a minute instead of a second _ that
power is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The work done by Brucker and his colleagues has been so
appreciated here _ where it was 100 degree Friday and so smoky some
pedestrians wore protective masks _ that their last runs on
Thursday night were hailed by 300 residents who stood on the end of
the runway and waved and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dangerous gesture because any aircraft aborting a
landing may have plowed into them. But Brucker said it put a human
face on a fire that is impersonal from treetop level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes on a human dimension when people's houses are burning
down,'' the gray-haired pilot said. ``We tend to depersonalize
things today. In the lexicon of disaster reports, it's not
somebody's house that's burning down, it's a `structure' that's
threatened. I kind of resent that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brucker, who has fought fires in Alaska's magnificent wilderness
and in the Snake River Canyon in Idaho, said that Florida's
wildfire of the century is providing a lesson on what happens when
man seeks to harness nature's sometimes untamable domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view my job more and more as not putting out forest fires
per se but protecting people's homes who have bumped up against the
forest,'' Brucker said. ``We call it the urban interface. We've put
out every fire ever started almost without fail, and we're seeing
the consequences of that policy. Forests don't get to go through
their natural burning-down process that they need to go through. I
can imagine how devastating I'd be if my house burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you, there aren't enough airplanes in the world
to put these fires out.''

CHURCH FINDS 150-YEAR-OLD TIME CAPSULE, PONDERS OWN FUTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were to put together a package for your
descendants, with information that would describe your life and
times for people a century from now, what would you put in it?
</P>
<P>
   That question has lately engaged the Plymouth Church of the
Pilgrims, an independent, congregational church that is a Brooklyn
Heights landmark, whose pulpit was originally occupied by the great
anti-slavery crusader, the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as Plymouth Church was celebrating its
sesquicentennial, workers discovered a lead box placed inside a
wall by the church's mid-19th century founders. Broken open, the
box revealed rather impersonal contents, mainly newspapers and
pamphlets from May 1849, when the present building was going up.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the idea of creating a new time capsule, one that
would give a broad range of information about the current church
and its members, has given the congregation an unusual opportunity
to think about its identity and its hopes for the future, said
Frank Decker, president of the church's council.
</P>
<P>
   This has come at a time when the congregation's leaders have
been wrestling, in study sessions and discussions, with the larger
question of what role a Protestant church can and should play, for
its members and for the larger society.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the church's offices, at 75 Hicks St., Decker
and the Rev. Sharon Blackburn, the church's senior minister, talked
about the challenges facing a church like Plymouth, in a culture
that is at once more secular and more religiously diverse than ever
before. The once-dominant position of Protestant churches has been
eroded, and the membership of many individual congregations,
including Plymouth, has gradually shrunk,
</P>
<P>
   In the church's current annual report, a copy of which will be
placed in the new time capsule, Ms. Blackburn wrote that the church
is ``experiencing and now living through our most major spiritual
challenge in some large number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said in the interview, ``We're beginning to look ahead,
we're beginning to see what we might be able to offer.'' Later, she
cited the results of a demographic study of local neighborhoods,
showing a high concentration of people 25 to 40 years old. ``This
is the group that wants a very strong Christian education program
for their children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One might optimistically argue that Plymouth Church has faced
major spiritual challenges before, certainly if one looks back to
its early days as an institution dedicated, from a Christian
standpoint, to the destruction of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The church's founders were largely New Englanders who had
settled in Brooklyn (as were the people who started the nearby
Church of the Pilgrims, with which Plymouth merged in 1934). In
hiring Beecher, they gained a preacher whose convictions and pulpit
skills gave him national stature. The church became a major stop on
the Underground Railroad. When Abraham Lincoln visited New York in
February 1860 to give what became a famous address at Cooper Union
in Manhattan, he crossed the East River to hear Beecher. (A small
plaque marks the pew where he sat.)
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of its past are also appreciated at the church.
Ms. Blackburn took out a copy of the church's bylaws, which
describe Plymouth's purpose as combining Christian nurture and
community with a certain social action. The church, the bylaws
state, is dedicated to bringing together Christ's followers in
worship and to pledging its members ``will work and pray for the
transformation of this world into the Kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This church,'' Ms. Blackburn said, ``has always had a strong
biblical faith, and yet that faith has been able to speak to
contemporary issues in such a way that it would rally people.''
These days, she said, that would place the church in the
theological middle, far from fundamentalism, but not on the left,
either.
</P>
<P>
   In their study of what Plymouth Church should be about, its
congregational leaders came up with six purposes, Decker said,
among them an emphasis on worship and education within the church
and on love of one's neighbors, within and outside the church
walls. ``You can't just live on the laurels of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackburn said that sentiment was widely felt as the church
marked its 150th anniversary last year. ``While it was a wonderful
focal point, we decided the past wasn't enough,'' she said. ``We
needed to make our history.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one item from the celebrations will go in the time
capsule, a compact disc recording of a concert in the sanctuary in
May 1997, to be included with the hope that the technology to play
it will still exist a century from now.
</P>
<P>
   Another item to go in will be a sermon outlining a vision for
the church's future, written by Ms. Blackburn, in which she
described a hope that the church would emphasize its essential
Christian beliefs as the basis for all it did. She said she
addressed the sermon ``to our grandchildren's children,'' and she
closed it with a blessing, signed in the name of the current
congregation.

THE TEACHER PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Cohen teaches American history to eighth graders. The
typical 13-year-old's barometer for injustice being what it is, her
students are especially receptive to the lessons of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the time between September and June, her classes used to
cover the period between colonization and westward expansion. Her
students simulated the Constitutional Convention in their classroom
and recreated Civil War battles in schoolyard games of capture the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But last fall, after new statewide curriculum standards mandated
that she make it through Reconstruction, Nancy Cohen found herself
teaching more of a survey course. ``It's as though they put us on a
treadmill and turned up the speed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since school in Newton, Mass. ended, she has
been listening with morbid fascination to the public pounding she
and her teaching colleagues are taking from parents and politicians
alike. News that only 41 percent of would-be teachers passed a
basic skills test triggered much of the outcry but Nancy Cohen,
ever the history teacher, thinks there is more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long has it been since these people have been in a
classroom?'' asks the 18-year teaching veteran. ``Do they have any
idea the number of balls we are being asked to juggle?''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the pressure to cover more material in less time.
There is also the matter of the MCAS, those standarized tests
introduced last spring for fourth, eighth and tenth graders. Nancy
Cohen spent the year teaching American history only to have her
students tested on the ancient civilizations they had studied in
grade six. ``Now I know that if I want my students to test well I
have to build in at least one week every year to review what they
learned in the previous two years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The erosion of teaching time is only one problem. The very
nature of the classroom has changed in fundamental ways since Board
of Education Chairman John Silber and Acting-Gov. Paul Cellucci
were toting bookbags.
</P>
<P>
   Were Silber and Cellucci to drop by Nancy Cohen's class in
September, her 24 students would hardly notice the presence of
additional adults. There could be three or four aides with her in
the classroom: an aide for the noncommunicative, wheelchair-bound
cerebral palsy student; an aide for the boy in the BRIDGE program
for students with behavioral problems; an interpreter for the deaf
students.
</P>
<P>
   This does not include the special education teachers with whom
Nancy Cohen will confer regularly about several students in her
class who will have IEPs (Individual Education Plans) or GEAPS
(General Education Accomodation Plans.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The day when you could give one homework assignment and grade
them all the same way is over. A student with one kind of learning
disability may have an education plan that requires me not to grade
his spelling; another plan might require that a child be given more
time to complete an assignment; an exceptionally bright student
might need extra work to supplement the textbook. I have a
classroom full of individuals. The state tells me I can't judge
them all by the same standard, but then turns around and gives them
all the same standardized test. Does this make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. But the debate about education reform, like the
one about welfare reform before it, is less about good sense than
simplistic solutions. No one, least of all teachers like Nancy
Cohen, opposes building accountability into the profession. ``I was
as horrified as anyone by how many candidates flunked the
competency test,'' she says. But how will Silber and Cellucci
measure a teacher's ability to engage students, to excite them
about learning? How will they attract the brightest students to a
career held in such low esteem that a fair number of parents assume
they could do a better job than their child's teacher? And how
accountable will they hold themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I, for one, got my masters degree in education from Boston
University when John Silber was president of the university. It was
a Mickey Mouse proram, at best. Whose responsibility is it to make
schools of education more challenging and more accountable? Didn't
John Silber hand out some of the degrees he is so quick to
disparage?''

INDIA'S A-TESTS PROMPT CIA TO REVIEW ITS WARNING SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a classified report on how to prevent future
intelligence miscalculations, the CIA has zeroed in on early
warning systems, starting with an obscure post in charge of
contrarian thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the national intelligence officer for warning,
Robert Vickers, found himself at the center of the debate over
whether India would test a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to argue against conventional wisdom. But after
supervising a debate among the experts from the CIA and other
agencies, Vickers accepted their consensus that India's new
government, led by a Hindu nationalist party, would not conduct
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   His decision not to challenge the experts is now seen in the
intelligence world as a key incident in a long chain of missteps by
officials throughout the U.S. government that contributed to one of
the worst intelligence failures in recent years. In May, India
announced that it had detonated five nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   The classified report, by retired Adm. David Jeremiah, a former
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says the intelligence
services need to find new ways to issue warnings by making sure
that contrarian views are heard.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, John Gannon, the chairman of the
interagency National Intelligence Council, is planning to expand
the use of panels of outside experts, known inside the CIA as red
teams, to challenge the assumptions of the CIA's analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But the teams could cause problems of their own: earlier use of
outside experts created poisonous rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the Ford administration used an outside panel
of conservative experts, known as Team B, to discredit CIA analysts
viewed by Republicans as being too soft on the Soviet Union. Soon
Team B got the reputation of being just as predictable as the
conventional wisdom it was supposed to counterbalance.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials say that they will be careful not to allow
the new teams to be tinged by such partisanship and that they will
only be used on a selected basis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But such outside advice is unlikely to be considered a
replacement for the full-time, in-house warning officer post, which
was created in 1979 as a position on the National Intelligence
Council in the wake of congressional demands for intelligence
reforms. The officer is responsible for making sure that the United
States does not get caught by surprise by a war or other major
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the warning officer is supposed to focus on
potential flash points that are sources of controversy among the
experts or need to be of greater concern to policy makers. By
definition, that means the job calls for unconventional thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they created the job, they were trying to
institutionalize the role of devil's advocate,'' said former CIA
Director Robert Gates, who conducted a still-classified study of
the warning process while he was at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the danger is that the warning officer can be easily
dismissed as the agency's Cassandra, always warning of worst-case
scenarios. ``You have to maintain your credibility,'' said one
official. ``You can't warn on everything, or else no one will take
you seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said: ``We worked this problem time and time again, and
it's very difficult to get the right approach. If you have a
warning officer who always takes a minority view, then he gets the
reputation for crying wolf. And the worst part of the problem is
that even when the warning officer is doing his job right, he is
usually going to be wrong, because the consensus view is usually
right.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Vickers, who has served as the warning
officer since 1996, has tried to strike that balance. Early this
year, for instance, he issued a major intelligence report that
raised new concerns about the security of nuclear weapons in the
former Soviet republics, one of the most controversial and
sensitive issues now faced by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   But on India, Vickers did not see that when he set off a debate
among the experts inside the intelligence community, they were
responding with answers that were too clever by half.
</P>
<P>
   All of the analysts Vickers polled in February discounted the
public statements of the leaders of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, who had vowed during their election campaign to turn
India into a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the consensus among the experts was that the
party would be forced to moderate its nuclear stand as soon as it
was in power, to hold its governing coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   Without any secret intelligence to contradict them, Vickers
accepted the experts' views. He published their analysis in a
classified newsletter produced by his office and distributed it
throughout the intelligence agencies in February.
</P>
<P>
   In May, India tested five nuclear weapons, and Pakistan followed
suit, sparking a global crisis _ and once again proving to the CIA
how badly it needs a few good curmudgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``India, the largest democracy in the world, tested a nuclear
weapon, and the United States, the major democracy in the world,
didn't know about it,'' said one senior U.S. official. ``That is
not a trivial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Vickers had plenty of company in misjudging India's
intentions, and officials say no one is trying to turn him into the
scapegoat for the mistakes of many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system failed,'' said one senior official. ``No one
warned.''

ROCK CDS: GO, GO BOY POWER _ SMELLS LIKE TEAM SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The base runners filling Yankee Stadium aren't the
only boys exuding grace and sweat this summer, and the World Cup
isn't the only game that has crowds chanting in the stands. Rock
'n' roll, the athletic activity favored by outsiders who never
wanted to be jocks, is often at its finest when played as a team
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, three bands that exemplify this spirit _ Rocket From
the Crypt, Girls Against Boys and Rancid _ are touring in support
of new bids for the jukebox crown. Those who like to watch women
win must wait until late summer, when Liz Phair, Hole, Polly Jean
Harvey and Lauryn Hill stage their own musical Olympics. For now,
though, it's the guys' turn to flex some muscle and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Girls Against Boys
</P>
<P>
   New York has not been home to many championship rock bands of
late, but this quartet of transplants from Washington give all the
signs of being contenders. ``Freakonica'' (DGC), the band's major
label debut, finds G.V.S.B. (the group's hip nickname) in
competitive shape, but its faults make one wonder if this club will
be like last season's Knicks, rich in skills but lacking focus.
</P>
<P>
   The band certainly owns a blueprint for success. After starting
life as a hardcore punk band, a past evident in Alexis Fleisig's
pugnacious drumming, G.V.S.B. stretched to accommodate the dub
reggae fascinations of the bassist Johnny Temple and the disco
fantasies of Eli Janney on keyboards, samplers and second bass.
Scott McCloud, the guitarist and front man, penetrated this whirl
of influences with his lascivious growl. The result was music about
the pleasures of electrified rhythm, stepping lightly from the rock
club to the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Freakonica,'' the elements still churn together, but the
blend gets a little too smooth. The insistent bass line of ``Park
Avenue'' sets the right mood, while the delightfully mean-spirited
``Psycho-Future'' and the frenetic ``Pleasurized'' achieve
satisfying intensity. Often, though, the musicians' thrilling
connections are compromised by Nick Launay's production, which
slicks up McCloud's voice and overprocesses rough spots that the
band could work through on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Freakonica'' is an indication that G.V.S.B. will grow
only stronger with time. Live, they're already there, as they'll
prove at the Bowery Ballroom on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket From the Crypt
</P>
<P>
   This San Diego-based sextet trades in a different kind of
masculine bravado from G.V.S.B.'s sexy prowl. Led by the suave yet
goofy singer John ``Speedo'' Reis, ``RFTC'' (Interscope) delves
into rock's rowdy history to turn punk clubs into sock hops.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo and his gang love garage rock, but on ``RFTC'' they turn
toward slightly older forms of boisterousness. Speedo models his
shtick after the jump-jazz king Louis Jordan, singing about love
and doglike desire in a deep moan that prompts hearty choruses from
his band. The call-and-response of ``Lipstick'' and ``Let's Get
Busy'' conjure scenes of beefy guys whistling after women in the
street; Holly Golightly, guest vocalist on the album's first track,
``Eye on You,'' proves that the ladies can talk back.
</P>
<P>
   The camaraderie felt in the vocals is reinforced by the music,
an exuberant mix of aggressive rock, swing horns and ska rhythms.
Comical horns and speedy drumming keep the band's mood meter on
high. Rocket doesn't hesitate to celebrate the obvious, as in
``Break It Up,'' which borrows from the sports arena anthem by Gary
Glitter, ``Rock and Roll Part 2.''
</P>
<P>
   But saying no to subtlety is part of this band's charm. Fans
claim its live show is rampantly entertaining; catch it at
Summerstage on Saturday, when Rocket opens for Question Mark and
the Mysterians.
</P>
<P>
   Rancid
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a team isn't just a team: it's a family. This
well-loved California punk band (headed here with the Warped Tour
in August) believes in that communal ideal. Upholding the socially
conscious, musically uncompromising agenda set down by 1970s bands
like the Clash, Rancid makes invigorating rock meant to inspire
listeners to be as radical in daily life as they are in the dance
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Won't Wait''(Epitaph), the follow-up to 1995's ``... And
Out Come the Wolves,'' makes this goal more explicit than ever.
Songs address the war in the Balkans, decry inhumane labor
conditions and even invoke those old favorites of the left, the
Sandinistas. Musical reports from the spots where bohemia meets the
down and out, from the Lower East Side to Echo Park, bear the stamp
of personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   This would all add up to boring agitprop if not for Rancid's
fractured humanity. The vocalists, Tim Armstrong and Lars
Fredriksen, blurt and growl as if they're in the midst of losing a
fistfight, but righteous anger and hope turn their garbled
utterances into testaments. Behind them, the band rages and rolls,
its punky reggae style (old enough to be a form of classic rock)
sounding as fresh as if it had just discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   Rancid exists to celebrate the bonds music makes, and it
welcomes many extended family members here, including the reggae
artist Buju Banton, members of the ska band the Specials and Roger
Mirel, of the hardcore group Agnostic Front. For Rancid, team
spirit promises more than just personal achievement. The band's
exaltation of rock as symbolic politics _ able to change a few
lives, if not the world _ elevates the stakes of its game.

 &HT;    Coke bottles feature NASCAR drivers
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Coca-Cola Co. is hoping NASCAR fans and Coca-Cola
memorabilia collectors will race out to snap up a series of nine
Coke-Cola classic bottles featuring some of the sport's most
popular drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-ounce bottles feature Dale Earnhardt, Dale Jarrett, Bobby
Labonte, Bill Elliott, Jeff Burton, Kyle Petty, Todd Bodine and
Ricky Rudd _ all members of ``the Coca-Cola Racing Family.'' A
ninth bottle commemorates Coca-Cola's designation as the official
soft drink of NASCAR. Six-packs of the limited-edition bottles are
now being rolled out, and full national distribution is expected by
the end of the NASCAR season this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this will be one of the most popular limited-edition
bottles series we've ever issued,'' said Andrew Angle, senior vice
president of Coca-Cola USA and general manager of Coca-Cola USA
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company and its bottlers issue between 130 and 150 different
commemorative bottles each year, featuring everything from the
Olympics and the Super Bowl to classic portraits of Santa Claus.
The NASCAR bottles could end up creating a trading frenzy among
fans, because not all of the bottles will be sold in every market,
a Coca-Cola spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's five-year agreement with NASCAR began Jan. 1, when
the company snagged the sponsorship away from rival Pepsico Inc.,
which held it for more than 40 years. Coca-Cola is spending an
estimated $30 million on the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, meanwhile, on Thursday renewed its agreement to be the
exclusive soft drink supplier to Daytona International Speedway.
Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Pepsi gained exclusive pouring rights at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway and four Penske Motorsports Inc.
tracks. The company is the title sponsor of four races, including
the Pepsi 400, which was postponed from this weekend until October
because of serious wildfires near Daytona International Speedway.

 &HT;    Small businesses in the South saw slowest growth rate
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Southern small businesses_ considered the leader
among small businesses _ had the slowest growth rate in the nation
during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the tight labor market, according to a national
quarterly survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages the South had always had was that labor
was pretty cheap,'' said Roger Harris, president of Padgett
Business Services, an Athens-based accounting tax firm that
specializes in small businesses and conducts the quarterly surveys.
``Now, it's catching up. To find good people, it costs more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the nation rode a wave of growth between
January and March (10.4 percent increase in operating income),
small business owners in the South reported an 8.6 percent drop in
operating income.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not losing money, their rate of growth is not as
strong as it has been,'' Harris said. He cautioned against making a
snap judgment about the performance until second quarter results
are released in early August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could turn around the next quarter. I don't want to be too
alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey polled 3,865 small businesses, most in the retail and
service industries. The companies employ fewer than 20 workers.
Padgett began the survey, which looks at business patterns by
region, in 1992. Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   Total sales were up in all four regions. With the exception of
the South, operating income was up as well.
</P>
<P>
   Wages continued to increase in all four regions, with the West
recording the largest increase at 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite positive national results in the first quarter, small
business owners predict slow stagnant second quarter sales and slow
job growth for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very disturbing,'' said Dan Sautner, Padgett chairman.
``Given the second quarter always has been the strongest for small
businesses, these predictions, if accurate, could turn 1998 into an
exceptionally challenging year.''

BRAZIL ESCAPES WITH 3-2 WIN OVER DENMARK  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Brazil escaped with a riveting 3-2 win over
Denmark Friday night in a World Cup quarterfinal match that was as
much about redemption as victory.
</P>
<P>
   For Brazil, the thrill of victory is routinely compromised by
the agony of criticism from fans and reporters. Only beautiful
domination is acceptable. Anything less might as well be defeat.
Even its 1994 World Cup title was dismissed by many as an
unfortunate return to the soccer of defense and individualism.
</P>
<P>
   No two players had been reprimanded more in this World Cup than
the forward Bebeto and the midfielder Rivaldo. Both were being
blamed for the subdued scoring of Ronaldo, considered the world's
greatest player, who has now delivered only three goals in five
matches. Bebeto was supposedly too old and slow at age 34. Rivaldo
was thought to be greedy, holding the ball too long as Ronaldo's
accurate feet waited impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, it was Rivaldo and Bebeto who delivered all of
Brazil's goals and who drew cheers instead of boos. Bebeto scored
once and Rivaldo twice as Brazil attacked from all angles, but
Denmark was fearless and it very nearly took the game away
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil now advances to the semifinals against either Argentina
or the Netherlands, but it has yet to fulfill its vast potential as
it seeks an unprecedented fifth World Cup title. Brazil made two
stark defensive mistakes Friday night and grew lucky near the end
when the Denmark defender Marc Rieper fired wide and hit the
crossbar from inside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denmark dignified this game,'' said Marion Zagallo, the
Brazilian coach. ``We won, but Denmark also could have won. It was
a victory of power and will.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunga, Brazil's crusty old captain, suffocated the Denmark
attack repeatedly in midfield and contributed directly to two
goals. So did Ronaldo in the role of playmaker and decoy. He had
been the subject of a national convulsion this week after Brazil's
team doctor reported that he was as much as 4 1/2-pounds
overweight. The doctor later changed directions as deftly as
Ronaldo in the open field, saying the star striker was at his ideal
weight.
</P>
<P>
   And the tendinitis in Ronaldo's left knee that caused him to
miss a practice did not cause him to miss a minute of Friday
night's quarterfinal or disrupt his underappreciated ability to
pass the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Denmark was direct and daring, and it caught Brazil
off-guard in the second minute by hurrying a free kick just outside
the penalty area. Brian Laudrup dribbled around the Brazilian wall
and laid a pass off to Martin Jorgensen, who finished the clever
set piece to put Denmark ahead 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not afraid,'' said Bo Johansson, the Denmark coach.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Denmark lacked the speed of Brazil's Cafu and Roberto Carlos
on the flanks and the constrictive defense of Dunga and Cesar
Sampaio in midfield. Brazil equalized in the 11th minute when
Bebeto slipped behind the Danish defenders, took an exquisite pass
from Ronaldo and delivered a low blast from 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand,'' Bebeto had complained before the
game. ``The others make bad passes, but the fault is always mine.''
</P>
<P>
   He had argued with Dunga during the Morocco game in the first
round and had accused Ronaldo of hogging the ball during the 1996
Summer Olympics. But he was not a sympathetic figure to Brazil's
fans, who preferred the injured Romario or the substitutes Denilson
and Edmundo.
</P>
<P>
   Bebeto was booed unfailingly when he was replaced in the second
half of Brazil's first four games. But Friday night, he pounded his
chest after scoring, as if to show that he still had the heart of a
champion. And he left to a chorus of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Rivaldo, too, thawed frozen opinions. In the 27th minute, Dunga
stole a pass, Ronaldo fed Rivaldo like a point guard on the left
wing and Rivaldo deftly finished the counterattack. But the 2-1
lead was tenuous. Five minutes into the second half, Roberto Carlos
failed to clear a header, whiffing on a needless scissors kick, and
Michael Laudrup pounced on the loose ball for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 60th minute, Rivaldo drilled the winning shot from 22
yards, appearing to surprise the Danish goalie Peter Schmeichel.
The Great Dane, as he is known, is considered the world's best
goalkeeper, but Schmeichel dropped to the ground too quickly Friday
night and was curiously vulnerable. Still, Denmark kept attacking
and missed twice at the end by an excruciatingly small margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard match, honest, open,'' Zagallo said, ``the
way football should be played in the World Cup.''

COMMENTARY: FROM HERE TO ZAPRUDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever else you are doing in contemplation of America's birth
this July Fourth, you will have to make do just a little bit longer
without the Zapruder film.
</P>
<P>
   It's not until August that all 26 seconds of this frame-by-frame
record of the Kennedy assassination will at last be available to
all Americans for nightly perusal in their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder is going digital, with bells and whistles that Oliver
Stone might envy: restored color in the grand manner of the new
``Gone With the Wind,'' plus 45 minutes of added material
guaranteed to inspire new grassy knoll speculations for the whole
family.
</P>
<P>
   The price is $19.98 for a VHS cassette, a bargain should by any
chance the added material include commentary by the onetime JFK
supporter and full-time gun enthusiast Charlton Heston. The company
bringing you this fine package, MPI Home Video, also distributes
``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' ``The Honeymooners,'' ``Dark
Shadows,'' ``Richard Pryor Live &AMP; Smokin','' ``The Frugal
Gourmet,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and ``Liberace'' _ an all-American
menu that takes one-stop shopping to a new dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Zapruder the Video will soon lead to Zapruder the Rock
Video, Zapruder the Musical, or Zapruder the Fox series destined to
succeed ``Drudge.'' Such is the American way. If so, we shouldn't
get too outraged about it. One of the many things worth loving
about this country _ and forgiving, when necessary _ is its youth.
America is in some ways still like that incorrigible kid you can
find horsing around on the periphery of whatever cookout or
fireworks display you happen to be at tonight. America is clumsy
and impatient and uninhibited. After it falls down and scrapes its
knees, it never tires of picking at its scabs and examining the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Zapruder'' _ or is it ``Zapruder!''? _ is at your
local video store, it will be competing with some other newly
repackaged cinema classics: the 100 best American movies selected
by ``1,500 prominent Americans'' in a now-notorious poll conducted
by the American Film Institute. It's not precisely clear who these
1,500 voters were. Bill Clinton and Al Gore _ though mentioned in
much of the press coverage _ did not in fact vote, according to the
White House. (This explains why ``Lolita'' is the only major
Stanley Kubrick movie missing from the Top 100 _ not to mention the
absence of ``Love Story.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the voters were, they've been deservedly reviled for
dumping Buster Keaton, Preston Sturges and Fred Astaire in favor of
``Dances With Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cineastes knocking the list miss one important point
about it. As a snapshot of mass American taste, the AFI Top 100
does offer a revealing and representative take on our country's
psyche. The movies listed as the best are certainly among the most
popular, and they are often movies that hit us where we hurt. They
are Zapruder films in the poetic, if not literal, sense.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some islands of pure pleasure (``Singin' in the
Rain'') and flag-waving (``Yankee Doodle Dandy'') in the Top 100,
but almost half the movies are violent. The most popular subjects
include crime (``Double Indemnity,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``The
Godfather,'' among many others), the Vietnam War (``Platoon,''
``Apocalypse Now,'' ``The Deer Hunter''), attempted assassination
(``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Taxi Driver''), urban dysfunction
(``Midnight Cowboy,'' ``Pulp Fiction''), marital infidelity (``The
Apartment,'' ``The Graduate'') and race (from ``The Birth of a
Nation'' to ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner''). The list's number 1
movie, ``Citizen Kane,'' exuberantly describes the birth of the
modern tabloid media machinery that distorts both the facts and our
understanding of all these issues.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges over all is the cinematic self-portrait of a
country more intrigued by its divisions and failures than its
successes. We are more likely to rent ``Raging Bull'' and
``Chinatown,'' both Top 100 films, than ``Young Mr. Lincoln'' or
``The Longest Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dream life of movies, we don't mind addressing what's
bloody and nasty and unresolved in the American experiment; it's in
real life that we too often lose perspective and think our deepest
wounds can be healed overnight, as if we had no memory that many of
them stretch back to the nation's infancy.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans have from the start been bigger on dreams than on
history. That was and still is the spirit of 1776.

   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ They were called dinosaurs and fossils. Their coach, Berti
Vogts, was called the zoo keeper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Germans seem to have proved yet again that when you play
an ageless style of soccer _ tight on the defensive line, strong in
the air, opportunistic around the goal _ individual ages hardly
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are never going to play like the Brazilians, so there is no
point in trying,'' Vogts said. ``We must put faith in our
traditional values and our system. Then, we can beat anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans have.
</P>
<P>
   The success of this veteran German side in the World Cup should
come as no surprise to anyone. Yet for some it did, not because of
what World Cup history said but because of what these players'
birth certificates said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, or West Germany, is the only nation that has managed to
qualify for at least the World Cup quarterfinals in 12 consecutive
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1934, when Germany last did not make the quarterfinals,
the Germans have been known to play the same, familiar game _ using
tall, fast players, perfectly executing the attack and refusing to
give any opponent the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is how we win,'' Vogts said. ``You don't want to change
how you win.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that seems to have changed for Germany is its
age.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team whose starting goalkeeper is 36, is held down at
midfield by a 37-year-old and whose top goal-scorers are 35 and 31.
</P>
<P>
   In an elimination game against Mexico, in which Germany came
back from a late 1-0 deficit to win on goals by Juergen Klinsmann,
35, and Oliver Bierhoff, 31, the average age of Germany's starters
was nearly 33.
</P>
<P>
   Only five players on the roster are under 30. Only three of
those 20-somethings see regular playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of experience on this team, and you cannot
underestimate experience in the World Cup,'' Klinsmann said. ``We
know how to fight to the last minute. We don't want to go home
early, and we know what it is to play these kinds of important
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, numerous players on this 1998 German side were on the
team that raised the Cup at Italia '90.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsmann and midfield general Lothar Matthaus, 37, started on
that 1990 team. Keeper Andreas Kopke, 36, was on that team, too.
And Vogts was an assistant coach to ``Kaiser'' Franz Beckenbauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an experienced team, you're able to overcome
some of the internal problems that every team has,'' said Vogts,
alluding to the longtime feud between Klinsmann and Matthaus that
some blamed for Germany's 1994 quarterfinal exit. ``This team is
much different than 1994's. The mentality of this team is totally
different, when in 1994 the players were only thinking of playing
time and playing against Italy in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the Bulgarians would be a pushover, and we were beaten
by them. This team is much better together than that one. We won't
look ahead of the job we have in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Today in Lyon, this German team faces another squad that many
consider a pushover, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   But experience tells these dinosaurs different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember the feeling of winning the Cup in 1990, and we
want that feeling again,'' Klinsmann said. ``We also remember the
feeling of losing to Bulgaria four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we will never get to the championship if we don't win
this game. Croatia has very strong players who play for great
(European) clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have to come from behind again like we had to
do against Mexico. We have to raise our game from the start and
beat them. We have to play our kind of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worked for decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chen Shi-Zheng, you might have thought, had already
paid dues enough for a lifetime. Now he has paid again.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is the director of the magnificent production of the
Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' by the Shanghai Kunqu Opera
Company that was to have opened the Lincoln Center Festival next
Tuesday evening and formed its flagship. But after two years of
painstaking preparation and eight months of intensive rehearsal,
the project ran aground at the last minute on the stony will of Ma
Bomin, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the longest two weeks of my life,'' the
35-year-old Chen said Friday morning at his apartment near
Washington Square Park, looking drained but typically resilient. He
had returned a mere eight hours before from eight months in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   His original plan for Friday had been to meet the arriving
members of the company at the airport and, with the younger ones,
begin a weekend of shopping and sightseeing. ``I had promised to
take them to the Empire State Building, the South Street Seaport,
the fireworks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a chaotic two weeks in which the sets and costumes for
the production were detained for a time at the Shanghai
International Airport and the players were sent back into rehearsal
for the benefit of the bureau's censors, the company was not
allowed to leave China. So instead, Chen was spending the day
fielding phone calls from around the world relaying conflicting
rumors: that some late miracle might still be possible; that the
company had just been packed off on a two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   After a preview in Shanghai, the production, running some 20
hours over six evenings, was damned for ``pornography,''
``superstition'' and ``feudalism.'' No matter that the
``pornography,'' chiefly the description of a subsidiary character,
Sister Stone, and the physical condition that enforced her
virginity, came right out of the 1598 text of the work by Tang
Xianzu, deemed one of the great masterpieces of Chinese literature.
Indeed, Chen had already compressed the offending discussion
considerably to keep talk of private parts out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The other two charges related chiefly to a funeral procession
for Du Liniang, the young heroine who pines away for lack of love,
in which dolls were burned in line with ancient Chinese folk custom
and much surviving practice. ``Feudal,'' it seems, is an
all-purpose condemnation applied to any part of pre-communist China
to which the pronouncing body happens to take exception. ``It's a
very heavy-handed word,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was also cited for transgressions of the style of Kunqu,
the most venerable and refined of the 360-odd types of Chinese
opera. What he actually violated, in his efforts to return to the
spirit of a 17th-century performance (if in fact the work had ever
been performed complete), was tradition as it now stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They criticized me for not using a proscenium stage and
brightly colored lights,'' Chen said. ``But there were no
proscenium theaters and brightly colored lights in the 17th
century. I made it clear from the very outset that I wanted to take
`The Peony Pavilion' as the subject and Kunqu as the vocabulary,
the expression. But they wanted to reverse that.''
</P>
<P>
   The production is to travel to Paris, for the Festival d'Automne
in November, then to Sydney, Australia, and Hong Kong. Lincoln
Center plans to forward the sets and costumes to Paris, said Nigel
Redden, the festival director, but it is far from clear whether the
company will be allowed to travel then or what the production might
be like, with or without Chen's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The entire incident carries deeply unsettling resonance in
Shanghai, Chen said. It was there, in 1966, that Jiang Qing, Mao's
wife, with her criticism of a theatrical production, set off the
momentous Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Momentous, certainly, for Chen, who was born in Changsha, in the
southern province of Hunan, in 1963. When he was 4, his mother, a
schoolteacher, was killed in front of their home by a stray bullet
fired during a rowdy, jingoistic parade. The bullet narrowly missed
the boy's head, he said, and the bloody scene constitutes his first
memory.
</P>
<P>
   His elder sister was there, too. She, like their father, a
public-health official, was sent to the country for
``re-education.'' The boy, spared because of his tender age, was
left to live with various relatives. He has never again seen his
father who, though still alive, was left brutalized and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people died,'' Chen said. ``The southwestern provinces
were the most violent area. Everybody was taking the opportunity to
kill his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, in fact, developed his love of Chinese opera attending any
number of funerals. Opera performances were banned, but mourning
was permitted. In southern China, death was celebrated in Taoist
fashion, for three days and three nights. Among other activities,
opera masters performed songs around the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened a whole new world to me,'' Chen said. ``It taught me
traditional music, and it introduced me to the idea of
impersonating someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Hunan School of the Arts reopened at the end of the
revolution in 1976, Chen enrolled in the opera program, and was
among the first graduates. He thus learned Huaga opera, indigenous
to Hunan. He then went to Beijing and worked in Peking opera.
</P>
<P>
   One of the criticisms recently leveled against Chen is that he
was not a specialist in the rarefied style of Kunqu when he took up
``The Peony Pavilion.'' But he is experienced in several styles,
and he surrounded himself with Kunqu experts and immersed himself
in study with an enthusiasm, not to say ferocity, that can well be
imagined by anyone who saw him at work in Shanghai. In effect, he
produced as well as directed the production and turned a $500,000
budget into an incomparably beautiful silk purse.

</P>
<P>
   Already in Beijing, Chen was restless with the conventions of
Chinese opera and avid to find more expressive modes. He studied
Western opera, made commercials and sang pop music. He also met
Heather Steliga, an American poet, and married her in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Their move to New York in that year began as a visit to Ms.
Steliga's parents in Boston. On learning of the massacre in
Tiananmen Square, they decided not to return to China.
</P>
<P>
   Chen earned a master's degree in performance studies from New
York University, where he now teaches. He has returned periodically
to work in China, as he did two years ago, directing a production
of Euripides' ``Bacchae'' with the China National Beijing Opera
Company. Though typically controversial, it met with acclaim in
Beijing and Hong Kong and is still touring around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what opportunities may arise in China now or how
he will feel about them. For the moment he is grateful to have got
out of the country without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he told reporters: ``Make me a scapegoat. Call me a
pornographer. I can take that. Just don't call me
anti-revolutionary.'' For that last offense, which used to be
capital, he might still have been in China despite his American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, he can at least celebrate Independence Day in style.
``Suddenly I feel I can breathe again,'' he said.

BILLY BRAGG: SONGS MADE FOR YOU AND ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Billy Bragg doesn't want Woody Guthrie to be
remembered as a humorless, two-dimensional agitprop songwriter. He
wants to avoid that same fate himself; Bragg, too, writes songs
with direct political messages as well as songs on more personal
topics.
</P>
<P>
   After being invited by Guthrie's heirs to dig through an archive
of 2,500 Guthrie lyrics whose melodies were never recorded, and to
write new tunes for them, Bragg has become more of a Guthrie fan
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Mermaid Avenue'' (Elektra), is a collaboration
with the country-rock band Wilco, which backs him up and plays its
own Guthrie finds.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bottom Line on Thursday night, amid a droll line of
between-song patter, Bragg praised Guthrie as a both a punk
forebear and a lyricist who ``mixes the personal with the
political.'' He chose Guthrie lyrics that can be whimsical and
rude, affectionate and pensive, connecting them back to Elizabethan
ballads and forward to Guthrie's rock heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg began his set alone with his electric guitar, then was
joined by Ian McLagan on keyboards. From his own material, he chose
songs about love's complications and about the death of his father.
His voice, which was once an untamed cockney bray, has grown more
controlled and gentle; he comes across as a regular guy trying to
muddle through.
</P>
<P>
   Then his band joined him, and the music started to romp. ``She
Came Along to Me,'' about women and equality, chugged like an Elvis
Costello song; ``Walt Whitman's Niece,'' about womanizing and
poetry, was oompahing country-rock. ``I Guess I Planted,'' a
reflection on unions and solidarity, rolled along like a shuffle by
the Band. ``My Flying Saucer,'' one of an additional 25 Guthrie
settings that don't appear on the album, used an
Appalachian-sounding melody above double-time garage-rock. For
``California Stars,'' Bragg's band changed Wilco's wistful ballad
into a New Orleans mambo, as Bragg sang ``This Land Is Your Land''
in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie's own talking blues and children's songs contradict any
notion that he was a dull propagandist. But Bragg and Wilco have
rediscovered a Guthrie who speaks to them: a lover, a joker and a
questioner as well as a protest singer. Bragg, who was already on a
similar path, now has one more model.

POLLUTION PROBLEMS FESTER SOUTH OF THE BORDER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Every day Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican city
across the Rio Grande from El Paso, produces 75 million gallons of
raw sewage, much of which flows through irrigation ditches into the
river, the prime source of water for nearly every community in both
Mexico and the United States between here and the Gulf of Mexico.
Juarez has no sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana, Mexico, near San Diego, a sewage treatment system is
in the planning stage, but for now the city continues to discharge
sewage into the Pacific, periodically requiring American health
officials to close beaches in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to provide
the border area with billions of dollars to address air and water
pollution _ and, in fact, both Juarez and Tijuana recently had
financing for sewage treatment systems approved by the bank set up
under what were known as NAFTA's side accords.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly five years after NAFTA was ratified, not a single
environmental project financed by the bank is in operation. To the
more than 10 million people living along the border between the
United States and Mexico, the money promised for the region's
serious environmental problems is too long and too little in the
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened so far does not at all meet the great promises
that were made,'' said Beatriz Vera, a program officer with the
Paso del Norte Health Foundation, which works to improve health
conditions in El Paso, Juarez and southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that environmental conditions along the border
are making people sick. On the Texas side, rates of hepatitis,
diarrheal diseases and gastroenteritis _ all commonly linked to
water and sanitation problems _ are two to six times the state
average. And conditions are worse on the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say pollution problems along the border are
especially daunting because the solution often lies on the other
side, in Mexico. That is true for water pollution in the Rio
Grande, stretches of which remain a dumping ground for human and
industrial wastes, and for air pollution like the gray haze that
periodically engulfs the remote Big Bend National Park in Texas,
giving it the smoggiest air of any national park in the West.
</P>
<P>
   American officials trace much of the haze to a mammoth complex
of coal-fired electricity plants in northern Mexico, about 125
miles upwind of Big Bend, but they have been unable to negotiate an
agreement with Mexico to build scrubbers that would cut the plants'
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico remains strapped for money, and many elected officials on
the American side are urging that the United States give it much
more assistance to develop solutions that could help people on both
sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look upon the border as an economic and political dividing
label,'' said State Rep. Andrew Nichols, a Democrat from Tucson,
Ariz., who also is director of the rural health office of the
University of Arizona College of Medicine. ``But disease knows no
border. If we worked more collaboratively with the Mexican
government, if we took that broader perspective, we'd be helping
our own people. It's not just generosity, it's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But spending American money on projects like sewage treatment
plants in another country is a sticky diplomatic and political
issue. ``It's very hard to convince Congress we need money to deal
with problems that seem to be in Mexico,'' said Doug Farquhar, an
expert on environmental health issues for the National Conference
of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, NAFTA provided for a binational agency, the
Border Environment Cooperation Commission in Juarez, to certify
cleanup projects, and a $450 million commitment from both nations
for a bank to finance the work. President Clinton and other
proponents of the free-trade pact said the bank, the North American
Development Bank, could use its lending authority to leverage up to
$8 billion for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the devaluation of the peso in 1994 forced many Mexican
communities to curtail plans for landfills and sewage treatment
plants, even with low-interest loans available. In other cases,
Mexican officials have disagreed over what technological steps are
needed to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has certified 21 environmental projects costing
$473 million, including the sewage treatment plants in Tijuana and
Juarez. But the bank has provided only a fraction of the money so
far, and no project is operating yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that NAFTA's environmental side accords
were flawed from the start because they did not provided a specific
way for Mexican or American cities to identify tax revenue from new
commercial activity generated by the pact's removal of trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still no system in place by which the growth,
especially on the Mexican side, can begin to pay for itself,'' said
Mary Kelly, director of the Texas Center for Policy Studies, an
environmental research group that has conducted extensive studies
of the border's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the problems originate south of the border. Mexican
officials express outrage over Texas' plans for a low-level
radioactive waste dump in Sierra Blanca, a town 80 miles east of
here near the border, and anger over that issue has hampered
negotiations on air pollution in Big Bend and on other cross-border
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the border's environmental problem is simply the
population growth on both sides. It is most striking in Mexico;
Juarez, for example, which had 250,000 people in 1960, now has five
times that number. The overall border population has more than
doubled, to more than 10 million, and is expected to double again
in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they express frustration over the belated progress, some
experts here see signs of hope in the fact that the development
bank is approving loans, such as the $31.2 million for the first
two waste water treatment plants in Juarez's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow, but this is much more than a technical problem,''
said Jim VanDerslice, a professor of environmental sciences at the
University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health at El Paso.
``It's politics, it's people, it's organizations. When you're
working binationally, it's just difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of cleanup plans say they are working as
fast as they can. ``A lot of people would say it's slower than
expected,'' said Angeles Villarreal, a spokeswoman for the
cooperation commission. ``But once you are working on these
problems, you realize that it takes a while. These are complicated
issues.''

BRASH, WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN MAKING WAVES AS RUSSIA'S HEAD TAX
COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Wearing black ski masks, a phalanx of gun-toting
Russian tax police officers swept into a dingy warehouse this week
and confiscated thousands of shiny bottles of vodka complete with
phony alcohol tax markings.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cheating owner managed to escape, but Boris Fyodorov
said he was not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to use our powers to the fullest,'' Russia's new
tax chief said. ``They clearly weren't being used before.''
</P>
<P>
   Brash, wealthy and supremely self-confident, Fyodorov has is the
head of the State Tax Service, the most difficult task in Russia.
In a country where tax avoidance is a national pastime, tax
collectors have come and gone with little to show for their efforts
but a ballooning government budget deficit. Yet if anyone can
change the system it just might be Fyodorov, the economic reformer
turned wealthy investment banker who is a veteran of Russia's
rough-and-tumble politics. He is a rare official who delights in
stepping on a few toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in the government twice, and by the time I leave a
lot of people feel pain,'' he boasted in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month in office, Fyodorov has been trying to dole out
more pain. He took on Gazprom, Russia's most powerful company and
one of the nation's biggest tax delinquents. He ordered his agents
to draw up a list of Russia's 1,000 wealthiest citizens, put
himself on the list, and decreed that every one of them would be
audited. And in an effort to scare tax deadbeats, he has begun a
series of highly publicized raids, like the one on the vodka
warehouse. In one instance, his inspectors went door-to-door in one
of Moscow's fanciest apartment buildings looking for people who
were secretly subletting their apartments and not reporting the
extra income.
</P>
<P>
   He has put his stamp on the Yeltsin government's plans to
overhaul the tax laws. Fyodorov wants lower corporate tax rates to
stimulate economic growth and encourage companies to pay their
taxes. He has also pushed for a flat tax on personal income.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia trying to contain a budget deficit and struggling to
prop up its currency, collecting taxes has never been more
critical. Any sign that Russia is serious about collecting revenue
would likely calm the stock and bond markets and, most important,
impress the International Monetary Fund, which is negotiating the
terms of a new multi-billion dollar loan for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Russians to pay their taxes, however, is not just a
matter of armed raids, publishing lists and ordering audits.
Success for Fyodorov will require nothing less than an act of
religious conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 million Russians filed tax returns in 1997, a tiny
fraction for a nation with 147 million people. There are plenty of
skeptics who think the Fyodorov will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can carry out kinds of checks and investigations and
change the head of the tax service 35 times,'' Grigory Tomchin, the
head of a trade association of privatized enterprises, told the
Russian press. ``The situation will not change. It won't be
possible to do anything until the debts of enterprises are
restructured.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov is a 40-year-old lone wolf who recently told associates
that if he were an American citizen he would be a conservative
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent free marketeer, he was picked in 1993 to be finance
minister by President Boris Yeltsin and earned a reputation for
taking off the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Russian government, no one respects you if you are
weak,'' he once told a Russian interviewer. ``You need to punch
them in the muzzle, and then they understand everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov, threw plenty of punches. He clashed with Viktor
Gerashchenko, the chairman of the central bank whose loose money
policies helped lead Russia into debilitating round of soaring
inflation. Fyodorov resigned in 1994 and later wrote a dictionary
of economic terms in which he referred to Gerashchenko as the worst
banker in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed then-Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as a
do-nothing politician. He even staged debates between himself and a
card-board cutout of the stolid Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's feistiness has been strengthened by his financial
independence. He is wealthy and accomplished enough in the world of
business that he could walk away from the job tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of the Soviet Union, he did a stint at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and at the World
Bank. His income was tax-free, under Russian law, and Fyodorov
bought Russian treasury bills at sky-high interest rates, according
to a business partner, Charles Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov and Ryan later founded the United Financial Group, one
of Russia's leading investment banks. That has given him an
appreciation of how Russia's byzantine tax system hampers business
and earned him the respect of Russia's financial oligarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other top Kremlin aides, Fyodorov has refused to
publicize his assets or income but he insists that he pays his
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia was hit this year by a financial crisis that has
sent stock and currency markets into a swoon, Fyodorov sent a
strongly worded letter to Yeltsin criticizing the government's
inaction. Yeltsin tapped him to take over the State Tax Service and
be the government's junkyard dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me the job nobody really wants,'' he said
cheerfully.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why. Russian disdain for authority and an
archaic and burdensome tax code had turned the country into a
nation of tax deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades, there was no culture of paying taxes,'' observed
Mikhail Berger, an economic specialist and editor of the newspaper
Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet times, the communist government deducted a small
sum from people's paychecks. But people barely noticed it and
hardly any one ever had to fill out tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a new Russia brought new problems.
Well-connected, profitable companies thumb their noses at the
government, while hard-pressed companies stay alive from barter
insisting they lack the means to pay what they owe. Millions of
ordinary Russians have embraced the underground economy, convinced
their taxes line the pockets of a powerful elite.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's predecessor, Alexander Pochinok, did little to
instill a sense of discipline in his agency or among a contemptuous
public. As tax collection faltered in May, Pochinok was with his
family on a expensive cruise to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   He returned just in time to be fired, leaving behind an army of
185,000 of demoralized and poorly paid inspectors and bureaucrats.
A tax inspector outside of Moscow typically earns less than $100 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov has sought to expand his authority and demonstrate that
no one is beyond the reach of tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the government has blocked access to export pipelines
for four oil companies that have not paid their taxes. It has
threatened to freeze the accounts of United Energy Systems, the
electrical monopoly run by reformer Anatoly Chubais, to force it to
begin paying up.
</P>
<P>
   But Gazprom, the nation's biggest and most politically potent
company, has emerged as the critical public test. The company,
whose gleaming, 34-story tower, complete with tennis courts and
gardens is a Moscow landmark, paid only one third of its taxes last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going after the big culprits to show that we can get
tough with them,'' Fyodorov said. ``Gazprom will feel it for sure.
Obviously, they have been playing games. When they want to buy a
bank or launch an investment program they have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fyodorov issued orders for the tax police to confiscate
dachas, private planes and vacation homes, Gazprom said it would
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with furious protests by Gazprom and their allies in
the Communist-dominated parliament, the Yeltsin government gave
some ground on Friday and decided to give the company until Aug. 1
to pay up or face confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a committee is being established to assess the
Gazprom's claim that the money the government owes it and its tax
debt should cancel out. Fyodorov has made clear that he believes it
is Gazprom that owes the state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he should succeed where so many others have failed,
Fyodorov had a characteristically blunt response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everyone who was in the job before me, and they could
not have done it,'' he said. ``I would like to prove that it is
possible to achieve something in Russia. That would be something to
talk to my grandchildren about.''

MUTING ANGUISH OVER '88 AIR DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE HORMUZ II, in the Persian Gulf _ Friday was a day to
demonize America.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Friday, just before the end of Iran's long war
with Iraq, a U.S. naval cruiser shot down an Iran Air civilian
airliner as it flew over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan expressed ``deep regret'' for what he
called a ``terrible human tragedy'' and the United States
eventually compensated the families of the victims as well as the
Iranian government for the loss of its plane.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Iranians, the shootdown still represents one of the
most heinous entries on the list of U.S. ``crimes'' against their
country in the last 50 years _ one that became even more monstrous
in their eyes when two years later the U.S. Navy decorated two of
the vessel's commanders instead of punishing them immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian authorities invited relatives of the victims and members
of the news media to mark the anniversary, flying them to the port
of Bandar Abbas in a chartered Iran Air Boeing 707 and ferrying
them to the point 25 miles into the Persian Gulf where the plane
hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an act of state terrorism,'' Mahdi Chamran, the
deputy cultural events director for Iran's armed forces, said in a
speech as the slow-moving German-made ferry steamed to its
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an accident,'' he said. ``If it had been an
accident they would have treated the commanders differently. They
wouldn't have given medals to people who had caused such an
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamran said no amount of money would ever compensate the
victims' families for their loss. He called on the Clinton
administration to apologize. ``If the United States wants to break
down the wall of mistrust, it is important that the families
receive an official apology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day was marked by both spectacle and sadness. At the airport
at Bandar Abbas, visitors saw a display of color photographs of the
bodies of some of the 57 children who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Children were dressed in green-and-white-striped T-shirts
specially printed for the occasion showing the number of men, women
and children killed by an exploding plane atop a blackened Statue
of Liberty. The father of a 5-year-old boy dressed his son in
camouflage fatigues and draped a banner across his chest that read
in English, ``Down With U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ferry reached its destination near the tiny island of
Hengham near the Strait of Hormuz, small pleasure speedboats that
the Iranians had transformed into military vessels circled the
ferry.
</P>
<P>
   As a white-uniformed navy band played in the sauna-like summer
heat, weeping women and other passengers threw armfuls of red,
white and coral gladiolas over the side of the boat. Two U.S.-made
Sikorsky helicopters flew overhead, dropping flowers into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for my father,'' said Farideh Ameri, a
13-year-old girl swathed in black, whose father, an Iran Air
official, was among those killed. ``Whenever I look at the sea I am
reminded that my father isn't coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she could ever forgive the United States for the
shootdown, she said: ``Never. Nothing replaces my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Rezaian, whose son was one of the plane's pilots, said he
had nothing to tell the American people. ``What can I say?'' he
asked. ``My son is gone. What do you want me to say?''
</P>
<P>
   But then, perhaps in an effort not to offend an American
visitor, he noted that his other son was living in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The shootdown alternately angers and mystifies the Iranians. How
could the USS Vincennes, with all its sophisticated gadgetry,
mistake a regularly-scheduled passenger plane heading across the
Persian Gulf from Bandar Abbas to Dubai for a military plane poised
to attack?
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon investigation concluded that the mistakes were not
technological but human, caused by ``the fog of war and those human
elements which affect each individual differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Central Command, which is responsible for Persian
Gulf operations, recommended that Lt. Cmdr. Scott Lustig, the
Vincennes' anti-air warfare officer, receive a mild reprimand, the
recommendation was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 Lustig was granted two Navy commendation medals for his
service on the Vincennes. The ship's commander, Will C. Rogers III,
was given the Legion of Merit for ``exceptionally meritorious
conduct'' during the period of his command.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the United States paid families of the victims
$300,000 for each wage earner and $150,000 for each non-wage earner
who had died. The Iranian government was paid $40 million for the
loss of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians were clearly torn Friday between their
determination to shine the spotlight on the tragedy and their
desire to follow the lead of President Mohammad Khatami and soften
their tone toward the United States. Khatami has made clear that he
has no use for the burning of the U.S. flag or the slogan ``Death
to America!'' and in the last few months there have been no
flag-burnings and markedly less anti-American sloganeering.
</P>
<P>
   But after a speech filled with fury, Gorbani Husseini, an
official with the Foundation to Preserve the Values of Sacred
Defense, which was the host at Friday's event, beckoned the
passengers to chant with him, ``Mag bar Amrika!'' _ ``Death to
America!'' They did, but only three times. And when he led them in
chanting the slogan in English, he watered it down to ``Down With
America.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a reporter why Iranians were still chanting
``Death to America!'' when Khatami had said he did not like it,
Ahmed Reza Kazemi, the general manager of the state-owned Iran Air,
said, ``What President Khatami has said is the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chamran, the armed forces cultural aide, begged to differ.
``There is no law preventing slogans against America,'' he said.
``President Khatami hasn't issued an edict banning them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, countered Kazemi, ``this year, culturally the activities
were very contained compared to last year. The reaction of the
people toward the United States was very mild.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, toward the end of the ceremony, a group of young women
who discovered that an American journalist was on board asked for
autographs.

SOME PROGRESS REPORTED IN TALKS TO END GM STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from the United Auto Workers union
and General Motors Corp. have begun a push to resolve strikes in
Flint that have crippled the giant automaker's operations across
North America, but the two sides have yet to settle GM's demands
for improved productivity here.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, the often-combative chairman of the bargaining
committee for the local UAW unit that began the strikes on June 5,
said in an interview here that the tone of the talks had definitely
improved and that negotiations would continue over the holiday
weekend. After weeks of criticizing GM publicly, and even canceling
talks temporarily over a perceived slight to striking workers by a
GM negotiator, Jewell refrained from attacking the company Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ternes, a GM spokesman, said that Friday's talks were
``slow but somewhat constructive,'' and represented an improvement.
``It has been much less than that in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials from GM and the union's national leadership have
also begun quiet negotiations this week, separate from the talks at
the factory here. The UAW has begun treating the current strikes as
local disputes, after initially seeking to turn them into a
showdown over GM's long-term strategy of reducing employment in the
United States through attrition to help cut costs and become more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell said no issues had actually been settled yet at the
factory here. ``We didn't resolve anything, but we had some good
discussions,'' he said in an interview late Friday morning at the
factory gate, as union negotiators left the talks for a lunch
break.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a dozen factory-level strikes against GM over the
last five years, a ritual has developed in which all issues remain
open until the final hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   These strikes typically begin, as this one did, with workers and
local union officials publicly vilifying the world's largest
automaker, while GM executives accuse union members of failing to
work hard enough. Serious negotiations begin when both sides cease
their public criticisms and instead make a series of proposals,
sometimes over the course of a week or more. Once each side has
laid out the relative importance of each of its many grievances,
round-the-clock talks start and a final bargain is usually struck
in a couple of days in which a few items are chosen from each
side's list of proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American
car operations, said in an interview before the latest round of
negotiations that the current strikes could be settled in as little
as four hours once both sides devoted themselves to the task.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, both sides would like to reach an agreement by next
Thursday or Friday, which would allow time for union members to
ratify a pact next weekend and allow production to resume here on
July 13, at the end of GM's regularly scheduled two-week summer
vacation. GM has shuttered 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North
America, and it could take two or three weeks to reopen them after
production of auto parts resumes here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 9,200 workers on strike at two parts
factories in Flint, GM has temporarily laid off 162,700 workers
across North America and outside parts suppliers have also laid off
thousands of workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jewell's remarks Friday were the first instance of a senior
union official hinting at progress toward a settlement. UAW leaders
excoriated GM during a union convention in Las Vegas a week ago.
Stephen Yokich, the UAW's president, even suggested there that GM
was run by an unseen ``madman.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators here have not yet reached the stage of talking
through the night. Bargainers recessed at 5:15 p.m. Friday and
planned to resume at 9 a.m. Saturday, Ternes said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators still face many tough issues here. There are
actually three sets of negotiations going on: one at each of the
two factories, and another round between national GM and UAW
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing dispute involves the walkout that began June 5
at Jewell's factory, which stamps and welds sheets of steel to make
hoods, fenders and engine mountings for most GM vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants GM to complete a promised $300 million
investment program at the factory and wants a variety of health and
safety changes, like the elimination of a machine lubricant that is
irritating the skin of some workers. GM wants the union to make
numerous changes in work rules, including the elimination of
production standards that allow workers to go home early and still
collect a full day's pay if they have made a certain number of auto
parts.
</P>
<P>
   To increase the pressure on GM, the union's national leadership
also allowed nearly 6,000 workers to go on strike June 11 at a
speedometer and spark-plug factory near the stamping factory. GM
has cut the work force there in half over the last decade while
buying more parts from outside suppliers, including some in Mexico,
and the union wants GM to slow the rate at which it is eliminating
jobs at that factory through attrition. But GM in particular has
given less importance to that strike, viewing it as a sideshow to
be resolved after the main dispute at the stamping factory.

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PARIS _ This time, it wasn't the Baggio, as in Roberto, the once
and fallen star, who broke Italian hearts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Di Biagio. As in Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   With the world's World Series at his feet and an ominously
familiar scene buzzing around him, Italian midfielder Luigi Di
Biagio fell victim to a moment that is sure to live in World Cup
infamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed, and I'm sorry,'' Di Biagio said. ``I am so sorry,
very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an Italian calamity, for sure, on the way to a 4-3
penalty-shootout loss to France at Stade de France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a single, frozen scene that seemed impossible to believe
but all too familiar for the Italians.
</P>
<P>
   It was a miss, reminiscent of Bill Buckner's infamous World
Series gaffe of 1986. But instead of letting the ball and this
monumental World Cup game roll through his legs, Di Biagio couldn't
get the ball by French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez with the final
penalty-shot attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought it was going in,'' Italian coach Cesare
Maldini said. ``I can't blame him for what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Di Biagio sent the ball high, hitting the crossbar and sending
Paris into a flag-waving, horn-blowing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   It also sent Italy home from the World Cup with a penalty-shot
loss for the third consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pity, considering how hard we played,'' Maldini said.
``For this to happen to us three times, it's very sad. It's a
curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Roberto Baggio's misfire in the World Cup final
against Brazil left Italy short of reaching the game's ultimate
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before that, it was another penalty-shot loss to
Argentina that sent Italy home after getting to the World Cup
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played very well, but we didn't get the result we
wanted,'' Maldini said. ``This team gave its all, down to the last
drop of sweat. Including Di Biagio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did his job. It's always easy to criticize afterward. But
we don't fault him at all, absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Di Biagio was practically inconsolable after missing the
critical shot, dropping straight back to the ground as the ball
bounced away, as if it was he who hit the crossbar, not the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As Di Biagio lay motionless on the ground, 80,000 fans and the
French team began celebrating reaching the semifinals and a date
with the winner of today's Germany-Croatia match.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian team surrounded Di Biagio, literally having to help
him off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel very disappointed,'' Italy forward Christian Vieri
said. ``No one feels more disappointed than (Di Biagio). It was
just something that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Italians, the loss seemed all the more painful and
unlikely, because until Di Biagio's miss, Italy was playing its
grimace-and-bear-it game to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly wary of France's electric scoring combination of
Zinedine Zidane and Youri Djorkaeff, Italy sent five men back to
protect goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca and placed three just behind
the midfield line.
</P>
<P>
   It was like an Azzurri wall.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a beautiful, high-flying strategy by any stretch of
the imagination, but it proved to strangle the zip out of Zidane
and Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make any mistakes,'' Maldini said. ``We had to
counterattack. We were never really in danger. We were faultless in
our defense. I had my strategy, and I stuck to my guns.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians hammered at the ball every time Zidane and
Djorkaeff touched it, eventually accounting for 24 fouls in the
process. Italy counterattacked only when there were clear
opportunities, and there were few.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 45 minutes, France earned some decent shots at
the goal, but beginning in the second half Italy clearly was
wearing on France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played an overtime game against Paraguay (in the round of
16), and maybe it caught up to us,'' Zidane said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of regulation, Italy was beginning to create more
opportunities on the counterattack, particularly after Baggio
entered the game in the 67th minute. In overtime, Italy had a
chance to win when Baggio squeezed through France's defense and
barely missed a crossing chip shot to the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play against a team like Italy, you can't afford
to let up,'' France coach Aime Jacquet said. ``For about
three-fourths of the game, we stayed focused and had full mastery
of the game. But as it went on, the Italians came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected them to come out and play that kind of match. We
tried to come up with some ways of countering their strategy, but
it was difficult. Things started getting more difficult for us, and
it was 50-50 who would win. It was up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   It was up to the shootout penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first eight of the 10 penalty-kick shooters, each
goalkeeper made one save _ Italy's Pagliuca against France's
Bixente Lizarazu and France's Barthez on Demetrio Albertini.
</P>
<P>
   France's Laurent Blanc, the hero of the Paraguay win, then
stepped up as the final shooter for his team. He nailed it high and
strong past Pagliuca.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Di Biagio. He charged and kicked, but the ball
ricocheted off the iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're into penalty kicks, it's a matter of keeping your
nerves,'' Jacquet said. ``Our players were able to do that through
120 minutes of a difficult game and the pressure of the penalty
kicks. We've worked for years to make this our World Cup, and now
we're living it to the hilt.''
</P>
<P>
   And Di Biagio is living the familiar Italian nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a lottery when you get to penalty kicks,'' Maldini
said. ``Argentina in '90, then Brazil in the USA and now France. We
haven't won one of these. It's been bad luck.''

HICKS DOES RIGHT BY STARS; HELP FOR RANGERS SHOULD BE NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ General manager Bob Gainey beamed from behind a
bow tie, and Brett Hull wore the look of a happy and wealthy man
early yesterday afternoon at the Dr Pepper StarCenter, but the guy
who clearly felt like a billion bucks _ and not one penny less _
was Stars-Rangers owner Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks continued to back up his promise to build the Stars into a
Stanley Cup winner, and when he sent Hull _ the biggest free-agent
catch in the NHL ocean this year until he signed a three-year, $17
million deal with Dallas yesterday _ to The Ballpark in Arlington
to throw out the first pitch before last night's game with the
Mariners, he might have also been sending a message to Rangers fans
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bank on it: The next superstar this mover and shaker sends to
the Rangers' mound will stick around for more than one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And that day won't be too long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, the day and the champagne celebration
belong to the Stars. Next June, when they're chugging their ale out
of Lord Stanley's Cup, they'll look back on July 3, 1998, as the
day the last piece was put into place.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, after an abbreviated run in the playoffs, Hicks and
the Stars determined that the team had to upgrade its goaltending
to make it to the next level and promptly signed free agent Ed
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after reaching the Western Conference finals against
eventual champion Detroit with center Joe Nieuwendyk on the shelf,
it was obvious that the Stars needed a tweak or two offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we went out and got the best goal scorer we could get,''
Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to like his style, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   Word that the Stars were calling a news conference to announce
the signing of the 33-year-old Hull, son of NHL legend Bobby Hull,
sent a shock wave reverberating throughout the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey and the Stars, who had let it be known publicly that they
were interested in free-agent wingers Wendel Clark or Geoff
Courtnall, identified Hull as their No. 1 priority several weeks
ago, then successfully ran a smokescreen on both the media and
other NHL teams, most specifically the Chicago Blackhawks, who had
also targeted Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, the Blackhawks signed center Doug Gilmour yesterday
after learning that Hull was off the market. It's called romance on
the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hull himself was caught off guard when the Stars phoned
Wednesday, the first day free agents could begin negotiating with
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he was pleasantly surprised,'' Hicks said. ``We
weren't even on his radar screen. It didn't take him long to make
up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   About as long as it took for Hull to pack his bags and head for
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stars were just a perfect fit for me,'' Hull said. ``When
Dallas came into the picture, it brought a whole new light on
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has the potential to bring a whole new light to the Stars'
offense as well. Although he scored just 27 goals in 66 games last
season, when he was paired with strong offensive teammates Brendan
Shanahan and Adam Oates in the early '90s, Hull responded with
consecutive 72-, 86- and 70-goal seasons. Four times he has scored
more than 100 points in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, however, demands a defense-first
philosophy from his players. Can Hull adapt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever coach Hitchcock wants me to do, I will,'' Hull said,
``but I've spent a lot of years in this league scoring goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, for one, is already envisioning a line of Hull, Mike
Modano and Jere Lehtinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a formidable line,'' Hicks said. ``If I was
Detroit, I'd be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the surprise in the Hull signing is that in so many ways
he doesn't appear to be a Gainey-Hitchcock kind of player. Until
the last few years he was considered to be strictly an offensive
player, and there were reports that he could be disruptive in the
locker room. Gainey generally likes players built in his own image:
quiet and quieter.
</P>
<P>
   That's obviously not the outgoing Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who say that don't know what they're talking about,''
Hull said of the rumors. ``I spent 11 great years in St. Louis, and
I wouldn't have been there that long if I'd been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time we heard from Hull, in fact, was after the Red
Wings had eliminated the Blues in the second round of the playoffs,
and he predicted the Stars would have little chance of upsetting
the defending Stanley Cup champions in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that because I know how good \Rthe Wings\S are, and I
also know how to beat them,'' he said. ``Hopefully, now we can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   We, as in Stars.
</P>

   ``We could use another pitcher,'' Hicks conceded, ``but nobody
much is really available until after the All-Star break.''

   JUAREZ, Mexico _ This border city that is one of Mexico's main
drug corridors suffers extraordinary homicide rates, and one
candidate for governor of Chihuahua, Patricio Martinez Garcia, has
repeatedly lambasted the state and city governments for failing to
suppress crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder is out of control, so what should we do, throw rose
petals and say our opponents have run a great government?''
Martinez said in an interview. ``They offered better security and
haven't delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's posturing as an opposition candidate sometimes seems
jarring, since he is a federal congressman from the PRI, the party
that has controlled the presidency and nearly everything else in
Mexico for most of seven decades. But Chihuahua's is one of six
Mexican statehouses controlled by the National Action Party, or
PAN, making this state bordering Texas a place where the opposition
has become government, and the PRI is opposition.
</P>
<P>
   These and other topsy-turvy realities of Mexico's creeping,
15-year transition from one-party rule have charged the governor's
election here on Sunday with tremendous symbolism. PRI leaders, who
last year lost control of the Congress and Mexico City's municipal
government, are aching to demonstrate that they can recover terrain
lost to a rising opposition tide.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramon Galindo, the PAN candidate here, has been warning that
a PRI victory would damage Mexico's chances to elect a non-PRI
president for the first time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Chihuahuans understand what's at play,'' said Galindo,
who stepped down as mayor of Juarez to run for governor. ``This
isn't just any other election. The battle for Chihuahua is the
battle for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chihuahua has drawn the most national attention,
governors' races are also scheduled for Sunday in two other
northern states.
</P>
<P>
   In Zacatecas, Mexico's main leftist party, the Party of the
Democratic Revolution, or PRD, has nominated a former congressman
who bolted from the PRI after being passed over for the nomination.
He is running strong, fueling PRD hopes that a victory will prove
that the party's stunning triumph in last year's Mexico City
mayoral elections was not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   In Durango, a PRI candidate is running far ahead of three
rivals, including one from a tiny leftist party once funded by the
brother of former president Carlos Salinas to splinter the
opposition. That tactic appears to have worked; polls show that the
three opposition candidates combined may garner 52 percent of the
vote, but the PRI is likely to win with about 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In these places, as in all of Mexico's 32 states, governors are
elected for a single six-year term, and are not eligible for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's balloting opens a 12-month electoral season in which
half the states will choose new governors, allowing Mexico's three
main parties to measure forces for the presidential race, which has
already attracted several declared candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections will be an exercise in changing the balance of
power between the parties and in building new majorities,'' Mariano
Palacios, the PRI's national party president, said in an interview.
``So what happens in the states will be a major factor in what
happens in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 16 elections are scheduled before December. Rafael
Gimenez, a poll-taker for the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, said
that the PAN and PRD have fair chances in 5 of the 10 races. The
PRI will win the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The closely disputed states include Aguascalientes, where the
PAN's candidate enjoys a slim lead, and Oaxaca, where a popular PRD
senator is running a strong race, Gimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   In oil-rich Veracruz on the Gulf Coast, the most populous state
to vote this year, the PRI candidate is Miguel Aleman Velasco, the
son of a former president. He is leading rivals by an overwhelming
margin, Gimenez said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of these campaigns will center on local issues,
the PRI's fortunes will also partly depend on voter perceptions of
President Ernesto Zedillo's economic stewardship. Market analysts
say Mexico's recovery has become a boom, but many working people
complain they have not felt it. Zedillo's approval ratings, which
have been high, have been slipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the classic George Bush recovery,'' said Federico
Estevez, a political scientist. ``Zedillo claims things are great,
and people say, `What's he talking about?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many campaigns will also focus on public security, and here the
opposition is on the defensive. The PRD controls Mexico City, and
has so far been unable to suppress lawlessness there. The PAN is
even more vulnerable because it governs Tijuana, Guadalajara and
Juarez, the three cities in which narcotics violence has been
deadliest.
</P>
<P>
   Chihuahua's outgoing PAN governor, Francisco Barrio, won
election in 1992 partly because under PRI governance, traffickers
overran Chihuahua, thoroughly infiltrating the police. Barrio's
1992 campaign slogan was ``Insecurity equals bad government.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many PRI leaders acknowledge that Barrio has made
government more efficient and responsive _ except on narcotics,
which has provoked hundreds of drug executions, and other crimes.
Hundreds of Chihuahuans have disappeared after detention by
security forces working for traffickers during Barrio's tenure, and
nearly 150 Juarez women have been murdered, many of them raped.
Galindo, PAN's candidate for governor here, blamed the
PRI-controlled federal government, noting that enforcing drug laws
is a federal responsibility and that most tax revenues go to Mexico
City, leaving Chihuahua little to spend on law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the PRI has exploited Chihuahua's record of violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, PRI legislators who control the Chihuahua congress
called Barrio's attorney general to a public hearing to berate him
over his failures against crime. This week Martinez closed his
Juarez campaign with a rally outside a restaurant closed since
August, when narcotics gunmen executed six diners as they sat at
their tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody that's been in government can use the public security
issue to their advantage; it's a great handicap,'' Barrio said in
an interview earlier this year. ``We can take credit for many
advances, but not for improving public security.''

GERMAN EXTORTIONISTS HAVE SOFT SPOT FOR SHOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The extortionist wanted his demand taken
seriously, but apparently did not want to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So when he slipped jars of marmalade laced with rat poison into
supermarkets in Luebeck earlier this year, he attached labels that
read: ``CAUTION: POISON.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, prosecutors in Luebeck charged a 48-year-old
architect with trying to extort $600,000 from the marmalade maker,
Schwartauer Werke.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the oddest crime waves that Europe has seen in years,
Germany has become engulfed in extortion attempts by people who
threaten to poison products and scare away millions of dollars in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The police estimate that there have been 120 cases in the last
year, with two or three new ones every week. Nestle's German
subsidiaries are receiving about a dozen threats a year.
Supermarket chains, food producers and cosmetic companies have all
been targets. Many have fought off more than one attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to say that Germany is the world leader in this
type of crime,'' said Klaus Ruthe, a partner at Control Risks
International, an industrial security firm.
</P>
<P>
   German consumer-products companies are starting to use
tamper-resistant packaging but many products remain exposed. Nestle
and other companies have organized response teams for dealing with
threats as soon as they develop.
</P>
<P>
   This crime wave seems to be dominated by nervous amateurs rather
than hardened felons. About two-thirds of the extortion attempts
stop after the first threatening letter. Extortionists who have
tried to ratchet up the pressure by placing poisoned products in
supermarkets have sometimes warned companies where to look for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests and convictions are continuing, but few of the suspects
arrested in the past year have had the usual criminal backgrounds.
Police officials described several as bankrupt businessmen and one
as a law student.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who aren't comfortable with causing physical
harm,'' said Juergen Schmidt, the head of criminal investigations
in Gifhorn, a small city in Lower Saxony, who has dealt with three
cases in the last six months. ``With extortion, you don't have to
threaten the people personally. It's a form of criminality that
doesn't require a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Because a handful of poisonings could be enough to cause panic
and cost a company millions of dollars in lost sales, individuals
with few resources have the power to make a real threat. But most
of the schemes collapse when it comes to collecting actual money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can write a letter or make a phone call,'' said
Isabella Hoelper, a spokeswoman for Maggi GmbH, a subsidiary of
Nestle that makes packaged soups and other products. ``But the
police tell us that if it comes to a transfer of money, they can
catch them every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The police and industrial security consultants advise companies
to play along with extortionists, though always in collaboration
with the police, in order to elicit clues about their identities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beiersdorf AG, a cosmetics company in Hamburg that makes Nivea
skin-care products, used negotiation and stalling tactics against
extortionists who had threatened to contaminate Nivea products if
the company refused to pay about $500,000. Company officials
notified the police, but began to communicate with the
extortionists by posting messages through classified ads in a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations about payments dragged on, the blackmailers sent
13 letters and made more than 50 phone calls from Germany, Belgium
and the Netherlands. In mid-March, they mixed chemical solvents
into one of the company's hair-gel products and slipped samples
into a supermarket in Mainz. They warned the company where to look,
and nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the Hamburg police apparently traced a call to a
telephone booth in Venlo, Netherlands. There they arrested two men
and charged them with trying to blackmail Beiersdorf. The two men
have denied the charges and are now in jail awaiting trial.

 &HT;    NASCAR fans crank engines, exit Daytona
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- The past two days have not been good for
Patrick Holley as race fans in droves checked out of his Days Inn
and Tropical Seas motels. This was no forced evacuation, only an
economical one, the result of fires and smoke that have battered
this part of eastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, NASCAR fans, being the hardy lot they are, didn't
budge from their rooms and campers until they got the word that the
Pepsi 400 race scheduled for today had been postponed until
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The race-crowd exodus was hurting other businesses, too.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Allison, who sells hot dogs, soft drinks and french fries
from his beach wagon, complained emphatically, ``Ain't nobody
coming to the beach with all this smoke and stuff. This race just
killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Holley, gave it all a more positive spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to what the people of this area have endured these
last few weeks, a race cancellation is a minor inconvenience,''
Holley said. ``Economically, it will cost us tens of thousands of
dollars. Everybody came in Wednesday, paid up front, and left
Thursday with refunds. I can't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many rooms suddenly vacant, Holley turned 30 rooms over
to charity, offering them for use by the local Economic Opportunity
Council, then he sent food and drinking water to firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here, too,'' said Holley, whose home was spared by the
work of firefighters earlier in the week. ``The fans will be back
in October. They probably are the most loyal fans in all of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the July Fourth holiday and the novelty of the night
race, Daytona merchants had been bracing for the biggest weekend of
the summer. Now, they're bracing for losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't begin to tell you what the dollar amount will be,
but it will be significant,'' said Lynne Fagan, president of Ramada
Inn Speedway. ``In terms of the entire season, we probably will not
recover. But, the fans will come back. They always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The fans held their ground and hoped for the best until
the call came from NASCAR at 10 a.m. Thursday. Only then, with no
race to be run and smoke being an everyday headache, home sounded
like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Clark thought so, too. He wished Thursday the nightmare was
gone and he was awake back home in Key Largo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent about $2,000 on this weekend, went all out,'' Clark
said of his camp site in the speedway infield. ``I bought an air
conditioner, a generator and a golfing canopy to cover our eating
area. Now, we can't even use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the hardy fans they are, race fans will endure most any
setback _rain, snow and tornadoes. This is the first time, however,
they've been ``fired'' out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent 12 days last year waiting to see the Winston 500 at
Talladega,'' said Ken Roam of Birmingham, while filling out a
reservation form at the Daytona Beach Hilton for the October race.
``Some people spend money on golf. I spend mine on racing, about 15
times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Robinson has been coming here from Louisiana for 10 years to
attend the Pepsi 400. But he's relatively certain he can't make it
back for the Oct. 17 race. It's his wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has put up with a lot the 19 years we've been married,
but she told me today that if I wanted to be married 20 years, I
better have a better plan,'' Robinson said, laughing. ``I think
she's got a cruise in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dedicated fans award maybe should go to Randy Faulk and
three friends. They drove 22 hours straight from Green Bay, Wis.,
arriving at Daytona Beach at 10 p.m. Wednesday. About 12 hours
later, they were snapping pictures in a half-empty parking lot and
wondering ``where to now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty bummed out,'' said 23-year-old Faulk. ``We'll just have
to find something else to do.''

 &HT;    Drew gets $7 million deal with Cardinals
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The long and painful holdout for J.D. Drew has ended.
His well-documented career in the independent Northern League is in
the books.
</P>
<P>
   Drew finally signed with a major-league baseball team, receiving
a four-year, $7 million deal Friday from the St. Louis Cardinals.
The signing ended what has been a bitter battle among Drew, the
Philadelphia Phillies and major league baseball. It came with a $3
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who will join the Cardinals' Class AA team in Arkansas,
said his year-long holdout was about principle, not money, but his
stance has left him unpopular with fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it all again, I would,'' said Drew, who lives
in the South Georgia town of Hahira. ``I said all along it was
about being comfortable, and I'm comfortable with St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who played at Florida State, originally was selected by
the Phillies as the second overall choice in the June, 1997 draft.
But he demanded an $11 million signing bonus and was offered a
four-year package for a guaranteed $3 million that could grow to $6
million with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Drew declined the deal and began playing with the St. Paul
Saints in the Northern League. His effort to have his amateur
status revoked _ he wanted free-agent status _ was turned down by
an arbitrator, so Drew went back into the draft for 1998. He was
the fifth-overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are thrilled about the signing, but likely will be
criticized by other clubs for giving Drew such a large deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel J.D. is definitely one of the top players drafted in
the last 10, 15 years,'' Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty
said. ``There's no guarantee when he'll play up here. He's going to
have to work his way up here.''

<P>
   Raging Bulls and an Angry Steer
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors increased their stock mutual fund purchases in
June, a month when the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose to
record highs, and also put more money in bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $21.1 billion entered stock mutual funds in June,
up from $18.7 billion in May, according to Trim Tabs Financial
Services Inc. And according to the Investment Company Institute,
the industry's trade group, about $9.81 billion was invested in
taxable-bond, municipal-bond and so-called hybrid funds in May, up
from $5.24 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
   But while the bulls were having a good time, neither Paul
Turcato nor his steer was staying on top of things at the Ponoka
Stampede rodeo in Edmonton, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY
</P>
<P>
   Confidence Is Not High ...
</P>
<P>
   The United States' manufacturers have slowed production to the
lowest rate of growth since 1995, the clearest impact so far of the
Asian crisis on the American economy. The National Association of
Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity weakened
in June for a majority of the companies that it surveys each month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 22 months that a majority had reported
weakening instead of strengthening in their businesses.
Manufacturing employment has fallen in recent months, and
industrial production has slowed to an annual growth rate of less
than 2 percent, down from 6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Production is slowing in large part because stockpiles of unsold
goods have surged, but also because companies are becoming worried
that the economic boom cannot continue at the fervent pace of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the index of leading economic indicators was flat in
May, a sign that growth will moderate in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ... Except Among Consumers
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence in the economy rose in June to a 29-year
high, as Americans remained optimistic that the strong labor market
and healthy economic growth would continue in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board, a private research group, reported that
its index of consumer confidence rose to 137.6 in June from a
revised 136.3 in May, a larger rise than Wall Street analysts had
expected. That confidence was also reflected in sales of new homes,
which rose in May to a record level.
</P>
<P>
   And the Federal Reserve Board helped matters down the road by
leaving interest rates unchanged. New single-family home sales rose
0.3 percent in May to an annual rate of 890,000 units, the Commerce
Department said, breaking the previous record set in April.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the percentage of homeowners who were late on
their mortgage payments also rose in the first quarter, according
to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL MOTORS
</P>
<P>
   Stop-and-Go Manufacturing
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. said June car and truck sales were the
highest for any month in nine years but that July sales would
plummet because of two strikes that have shut down most of the
automaker's North American assembly plants and idled almost 172,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Most other carmakers also reported higher sales. A GM official
said sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent this month compared
with sales from the month a year earlier because of the strikes.
That would push GM's market share to a record low of 25 percent and
put GM behind Ford Motor Co. as the largest volume vehicle
manufacturer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Already, analysts say the strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich.,
have cost GM $1.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Cleaner Air, Costlier Cars
</P>
<P>
   People in Europe's car-filled cities are likely to start
breathing a little easier in the next few years because of tough
new anti-pollution rules announced in Brussels, Belgium, by the
15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which ban the use of leaded gasoline, require many
car engines and all fuels to become cleaner by 2000. Even tougher
standards will go into effect in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes, governments hope to cut as much as 70 percent
of the pollutants in emissions from cars, which regularly foul the
air in some of Europe's most beautiful city centers. The changes
are expected to raise the prices of cars between $300 and $600 in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Carmakers will need to invest some $65 billion to meet the new
standards, according to European Union officials. The oil industry
estimates it will cost $35 billion to put the program into effect.
And surprise, surprise, most of the higher costs are expected to be
passed on to consumers.

   Bailing Out the Banks
</P>
<P>
   The government outlined a long-awaited ``Total Plan'' to clear
away bad debts, estimated around $600 billion. The plan seems to be
modeled on the United States' bailout of savings and loans in the
1980s and is intended to gradually shut down banks weakened by bad
loans while keeping credit flowing to healthy corporate borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, insolvent banks will be managed by a new
watchdog agency while a merger partner is sought. Bridge loans will
be provided to corporate customers dependent on financing from the
troubled banks. When no suitor can be found, the banks will be
taken over by a state-funded holding company and then sold off or
liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   Bad loans will be handed over to special institutions and good
loans are to be transferred to healthy private banks. The process
is to be completed within a maximum of five years and funded by
taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Balance of Payments, Indeed
</P>
<P>
   Russia's legendarily ineffectual tax men stared down the
nation's biggest and most powerful corporation last week,
threatening to seize control of the company _ and its executives'
dachas, yachts and other perks _ unless it paid billions of dollars
in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To most everyone's amazement, the company, Gazprom, gave in and
agreed to turn over 4.2 billion rubles ($675 million) in unpaid
taxes by Monday and to start paying the government about 4 billion
rubles a month.
</P>
<P>
   Had President Boris Yeltsin grown a backbone in dealing with the
oligarchs who control the economy here _ or had he staged a deft
act of political theater?
</P>
<P>
   For the agreement does not merely force Gazprom, the world's
largest petroleum company and Russia's biggest tax delinquent, to
make good on its back taxes; it also requires the government to pay
Gazprom billions of rubles for oil and gas that government agencies
and state companies purchased but never paid for. By many
estimates, the two sums amount to a wash.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF
</P>
<P>
   Mean and Green
</P>
<P>
   Fore! New golf courses are opening in the United States at the
rate of more than one a day, according to the current issue of
Audubon magazine, and the more than 16,000 of them take up an area
three times the size of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   A major cost of golf courses _ both environmentally and bottom
line _ involves the heavy use of pesticides and herbicides to keep
those greens green. But some courses have found that sound ecology
pays twice: The Old Westbury Golf and Country Club on Long Island,
for example, spent $150,000 on chemicals in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Today, largely thanks to organic fertilizers, it has cut that
budget item to $8,000 a year and is much more user-friendly for
both the birdies and those who covet them.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Big Pricey Cities
</P>
<P>
   Business executives living abroad may have become used to the
astronomical prices they pay in Tokyo and Hong Kong, and maybe even
in Beijing and Shanghai. But companies doing business in China for
the first time might do a double take when their employees file
their first expense statements from Dalian, the globe's
ninth-most-expensive city for overseas workers _ and notably more
costly than New York, ranked No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   According to Corporate Resources Group, a consulting firm based
in Geneva, Asia still has seven of the world's 10 most expensive
cities for foreign workers. For big savings on expenses, try
Harare, Zimbabwe, which ranked at the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
   JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Burger Flippers, Take Note
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is showing signs of cooling. In June,
unemployment edged up to 4.5 percent and job growth slowed. There
were other signs of moderation, too.
</P>
<P>
   Total hours worked were virtually flat in June, a clear
indication that the nation's output of goods and services is
growing much more slowly than in recent quarters. And hourly pay
rose by a mere penny, suggesting that wage inflation, while higher
than a year ago, was not accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown, however, is from an exceptionally torrid pace. As
recently as a year ago, joblessness stood at 5 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the pulsating sunlight, children churn round and
round on a groaning Jolly Caterpillar, while others vigilantly man
the guns on the rocket ship, caring not a whit that the paint is
faded and the upholstery torn. Their parents watch dreamily,
remembering how they once rode the same rides in the same little
kiddie land.
</P>
<P>
   South Beach Amusement Park is the heart of the Staten Island
summer, an acre of Americana almost in the shadow of the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It is the final remnant of a continuous
string of amusement parks _ replete with Ferris wheels, sideshows
and tens of thousands of weekend visitors _ that once rivaled Coney
Island. But city and private development plans, television,
airplane vacations, Disney and change itself killed the South Beach
fun land. Except for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a landmark; it's been here forever,'' said Joanne
Barile, 33, who had brought her four children. ``I was on all these
rides.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the little park that stayed is for sale. The price is
$550,000, including 16 rides _ a carousel, a little roller coaster,
a Tilt-a-Whirl and you can probably guess the rest. It also comes
with a food concessionaire who pays $16,000 a year. The offer does
not include the land, but the owner, Marshall Lepre, would throw
that in, too, if a buyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes, but offers no assurance, that 326 Sand Lane will
remain an amusement park. Several people have visited since he
began advertising the park in newspapers several weeks ago. One
possibility is apparent: A town house development, a ubiquitous
feature of Staten Island, is rising across the street.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Association of Amusement Parks
and Attractions, Lepre's decision to sell is an increasingly common
one among the families who have long owned such little parks.
``We're seeing some consolidation for the first time,'' said Susan
Mosedale, a vice president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Lepre, 35, who began by selling cotton candy and popcorn from
his father's stand, said he would like to go into catering. He can
no longer work the long weeks, not least because he has a
5-year-old son and because his wife, a registered nurse, is sick of
the schedule. His father died in 1985 at 54 and his mother,
Maureen, who loved the park dearly and is famous for her lasagne
and for giving away tickets, died seven months ago at age 61. One
of the things Lepre, whose T-shirt says ``No. 1 Dad,'' is thinking
these days is that life is short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard right now,'' he said. ``There are lots of memories
here. Some of them are overwhelming.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the time, he stands behind the counter, in front of a
poster sent by a day care center. It has children's handprints in
different colors and an inscription: ``Thanks for being so kind to
our children.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign gives the prices: $1.25 a ride, 20 tickets for $20 and 40
for $35. Any unused ones can be used in the future, even in a
future season. There is no admission or parking fee. Birthday party
packages draw 350 parties of at least 10 a year. Groups of
disadvantaged children are often admitted free.
</P>
<P>
   The scene could seem depressing, were it not for the squeals of
the children and the low prices. The pavement is cracked, the
fluttering triangular pennants sun-bleached. There are no trees or
other shade. Some of the rides are rusted. Weeds taller than an
adult surround two sides of the park, and a half-block down the
street is a rather shabby strip club. The blaring radio music is
'60s and '70s rock, and, yes, Cat Stevens is still Cat Stevens on
this frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Several rides are restricted to passengers over 42 inches tall.
A sign on the Tilt-a-Whirl warns: ``Do not ride it if you have a
medical condition. For example, heart, back, neck or head, or if
you think you're pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are not charmed. John O'Day, 65, who calls himself Smiling
Jack, scrunched on a bright yellow bench and allowed as how the old
days, before the city condemned most of the park in the mid-1950s,
were golden. He remembered grabbing the brass ring on a great big
carousel, nickel mugs of root beer and 15-cent hot dogs. He said
Staten Island was special then, but now it is just another
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pale imitation,'' he growled. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Others seem happy just to be in a pleasant place, though many
acknowledged it seemed so much bigger through the eyes of a child.
A mother cheers when her son shouts ``Hi-yo Silver!'' as he rides
the carousel. Another delicately splashes water on her toddler
daughter as she glides along in the boar ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy's face glows when he's on there riding,'' said Denise
Payne, 32, as she watched her boy ride the Jack Rabbit roller
coaster. She said her husband came here as a boy, just like her,
although they did not know each other then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my place,'' she said. ``My mother took me with my
brothers and sisters _ you know, everybody. Nothing bad has ever
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, there were 1,500 amusement parks in the United States.
Now there are less than half that many. Some of the little ones,
including bustling Nellie Bly Amusement Park over in Gravesend,
Brooklyn, are doing well by offering more for less. But others are
falling by the wayside, and the future of South Beach Amusement
Park is anything but certain.
</P>
<P>
   Many are hoping it will manage to stay open. John Connolly, 38,
a New York City firefighter, had brought his triplets to celebrate
their sixth birthday, along with his two older children. The
triplets' faces were smeared with the ice cream cake that comes
with the birthday packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live on Staten Island, this is a place you can go and
treat the kids to a good day,'' he said. ``Just to see the smiles
on their faces, you can't put a price tag on that.''

 &HT;    Daytona Beach sees tourism being choked off
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla._It's supposed to be the biggest weekend of
the summer, a four-day spending spree when hard-partying stock car
racing fans jam this beach town's hotels, restaurants and gift
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Florida wildfire crisis that postponed the Pepsi
400, this July Fourth has turned into a disaster-tinged dud, so
much so that hoteliers seemed almost grateful when an unexpected
wave of would-be lodgers arrived _ evacuees from next-door Flagler
County looking for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of cars streamed south into Volusia County, with many
people stopping to rent the rooms just vacated by disappointed race
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, evacuees worried about their homes burning down
weren't going to spend the kinds of cash that revved-up racing fans
would. And some hoteliers _ in a spirit of charity _ were giving
reduced rates to evacuees, sometimes not even charging at all if
the people were in tough financial shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a big financial hit,'' said Sammy Mistry, who
owns the Cardinal Motel. ``But we had a plumber from Flagler come
in last night at 3 a.m. with his five kids and his dog, and we
couldn't turn him away. His house may have burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Thunderbird Beach Motel, what looked to be a fully-booked
weekend evaporated Thursday morning when Daytona International
Speedway officials canceled the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bust,'' said manager Judy Foster. ``We had to drop our
rates from $150 a night with a three-night minimum to $45 and $55 a
night. And last night I still only had 43 rooms full out of 97
available. A bunch of those were evacuees.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Foster's race fan customers were rolling over their
reservations to the Oct. 17 date when the Pepsi 400 has been
rescheduled. Others, though, had already taken long-planned
vacations and couldn't get more time off. Foster was refunding
their deposits fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't keep their money,'' she said. ``That just wouldn't
be right. You treat them right now and they'll treat you right
later. They'll be back when all this smoke and ash clears . . .''
</P>
<P>
   At The Corner, a T-shirt shop and body-piercing parlor, manager
Chris Saliba said he figured the July Fourth weekend would mean at
least $5,000 a day in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can do $1,000 now,'' he said. ``All that's
coming in are locals. I'm not going to charge them high prices when
they're living with this disaster. ``
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach has suffered from smoke from the fires for much of
the past two weeks. Often the beach is blanketed with thick smoke
at daybreak, then clears for several hours at midday when the sea
breeze kicks in, only to descend under the haze again at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Some hoteliers reported business dropping off a week ago. News
reports about the fires were prompting some people with
reservations to call ahead. Others arrived but checked out after
one night once they found themselves gasping for breath on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Many merchants were counting on the busy holiday weekend to turn
things around. Now they don't know when things will get better,
especially since news coverage has made it seem like half the
county is on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, about half the county is on fire, but so far, the
flames have been contained in the western rural areas, away from
the populated coast.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Ben, a clerk at the Rusty Cat Gift Shop, said business has
been off for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off about 70 percent,'' she said. ``The store would
normally be full, and now there's no one in here. It's been slow
for the last two weeks. This weekend is supposed to be the real
start of summer, and it just isn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the lost business, though, none of the merchants seemed
critical of race officials for postponing the event. With fires
burning in a long, smoky line across the western horizon, they
agreed it was no time for a hard-partying crowd of 250,000 race
fans to be coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't bring a party to a town that's been devastated,''
Saliba said. ``That would just be a slap in the face.

 &HT;    White flag day: Lopez fails to make cut at U.S. Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ After four second-place finishes at the U.S.
Women's Open, Nancy Lopez was prepared to once again leave town
unfulfilled. But nothing could have mentally braced her for this.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the cut? Sadly, Lopez made that all but official by the
end of her front nine Friday. The wheels not only came off. They
rolled off the course property and halfway down I-43.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 U.S. Opens, Lopez had never failed to break 80. Friday the
elegant icon from Albany shot an 83 for a two-day total of 18-over
par 160, missed the cut and stood before the media admittedly
shell-shock. During an eight-hole stretch in the middle of the
round, she went 11-over par with three double-bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really would have liked to have just gone like those pigs
who buried themselves where the fires are in Florida,'' Lopez said.
``I felt like just burying myself in the dirt. I just wanted to
hide and go away for a little while. ... Golf is so humbling, and
you just don't want to play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was no place to hide and nothing to do but
deflect the pain. Lopez started the round with tragedy, hitting a
fan, Cecelia Logan, 49, of Jamison, Pa., in the face with a ball on
the first hole. She was treated and released at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Lopez could barely find a green. Over two
days, she found the putting surface in regulation only 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been surreal, really,'' said husband Ray Knight.
``It's the weirdest round I've ever watched her play.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to the 18th green, after Lopez found the water with her
second shot, the threesome of Lopez (83), Meg Mallon (76) and Jane
Geddes (79) recognized the demanding Blackwolf Run Golf Course as
the true champion. At Geddes' suggestion from back on the 10th
hole, when Lopez had just moved to 9-over for the day, the three
players put towels on their putters and waved them in surrender for
the final walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was pretty appropriate,'' Mallon said. ``The
course definitely won.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time Lopez had moved into weekend position on
rounds of 69-68 and stood one stroke off Alison Nicholas' lead.
Eventually, Lopez would lose by a stroke, missing a 10-foot putt on
the 72nd hole. What transpired Friday was in no way comparable.
This was the greatest player in modern women's golf playing like an
amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a whole different kind of disappointment,'' she
said. ``It's just hard to feel like you have to smile when you
don't really feel like smiling. That kind of frustrates you. But
it's not like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   When many players would have blurted out a few words afterward
and bolted, Nancy Lopez was being, well, Nancy Lopez. She spoke to
reporters for a half-hour and then signed autographs for nearly as
long.
</P>
<P>
   When her voice choked in front of the microphones, she said,
``You know, I'm a crybaby. I'm all right. I just have to get over
it. I wear everything on my heart ... always.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching quickly for another goal, Lopez said she would be
playing the next four LPGA events and trying to make the Solheim
Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I didn't play well here,'' she said, ``I think next
week's going to feel like pitch-and-putt.''

 &HT;    Tough course doesn't faze Stacy
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ No stranger to stout U.S. Women's Open
performances, Savannah native Hollis Stacy made her presence known
Friday with a 3-under-par 68 in the second round. While others were
surrendering to the Blackwolf Run Golf Course and cursing designer
Pete Dye, Stacy demonstrated how she become a three-time U.S.
Women's Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy started briskly in her morning round, making birdies at
the first two holes and repairing some damage from Thursday's
opening 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to play the weekend, especially because I've
missed the last two cuts (at the Open),'' said the 44-year-old
Stacy, a resident of La Quinta, Calif. ``Since I birdied the first
couple of holes, I felt more like I could just play golf and not
sweat bullets about the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what bothered other players _ wind, length, tight
approaches, undulating greens _ seemed to faze Stacy Friday. She
birdied the 10th and 13th and bogeyed only the 17th, finishing 36
holes at 2-over 144. Had it not been for the local wildlife, Stacy
might have played a flawless round. She 3-putted the 17th green
after waiting for deer prints to be fixed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' she said, ``he wasn't (going) spikeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy, who told the U.S. Golf Association this year that she did
not want an exemption, made it here as a qualifier from the
Broadmoor sectional in Colorado Springs. It's the 29th consecutive
Open appearance for Stacy, who has six USGA championships _ Opens
in 1977-78 and 1984; and U.S. girls junior titles in 1969-71.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy's play was more solid than her physical condition. She's
been on a daily regimen of strengthening and stretching exercises
since injuring her back in February ``from hitting lots of golf
balls with my new equipment, playing in cold weather and a lovely,
six-hour flight to Hawaii and lifting up a 40-pound golf bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stacy, ``I'm not 24 anymore, where I would walk out onto
the practice tee, hit one ball and go to the first tee. I have to
stretch for 15 minutes to hit a bucket of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar impersonation?
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the performance of another ACC player, Georgia
Tech's Matt Kuchar, in the Masters and U.S. Open, Duke senior-to-be
Jenny Chuasiriporn shot an even-par 71 for 143. She made the cut
last year, also, eventually tying for 56th at Pumpkin Ridge. ``It's
always nice to see another amateur do well,'' said the Curtis Cup
player from Baltimore, who met Kuchar playing junior golf. ``He is
actually a good friend of mine. It will be nice to see what he does

sees distractions
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez's husband, Ray Knight, who knows something about
distractions having worked for Marge Scott as the Cincinnati Reds
manager, wonders whether all the pre-tournament attention and
on-site media requests took away from her focus. ``I talked to her

can prepare giving people so much time.'' ... Amateur Robin Burke,
another Curtis Cup player, recorded a 10 on the par-4, finding the
water three times during an 84. ``I would have liked to dive into

Burke, 35, from Houston. She had to get up-and-down from over the
green for the 10. ... Early Georgia finishers: Cindy McCurdy,

IVANISEVIC DEFEATS KRAJICEK IN `LONG MARCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Chairman Mao, the ``Long March'' guy, would have loved
what Goran Ivanisevic and Richard Krajicek committed in the name of
tennis Friday at the Big W. As a sporting version of the Chinese
water torture, it will live in infamy for all those who believed
the tiebreaker had liberated their favorite game from such
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the USA. Only at the US Open among the four majors does
the tiebreaker conclude all sets that arrive at 6-6. All sets, like
all men and women, are created equal in America. It is comforting.
Not so at Wimbledon, where the archaic deuce scheme _ you've got to
be two games ahead to win _ prevails in the ultimate set: fifth for
guys, third for dolls.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Krajicek, champion two years ago (the only
victimizer of Pete Sampras in Pete's last 39 capers on the old,
balding sod), and Ivanisevic came in for the longest fifth set
trudge in Wimbledon history. One tiebreaking game could have
settled it well before. But no, tradition dictated that they
soldier on and on, for 16 more games before Krajicek _ wondering if
he would miss Christmas at home _ became despondent and forgot
where to serve the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Frying Dutchman, using his gut-strung skillet heatedly,
already had 43 aces. However, after 72 games and 3 hours 20
minutes, Krajicek abruptly couldn't put a first serve in the proper
space. He lost the game and the hyperextended semifinal by an army
serial number score: 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7, 15-13. His long march had
been to oblivion for this year. Ivanisevic's was to a final with
Sampras that nobody, including himself, could have envisioned when
he showed up at the front gate with a 16-14 record (nine first
round losses), a No. 25 ranking and looking like Rasputin: bearded
and wild-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When Chairman Mao Zedong marched the Red Army that very long way
to remote Shaanxi Province in 1934, they had plenty of time after
arrival for tennis and such interminable sets. It was three decades
before the tiebreaker became a sport-saving gleam in the eye of its
papa, Jimmy Van Alen of Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to Mao's biographer, Edgar Snow, the Chairman was
an enthusiastic player in camp while the Commies hid out, preparing
to take over China. Alas, his career ended when a goat ate the net.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic was nearly the goat who choked on a net cord. He had
worked his way to double-match point with serve at 5-4, 40-15 in
the fourth set _ only to bungle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem. It's over. You could win a lot of money betting
I'd lose serve with two match points.'' He hadn't lost it _ yet.
Zing! Goran fired an apparent goodbye ace, and Richard began the
long walk to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly,'' Krajicek says, ``as I think it's over ... it's
still going on. I didn't hear the ball tick the net, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   But, according to an electronic net judging device, it was a
let, to be replayed. Reprieved, Krajicek cracked the momentarily
rejoicing Ivanisevic's serve and forced that slow-boat-to-China,
79-minute fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Stroking his billygoat beard, Goran looked and felt distraught.
He should have been in the shower long before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange for me not to lose my temper, but I didn't. I
prove I kept my mind when I break him right back after he breaks
me'' _ to 3-3. ``No more breaks until the end. In the fifth I never
saw somebody serve like Richard. Even when I guessed right _ boom!
_ I couldn't reach it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aces fell like dandruff in a shampoo commercial _ 24 for
Krajicek, 15 for Ivanisevic in the home stretch alone. They totaled
71 for the matinee in which points were shorter than Michael
Jordan's coiffure.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek says he would have preferred a tie-breaker to decide
it, saving 15 games. Ivanisevic likes it the way it is, even though
``my (butt) was sore as hell, and I worried about cramping.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras sides with Ivanisevic until somebody reminds him that he
wouldn't have won the US Open in 1996 if this system were in effect
at Flushing. Swooning, vomiting, he barely wobbled past Alex
Corretja in the fifth-set breaker of their quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it should be the players' option,'' Pete laughs. ``If
I'm throwing up, we play a breaker. Otherwise, play it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some like it hot in a tiebreaking, risky roulette climax; others
like it as long as it can go. Regardless, the fifth was tense,
nerve-pinching as games mounted and the adversaries dueled in
staccato bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Two double faults troubled Goran before he held to 9-8, and
another as he got through deuce to 11-10. A pair of one-armed
bandits, they kept hitting jackpots at each other. Elizabeth Taylor
had a couple of marriages briefer than their fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Triskaidekaphobes in the Centre Court gathering of 13,120 would
have predicted disaster at 13-13. Having no fear of that number,
Goran got to 14. Richard couldn't, bowing out on the Croat
Croaker's backhand passer, and his own wayward volley.
</P>
<P>
   Tiebreaker sire Van Alen used to call such overgrown sets
``urological torture for players, fans and court officials.
Lingering death.''
</P>
<P>
   Sighs of relief greeted the 28th game conclusion where 13 would
have sufficed. But Chairman Mao, who encouraged his marchers with,
``A journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first step,'' might have
hailed it as worthy discipline for these two young capitalists.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are serial acquirers _ companies that play Pac-Man by
gobbling up other companies, paying for the purchases with
high-priced stock. It's a cycle that feeds voraciously on itself:
The more a company acquires, the higher the stock price, fueling
even more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers include companies like Republic Industries and
Nationsbank, Cendant and Worldcom. They promise investors that they
will make money by transforming industries, providing tremendous
economies of scale and greater efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the cycle, it may indeed work out that way. But
investors can find it impossible to tell when the game is about to
come to a grinding halt _ rudely punishing the acquirer's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the newly formed Cendant Corp. lost nearly half their
value after the company disclosed in April that one of its
businesses, the former CUC International, had overstated earnings.
Waste Management's troubled accounting and ill-fated
diversification attempts eventually crushed its shares and are
driving the company into the arms of a rival.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Office Products' profits have slumped and the company
recently ended up spinning off four units composed of some of its
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   What all serial acquirers _ the successful and the
not-so-successful _ have in common is that their finances can
confound even the most sophisticated investors. Buyers of these
companies' stocks must decide whether to risk being swept up in the
deal-making in the hopes of riding a stock up further.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer complexity of putting together dozens of companies or
more _ in each of its most frantic years, Waste Management bought
as many as 100 companies _ makes it nearly impossible to see
whether the acquiring company's strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that many of these companies employ
accounting sleight of hand; in perfectly legal maneuvers, they mask
the real cost of their acquisitions through write-offs, leaving the
buyers looking more profitable than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   In sorting this out, investors get little help from Wall Street
analysts, who often play along. After all, corporations can come
down hard on naysayers. Thomas K. Brown, until recently a banking
analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, long criticized the
acquisition strategy of First Union Corp., which has made more than
70 acquisitions since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, he was excluded from one-on-one meetings
at First Union's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. (First Union said
it had never refused to meet with Brown.)
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, who asked not to be identified, recalled being
threatened with a lawsuit by one serial acquirer after publicly
questioning its purchases. Why the heavy-handed treatment? ``So
much depends on the stock price,'' he surmised.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts can also be reluctant to look too closely at any one
transaction for fear that their company might lose the lucrative
investment banking fees on the acquirer's next deal.
</P>
<P>
   A result of this combination of complexity and analysts'
see-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach is that the guidepost usually
followed by investors _ the analysts' estimated growth rate of
earnings _ can vary so wildly for these companies as to be nearly
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts following Worldcom, for example, peg its annual
earnings growth rate at anywhere from 20 percent to more than 50
percent, a range that suggests they are doing little more than
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiastic analysts are not always wrong, of course, and many
investors enjoy long rides up with the stock of acquisition-happy
businesses. ``Lots of companies have successfully changed the
profitability of an industry by acquiring,'' said John W. Ballen,
the chief equity officer for MFS Investment Management in Boston,
citing Republic Industries, Computer Associates and Cardinal Health
as examples.
</P>
<P>
   But other seasoned investors and analysts are so wary of the
serial acquirers that they simply steer clear. ``I don't feel
comfortable covering a company that makes so many acquisitions,''
said Stephen Sanborn, the research director for Value Line of New
York, which provides stock analysis to individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Value Line does not cover Starwood Hotels and Resorts, for
example, whose buying spree of about 40 businesses in the last
three years includes this year's purchase of ITT Corp. for $15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   As a company gets larger, said Robert A. Olstein, a portfolio
manager in Purchase, N.Y., ``the pressure on keeping that going is
growing.'' Olstein, who has spent decades scrutinizing companies'
financial statements, also avoids these stocks. Eventually, he
said, the chief executive ``reaches too far,'' making an
acquisition that leads the company to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, the game goes on so long that analysts and
investors catch on. First Union has been engaged in its feeding
frenzy for more than a dozen years, and the drops in its stock
price after several of the bank's recent acquisitions indicate that
many on Wall Street have grown tired of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the deals' complexities, the so-called experts
can be just as ignorant as the average investor about an acquirer's
true performance, and the rapid rise in many of these companies'
stocks suggests that the game remains as popular as ever.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at three of these companies _ Worldcom, First Union
and U.S. Filter _ illustrates the challenges for investors in
evaluating a serial acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the financial results of a serial acquirer is
difficult enough _ the footnotes in its reports are full of
references to actual results and pro forma results, depending on
how the company is putting together the numbers for different
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But making it even more difficult to decipher performance are
accounting techniques that allow companies to erase ``good will'' _
a measure of how much a company pays over the book value of an
acquisition _ and thereby insure that their future earnings do not
reflect the hefty price of their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   For Worldcom Inc., the strategy of gobbling up other
telecommunications players, mostly through stock-based purchases,
has been a raging success to date.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually understand their business and make moves that
are strategically intelligent,'' said Michael J. Mahoney, who owns
the stock as the manager of the AIM Global Telecommunications fund.
Shares of Worldcom, which is based in Jackson, Miss., have gained
an average of around 50 percent annually over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of analysts who follow Worldcom
continue to urge investors to buy the stock, despite the drastic
changes ahead as the company swells more than four times its
current size with its pending $37 billion acquisition of the MCI
Communications Corp. (The final purchase price depends on a number
of factors, including the price of Worldcom's stock.)
</P>
<P>
   The analysts' logic goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom is expected to earn $1.95 a share in 1999. With an
estimated long-term growth rate around 30 percent a year, the stock
can command a price-to-earnings multiple of 25 to 30, roughly in
line with its growth rate. Presto: The stock is worth $48.75 to
$58.50, making it a buy at its current price of $50.1875.
</P>
<P>
   In that equation, however, the key number is the growth rate. On
its own, MCI has been a much slower grower than Worldcom, says
Anthony F. Ferrugia, an analyst at A.G. Edwards and one of the rare
members of his profession not pushing the stock.
</P>
<P>
   And Worldcom is paying a huge premium for MCI. So while there
may be substantial savings when the two companies combine, it is
not at all clear to him how fast the combined company can grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at all those numbers, I don't have a crystal
ball,'' Ferrugia said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney acknowledges that achieving the projection of 30
percent-plus growth ``takes everything working.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a little accounting magic. Over the last two
years, Worldcom has managed to bolster its future earnings by a
little more than $2.5 billion by making a like amount of good will
vanish through write-offs, which are usually discounted by
investors as one-time anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   The technique used by Worldcom is becoming increasing popular,
particularly when, because they have been buying back stock or for
other reasons, companies cannot treat an acquisition as a pooling
of interests, in which no good will is created.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the buyer contends that some part of the price of a
purchase is acquired research, which must be written off
immediately under current accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   That, effectively, increases future earnings by reducing the
amount of good will amortized each year, a figure that is
subtracted from earnings on a company's income statement. For
acquirers, the attraction of this technique is that management gets
to determine how much good will it can write off: it is the buyer
that assigns a value to the acquired research, although managements
bring in appraisers to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very, very subjective estimate,'' said Baruch Lev, a
professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who has
recently completed a study of the technique.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Lev is the possibility that investors are failing
to discount such companies' future higher earnings. ``Some of this
growth in earnings and high return on equity will turn out to be
bogus,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what would happen to Worldcom's earnings-per-share
numbers if the company had not taken those write-offs in the last
two years. If it had amortized the good will over 20 years _
Worldcom's practice varies from 10 years to 40 years _ it would
have eliminated roughly $125 million a year in goodwill expenses,
or around 12 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   If estimated 1999 earnings were, therefore, $1.83 a share, the
stock, at a multiple of 25 to 30, would today be worth $45.75 to
$54.90. And that would make it less of a buy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should be prepared to see the same technique used when
Worldcom completes its merger with MCI, which is expected to result
in about $25 billion in good will, the premium it is paying for
MCI. Worldcom may write off some of that sum as acquired research _
about $3 billion, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be a higher number,'' added Gary Brandt,
Worldcom's vice president for investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt argues that Worldcom is already being penalized by its
accounting for earlier purchases, from which the amortization of
good will wipes out about 50 cents of earnings per share a year, he
said. The company, he added, relies on independent appraisals to
determine how much it can write off for research and stays well
within accepted accounting practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin M. Moore, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown, dismisses the
significance of Worldcom's accounting treatment. ``The creation of
good will is an accounting charge and does not change its cash
flow,'' Moore said, adding that the latter is the most important
measure in determining what a company is worth.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not concerned about how Bernard J. Ebbers, Worldcom's
chief executive, arrives at his results. ``As long as they do $2,
however they do it is fine with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lev counters that analysts rely heavily on earnings in valuing
companies, so how they come up with those numbers is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accounting is accountability,'' he said, adding that managers
have little incentive to pay less for an acquisition if they do not
have to account for its full price.
</P>
<P>
   Serial acquirers are so difficult to analyze because of the
guesswork in determining even the most basic information about a
company. How fast would it grow if it had made no acquisitions? How
fast are its new businesses growing?
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have been shopping as busily as U.S. Filter Corp.,
which has completed more than 150 acquisitions since 1991 _ roughly
60 in the last year alone _ to become the nation's largest provider
of water-treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is a logic to the strategy of the company, which is based
in Palm Desert, Calif. ``You have an industry that's just ripe for
consolidation,'' said Patrick S. Adams, a portfolio manager for
Berger Associates in Denver who owns the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping track of all of U.S. Filter's activities is nearly
impossible. Its frenetically acquired operations range from
waste-water treatment plants to the sale of bottled water. And the
sheer number of purchases means that most investors do not know how
quickly certain businesses are growing and how profitable they are.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people have done real in-depth models for every
division they've acquired?'' asked one portfolio manager, who has
owned the stock but asked not to be identified. ``Probably no
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery may be the company's internal growth rate,
which is the measure of how quickly U.S. Filter is increasing its
business without the benefit of all of its acquisitions. Like a lot
of companies, U.S. Filter will tell curious analysts what that rate
is _ somewhere in the vicinity of 10 percent _ but the figure never
appears in the financial statements available to the average
investor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an estimate, yes,'' said Tim L. Traff, a co-founder of
the company and its executive vice president for development.
</P>
<P>
   And while U.S. Filter has been quick to supply anecdotal
evidence of how its purchases have fared, a more systematic
appraisal is essentially impossible, because the company does not
provide detailed information about every purchase, said Rod Lache,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Lache, who nevertheless recommends the stock, concedes that the
anecdotes ``are not helpful in modeling'' the company's future
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, figuring out how U.S. Filter's purchases have fared
proved so challenging that the Securities and Exchange Commission
asked the company earlier this year to improve the disclosure in
the company's public financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC declined to comment, and the company said its
discussions with the commission were routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give out as much information as we humanly can on a daily
basis,'' Traff said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Worldcom, U.S. Filter seems to be a master of accounting
wizardry, which contributes to the difficultly in estimating future
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a
group in Rockville, Md., that studies corporate accounting for
professional investors, U.S. Filter took several charges in its
December quarter that could help inflate future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company's acquisition last month of Culligan Water
Technologies for $1.5 billion in stock complicates matters further
because Culligan itself made more than 35 acquisitions in its most
recent fiscal year and took several charges.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Filter defends its accounting as appropriate and has
promised to take away at least some of the mystery. Starting with
its quarterly results due out in August, the company said, it plans
to disclose more information about its individual divisions, like
their revenues and operating margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we'll be able to dissect the company and
judge the progress of the company,'' said Lache, who, with the
information that is available, has projected an earnings growth
rate of 25 percent or more for U.S. Filter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, analysts and investors can judge the results of a
serial acquirer's strategy. If they grow skeptical _ even sending
the stock down on news of another purchase _ a company may send its
Pac-Man strategy packing. First Union seems to be taking that step.
</P>
<P>
   In the whirl of acquisitions among banks, First Union has been
among the busiest, growing from a single-state bank with about $7
billion in assets in 1984 to a 12-state banking giant with $220
billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and investors have grown sharply critical of
the bank's strategy and say its acquisitions have diluted its
earnings. The market's judgment is that First Union has overpaid
for its purchases, using stock with a relatively low
price-to-earnings multiple to pay for companies with higher P/E
ratios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what _ that causes dilution,'' said Brown, the early
critic of First Union. He is now working for Tiger Management, a
money manager in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has certainly suffered. Over the last five
years, First Union has returned 184 percent, compared with a 304
percent gain in the Standard &AMP; Poor's large-bank index. On the day
last November when First Union announced it would buy Corestates
Financial in a $17.1 billion deal, First Union's stock lost more
than $2 a share _ roughly a 4 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the bank's efforts to show that its acquisitions
make sense, ``the market is saying that these deals do not have as
much economic value,'' said David Ellison, a portfolio manager for
the brokerage firm Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   First Union has apparently heard Wall Street's complaints,
although the bank declined to comment on its strategy. Edward E.
Crutchfield, its acquisitive chairman, is now telling analysts and
investors that the bank will not pursue deals in which it must pay
a premium, like its acquisition of Corestates, but instead will
look for a partner with which to achieve a ``merger of equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, for one, is not so easily convinced. He said First
Union's management, having watched the bank's stock suffer, would
try to increase the P/E ratio. Cynics might argue that executives
are trying to get ``the currency up so they can do a deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it pays to be skeptical of any company whose fast
growth is largely a result of a frenetic buying spree. The company
will almost surely stumble, said Ballen of MFS, who is a big
shareholder in one recent sufferer, Cendant. ``It's going to
happen,'' he said. ``I'm sure that it's happened to every company
that makes acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why investors who are interested in reducing their
risks might want to consider sitting out this particular game.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WIMBLEDON, England _ The Pete Sampras era at Wimbledon began after
a loss to Goran Ivanisevic. That defeat in the 1992 semifinals
opened the door for Andre Agassi, not Sampras, to become the first
player of this latest golden generation of American players to
break through on Centre Court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ironic, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Today, Agassi is an afterthought, destined to be remembered as a
flukish champion, certainly on Wimbledon's lawns. But Sampras is
one title short of making big-time history. With another victory
Sunday _ against, as fate would have it, Ivanisevic _ he would put
himself in very special company.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, only Bjorn Borg has won Wimbledon five times.
Of the Open Era players, only Borg has won 11 Grand Slams. Now,
having stopped Englishman Tim Henman's milestone sprint through the
draw 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 in the semifinals Friday, the 26-year-old
Sampras is three sets from pulling even with Borg on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Which also would leave him one Slam championship short of tying
Roy Emerson's all-time record of 12 _ many of them coming in the
mid-1960s when rivals such as Rod Laver, who also claimed 11
majors, had become barnstorming professionals and were thus banned
from tournaments like Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   But after beating Henman, Sampras didn't sound like a man making
a date with destiny. He had left everything on the worn grass,
although he hardly had been through an ordeal like Ivanisevic's
earlier five-set battle with Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fried, to tell you the truth,'' Sampras said. ``It was
very difficult out there. Not only was I battling Tim, the crowd
was pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman, 23, was the first native son to reach a Wimbledon
semifinal since Roger Taylor in 1973. Had he won, and the
boisterous Centre Court audience did everything under its power to
pull him through, he would have been the first British finalist
since Bunny Austin lost to the Grand Slam-bound Don Budge exactly
60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With England's World Cup soccer fortunes having cratered during
the week, there was an air of desperation about Henman's fanciful
bid to upset the No. 1-ranked and top-seeded Sampras, who has been
having a mediocre year by his august standards.
</P>
<P>
   Henman rose to the occasion as best he could in his first Slam
semifinal, but he said he wouldn't accept the outcome as any kind
of moral triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the score is irrelevant,'' he argued. ``It's about
winning and losing. I lost today. That's the bottom line of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, the underachieving Croat who never has won a major,
earned the right to try to change his fortunes and thwart Sampras'
aspirations by hanging on in a grueling 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (5-7),
15-13 saga against the 6-foot-5 Dutchman Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   The year he claimed his title, Krajicek had knocked Sampras out
in a rain-plagued quarterfinal that took two days to complete. That
was Sampras' lone loss since the one to Ivanisevic, which Sampras
avenged convincingly in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he might have preferred to settle his account with
Krajicek as well, but he insisted he is content to take his chances
against Ivanisevic, whose spirit, as well as his serve, he broke in
a straight-sets final that went 7-6, 7-6, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek had suggested last week that Sampras had become just
another player, perhaps no better than 10th-best on the tour in
1998. But if that got under Sampras' skin, he declined to show it
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not personal, you know,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras would be put to a test by Henman and his rabid
army of supporters, he never gave a strong indication he might let
the match slip away. With his serve reaching 136 mph at various
times, he rebounded impressively in the third set after dropping
the second and then staved off Henman's final serious threat to
cloud the outcome when he saved a break point in the first game of
the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come through there,'' he said, ``that was a big moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Sampras would convert five of his eight break points,
Henman only two of six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's relentless the way he plays,'' Henman said. ``I
think that's why he's so difficult to beat. There's no letup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who hadn't lost a set at Wimbledon until Henman took
the second, appears to be back to being the Sampras who has headed
the ATP rankings each of the last five years. He has, by his own
admission, had a subpar '98, succumbing in the quarterfinals of the
Australian Open _ a defeat that briefly cost him his No. 1 ranking
to Marcelo Rios _ and the second round of the French Open, the one
major in which he remains a minor player.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivanisevic-Krajicek semifinal had interminably delayed the
start of the much-anticipated Henman-Sampras showdown, dragging on
for 3 hours, 22 minutes after Krajicek, an ace-negating net cord
away from defeat in the 10th game of the fourth set, rallied to
produce one of the longest and most memorable Wimbledon battles in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already walking to the net,'' Krajicek admitted. ``I
didn't hear the net cord. I thought it was over. I was going up to
shake his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, though, Krajicek had squared the match, and
then it was Ivanisevic's turn to anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `My God,' but I also say, `OK, you cannot get it back,
so you just have to try to win this set,''' Ivanisevic said. ``A
fifth set, it's always roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour's two biggest servers needed 77 minutes to complete
that final set, since Wimbledon is the only Slam that doesn't
employ the tiebreaker at 6-all in the fifth. They played on for
another 15 games with barely a break in stride before Ivanisevic
put Krajicek in a 15-40 bind and then finished him off with a
jammed forehand return that Krajicek volleyed into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, seeded ninth, had fired 23 aces in the set and 42
overall, compared to the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic's 15 and 28.
Although the bedeviling lefthander from Split was the tournament
leader going in with 133 aces in his five previous wins, he was
definitely outslugged by Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just `boom!' and I couldn't even react,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``Even when I picked the right side, I couldn't reach it. I
never saw anybody serving like that in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, requested to make a prediction about Sunday's outcome,
was outspoken as usual. But he has definitely changed his tune
regarding Sampras, who has beaten Ivanisevic in eight of their last
nine meetings, the latest victory coming in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if Goran plays Pete,'' the Dutchman said, ``he's not
going to win. There were a few holes in his game today. I mean,
he's playing good, but I don't think Pete would let him get away
with what he got away with against me. I think he has to hope he
plays Henman.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of England was hoping that as well.

CLINTON PRESSURES CONGRESS FOR MONEY TO ENSURE SAFETY OF FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to press Congress on
Saturday to provide all $101 million he has sought to ensure the
safety of the nation's food supply. But Congress seems unlikely to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to announce two steps the administration can
take without congressional authority to protect food safety,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the
president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug
Administration ``greater authority to halt imports of fruits,
vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety
conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to
give the Department of Agriculture ``new authority to impose tough
fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue
mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has no reliable tracking system, but health
officials say food-borne diseases account for up to 30 million
cases of illness and 9,000 deaths a year. There have been many
large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year, including
one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in
the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated
with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has failed to address legislation proposed by the
administration to give the food agencies greater authority, and it
appears unlikely that Congress will provide the full amount of
money the administration has requested to expand inspections,
increase research and surveillance of food-borne illness and
educate consumers. Before the July 4 recess, the House voted to
provide only $16.8 million of the requested money, and the Senate
bill, which has not been voted on, provides just $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the day the agencies can quantitatively answer how much
it would cost to reduce food-borne illness,'' said John Ziolkowski,
a staff member of the House Appropriations Committee, ``they won't
get any more money. If they can say we will cut food-borne illness
by so much, I'm sure the members would say that is a serious
proposal. Did we provide enough money? No. I'm sure we didn't for a
lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
agriculture, Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said that even though some new
programs proposed by the administration had merit, the committee
did not have the money for them. So it provided nothing. Instead,
Cochran suggested that some of the Food and Drug Administration's
duties be delegated to states and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials say more action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food-borne diseases are a continuing problem that have not yet
been resolved,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and
diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. This fact has been underscored in the last few months
by two unexpected outbreaks of food-borne illnesses: travelers'
diarrhea, or enterotoxigenic E. coli, from potato salad, which
sickened 4,000 people in Illinois, and salmonella in breakfast
cereal, which made 200 people ill in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salmonella in breakfast cereal is basically a first for us in
this country,'' Tauxe said. ``We cannot have a breakfast-cereal
plant having failures like that, and that's an inspection
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The potato salad outbreak is equally worrisome, he said. ``We
used to believe you had to travel overseas to get travelers'
diarrhea. It's a classic example of emerging infections common in
Latin America becoming a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Tauxe described as ``extraordinary efforts'' to
prevent E. coli O157:H7 from contaminating meat, it continues to be
a problem. ``I don't feel that recalls are the answer,'' he said,
``because we don't want E. coli in the meat to begin with. That's a
sign that additional efforts are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the number of products recalled for life-threatening
microbial contamination has increased almost fivefold, according to
the FDA. In 1993, the agency asked the administration for the power
to bar fruits, vegetables, grains, fish and other food from
countries with food-safety systems inferior to that of the United
States. But advocates of free trade oppose ceding that power,
called equivalency, and no action, executive or legislative, has
been taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture has the power to bar imported meat
and poultry, but in a report issued in May, the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said ``Federal agencies
cannot ensure that the growing volume of imported food is safe for
consumers,'' and recommended that the power of equivalency be
extended to cover all foods eligible for import.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The FDA now deals with imported food only after it arrives. It
inspects slightly more than 1.5 percent of all foreign shipments,
and among imported produce items, a source for some extremely
serious outbreaks of food-borne illness, only 0.2 percent were
sampled last year. The number of shipments of food for which the
FDA is responsible has increased to 2.2 million from 1.5 million
five years ago. The number of people who inspect the food has
remained the same. And domestically, the agency inspects food
plants only every 10 years, on average.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns from its recess, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
will offer an amendment to restore all of the original $101 million
for the president's food safety initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And in his radio address, the president will announce what the
administration can do without congressional approval. One measure
is an FDA rule requiring warning labels on all packaged juice that
has not been pasteurized or processed to kill harmful bacteria. A
second measure is the creation of a national institute for food
safety research to coordinate public and private research.
</P>
<P>
   Unpasteurized apple juice, contaminated with E. coli O157:H7,
caused the death of a 16-month-old child last year and led to the
hospitalization of a dozen other children. The new labeling rule
will take effect in time for the apple cider season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is sitting on its hands while we watch all these
outbreaks occur around this country,'' said Caroline Smith deWaal,
director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an advocacy group based in Washington, ``and things are
not going to get better without resources and authority to regulate
food.''

MANY FUNDS FAIL TO MATCH INDEXES

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the stock market hot as a firecracker, pushing the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index to record highs, why aren't mutual fund
holders cheering? Because it is no fun to have few or no gains in
one's fund holdings while the indexes race ever higher.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to own a fund that underperforms the market
averages by a few percentage points but still winds up with a gain
in net asset value. At least these shareholders are making money.
</P>
<P>
   But many domestic stock mutual funds this quarter were flat or
slightly down while the major indexes moved up. The average U.S.
diversified stock fund listed in the tables in The New York Times
rose 0.05 percent. The 251 specialized funds lost an average 1.41
percent, while the 655 international funds lost the most: an
average 3.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast these returns with what the various broad-based indexes
did for the period. The most common benchmark for American stock
funds, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, returned 3.3 percent
during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index returned 3.2 percent and the Dow
Jones industrial average returned 2.1 percent. Morgan Stanley
Capital International's all-encompassing index of foreign stocks
lost 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only stock funds that outperformed the S&AMP;P during the
quarter were large-capitalization growth funds, up an average 5.24
percent. Large-cap growth and value funds were up just 2.12 percent
and mid-cap growth stock funds eked out gains of only 0.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So when shareholders open their latest fund statements, many
will be wondering what is behind the mediocre performance turned in
by most mutual fund managers this last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it can be attributed to the expenses levied on fund
holders; management fees, sales charges and advertising costs can
really add up, taking 1 percent or more off a fund's performance.
</P>
<P>
   But a more significant driver may be the serious bloodletting
going on in secondary and third-ranked stocks that are not included
in the major indexes. Through June 2, for example, 43 percent of
all Nasdaq stocks were down 30 percent or more; almost two-thirds
had lost 20 percent or more of their value.
</P>
<P>
   According to John L. Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon
Smith Barney, only once in the last eight years has greater damage
been done to these stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The positive performance by the major indexes has obscured the
pain. But the further fund managers strayed from the most heavily
weighted stocks in the S&AMP;P 500, the more likely their performances
lagged behind the market's. Small-cap growth funds lost 3.49
percent during the second quarter; small-cap value funds fell 4.86
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason funds may be underperforming the indexes is
related to the weak market for initial public offerings. Access to
hot issues has often helped fuel rocketing fund performance, but
the performance of initial public offerings in the second quarter
was well below the gains made by new issues during the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Securities Data Co., the average gain on new issues
was almost 17 percent in the first quarter. In the second quarter,
the average gain was 9.3 percent. Not bad, but not exactly the push
needed to propel stock fund performance into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fundamentals of various industries also affected
performance. Among the eight sector-fund groups followed by
Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, four showed
gains and four showed losses. The biggest losers were those
investing in gold and other precious metals, which lost almost 18
percent during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Falling oil prices depressed natural resources funds, which lost
almost 9 percent. Winners included communications company funds,
which rose 1.93 percent, and financial services funds, which gained
1.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market does not deserve all the blame. Some of the
poor performances of many funds may also have their roots in a
subtle shift in the goals of the fund companies. In the 1980s,
mutual fund giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and Putnam once went
after individual customers, with impressive performance as the
lure.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many appear to be more interested in not lagging behind
the market averages to an embarrassing degree. This more defensive
posture has much to do with how funds appeal to today's investors,
because the biggest growth area in the business is in managing
blocks of 401(k) retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   Since retirement money is at issue, 401(k) customers are viewed
as more risk-averse than investors who buy and sell using
discretionary money. Therefore, many funds are focusing on making
sure that performance does not fall way behind the appropriate
benchmark, instead of following the more risky strategy of seeking
to outperform the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These funds know that they are selling to a risk-averse market
and don't want to stick their necks out,'' said Alan Dworsky,
principal at the money management firm Mt. Auburn Management in
Boston, who runs some $600 million in institutional money. ``They
believe they have more to lose by significantly underperforming the
market than they have to gain'' by top returns.
</P>
<P>
   Dworsky, who was a fund manager at Putnam Investments for 17
years before starting his firm in 1984, also noted that the larger
the fund organization, the more likely that the investment
decisions would be dominated by committees, which usually gravitate
toward well-known stocks. This minimizes risk, but it also hurts
their funds' chances of doing much better than their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, conservative funds investing in both corporate
bonds and municipal issues did fairly well in the quarter.
Corporate bond funds, which include those investing in high-yield
bonds, rose 1.24 percent. Municipal bond funds advanced 1.33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fund managers may be in a more defensive posture
these days because so many of them have underperformed the broad
market indexes for years. Only one group of money managers has seen
its funds outperform their benchmark for the last five years: the
small-cap managers.
</P>
<P>
   But this may be because growth stocks have been the place to be
recently, and the Russell 2000 index is relatively easy to beat
because it is underweighted in such recent high-performance areas
as technology and health care. In addition, small-cap fund managers
have been expanding their horizons to include larger-cap issues,
which has probably helped their returns as well.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, this underperformance feeds on itself, making
managers less secure in their stock-picking and more likely to
follow the crowd. It also has sent investors fleeing to funds that
mirror the indexes, offered by Vanguard, Fidelity and others.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds now have $195 billion invested in them, up from
$56.7 billion in 1995. Although index funds account for only 6
percent of the $2 trillion investors have put to work in stock
funds domestically, that percentage is double what it was three
years ago. Morningstar reported that the best-selling fund so far
this year was the Vanguard Index 500 fund.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the money in the so-called closet index funds,
those run by managers interested in mirroring the S&AMP;P's returns but
not willing to own all the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500. These funds,
which own big-cap stocks, are also exceedingly popular among
investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to AMG Data Services, of the roughly $4 billion
investors are currently delivering to fund companies each week,
half goes into index funds or funds that invest in the same
big-capitalization stocks that populate the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   To give fund managers some credit, the disparity between their
performance and the index seems to be narrowing, probably as a
result of a slowing in the averages' bull runs through much of the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended May 31, for example, the S&AMP;P returned
30.67 percent. During that time, the average large-cap stock fund
with a growth and value blend, the best proxy for the S&AMP;P, returned
only 26.77 percent. That's a difference of almost 4 percentage
points, well above the 1 percent to 2 percent disparity during the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair with big stocks continued during the second
quarter in another measure: every week, investors put more money
into big-cap and index stock funds than they removed, according to
AMG Data Services. Contrast this with the up-and-down investor
interest in small-cap stock funds: in only six of the last 12 weeks
did investors put more money into small caps than they took out.
The rest of the time, investors in small-cap stock funds were net
sellers of these shares.
</P>
<P>
   Will the second quarter's dismal performance lead investors to
dump their funds? Probably not. Investors are famously unfocused on
their fund holdings. Committed to stocks for the long run, most
seem able to take a lot of pain without running for the door.
Losses of 1 percent to 2 percent of assets is not likely to be
enough to raise the ire of investors.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who find their funds lagging behind the market by
more than 2 percentage points should rethink their holdings,
especially in funds that charge fees and loads of more than 1
percent for the privilege of losing money. The Parnassus fund, for
example, which lost roughly 13.3 percent of net asset value during
the most recent quarter, charges a 3.5 percent front-end load.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Micro Cap B shares lost 9.7 percent in the most recent
quarter. The fund sports an expense ratio of 2.4 percent, a
descending back-end load starting at 4 percent if you sell within
two years of buying the fund, and a 1 percent 12b-1 fee.
</P>
<P>
   As long as fund managers continue to get beaten by stock indexes
in the performance game, investor ardor for index funds and those
that mimic their performance will continue. Indeed, there is a
feedback effect created by the rise of index funds and shadow
indexers.
</P>
<P>
   As the money pours into big-capitalization stock funds, the need
for liquidity in the stocks they buy rises as well. Funds with $2
million to $3 million to put in each stock holding cannot buy
shares in companies that are illiquid without moving these stocks'
prices.
</P>
<P>
   So these fund managers cannot buy anything but the tried and
true, very liquid stocks that dominate the S&AMP;P 500. This drives
those stocks' already high prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Will active managers ever again be able to beat the market
averages? Perhaps. But investors might not want to wish for such an
event. When asked under what circumstances mutual fund managers
might be able to outdo the market averages, Amy Arnott, editor of
the Morningstar survey said, ``It would be easier for active
managers to look a little better if the indexes were to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Indexes fall? Maybe middling investment performance by mutual
funds isn't so bad after all.

WIDE POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHIC GAPS SEPARATE PARTIES PLANS ON
HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Democrats and Republicans want to compromise
their differences on legislation to define patients' rights, they
will have to bridge a broad conceptual and political gap.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would establish far more protections for
consumers. But to do so, they would create vast new authority for
the federal government to regulate the operation of health
maintenance organizations and insurance companies. The government
would, for example, set standards for the quality of care,
including coverage of prescription drugs and the length of hospital
stays for mastectomy patients.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, follow their traditions. They say they trust
the market, abhor big government and want to avoid litigation. They
offer several proposals that have no parallel in the Democratic
bill. The Republicans would expand the use of medical savings
accounts, limit damage awards in medical malpractice suits and help
small businesses band together to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such differences, the Democratic bill, which is strongly
supported by President Clinton, and the Republican proposal, which
is still being translated into legislation, have a common core.
</P>
<P>
   Both would require coverage of emergency care whenever ``a
prudent lay person'' would consider it necessary. Both assure women
that they can go directly to obstetricians and gynecologists
without getting prior authorization or a referral. Both ban ``gag
rules,'' restricting what doctors can tell patients about treatment
options. Both require health plans to disclose certain information,
so consumers can compare costs, benefits and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would also establish procedures for patients to
appeal the denial of health services or payment by seeking review
from an independent panel of medical experts. Both require health
plans to keep medical records confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Both also say many consumers could, for an extra charge, buy
coverage that would allow them to use any doctor. Such patients
would not be confined to a list of physicians approved by their
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   But each bill also includes many provisions not found in the
other. For example, the Democratic bill would make it easier for
people to sue HMOs and employer-sponsored health plans, under state
law, for personal injury or wrongful death caused by the improper
denial of benefits. Patients could seek reimbursement for lost
wages, compensation for pain and suffering and punitive damages in
some cases.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican proposal, patients could obtain a more
limited type of relief in disputes over the denial of benefits.
They could go to court to recover the amount of the original claim,
plus lawyers' fees and court costs, and they could seek a court
order requiring their health plans to provide a particular benefit
or service. Health plans would have an incentive to provide
promised benefits in a timely way because they would be subject to
a penalty, perhaps $250, for each day they improperly withheld
care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and advocates for consumer groups prefer the Democratic
approach. ``HMOs should be held liable if they make medical
decisions, just as physicians are,'' said James H. Stacey, a
spokesman for the American Medical Association. But insurers and
HMOs adamantly oppose any expansion of their liability, saying it
would raise costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill would establish new protections for doctors,
nurses and other health care workers who report evidence of
substandard care to the government authorities. Labor unions that
represent hospital and nursing home employees have sought such
protections for whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic proposals would dismantle the
fundamental structure of managed care while their own proposals
would build confidence in it by guaranteeing adequate recourse for
patients who have disputes with their health plans. Conversely,
Democrats say the Republican demands for medical savings accounts
and limits on malpractice suits are ``poison pills'' that would
kill legislation to regulate managed care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Democratic bill appears to be far more prescriptive, but it
is impossible to be sure because details of the Republican bill are
not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of Democratic proposals not found in the
blueprint devised by House Republicans:
</P>
<P>
   _ A health plan must have ``a sufficient number, distribution
and variety'' of doctors to serve all its patients in a timely way.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an HMO does not have an ``appropriate specialist'' to treat
a patient with a serious or complex medical condition, it must
refer the patient to a specialist outside its network, at no extra
cost to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an HMO terminates a doctor's contract, it must continue
coverage for patients receiving ``a course of treatment'' from that
doctor, including pregnant women and people with terminal
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ A health plan must cover at least 48 hours of hospital care
for a mastectomy, and it must cover reconstructive breast surgery
after the operation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health plans and insurance companies must help pay the routine
costs of care for people in clinical trials and research studies if
they have serious illnesses for which no standard treatment is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a health plan or an insurance policy provides any coverage
of prescription drugs, and if it establishes a list of approved
medications, it must also pay for other drugs when they are
``medically indicated.'' Moreover, if a new drug has been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, insurers may not refuse to
cover it by contending that its use is ``investigational.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In delivering health care services, an HMO may not
discriminate against patients on the basis of race, religion, sex,
age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or genetic
information. This provision does not require insurers to offer
coverage to everyone who applies, nor does it affect the premiums
that may be charged.
</P>
<P>
   _ An HMO or an insurance company may not arbitrarily interfere
with or alter a doctor's decision about the ``manner or setting''
in which services are provided, if they are medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic bill, private health plans and insurers
would have to collect a wide range of data on the use of services,
the quality of care, mortality rates, customer satisfaction, the
number of grievances and the demographic characteristics of
patients. The government would prescribe a standard format, and the
secretary of health and human services would have access to all the
data collected.

   SERIAL-MERGERS (Undated) _ They are serial acquirers _ companies
that play Pac-Man by gobbling up other companies, paying for the
purchases with high-priced stock. It's a cycle that feeds
voraciously on itself: The more a company acquires, the higher the
stock price, fueling even more acquisitions. The buyers include
companies like Republic Industries and Nationsbank, Cendant and
Worldcom. By Reed Abelson. (Moved). Graphic &UR;  &LR; and Photo. &QL;

   BANKS-POOR-LOANS (subslug) (New York) _ In the past, bank

   MUTFUND-LATIN (Undated) _ Investors have punished Latin American
stocks this year, but many market analysts say the downturn is
strictly a case of guilt by association with Asia. By Mickey Meece.
(Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-LIFE-STYLE (Undated) _ When mutual fund companies
started pushing so-called life-style and life-cycle funds, they
seemed like sure-fire hits: single funds that were meant to
simplify the decision-making process for befuddled investors.
Essentially, these funds would plunk an investor into a portfolio
with a mix of stocks, bonds and cash tailor-made to his investing
time horizon, eliminating the need to concern himself with
complicated issues like risk or asset allocation. The problem is
that investors, by and large, haven't warmed up to the idea. By
Abby Schultz. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BONDS (Undated) _ Concerns about Asia's fractured
economic machine have caused investors _ especially those overseas
_ to pull money out of certain stock and bond markets and pour it
into United States Treasury bonds. So prices have risen and yields
_ which move in the opposite direction of prices _ have sunk to
30-year lows. By Sana Siwolop. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-QUARTER (Undated) _ It was a bitter spring quarter for
many a mutual fund manager, but it was a very sweet season for
others. How did some managers land at the top of the fund
performance lists? By Carole Gould. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-CLOSED-END (Undated) _ With closed-end funds developing
a reputation as a dysfunctional branch of the fund family tree,
shareholder activists have grown restive. That doesn't bother some
analysts, who feel that many such funds look like bargains as of
late. By Rick Gladstone. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BENCHMARKS (Undated) _ So, how's your portfolio doing?
Good question. The fact is that you won't have a clue if you
measure your mutual fund's performance against the wrong benchmark.
Doing so can lead to Godzilla-size mistakes, like holding onto
losers or selling winners. By Noelle Knox.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-VANGUARD (Undated _ To hear John J. Brennan tell it,
there's really nothing much afoot at the Vanguard Group, the giant
fund company he heads. Vanguard, for example, definitely does not
intend to join the rush to build a financial services conglomerate,
he said. By Edward Wyatt. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-DOMESTIC (Undated) _ With the stock market as hot as a
firecracker, pushing the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 index to a record
high, why aren't mutual fund holders cheering? Because it is no fun
to incur losses in your fund holdings while the indexes race ever
higher. By Gretchen Morgenson. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-IAI-BALANCED (Undated) _ The IAI Balanced fund has
proven to be the best performer in the quarter of all stocks funds
trcked by the New York Times and the best domestic hybrid fund over
all. By Kenneth N. Gilpin. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PORTFOLIOS (Undated) _ It has been one wild ride. Only
an unrepentant bull could have scooped up every dollar from the
red-hot stock market during the last five years as the Dow Jones
industrial average flirted with the 9,000 mark from the mid-3,000s.
Put simply, this time the theory of diversifying investments did
not work. Carefully balancing big stocks with smaller ones, or
American issues with international issues, was a waste of time.
Investors would have been better off sweeping their money into
Vanguard's S&AMP;P 500-stock index fund and going to the beach. By
Carole Gould. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   EARN
</P>
<P>
   EARN-MEDICAL-SAVINGS (Undated) _ An update on Medical Savings
Accounts, which started 18 months ago. A reinterview with some of
the people who signed up with high hopes. Not surprisingly, some
are quite disappointed. By Margaret O. Kirk. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EARN-ABSENTS (Undated) _ Looking at how different companies have
combatted the persistent problem of absenteeism among employees,
i.e., Continental Airlines gives away Ford Explorers for six
month's perfect attendance. By Susan J. Wells. (Moved). Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   EARN-INTERNS (Undated) _ There's a good deal to be said for
internships. Some say they give the intern a head start on a
permanent job. Then again, some interns, working for meager or no
wages, say they are a head start on slavery. By Lawrence Van
Gelder. (Moved).

   CAR-SMART-CORVETTE (Undated) _ No modern car on the American
road is more red-, white- and blue-blooded than the Chevrolet
Corvette. Introduced as a 1953 model, it was Americas first true,
mass-produced sportscar _ the United States' answer to the
pint-size roadsters that were being imported from Europe. And the
Corvette remains the only American sports car to stand the test of
time. A million-plus Corvettes have been built in more than four
decades, more than any other single sports car ever. By Michelle
Krebs. (Moved).
</P>

   ABOUT-CARS-CADILLAC (Undated) _ After decades in which Cadillac
represented the epitome of American luxury cars, it will start

 &HT;    Daytona and Pepsi 400 feels the heat
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The wildfires have transformed this city
and the baby powder and underwear in the middle of a sports bar are
among the many starkclues.
</P>
<P>
   The ash on cars and the masks on faces is more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi 400, the city's strongest summer lure and a $100
million economic infusion, was postponed Thursday as the fires
pressed closer and closer to Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of a bustling weekend, businesses tried to make due
in a city that, at times, looked like it was at the foot of a
volcano rather than the edge of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just kills us, but what can you do?'' said Armando
Deloera, general manager of Rio Bravo's Cantina, next to the
speedway. ``I really don't think anyone is worried about business.
We're just trying to feed as many firefighters and help as many
people as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners are still serving up huge amounts of food.
Bartenders keep serving drinks to customers lined up five-deep. And
Hooters waitresses still attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of catering to 150,000 or so race fans, businesses
are serving hundreds of firefighters who have battled the fires for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters sent its waitresses to fire stations delivering chicken
wings, while other restaurants converted to relief stations.
</P>
<P>
   Houligan's Sports Pub, about five miles from the front lines of
Volusia County's fires, has become the favorite spot for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cases of Gatorade and water, ice, food, underwear,
baby powder, eye drops and dozens of socks sit where beer bottles
and happy hour food usually are seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle sits Houligan's owner Walter Curtis. Curtis
jokingly acknowledges he didn't have much choice but to become a
Good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops came in Wednesday night and kicked everybody out,''
Curtis said. ``They evacuated the whole area, so what the hell else
was I going to do? I had an empty restaurant and a lot of people
who needed help, so it made sense. But, yeah, it kills a HUGE
weekend for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many people who have pitched in to help, one tourist
stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Loomis of Columbus, Ga. came to Ormond Beach four days ago
for a family reunion. Instead, he's become a reluctant celebrity, a
volunteer who organized a massive relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in two towns talk about him as they take breaks
from the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just one of those do-gooders saving the day,''
Loomis said. ``It keeps me off the street and out of trouble, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Others handled their ruined vacations differently. Greg and Dana
Cline of Columbia, Mo. arrived Monday with their two young sons,
hoping to see their first race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew it was like this, we never would have come,'' Dana
Cline said. ``It's been difficult, but we are going to go back to
safe homes, so it puts things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get rid of our tickets, because we're not
coming back,'' Greg said.
</P>
<P>
   That should be no problem. Several men lined Speedway Boulevard
Friday carrying ``I need tickets'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   It's seems scalpers survive any natural disaster.

 &HT;    Residents return home to surevy fire damage
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ Pete Knox, 62, walked as fast as he could down the
dirt road he had lived on since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys fought hard,'' he said as he rounded a bend and saw
his mobile home surrounded by charred forest. Some of the siding
was torn off, apparently by firefighters working to save his
property. In the back, a shed was destroyed. But across the street
lay what he had been afraid of. A chimney and the screen enclosure
for a pool were all that were left standing of his neighbor's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Without a firefighter in sight, a lonely fire chewed on what's
left of another neighbor's shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate them boys,'' Knox said. ``I'm going to buy 'em a
6 pack of beer, no a 12 pack. A whole damn truckload.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox was among the 9,000 people evacuated from northern Brevard
County Thursday night. Some were able to get passes to return for
two hours Friday morning, or like Knox, rode in with deputies.
</P>
<P>
   For all the devastation, the 45,000 acres burned in Brevard,
only about 30 of the 2,000 homes in the fire zone were destroyed by
late afternoon Friday. Another 20 were damaged to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reflect the efforts of 650 firefighters from around
the state and the country. While U.S. Forestry Service officers
worked on a way to stop the fires, local firefighters did nothing
but try to save homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One problem firefighters were not anticipating is septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several instances where fire trucks have crashed
through septic tanks and become stuck, immobile for 30 minutes or
even more,'' Brevard County Fire Chief Don Boykin said.
</P>
<P>
   Communication between the various agencies went moderately well.
Brevard deputies carry 800 megaherz radios, part of a statewide
system that is slowly being implemented, in part for disasters like
these.
</P>
<P>
   But very few fire departments are using the 800 mhz radios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has the same system and there aren't enough local
radios to go around,'' explained Palm Beach County Fire Rescue
Capt. Donnie Thompson. It didn't help that one of the towers in the
north end burned in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about to get overrun at one point yesterday and thank
God, that helicopter showed up and dumped water on us,'' he said.
``He was working in the area and he saw us out there getting into
trouble. We were about to get hurt and lose the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   He and several other Palm Beach County supervisors were manning
the command post Friday, sending out strike teams as soon as they
were rested enough to go back to the front. Yesterday that's where
he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in emergency services for 23 years and I can't
believe this,'' he said. ``I saw more fire yesterday than I have in
23 years.''

   PARIS _ Key U.S. and French officials vowed Friday to keep
pushing for a diplomatic solution to head off a wider war in
Kosovo, but agreed that chances for success in the violence-torn
Serbian province were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is intensifying its effort, but this issue
is going to be decided on the ground in Kosovo,'' said Richard
Holbrooke, nominated by President Clinton to be the U.S. delegate
to the United Nations and a special envoy to the Balkans.
Meanwhile, fighting between Serbian government forces and
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels continued.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke spoke Friday before leaving Paris for Belgrade for
another round of talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and the political leader of the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova,
whom U.S. and European diplomats regard as the key Albanian player
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Paris, Holbrooke said Western efforts to
press Milosevic into ordering heavily armed Serbian forces in the
province to stop attacking Albanian rebels were clouded by
uncertainty about who spoke for the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
has seized about 40 percent of the territory in the last couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal for the province, which enjoyed wide powers of
self-government within Serbia until Milosevic abolished autonomy in
1989, is independence, which no Western country supports.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he told that to rebel commanders he met near the
provincial capital of Pristina last week, and the principal U.S.
troubleshooter in the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, had a separate
meeting a week ago with two exile leaders claiming to speak for the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting did not establish that the people with whom he met
had authority or influence over the men with guns,'' Holbrooke said
Friday. ``How do you negotiate a cease-fire and a withdrawal of
forces when you don't know you are in contact with the people in
control?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who conferred with
Holbrooke for an hour Thursday on Western strategy for keeping the
fighting from spreading into Albania and Macedonia, said Friday,
``A catastrophe scenario is quite possible despite all our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vedrine said the threat of NATO air strikes against Serbia
had kept Milosevic from ordering a full-scale Serbian military
assault to retake rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials estimate that Serbia, which with Montenegro
makes up what remains of Yugoslavia, has 30,000 troops, 25,000
heavily armed police officers, dozens of anti-aircraft missile
batteries and heavy artillery and armor in the province, where at
least 90 percent of the population of about 2 million is ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we will resolve the dilemma,'' Vedrine said
at a breakfast with U.S. and British reporters. ``If Milosevic
orders a big operation, we cannot remain inactive.''
</P>
<P>
   France, a NATO ally, supported contingency planning ordered last
month by allied defense ministers to prepare for the use of
military force if necessary to stop the fighting in Kosovo, Vedrine
said. But the French believe that any action by the allies should
first be approved by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China, both permanent members of the Security Council
with the power to veto decisions there, are both opposed to outside
military intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine could not say Friday what France would do if Serbia
unleashed a full-scale attack and the Russians vetoed a Security
Council resolution authorizing NATO to act. United States officials
have said that United Nations authorization would be desirable, but
they do not think it is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has worked with the United States, Britain, France, Italy
and Germany in the so-called contact group of nations monitoring
the cease-fire that Holbrooke brokered in Bosnia in 1995, and has
urged Milosevic to pull back in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to use force, and we may, and if we went in without
United Nations authority, we would not be in a position to insist
that Russia, China, Nigeria, or other countries cannot use force
without United Nations authorization,'' Vedrine said. But he added
that he did not think that Russia or China had said their last
words yet on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine and other French officials said they had pushed allied
military planners in Brussels to come up with as wide a range of
military options as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only option was to bomb strategic Serbian military and
communications sites throughout the country, the next day the
Kosovo Liberation Army could declare Kosovo a sovereign republic,
Albania could join in supporting it, and the war could spread to
Macedonia and beyond,'' Vedrine said. ``The use of force could
provoke exactly the opposite of the desired result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no simple military option we haven't taken simply
because we were afraid to do so,'' Vedrine insisted.

DEFIANT FRANCE WILL LET BIRD HUNTERS BLAST AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Bashing those meddling European bureaucrats in Brussels,
Belgium, long a favorite pastime in Britain, is now in season in
France, where President Jacques Chirac signed into law Thursday a
measure defying a Europe-wide regulation that bans the hunting of
migratory birds during the nesting period.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Margaret Thatcher when she was Britain's prime minister,
Chirac took little apparent pleasure in defying Brussels, where the
bureaucracy has already threatened legal action that could end in a
European Court of Justice fine against France of about $114,000 for
every day it violates the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president desires coordination between the government and
the European Commission to find a solution to this affair,'' his
office said after announcing that Chirac had signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Passed by the French Legislature last month over only cursory
resistance by the Socialist-led government, the law allows hunters
to fire away at waterfowl up to a month beyond the end of the
season next Jan. 31, as prescribed since 1979 in a Europe-wide
directive.
</P>
<P>
   That directive was approved by French elected officials at the
time, according to Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, a member
of the Greens party who described herself as furious and insulted
by the behavior of her legislative colleagues when they raised
their guns in Parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
   The directive, adopted unanimously, was intended to protect
birds during the reproductive cycle. International lawyers say
European law supersedes any national legislation that contradicts
it, supposedly binding all 15 member states of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   France is usually a pillar of that union, except occasionally
when disgruntled farmers and other rural denizens rise up against
regulations that tell them how much grain they can grow and how big
tomatoes and cucumbers should be.
</P>
<P>
   The French heartland has become increasingly insurgent about the
hunting rules, and earlier this year 800,000 French hunters signed
a petition to the European Parliament, asking for a modification of
the regulations. A million petitioners from other countries joined
in the protest, and Alessandro Fontana, a member of the European
Parliament's commission on petitions, told the daily Le Figaro last
month that the directive might be changed next fall if French
hunters would just be patient and go through European channels.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing an easy target, French legislators of every party except
Mrs. Voynet's Greens vowed to defy Brussels and let French hunters
keep blasting.
</P>
<P>
   France has two months to settle the conflict out of court with
the European Commission, which can otherwise go to the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg and ask it to find France in
violation of its treaty obligations.

GUMP, MIZE, URESTI, WAITE HAVE OUTSTANDING DAY AT GHO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ As Stewart Cink surveyed the scoreboard after
Friday's second round of the Greater Hartford Open at the TPC at
River Highlands, he compared this year to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night-and-day difference,'' said Cink. The rain and wind
came early and now the course is soft and the winds died down.
These are perfect scoring conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the field was stacked with a host of big names, the
players who showed up ripped the place apart in Friday's sunny and
soft conditions. Scott Gump showed the way by equaling Billy
Andrade's course record with a 62. Larry Mize checked in a 63 and
Omar Uresti and Grant Waite had 64s. There were 77 rounds in the
60s and 76 players bettered par 70. The cut was 139, matching the
low numbers of the year (Hawaii, Byron Nelson). Translated, you had
to have broken par for the first two rounds to play today's third
round here in the suburbs of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Gump wound up leading with minus-10 figures of 62_130 to take a
one-shot lead over Omar Uristi (64) and Mize. Waite, Cink (65) and
Doug Tewell (66) trailed at 132. Pete Morgan, the Cape Cod native
son who was a Monday qualifier and led after the first round with a
64, hung on to easily make the cut with 71_135. Casey Martin,
playing in his first PGA Tour event after getting an injunction to
ride in a cart, took an 8 on the 13th hole and missed the cut with
73_144.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who made the cut at the US Open at San Francisco's
Olympic Club and finished tied for 23d, plans to play Quad Cities
next week but is undecided beyond that. ``I played poorly,'' said
Martin. ``I wish I wouldn't have played like I did. It was fun. The
people are great. They went out of their way to treat me well and
encourage me. I didn't hit it well at all. It's pretty much what I
expected. It's hard, but if you uplay well you can score. I'm not
sure what I'll take out of here. Give me time on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump, who has played in 18 PGA Tour events this year but whose
best finish was a tie for 19th in the BellSouth Classic, started on
the 10th tee and birdied the 12th (9-iron, 15 feet), 13th (wedge, 3
feet), 15th (sand wedge, 15 feet), 17th (7-iron, 20 feet), and
18th, when he watched a 210-yard 4-wood out of a fairway bunker
bounce out of trouble to four feet of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bonus,'' said Gump. ``It just hit left of the
bunker, rolled up to four feet. I wasn't planning on that one.''
</P>
<P>
   After that he birdied the 2d (7-iron, 20 feet), 3d (pitching
wedge, 4 feet) and 8th (5-iron, 8 feet) to shoot his 62 and match
Andrade's score in the third round three years ago. ``I just wanted
to keep it going,'' said Gump. ``It was fun. I knew if I was seven
under after 11, I had a chance to shoot 59. You don't get those
opportunities too often. That was in my mind. You never know. I may
get lucky, make a couple of putts, and boom.'' He was happy to take
his 62 and the lead and get into the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Uresti, who led Bay Hill going into the final round a year ago,
was actually in minus-11 figures before bogeys on the 15th and 16th
holes brought him down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little wait on the 15th tee,'' said Uresti. ``I
started thinking about everything and was getting anxious and a
little nervous. I just got a little quick with my tee shot and hit
into the right rough. I got a little quick on the next hole with a
7-iron, ended on the right front of the green and didn't hit my
first putt hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mize, whose most famous moment came when he holed out a shot on
the second hole to beat Greg Norman in the Masters 11 years ago,
had front and back nines of 31-32. ``It was a great day to play
golf,'' he said. ``I'm happy with it. I haven't really gotten
myself in this poisition, so that's what exciting about it. You
can't win a golf tournament until you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, who grew up in Harwich, made his first cut in his fourth
PGA Tour event at age 35. Even though his 64 led the tournament
after the first round, he said he felt Friday's round, which
included one birdie and two bogeys, was solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm happier with this round,'' said Morgan. ``I think
the pressure's off now.'' He had trouble sleeping Thursday night.
``I never thought about it until somebody brought it up in the
pressroom. Now I just want to do the best I can.''

HENDRICKSON DELIVERS ON CUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy defender Ezra Hendrickson
could have just as easily chosen cricket instead of soccer as his
sport of choice. While he grew up on the tiny island of St. Vincent
&AMP; The Grenedines in the West Indies, cricket was the more popular.
But Hendrickson stuck with soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone played cricket; it was all over the place,''
Hendrickson said. ``And I was a pretty good batsman too, but in
grammar school I chose soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson's parents separated when he was 13 and he moved with
his father to Indiana. The only cricket anyone heard of there, they
stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basketball and basketball,'' Hendrickson said of
Kokomo, Ind. ``And it was cold, very cold.''
</P>
<P>
   His MLS career was almost over before it began. Hendrickson
wasn't selected in the inaugural MLS draft in 1996. He went to the
A-League, where he was named defensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, New York/New Jersey of MLS made him a first-round draft
pick, but Hendrickson only started four games and was put on
waivers last August. Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano quickly picked
him up.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 games with the Galaxy this season, Hendrickson has earned
the reputation as the best attacking defender in MLS. He has netted
five goals with six assists since he became a regular starter March
28 for the injured Paul Caligiuri.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a season of redemption for Hendrickson. Throughout
his career, coaches have dwelled upon his awkward running style and
lanky 6-foot-3 frame and have failed to appreciate the soccer
player underneath. But given a chance, he's delivered at every
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely have a different look of what a soccer player
should look like, but I never pay much attention to that,''
Hendrickson said. ``Coaches can say what they want, but if you can
play the game, that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, known for his ability to spot talent, took criticism
when he picked Hendrickson off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see how he can be dismissed at first sight,'' Zambrano
said. ``And I had my doubts and share of critics when I picked him,
but I said to myself, `In time, this guy will come around.' You
know, he doesn't look like a player or run like a player, but he is
a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson's deceptive quickness allows him to attack up the
flanks, where he has scored more MLS points (16) than any defender
in the league. He also has incredible stamina to hurry back on
defense. He's had such an impact that Zambrano will have a big
decision to make with Caligiuri coming off the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson's minor ligament strain in his right foot allowed
Caligiuri to start last Saturday against San Jose, where Caligiuri
scored a goal in a 2-1 victory. But once Hendrickson's healthy
again, he says he's going to continue to make Zambrano's decision a
tough one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said when I was on the bench, that when I got my
chance, I was going to make it hard for Octavio to put me back
there,'' Hendrickson said. ``I think I've done that and I'm going
to continue to make it a hard choice for him to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, not sure who will be the regular starter when both are
healthy, says he will weigh his options and do what's best for the
team. He could start both. Zambrano does agree, however, that
Hendrickson should be given a spot in the MLS All-Star game, Aug.
2, in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he said. `C'mon, show me a defender that
has done what he has done? I'm surprised he hasn't gotten player of
the week yet because he's had marvelous matches back to back.''

HOW FLORIDA'S WILDFIRES DEVELOPED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also FLA-FIRES, as well as extensive coverage of the
Florida wild fires from Cox) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida's troubles with weather and wildfires in June and July
actually began last winter.
</P>
<P>
   While El Nino was grabbing center stage as a prime culprit in
producing tornadoes in Florida in February, the winter there _ as
in the rest of the country _ shaped up less obviously and more
quietly as unusually wet and warm, a condition that also was
probably due to El Nino. Bushes and grass grew faster than usual
and became thicker, meteorologists say, producing abundant fuel for
any fires that might start.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late spring and early summer, the moisture tailed off
but the warmth remained. Aloft, two on-again, off-again climatic
features joined forces to dry out the state. First the jet stream,
the high-altitude, west-to-east river of strong wind that marks the
boundary between masses of cold polar air and warm tropical ones,
was stronger than normal in the spring. And its path was farther
south than usual.
</P>
<P>
   This had the effect of suppressing rainfall in northern and
central Florida. In the spring, the sun heats Florida's land mass
more than the surrounding water. This creates a pattern of
relatively low-level air circulation in which the heated earth
causes air to rise over the land and sink over the water. With lots
of moisture in the air, this pattern creates thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   This year that arrangement was thrown off kilter by the strong
jet-stream winds that ordinarily would not be present, said Fred
Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. The
result was a suppression of storms and rain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a persistent high-pressure system, as
sometimes happens in the atmosphere, lodged stubbornly in position
over Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. This also suppressed the
formation of storms.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these large-scale circulation patterns were influenced
by the aftereffects of El Nino is unclear. Even though the big pool
of warm water in the eastern South Pacific that defines El Nino has
disappeared, Gadomski said, it takes time for the climate system to
respond. So it is a ``reasonable hypothesis'' that the lingering
effects of El Nino could have had something to do with the unusual
circulation pattern, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, northern and central Florida have had only a
fraction of their normal precipitation this spring and early
summer. The abnormally lush growth of vegetation dried out,
providing abundant tinder. Any spark _ a match, a campfire, a
deliberately set blaze, a relatively rare lightning strike _ might
have set it afire.
</P>
<P>
   With less moisture on the land, less of the sun's energy has
been devoted to evaporating moisture, and more has gone into
heating the earth. Result: record high temperatures, which
intensify the drought even further. In June, Melbourne, Fla., had
more than 20 days with temperatures higher than 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of this occurring is less than one in 1,000,''
said David Easterling, a climate scientist at the National Climatic
Data Center, a federal installation in Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that something new is going on? Computer models
suggest that as the earth's atmosphere warms, as it has been for
about a century, its water cycle should become more intense: Heavy
rainstorms become more common, while at the other end of the
continuum droughts become worse.
</P>
<P>
   The center has gathered evidence that heavy rains are indeed
becoming more common. But ``on the dry end, there is none that I
know of,'' said Robert Quayle of the climatic data center.

FLORIDA WILDFIRES WORSEN

<P>
   PALM COAST, Fla. _ Fed by bountiful, bone-dry brush, Florida's
worst wildfires this century continued a merciless march through
this state Friday, forcing 30,000 people from one coastal county
into frantic flight down Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the fingers of several blazes in coastal Flagler
County could unite into a powerful _ and potentially deadly _ fist
of fire, state emergency managers ordered a countywide evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   That brought to 70,000 the number of Floridians who have been
chased from their homes during a two-day assault on the wind-blown
east coast from Jacksonville to Cape Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish we knew when this was going to be over,'' said Richard
Wieser, a Flagler County emergency management spokesman. ``Nature's
course is that this fire will continue to build.''
</P>
<P>
   As they snaked their way along jammed evacuation routes, many
residents got their first hard look at what the wildfires had
wrought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never looked like this on television,'' said Maria
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who fled the flames described a chaotic scene as
thousands of people loaded vehicles with possessions ranging from
furniture and computers to clothing and books. One man stuffed a
deer head into his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was complete chaos,'' said Palm Beach resident
Jeff Bardy, who left his home Friday morning. ``People were getting
no information or bad information. People were panicking and there
was nobody on the scene with any information. You've got to know
when it's time to get out, and it was time to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Portions of Interstate 95, the main north-south highway on the
Atlantic Coast, remained closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But by last night, officials said they were hoping an unexpected
sea breeze would prevent diverse fires in Flagler County from
converging.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Governor Lawton Chiles said: ``It doesn't look like we're
going to get any relief any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, the state capital, Federal Emergency Management
Agency Director James Lee Witt implored residents to heed
evacuation orders _ some shouted from police bullhorns _ to prevent
the fire from growing from a multimillion-dollar catastrophe into a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do everything we can to help you rebuild,'' said Witt,
who announced millions more in federal disaster aid. ``The most
important thing is not to get killed or injured. We can help
rebuild, but we can't help replace a life.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene in central Florida, north of the Kennedy Space Center
and east of Disney World, where Mickey Mouse's parade was
unaffected, was nothing less than surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Gray smoke blocked out the sun. Ashes drifted slowly from the
skies. Screaming sirens drowned out sidewalk conversation.
Temperatures hovered near 100 degrees Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night it looks like hell,'' said Jerry Kiser, 51, who has
been forced from a home he believes has survived the flames.
``During the day, it sounds like a war zone. It's just terrifying
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Smith said he grabbed his little boy's fire truck, his
infant daughter's toy carousel, and some clothes when the call came
for his family of five to evacuate their mobile home in Mims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've got is back there. We lose that stuff and we
lose everything. There's no way we can afford to replace it,'' said
Smith, who has been sleeping on the cot of a Red Cross shelter.
``We moved here five months ago from Missouri and we're going back.
We kind of lost hope when all this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 4,000 firefighters battling the 1,900 blazes, which have
blackened more than 500 square miles and destroyed more than 150
homes since late May, hope for rain and relief is what cushions a
grueling regimen at the fire line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of flames. A lot of smoke. Visibility is real
poor. The heat's bad. You get tired real quick,'' said Andrew
Schulte, a 21-year-old firefighter from Micco, who has been working
18-hour-a-day shifts. ``The fire's going every place. We've been
working for days and days and days, and we can't stop it. We think
we got a hold on it and it goes someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Banfield, 38, a Palm Bay firefighter, sat exhausted in the
cab of his pumper truck Friday afternoon, dripping sweat and
visibly exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting a losing battle here. We can't seem to beat
it,'' he said. ``But this state is my home. And I'm going to defend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schulte and Banfield prepared to take another shift, federal
officials nearby were plotting how to dampen the fire's power by
air, directing a fleet of helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft,
imploring the pilots under their command to make safety their
watchword.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to play catch up on the old fires, and the new
ones keep starting up and we just don't have the resources,'' said
Ryan Curl of the federal Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to extinguish these fires, we're going to need a
major rain event,'' he said. ``The brush is so dry and so plentiful
that within a few hours after we get to them, they're right back to
where they were when we started _ and at full intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   By early last night, a steady rainfall began in evacuated
Flagler County _ welcome relief where four fires were raging and
officials were hoping the rain would prevent them from becoming a
wall of flames.
</P>
<P>
   But even the rainfall that residents have been praying for for
days is not without its danger. Meteorologists said lightning
strikes were possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we have a thunderstorm, it's like little fingers
walking across the carpet,'' said Mary Verry of the US Forest
Service. ``You can just see the fires just flaring up all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In Flagler County, the evacuation order sparked anger and
bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Don Pell, 70, said he was forced to evacuate Thursday night only
to return to his home Friday as fire crews were pulling away. His
home and the home behind it were still standing, but they were the
only whole structures left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire department just put out the big fires and took off,''
Pell said. ``There were still plenty of small fires and they left
them for me to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Using three garden hoses, Pell kept the resurgent fires off the
two properties for four hours. When he was finished, his and his
neighbor's lawns looked like nearly perfect postage stamps of green
among the smoldering black ruins of the other lots on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't talked my way back in here, there wouldn't have
been anything standing in this neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Connor, a 12-year resident and former New York City
firefighter, said: ``If Flagler County was some little
oil-producing country, they'd have the Marines, the Army. They'd
have everybody here. Where's the Army?''

   SWEEPING PRIVATIZATION ANNOUNCED IN SOUTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   Looking for expedient ways to raise cash, the South Korean
government began a far-reaching effort to privatize large
industries, most notably the giant Pohang Iron and Steel Corp., the
world's second-biggest steelmaker behind Nippon Steel of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The government's shares in the steelmaker and four other
state-controlled companies and their subsidiaries are to go on sale
immediately. Six other companies will be privatized over a
four-year period. South Korea hopes to reap $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   SHELL WITHDRAWS FROM RUSSIA BID
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch Shell said it was quitting a joint bid for Rosneft,
Russia's last state-owned oil company, because low oil prices would
limit returns from the project it was expected to finance. Shell,
the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, also attributed
the decision to financial turmoil in Russia that has created acute
problems for its two Russian partners in the bid, Lukoil and
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, the new head of Russia's State Tax Service, has
a difficult task in a country where tax avoidance is a pastime. But
Fyodorov has embraced the challenge, going after the delinquent
Gazprom gas monopoly and even raiding warehouses of deadbeat vodka
distillers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM RETREAT IN LATIN AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it would no longer make computer engineering deals with
Latin American governments. The change, disclosed by an IBM
executive, comes against a backdrop of a bribery investigation in
Argentina that has implicated some former IBM officials.
</P>
<P>
   VW HAS ROLLS, MAYBE NOT ITS NAME
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen completed its purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars but
may be missing one of the most important parts of the deal _ the
legendary Rolls brand name. Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet engine maker,
says it still retains control of the name and VW has no right to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ODD EFFECT OF MEDICARE RULES
</P>
<P>
   The government took a big step this week to make the business of
caring for elderly patients less lucrative, dealing a setback to
hospitals, some nursing homes and home care services. But oddly,
under new cost-reduction rules that took effect July 1, Medicare
patients are likely to spend more days, not fewer, in nursing homes
and beds for acute care in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. MARKETS CLOSED

   All financial and commodities markets in the United States were
closed on Friday in observance of the Fourth of July holiday. Most

 &HT;    Sampras, Ivanisevic finally arrive
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It was whap, thwack, boom on Centre Court
at Wimbledon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the points went quickly on the grass of the All
England Club, the matches stretched for hours before No.1 seed Pete
Sampras and No.14 Goran Ivanisevic each won and secured spots in
Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras took 2 hours, 24 minutes to defeat Britain's beloved Tim
Henman 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. But Ivanisevic needed 3 hours, 18
minutes to upset No.9 Richard Krajicek 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (5-7),
15-13.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic had two chances to win at 5-4 in the fourth set. But
he lost that game after both he and Krajicek thought Ivanisevic had
served an ace and joked when the umpire called a let because it had
tipped the net. ``He was already, at 40-15, laughing at the
match,'' said three-time winner and BBC commentator Boris Becker.
``Krajicek knows it isn't over yet. I can't believe it. Terrible
move. Now the whole match could change.''
</P>
<P>
   The former king of Centre Court was accurate. The fourth set
went to a tiebreaker, which Krajicek won on his third chance.
Krajicek's service return was off all day, but both his serve and
return improved in the final two sets.
</P>
<P>
   He served 42 aces in the match _ four off Ivanisevic's record _
with 23 in the fifth set. Ivanisevic, long called the best male
player never to win a major, hit just 14.
</P>
<P>
   But Krajicek was just as surprised as all the fans waiting to
watch Henman that he remained on the court to earn his first lead
in the fifth set, although it only lasted a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already was walking to the net,'' Krajicek said. ``I didn't
hear the net cord at 40-15, so I thought the match was over. It was
a strange feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set was a monotonous duel, with the players trading
service breaks in the fifth and sixth games and then not seeing
another break point until 15-40 in the 28th game. For the duration,
they exchanged aces and only a handful of points with more than
three hits before the point ended.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek finally put a backhand into the net to lose 15-13 after
an hour and 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, ranked an unusually low 25, knelt to the grass in
disbelief, then tossed his racket, bandanna and two towels into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means a lot because a lot of people say, `He's gone. He's
never going to be back,' and you have two ears and you have to
listen all the time,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I think it's time to
change on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a long way from Sunday late in the fourth set. He had
just blown two shots at winning and, as Becker put it, ``His
strongest point was never his concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek knew he still could win it because Ivanisevic has a
reputation for becoming destracted and destroying himself with his
temper, then jumping back alive at unexpected times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Goran,'' Krajicek said. ``The only thing predictable
about him is he's unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic did double fault 16 times and struggled with his
first serve throughout. But his volleying was strong and he took
advantage of his chances. Plus, he didn't melt into distraction or
personal aggravation. He wasn't even tempted to hurl a racket to
the ground or yell profanities in Croatian at himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange, you know,'' he said. ``But I (was thinking),
if I lose it for just a second, I will lose the match. I don't
think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set.''
</P>
<P>
   He will play Sunday in his third Wimbledon and Grand Slam final.
He is seeking his first title against a man who already owns 10 and
needs one now to redeem a flagging year.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek doesn't think Ivanisevic is up to beating Sampras, who
played a nearly error-free, intense match with Henman.
</P>
<P>
   Brits filled nearly every seat on Centre Court, wearing
patriotic hats and waving Union Jack and St. George's Cross flags
of all sizes. They went wild when he won the first point of the
match but had little to say again until he won the second set and
played a strong third.
</P>
<P>
   ``(At) 6-5, I raised my level just a little bit, hit some good
shots, and that was really the key to the match,'' said Sampras,
who is seeking to tie Bjorn Borg's modern-day Wimbledon title
record of five.
</P>
<P>
   Henman was disappointed, both for himself and for disappointing
a nation that believes it suffered athletic disaster this week in
World Cup soccer and was hoping Henman could soothe the agony.
</P>
<P>
   But his fans appreciated the high level of tennis he played, and
some were even surprised he did so well. Sampras had nothing but
praise for his friend and frequent practice partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very solid player and will eventually win this
tournament,'' said Sampras, who called the match one of his best of
the year. He showed more emotion than usual, yelling several times,
arguing calls and even tossing a cracked racket over his shoulder
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very intense,'' he said. ``I felt I was playing Tim and
the crowd, so obviously I was going to show a little more emotion
than usual.''

 &HT;    Novotna hoping `third time lucky'
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Only the English could so adore as
disastrous a loser as Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Novotna is a loser, but here at Wimbledon, the finalist
today lost in royally English fashion five years ago. She was
leading 4-1, and a point from 5-1, in the third set against Steffi
Graf.
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna looked around, noticed she was about to win and
nearly stopped breathing with fear. She lost 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 6-4
and sobbed on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she gets her third chance to win a Grand Slam _ and make
good on what the Duchess told her when she lost to Martina Hingis
last year: ``Third time lucky.'' Novotna meets 16th seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France in the oldest final since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   And England wants Novotna to win the title almost as much as
they wanted Brit Tim Henman to triumph on the men's side.
</P>
<P>
   They love Novotna because she lost the way England so often
loses: after a big lead, clearly the better competitor, in a manner
that makes fans want to wail.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist for The Times of London explained it: ``We simply
cannot help loving anyone who has fouled up in so spectacular a
fashion. We can all identify with self-created disaster, and there
is nothing in life so gorgeous as the thought that wrongs can
somehow be put right.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna didn't discuss her 1993 collapse the day she beat Hingis
to reach the final, but she did earlier in the tournament. She
would be satisfied, she said, if not happy, to end her career
without a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   She is relaxed about tennis and has found a way to balance hard
work with fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on the court you can just see her always laughing,''
said Lindsay Davenport, who used to play doubles with Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   Today, against an opponent who has never played a Grand Slam
final and won just four singles titles in 14 years on tour, Novotna
expects a difficult match.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat made a stunning comeback against Natasha Zvereva in the
semifinals and upset second seed Lindsay Davenport in the
quarterfinals. Despite her low ranking and lack of experience in
this situation, she has had a calm confidence this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I said my goal is Wimbledon and I want to make
it,'' Tauziat said.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna doesn't want the moon, just another good cry _ this one
for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Graf will play U.S. Open: Five-time U.S. Open champion Steffi
Graf has signed up to play the tournament again this year. Graf has
missed most of the past year with a series of injuries, and despite
speculation that she would retire after Wimbledon, Graf now sounds
determined to complete her career on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   Lobs: Venus and Serena Williams both won again in their mixed
doubles matches, putting both in the semifinals. A win today for
the Palm Beach County sisters would put them in Sunday's final
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams and Justin Gimelstob defeated top seeds Leander
Paes and Larisa Neiland 6-3, 6-4, and will face fifth seeds Mahesh
Bhupathi and Mirjana Lucic, while Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi
defeated unseeded Sandon Stolle and Kristien Kunce 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.
They will play second seeds Paul Haarhuis and Caroline Vis.

<P>
   TAMAQUA, Pa. _ The last words of the condemned Irishmen had to
compete with a nearby karaoke singer, so the men on the makeshift
gallows raised their voices for the crowd below as they professed
their innocence or asked for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dangling nooses would be placed around a neck on
this day, though. This was Tamaqua's summer festival, and the six
men were Molly Maguire re-enactors.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a century of secrecy surrounding the Molly
Maguires, the violent confederacy of Irish-American mine workers
has become a tourist attraction in the hard coal region of
northeastern Pennsylvania. But as the region's annual Molly Maguire
Weekend encourages a new openness about this sensitive episode, it
also underlines the delicacy of recreating history where
descendants of the participants still live, memories are long and
pain runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romanticization of this era could get out of hand,'' John
Bugbee of Glen Rock, Pa., warned at a weekend discussion at Molly's
Pub in Locust Gap. ``My concern is that I don't want Frank Langdon
to be forgotten in all this'' _ Langdon being not only the mine
official whose murder in 1862 is listed as the first by the Molly
Maguires, but also Bugbee's great-great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bugbee moved off for a quiet word with Alice Wayne of
Girardville, the 93-year-old granddaughter of John Kehoe, the man
hanged for the Langdon murder.
</P>
<P>
   From 1862 to 1875, Irish-American militants used ``Molly
Maguire'' _ the name of a mythical woman who led resistance to
landlords during the Irish potato famine _ as a nom de guerre as
they fought other ethnic gangs and the growing power of coal
companies. The violence ended only after dozens of men had been
murdered or executed and labor activity had been crushed by troops,
private police and spies.
</P>
<P>
   Given that dark history, the Schuylkill County Visitors Bureau
has tread carefully in staging Molly Maguire events that attract
tourists ranging from Molly Maguire aficionados to fans of Arthur
Conan Doyle, who based his Sherlock Holmes novel ``The Valley of
Fear'' on events here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sensitive to the fact that there are descendants,''
said Mark Major, director of the visitors bureau. ``We don't want
it to be painful.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in Colonial Williamsburg, where a mock slave auction drew
protests in 1994, the re-enactments have caused pangs among some
who live in the shadow of the scarred anthracite hills.
</P>
<P>
   This year, plans to re-enact an 1874 riot in Mahanoy City that
led to several shootings were canceled because of objections from
current members of the two fire companies involved in the riot.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the first re-enactments _ of John Kehoe's trial, put
on by the Schuylkill County Bar Association and the County
Historical Society in 1994 _ drew anonymous phone threats in
addition to 400 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as more than 100 Molly buffs, historians and descendants of
men on both sides of the conflict gathered in June for events
ranging from the theatrical to the academic, the most remarkable
feature of the weekend was the willingness to talk about a subject
that until recently was still largely discussed in whispers, if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people turned out for a walking tour of Mahanoy City, site
of the clash between the Irish-American members of the Humane Fire
Company and the English, Welsh and German members of the Citizens
Fire Company.
</P>
<P>
   Among the walkers was George Maloney of Pittsburgh, who is
tracing a family link to Peter McManus, hanged in 1879 for the
killing of a mine watchman. Maloney recalled the silence that
enveloped the Mollies when he was growing up in the coal region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taboo,'' he said. ``Nobody talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The taboo was nowhere in evidence at Molly's Pub, where 100
traded information and opinions. They included Patrick Campbell,
whose 1992 account of the trial and hanging of a great-uncle, ``A
Molly Maguire Story'' (Templecrone Press), helped open discussion
of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a native of Ireland, likened attitudes about the
Mollies to reticence about the potato famine. ``It was rooted in
people's idea of what was respectable,'' he said. ``It was not
respectable to die of hunger. The same is true of the Molly
Maguires. Murder is murder, unless it's political. They'll talk
about it now because the American-Irish are more self-confident.''
</P>
<P>
   But down the valley in the Girardville tavern that John Kehoe
once ran, his great-grandson and the tavern's current proprietor,
Joseph Wayne, had little time for Molly Maguire Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to re-enact hangings,'' said Wayne, who helped
secure a pardon for his great-grandfather in 1979. ``How do you do
that tastefully?''

<P>
   Ivanisevic displays &QL; 
new will to prevail
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ They came to see Tim play Pete. But Goran and
Richard had their own agenda. They held the court, and they weren't
going to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   Let 'em wait, Goran grunted.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Richard growled. Let 'em wait.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Ivanisevic vs. Richard Krajicek constituted the undercard
at Wimbledon on Friday, yet somebody forgot to pull the plug on
them. It was, after all, a semifinal, so you couldn't call the
fight a draw and schedule a rematch. There had to be a resolution,
and drawing straws wasn't an option.
</P>
<P>
   Like two brutes in a tough-guy competition, tennis' two biggest
servers pounded on each other for 3{ hours and some 71 games, plus
a tiebreaker. If there is such a thing as bare-knuckles,
last-man-standing tennis, that's what the stubborn Croat and the
dogged Dutchman played as the mood of the Tim Henman-crazed crowd
changed from polite interest to toe-tapping impatience to abject
boredom to, ultimately, morbid fascination.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't help themselves. This was great theater, at once
Shakespearean and absurd. In short, a typical Goran production.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we thought they might play forever, Krajicek blinked,
and, like that, he was out 15-13 in the fifth. As exhausted as the
participants, we were left to wonder if anybody has blasted 23 aces
in a set _ and lost it. That would be Krajicek's
stranger-than-fiction fate.
</P>
<P>
   Having rallied from two sets down, the 1996 Wimbledon champion
got a break ahead in the fifth set, then turned the heat up on
Ivanisevic, who has, of late, been inclined to get out of the
kitchen. Hadn't he lost four first-round matches in his past five
Grand Slam starts and stalled in the second round of the other?
</P>
<P>
   Unquestioned physical potential
</P>
<P>
   Not here, though. Ivanisevic has, somewhat amazingly, never won
Wimbledon, but he realizes he should have numerous times and he
knows he still can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If,'' as he said the other day, ``I don't lose my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Or his serve. The Ivanisevic serve is tennis' most feared
weapon, the game's one doomsday stroke. If Goran had a game equal
to his serve, he would be a bigger, better, faster, stronger cross
between Rod Laver and John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   And we wouldn't talk about the Sampras quest to surpass Roy
Emerson as the grandest of all Slammers. No, Goran could be the guy
with one foot in the history book.
</P>
<P>
   But stuff happens to Ivanisevic that never seems to happen to
Pete. He has what he calls ``blackouts,'' in which his touch and
strategy abandon him. And although he denied it, he appeared to
have one at 5-3, 40-15 _ double match point _ in the fourth set.
After 1 hour, 48 minutes, a third Wimbledon final was in his grasp
when he smacked a serve most of us, Krajicek included, believed to
be an ace.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cyclops machine let loose with a beep _ a let! _ and
another 80 draining minutes later, he would be out there still,
trading roundhouse punches with a brute who packs practically the
same wallop he does. They finished 1-2 in the tour's ace standings
last year. Friday, they would smack 70 between them. Oddly,
Ivanisevic wouldn't win that battle. He was buried 42-28.
</P>
<P>
   But he would win the war. This was a new wrinkle for him, one
that perhaps announces a change in Ivanisevic's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
he said. ``Everybody was thinking, `Maybe it's going to be 6-2,
maybe 6-3. He's gone; he's going to lose it.' But I was just very
mentally strong today. Never was I like this in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying in control
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start muttering in Croatian. He didn't fling his
rackets around or pull out his hair. He stayed calm. Somewhat
amazingly, given his history of buckling under pressure, he kept
his brain tuned in to the business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I wait for the one moment when I will explode,'' he
said. ``But today, what can I say? I just changed. I just say, `OK,
now you're going to be cool. You're going to keep your mind on what
you have to do, and you are going to win it.'''
</P>
<P>
   First, he got Krajicek's attention with a pair of brutal
backhand return winners in a losing effort in the 26th game. Then,
after holding easily himself for 14-13, he put Krajicek in a 15-40
vise and squeezed with everything he had, ripping a forehand return
off a second serve straight down the center line.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek flinched, poking a backhand volley into the net. It was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Brits could have their Tim. Ivanisevic was moving
on _ and perhaps on up the ladder again.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras proved too much for Henman, and he presents a far
greater challenge than Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Goran's most daunting opponent is always Goran.

FLORIDA FIRES FORCE EVACUATION OF ENTIRE COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See also FLA-FIRES-WINTER, as well as estensive coverage of
the Florida wild fires from Cox.)

   LAKE MARY, Fla. _ The dislocation of communities in northeastern
Florida worsened Friday when an entire whole county was ordered
evacuated as three brush fires threatened to merge into one and
trap about 35,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Flagler County fled south to hotels and Red
Cross shelters in neighboring Seminole County and Orlando as more
than 800 firefighters struggled in 100-degree heat to contain
dozens of runaway fires. The fires have been especially fierce
because they are fed by Florida's extreme drought conditions and
steered by unpredictable winds.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the evacuation of Flagler County, 10,000 other
residents were ordered out of their homes in Brevard County south
of Daytona Beach after a brush fire jumped over a highway to menace
their community.
</P>
<P>
   The fires, raging mostly through forest and rural areas in north
and central Florida since Memorial Day, have caused no deaths and
relatively few injuries or loss to property, but the potential for
disaster remained as they threatened to race into cities and towns.
The evacuations raised the number of people forced out of their
homes this week in northeastern Florida to about 85,000.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that about 124,000 of the 453,000 acres
ravaged by the fires since May have burned in the last 24 hours
alone, primarily in the counties of Flagler, Brevard, Volusia, St.
Johns and Orange. Gov. Lawton Chiles said equipment and
firefighters were coming from 41 states. He added, ``We have about
half of the country's firefighting assets in Florida right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation of Flagler County, an agricultural area that
includes several coastal towns, came after officials worried that
three brush fires burning near the city of Bunnell and the town of
Palm Coast would ``converge and you'd get one big fire,'' said Don
North, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To
let county residents evacuate, state officials re-opened southbound
lanes of Interstate 95, which remained closed to motorists for more
than 100 miles south of Jacksonville because of smoke and the
threat of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our cars packed for three days _ pictures, wills,
important papers,'' said Rosemary Ratusz, an elderly widow who left
in a caravan of six cars, eight neighbors and two pets from
Willoughby Place, a street in Palm Coast. ``We could see smoke,
red, black and white. It looked like the whole place was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ratusz and her neighbors sought refuge at a Red Cross
shelter at Lake Mary High School in Seminole County after putting
lawn sprinklers on the roof and leaving them on to try to protect
their homes. They said they had lived with the stench of smoke for
weeks, but that until the last minute they had believed they would
be spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured with all these firefighters around these fires
couldn't get out of control,'' said Eddie Jensen, 40, a postal
clerk who left with his wife and two teen-age children. ``People
don't realize how rural Florida really is. They think beach, palm
trees and bikinis.''
</P>
<P>
   Help has come from the Army, National Guard, Bureau of Indian
Affairs and fire departments from across the country, and fire
officials say they are using every resource at their disposal, from
trucks and bulldozers to planes and helicopters. This includes
three World War II bombers that can drop 2,000 gallons of water
each and a C-215 tanker aircraft from North Carolina, nicknamed the
``Super Scooper,'' that can scoop up 1,400 gallons of water in 10
seconds as it skims over large lakes.
</P>
<P>
   But while the cost for battling the 1,785 fires so far this
summer amounts to more than $80 million, many firefighters on the
field say that the only resource that can ultimately help them is
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources are here,'' said Hank Strickland, 41, a
firefighter from South Carolina fresh from a 13-hour work shift in
northern Brevard County. ``It's the dryness and Mother Nature. If I
had my way? Rain with no lightning.''

INVESTIGATORS UNCOVER INVENTIVE TELEPHONE SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ga., Texas, Colo.)  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal investigators said the scam was ingenious in
its simplicity: Five people in New York City would tap into public
pay phones at major airports across the United States, and then
steal calling-card numbers punched in by unsuspecting travelers.
</P>
<P>
   After a seven-month investigation by the Secret Service, the
scheme ended last month with the arrest of four men and one woman,
who federal prosecutors said worked out of four apartments in
Manhattan and the Bronx. But the case, which investigators and
telephone-company officials said is the first of its kind in the
nation, is only the latest machination in a $4-billion-a-year
telephone-fraud industry that keeps reinventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something new that we have not seen before,'' said
Boyd Jackson, the director of network security at AT&AMP;T Corp. and
one of the industry experts who helped federal investigators on the
case. ``And there is nothing I am aware of that customers can do to
fully protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, who said that calling-card theft costs
telephone companies and consumers millions of dollars annually,
have yet to establish an exact figure for how much this scam
netted. And because of the scheme's simplicity, and the fact that a
thief can tap into phones from hundreds of miles away, the
authorities are fearful of copycat crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, whose office is
prosecuting the case, left open the possibility of more arrests,
saying an investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the suspects stole hundreds of calling-card
numbers by dialing into public telephones in O'Hare International
Airport in Chicago, Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta,
Houston International Airport and Denver International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Federal documents say the scheme worked this way: The defendants
would call phones at the airports. When callers picked up the
ringing phones, they would hear what sounded like a dial tone,
which was activated when the suspects initiated the phones'
conference-call feature. Even if the caller was startled by the
dial tone and hung up, the tap remained activated for 15 seconds,
ensnaring callers if they picked up the phone again or if someone
else waiting in line tried to use the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Calling-card numbers that the victims punched in were recorded
by the suspects, who then would translate the tones back into
corresponding numbers using a device called a dial-number recorder,
prosecutors said. Such recorders are commonly available at
electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we have ever seen this type of setup
with these dial-number recorders,'' said Denise Gibson, a
spokeswoman for the New York City field office of the Secret
Service. ``Unfortunately, these are well-known and readily
available electronic devices.''
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining the calling-card numbers, thieves typically make
a profit by selling them on the black market to other criminals and
unwitting consumers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury Department that
investigates financial crimes, was tipped off to the scam by AT&AMP;T,
Bell Atlantic Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. after they
received an unusually high number of complaints from customers who
had recently used their calling cards in airports.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Secret Service agents arrested Benito Lopez, Juan
Morel, Miriam Mercado Florian and Julio Olivo, all of the Bronx,
and Gladys Brito of Manhattan. In the apartments, investigators
said, they confiscated dial-number recorders, audiotapes, lists of
public-telephone numbers and lists of calling-card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The five suspects, who each could face a maximum of five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted of fraud, could not be
located for comment. The suspects were arraigned and released on
bail last week in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where they are
scheduled to reappear for a preliminary hearing on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and telephone-company officials said they were concerned
about not being able to prevent copycat crimes, because under such
a scam, a thief does not have to be on location and there is no way
for consumers to differentiate between fake and real dial tones.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said that fraud, including calling-card
schemes, costs the telephone industry about $4 billion each year.
</P>
<P>
   Calling-card scams began with the actual theft of cards. That
scheme was foiled by telephone companies providing customers with
personal security codes not printed on the cards. Thieves responded
by glancing over the shoulders of callers and writing down their
calling-card numbers and security codes as they punched them into
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies say they put a dent in this so-called
``shoulder surfing'' by furnishing pay phones with automatic card
readers, and plastic shields and other measures to obstruct the
view of potential thieves. In recent years, more enterprising
thieves have obtained calling-card numbers and security codes by
contacting customers and telling them they were telephone-company
operators who needed to verify their card numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One federal official expressed a grudging admiration for the
latest scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a personal perspective, I thought it was rather
ingenious,'' Ms. Gibson said. ``It has alerted us to a potential
problem that we are sure other criminals will be able to
duplicate.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Independence Day celebrates America _ fireworks,
parades and cascades of red, white and blue _ then it also
celebrates what it means to be an American. And being an American
usually means being an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, this has never been truer: A new wave of
arrivals has propelled the city's immigrant population to a record
2.7 million, and about 60 percent of New Yorkers are either
immigrants or their children.
</P>
<P>
   Many things have changed since the New York area's last huge
wave of immigration early in the century. Immigrants take jetliners
to Kennedy and Newark International Airports, not ships to Ellis
Island. But as any immigrant can attest, the first steps to life in
the United States are no less awkward, difficult and lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, a federal
advisory body, suggested several ways to help immigrants adjust.
One idea was to compile a ``welcome package'' containing important
information in several languages.
</P>
<P>
   For now, that suggestion is not being actively considered by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is more concerned
with reducing the unprecedented backlog of 2 million immigrants
awaiting citizenship around the country, said Eric Andrus, an INS
spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog is so great _ 300,000 are waiting in New York City
alone _ that the New York immigration district did not have enough
approved applications to stage its traditional Fourth of July
swearing-in ceremony this year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the agency's priorities, it remains to be seen whether the
welcome package will ever become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   But what if there were such a package? What would be in it?
Practical things, such as maps or guides to English-language
classes? Philosophical things, such as strategies for successful
immigrant living? Or quirky things to reduce the chances of culture
shock?
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of Independence Day, eight immigrants were asked
for their thoughts. Some had specific ideas for an official federal
information packet, while others couldn't resist tossing in more
personal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Urban, 40, a pastry chef at Maya Restaurant in Manhattan
who emigrated in 1970 from the Dominican Republic, suggested
including information about the government, about language schools,
about the libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some countries, people don't even know what taxes are,''
she said. ``I would explain the concept, say that it's not money
that you give away to the government; it produces money to support
the schools and Medicaid and the libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   A list of discount outlets and wholesale companies would also be
beneficial, she said, as would a guide to the city's culinary
delights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something visual, like a poster, showing different
foods, like french fries,'' she said. ``If you understand what it
is, and what it looks like, I think you'll be willing to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Benson, who is in his early 50s, owns two bars,
O'Donoghue's and The Quiet Woman, in Hoboken, N.J. He was a dairy
farmer in County Mayo, Ireland, before immigrating here 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he would encourage immigrants to avoid living in an
area with a large concentration of their own nationality. Being
independent, he said, would open one's mind. A positive attitude
also helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Irish say that they'll stay one or two years,'' he
said. ``Then one year goes by, and they say another year. Then
another. Until 10 years go by so fast, and they're still here and
they don't achieve their maximum while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   People also should not cling to their old habits, he said. For
example, immigrants should not gripe about how Americans write
dates numerically: 7/4/98, for instance, is written 4/7/98 in
Ireland and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to change the American way,'' Benson said,
``so you might as well go along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Moise-Stone, 43, a lawyer for the City University of
New York, emigrated from Haiti about 30 years ago. She said that
Haitian immigrants would appreciate guides to the city's parks,
churches, libraries and ethnic enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Haitians would have to adjust to, she said, is
freedom of speech: ``You can go out and bad-mouth Clinton all you
want; nothing is going to happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Babou, 45, who emigrated from Senegal 10 years ago and now
works as a radio and newspaper correspondent in Manhattan, said
that any package should include tips on where, and how, to master
English: ``I've observed people who ordered the same type of food
for six months, nine months, simply because they didn't know the
word for the other foods.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Senegalese immigrants should listen primarily to
the authorities for advice, and not fellow immigrants. ``When I
came here, many people said the bank wouldn't accept my money
because I didn't have a green card,'' he said. They were mistaken.
``That was only because they happened to have a green card when
they opened their bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of life here is fast, he warned, and the living spaces
mercilessly tiny. Don't take it personally, Babou said. ``People
don't have time to give to you, so don't be angry with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Baumeler, 32, who emigrated from Peru as a child and grew
up in a largely Peruvian immigrant neighborhood in Passaic, N.J.,
is now a senior brand manager with a pharmaceuticals company in New
Jersey. He said that he would enclose a fair amount of information
about the selling points of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are fighting that emotional attachment to their
country,'' Baumeler said, ``so you need to say, `Here are some of
the privileges that come with being a naturalized citizen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating that switch, perhaps, is that Peruvians are
generally quite sociable, he said, while Americans are more
private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Peruvian immigrants construe that as being unfriendly, or
find that insulting, or the American people are cold,'' he said.
``They should realize that people here just keep to themselves.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Julie Horvath-Krol, an actress and translator, emigrated from
Hungary in 1991. Now a Staten Island resident, she declined to give
her age, but cheerily stated that she has six children; the oldest
is 29.
</P>
<P>
   Topping Ms. Horvath-Krol's list in a fantasy package for
immigrants was advice on learning the language and getting familiar
with the city's vast library system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, Hungarians should not be afraid of the
police. And they should also understand how easy it is to get
things done, she said. In Hungary, people just wait and wait in
line, sometimes for hours, sometimes for consecutive days. Here,
she said, ``you can just make an appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she wished someone had given her when she first came
here was a user-friendly guide to building one's credit history and
financial profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach them that `yes, there is a way to open a bank account,'
which is mutually beneficial for the businesses here and for people
coming here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mak, 40, the president of the Brooklyn Chinese-American
Association, who came here in 1970 from Hong Kong, said an
immigration packet should include a guide to New York landmarks, a
subway map, a map of downtown Manhattan listing major city
agencies, and a list of city services and telephone numbers that
people can call for immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be just as simple as who to call when you want to do
construction on your house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Sharma Sachar, 35, founder and associate publisher of
``Silicon India,'' a business and technology magazine based in
Manhattan, emigrated from India in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sachar said that the package should include information such
as contact numbers for consulates, and information on city services
such as subsidized housing and tax tips.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, it should tell Indian immigrants to change their
concept of time: In India, 9 a.m. means 10 a.m. ... or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, a deadline is a deadline,'' she said.

COMMENTARY: A HARD LESSON ON THE VALUE OF LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Newsletters and fliers cover the coffee table in Mark
and Rhoda Berenson's living room on Manhattan's East Side,
instruments of persuasion in a campaign to free their daughter Lori
Helene Berenson from a mountain prison in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're literally a mom-and-pop operation,'' Mrs. Berenson said.
As with most mom-and-pop operations, money does not flow freely.
The Berensons have begun to scrape the bottom of their cash barrel,
and so leaflets protesting their daughter's innocence share the
coffee table with newly printed fund-raising appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Having to rattle the cup may be necessary, but it is still
unsettling. ``We don't even want to ask our relatives,'' Berenson
said. That discomfort, though, is nothing compared with the
emotional wringer that the Manhattan couple have been put through
in recent days over whether their daughter might be released before
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst,'' the father said. ``By the end of it, my
guts were hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson, 28, has been imprisoned for well over two years.
To be precise: two years, seven months and four days as of
Saturday, her father noted without skipping a beat. A journalist
who sympathized with Peru's pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru guerrillas, she
was sentenced to life in prison after a military trial that had as
much to do with international norms of justice as the Three Stooges
do with Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether this New Yorker was part of a
terrorist band, as the Peruvian government claims, or simply a
left-leaning do-gooder, as her parents say. The question is
certainly not why she meddled in Peruvian affairs to begin with, as
some unsympathetic Americans have asked.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is simple. Did she get a fair trial? Considering
that she was charged with treason against Peru when she is not
Peruvian, and considering that the judges and prosecutors were
hooded and that she was not allowed to challenge evidence or
cross-examine witnesses, many Americans from President Clinton on
down say, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, some in Peru are starting to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons' emotions were sent on a roller coaster last week
when out of nowhere Peru's new prime minister, Javier Valle
Riestra, said Ms. Berenson should be pardoned and sent home. Valle
Riestra, a politically independent constitutional lawyer,
essentially echoed objections that the system was repressive and
that a foreigner could not be sentenced for treason.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the prime minister issued his call just as
Berenson was completing a visit to the prison high in the Andes
where his daughter is being held and where, he said, the constant
cold has caused her to suffer severe circulatory problems and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the airport getting on the plane to return to the
U.S. when he got on television,'' the father said.
</P>
<P>
   But in no time hope turned to familiar frustration when the real
power in Peru, the hard-nosed president, Alberto Fujimori, said
there was no way that the young American would go anywhere. ``There
was a combination of tremendous emotion and tremendous activity,''
Mrs. Berenson recalled Thursday. ``I think we had three meals in
five days. We still haven't caught up on sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the sudden ups and downs, the Berensons are left to
figure out if they have made progress or lost ground. ``As far as
I'm concerned, we're way ahead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she was heartened that the U.S. ambassador
to Peru, Dennis Jett, spoke out this week. He rebutted statements
by Fujimori that Ms. Berenson had acknowledged being a Tupac Amaru
member _ she did no such thing _ and that she would receive no
special treatment because she is an American. If anything, the
ambassador said, her nationality has worked against her.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons' congresswoman, Carolyn Maloney, said she was
encouraged that some Peruvian officials have begun speculating
about a new trial, this time in a civilian court. But over all,
some Western diplomats in Peru saw little to cheer in Ms.
Berenson's situation. ``Peruvian public opinion is 99.99 percent
against her and the president has dug in his heels,'' one of them
said by phone. ``The last person to respond to pressure is Alberto
Fujimori.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Berensons plan to hit the road this
weekend, pleading their case to a group in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, of course, is the Fourth of July. They will talk about
liberty.

EDITORIAL: OBSTRUCTING LOCAL WELFARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani made the right moves when he required New
York City welfare recipients to work for benefits and asked new
applicants to exhaust the search for employment before asking for
aid. But as he makes it tougher to obtain welfare, he needs to make
sure that the city also has policies and programs that offer tools
to move into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Among the big inconsistencies are proposals to limit remedial
work at the City University of New York, tighten admission
standards and delay student workfare. All are at odds with the aim
of preparing more people to be wage-earners.
</P>
<P>
   The city's welfare rolls shrank from 1.16 million in 1995 to
about 770,000 this year, partly because of the strong economy and
partly because the city tightened screening and required
able-bodied recipients to work in exchange for benefits. The rolls
will shrink yet again when the city adopts a new system that
requires people to search widely for work before receiving public
aid. The new system has dramatically driven down applications in
places where it has been tested.
</P>
<P>
   While steering people toward the job market, however, the city
has simultaneously embraced policies at the City University that
make the transition less likely. Over the last two years, for
example, the city has steadfastly resisted a program to provide
workfare on campus, so that welfare recipients might fulfill their
work obligations without disrupting progress toward a college
degree. The city will finally begin phasing in a campus workfare
plan next fall, more than a year after the state Legislature
ordered it to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the number of welfare recipients attending the City
University has dropped from 27,000 to about 12,000, partly because
of tuition increases and aid cuts, but also because the initial
workfare policy drove them out. The new plan to limit remedial
education at CUNY will hit these students even harder, making it
less likely that they will acquire the skills they need to earn
college degrees. Without degrees, they will be locked out of all
but menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform can succeed only if New York's poorest citizens
can get the skills they need to move into the mainstream economy.
For that to happen, the city needs to make sure that the people who
are being moved briskly toward the work force also have the
broadest possible access to training and education.

THE MANHATTAN OF ASIA IS INDIFFERENT TO CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ They call this city the Manhattan of Asia. And
Friday, as President Clinton wound up his visit to China by
motoring around town to give a speech, attend some meetings and do
a bit of shopping, Hong Kong treated the leader of the free world
with New York-style indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paying any attention to him,'' Chu Shu-san, 48, a
newsstand vendor, said with a shrug as he sold copies of papers
with Clinton's picture on the front page. ``He's just in transit
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Clinton attracted a good crowd for a speech Friday
morning about the relationship between the United States and Asia.
But the audience of local and foreign business leaders responded
tepidly to his call for a speedier introduction of democracy to
this former British colony, which reverted to Chinese rule a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debated this issue for five years in the 1980s,'' said
Vincent Lo, a leading property developer, in a somewhat grumpy
tone, as he rose to leave after Clinton's half-hour speech. ``We
know the good points and the bad points of democracy, and we know
we mustn't rush into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first president to visit Hong Kong while in office,
came here three times before entering the White House, and he
clearly likes the place. ``I think it's quite appropriate for our
trip to end in Hong Kong, because, for us Americans, Hong Kong is
China's window on the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 24-hour stop lacked the high drama of his televised
debate with President Jiang Zemin, his freewheeling give-and-take
with students at Beijing University, or even the solemn welcoming
ceremony at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy day here, few people lined the streets to see
Clinton's motorcade. When the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
and her daughter, Chelsea, slipped away to do some shopping at
Shanghai Tang, a boutique that specializes in updated Mao-style
clothing, they barely drew a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Primary Colors,'' the film adaptation of the thinly
disguised satire on the Clinton presidency, has flopped here. The
movie, which opened in Hong Kong the day after Clinton arrived in
China, has earned just a fraction of the box-office of the most
popular current film, ``True Mob Story.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lack of drama is that Hong Kong's troubles
are more economic than political. People here are worried about the
swooning stock market, the plummeting value of real estate and the
stability of the Hong Kong dollar _ topics that do not lend
themselves to soaring rhetoric or street theater.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Hong Kong and China for not devaluing their
currencies and he endorsed a $200 billion plan announced Thursday
by the Japanese government to take over failing banks and protect
depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the president did not ignore political issues. He
applauded the record voter turnout in Hong Kong's legislative
elections of two months ago, saying that ``the results were a
mandate for more democracy, not less, and faster, not slower,
strides toward political freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton met privately for 20 minutes with
Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent democratic politician. Lee,
who lost his seat in the legislature when Beijing dissolved the
body before the handover and regained it in the recent elections,
told the president he hoped that half of the council's 60 seats
would be directly elected in 2000 _ compared with 20 seats Friday.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said Clinton listened
attentively to Lee but did not express an opinion on any specific
proposals for speeding up democracy in Hong Kong. ``I don't think
it's for us to get into the specifics of what the timetable of that
might be,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's reluctance to talk numbers, Lee said the
meeting was ``terrific.'' He said the president responded
positively to his argument that the ``Hong Kong government should
be encouraged to develop democracy, so they can see that it works
well under Chinese rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Clinton met several other democratically-elected
legislators. One participant, Tsang Yok-sing, the head of Hong
Kong's largest pro-Beijing party, said the president ``showed that
he has a positive attitude toward developing a constructive
relationship with the Chinese leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   After his news conference, Clinton and his family stopped off
for some last-minute shopping on their way to Hong Kong's new $20
billion airport. The president's use of the airport is about the
only part of his visit that has generated local interest. Air Force
One landed six hours after the departure of Jiang, who had been in
Hong Kong to mark the first anniversary of the handover.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Standard devoted much of its article on Clinton on
Friday to a discussion of the dual presidential flights.

ARGENTINA, NETHERLANDS IN ATTACK MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France _ The last time Argentina and the Netherlands
met in the World Cup 20 years ago, Maradona was a pup and Clockwork
Orange was still whirring. Argentina won, 3-1, in overtime and
claimed the title. The Dutch disappeared for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, both sides are just happy to be at the Stade
Velodrome with a shot to get to the final four. Argentina, despite
playing a man up for the final 73 minutes, had to go to penalty
kicks to beat the English in their second-round match. The
Netherlands didn't beat Yugoslavia until the 90th minute, after
Yugoslavia's Predrag Mijatovic missed the first penalty shot in the
Cup since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this could be one of the most entertaining matches of
the tournament if both teams play the way they say they will _ all
out. ``Against any team, our concern is to create, attack,'' says
Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, whose squad has taken 86 shots in four
matches.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Argentina, which was having a lovely open match
with England until David Beckham got himself sent off in the 47th
minute and the English threw up the wall. But the Pale Blues
wouldn't have minded playing this match Sunday, to give battered
bodies and tired legs an extra day to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch only had to play 90 minutes against the Yugoslavs.
``And they only played us for five minutes,'' says midfielder Edgar
Davids, who scored the winning goal as time was running out.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines went 120 against the English a day later and came
out black and blue. Ariel Ortega, their gifted playmaker, is
hobbling on a bruised toe, and forward Hernan Crespo and keeper
Carlos Roa both have thigh injuries. And defensive midfielder
Roberto Sensini, who's playing in his third Cup, has been injured
for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficult match they had to play a day after ours might
prove to be an advantage for us,'' says Dutch attacker Marc
Overmars. So the Netherlands plans to come early and strong _
before Argentina gets a chance to do likewise. The Clockwork Orange
era of Cruyff and Rep and Neeskens, with its emphasis on ``total
football,'' may be long past but the Netherlands still can pile up
goals with likes of Overmars and Dennis Bergkamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch scored five on Nigeria in a pre-Cup tuneup, five on
the South Koreans and two on the Mexicans in the first 20 minutes.
``I'm convinced we have the most offensive team in the
tournament,'' says midfielder Ronald De Boer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Argentines, who have also tallied nine goals in four
matches, can play pinball with the likes of Gabriel Batistuta, who
has scored five, and Ariel Ortega, the gifted attacker who can also
deal like a midfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Argentine team,'' says Hiddink. ``Football is in
their blood. It's a young and experimental side, lively, always
animated, with an enormous desire to attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pale Blues, who've been waiting for an opponent who'll joust
with them at battle speed, are getting their wish in the Dutch.
They may not be playing for table stakes, as they were in 1978. But
this one will be worth a VCR tape.

WHEELING AND DEALING CARDINALS PUT DREW IN HIS COMFORT ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, Mark McGwire. This year, J.D. Drew.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals pulled off the unexpected again Friday,
achieving in one month what the Philadelphia Phillies could not do
in one year after making Drew the second pick in the 1997 draft.
The Cardinals, who last season enticed the power-hitting McGwire to
stay with them rather than become a free agent, reached agreement
on a four-year, $6,875,000 contract with Drew, the supposedly
unsignable draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along it was about how comfortable I'd be where I
played,'' Drew, a 22-year-old outfielder, said at a news conference
in St. Louis. ``I felt comfortable with the Cardinals. If I had to
do it all over again, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, comfort equaled money.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Boras, Drew's agent, the contract with the
Cardinals includes a $3 million signing bonus, salaries totaling
$3,875,000 and as much as $1,625,000 in bonuses based on roster
time. The package could be worth $8.5 million over four years,
compared with $4 million from the Phillies' basic offer, not
including bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   If based on five years, as the Phillies offered at the 11th
hour, the Cardinals' contract could be worth slightly more than $11
million compared with slightly more than $6 million from the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who was close to the Phillies' negotiations said they
had been willing to offer more money but would not make new
proposals as long as Boras stuck to his demand for a $10 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the Phillies' organization who was involved in
the talks said that even when Boras, at the end, sought a signing
bonus between $4 million and $5 million, the club was not willing
to go beyond $2.6 million, which was in line with the rate for high
first-round choices last year. Matt Anderson, a college pitcher who
was the No. 1 pick in 1997, signed with Detroit for a $2,505,000
bonus, then a record for a drafted player.
</P>
<P>
   The contract Drew signed 13 months after he was initially
drafted out of Florida State University is the biggest attained by
a drafted amateur. Earlier this week, St. Louis signed Chad
Hutchinson, a Stanford pitcher and quarterback, and a Boras client,
to a four-year, $3.5 million contract. Negotiations for Drew
escalated rapidly once the Hutchinson deal was completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drew will report to the Cardinals' Class AA Arkansas team
Saturday.

WILLIAM CAREY, 82, SCIENCE GROUP LEADER, BUDGET OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William D. Carey, a former executive officer of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and a former assistant
director of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget, died June 24 at his home
in Washington. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was chronic lung disease, said his son, Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was the association's executive officer, and at the same
time publisher of its journal, Science, from 1975 until he retired
in 1987. In that year the association, the nation's largest general
scientific organization, had 132,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in the Bronx, New York City, grew up in Boston and
received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Columbia University and
master's degrees from Columbia in public law and government and
from Harvard University in public administration.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Bureau of the Budget in 1942, Carey went on to
be executive assistant director from 1959 to 1966, during the
Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and assistant
director from 1966 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Science published a letter from Frank Carlucci, who was
then deputy secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, that
contended ``the Soviets exploit scientific exchanges to enhance
their military posture.'' Carlucci voiced concern over the
disclosure of information to the Soviet Union through exchanges of
scholars and students, and through other conduits.
</P>
<P>
   Carey argued in an interview that Carlucci's letter ``focused
mainly on half a dozen bad cases, including some exchanges that
were discontinued because they were so one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son, Eric, of Arlington, Va., he is survived by his
wife, the former Mary Margaret Rhodin, whom he married in 1944;
four daughters, Teresa Boswood of Oxford, England, Jane Long of
Washington, Julia Corrado of Alexandria, Va., and Elizabeth Langley
of Arlington, Va., and nine grandchildren.

RENATO CAPECCHI, 74, WHO SANG COMIC ROLES IN TRAGIC OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Renato Capecchi, an Italian baritone and character actor who was
best known for his deft portrayals of comic roles, died June 30 at
his home in Milan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Tony
Russo, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Capecchi was a regular presence at the New York Metropolitan
Opera in the early 1950s and from 1975 , until his retirement in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   He made his Met debut as Germont, in Verdi's ``Traviata,'' in
1951. During that first Met stint, which lasted until 1954, sang
mostly serious roles: Marcello in Puccini's ``Boheme,'' Escamillo
in Bizet's ``Carmen,'' Enrico in Donizetti's ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' _ as well as an occasional comic turn, like Figaro in
Rossini's ``Barbiere di Siviglia.''
</P>
<P>
   After his return to the Met in 1975, Capecchi specialized in the
smaller roles that add humorous touches to otherwise tragic works _
the Sacristan in Puccini's ``Tosca,'' for example, or Benoit and
Alcindoro in ``La Boheme.'' In 1986, when he was 63, he sang a
program of Italian folk songs in a belated New York debut recital
at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Outside New York, Capecchi's career was somewhat more varied. He
sang in the first Italian production of ``The Nose,'' by
Shostakovich, and he created roles in Gian Francesco Malipiero's
``Donna e Mobile,'' in Giorgio Federico Ghedini's ``Billy Budd''
and ``Lord Inferno'' and in Sylvano Bussotti's ``Inspirazione.''
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Capecchi staged ``La Boheme,'' at the
Metropolitan Opera, Donizetti's ``Daughter of the Regiment'' at the
New York City Opera and ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' at the
University of Colorado. He also directed productions at the San
Francisco Opera and at the Manhattan School of Music, where he
taught for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Capecchi was born in Cairo in November 1923 and studied in
Lausanne and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s he won a vocal competition sponsored by an
Italian radio station, and in 1949 he made his professional debut
as Amonasro in Verdi's ``Aida.'' He gave his first performances at
La Scala in 1950 and sang regularly at Covent Garden from 1962 to
1973.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jeannette; a son, Marco, and a
daughter, Magali.

   No one heckled the 32-year-old Gump on Friday as he shot a
course-record, 8-under-par 62 to take a 1-stroke lead midway
through the $2 million Canon Greater Hartford Open at the
6,820-yard TPC River Highlands Course.
</P>
<P>
   Without a victory in six years on the PGA Tour _ he won twice on
the satellite Nike circuit in 1994 _ the 32-year-old Gump had eight
birdies and no bogeys during Friday's round. Coupled with an
opening-round 68, the Windermere, Fla., golfer stood at
10-under-par 130, a stroke ahead of Larry Mize, who fired a 63;
Omar Uresti, another relatively unknown golfer, who shot 64; and
Stewart Cink, the event's defending champion, who shot 65.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed more surprised by his 62 than Gump, whose score
tied the lowest round shot this year. Bruce Lietzke, David Love III
and David Duval shot 62s earlier this year in tour events.
</P>
<P>
   But Gump had fired a 63 _ also in the second round _ in the GTE
Byron Nelson tournament last year. He finished 48th.
</P>
<P>
   Gump attributed his 62 to the heavy rains that left the greens
and the fairways relatively soft. ``The pace of the greens is
especially nice,'' said Gump, who has missed six cuts in 24
tournaments this year and whose best finish has been a tie for
ninth place, in the BellSouth Classic in May. Along with most of
the others on the leader board in an undistinguished field _ only
five of the top 25 money-winners entered this tournament _ Gump
ranks 127th on the money list with earnings of $100,800.
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes back of Gump were Grant Waite of New Zealand and
48-year-old Doug Tewell, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour who got
into the tournament as an alternate. Among those in a group of
five, three strokes back at 133, was Duval, the Tour's leading
money-winner who shot 65 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin, playing in his first PGA Tour event, drew the
largest gallery for the second straight day but failed to make the
cut. The 26-year-old Martin, who is permitted to use a golf cart as
a result of a federal judge's ruling, finished at 4-over-par 144
following a 73 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six players made the cut, but they had to finish at
1-under 139 or better to do so. That tied the low-cut number this
year in two other tournaments. Among those who barely made it were
the reigning British Open champion, Justin Leonard, whose 68 put
him at 138, and John Daly, who also had a 68 and wound up at the
cutting edge of 139.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The qualifier PETE MORGAN, whose 64 on Thursday gave him a
1-stroke first-round lead, slipped to a 71 to stand at 5 under 135.
...
</P>
<P>
   _ With his father, RON, as his caddie, the amateur J.J. HENRY of
Fairfield, Conn., shot a 71. Coupled with his opening-round 68,
Henry was at 139 and made the cut. Henry, a recent graduate of
Texas Christian University, finished second in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament last spring. He will be
a member of the eight-player team that will represent the United
States against teams from Britain and Ireland in the Palmer Club,
the collegiate version of the Ryder Cup, at St. Andrews in Scotland

 &HT;    Daytona and Pepsi 400 feels the heat
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The wildfires have transformed this city
and the baby powder and underwear in the middle of a sports bar are
among the many starkclues.
</P>
<P>
   The ash on cars and the masks on faces is more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi 400, the city's strongest summer lure and a $100
million economic infusion, was postponed Thursday as the fires
pressed closer and closer to Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of a bustling weekend, businesses tried to make due
in a city that, at times, looked like it was at the foot of a
volcano rather than the edge of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just kills us, but what can you do?'' said Armando
Deloera, general manager of Rio Bravo's Cantina, next to the
speedway. ``I really don't think anyone is worried about business.
We're just trying to feed as many firefighters and help as many
people as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners are still serving up huge amounts of food.
Bartenders keep serving drinks to customers lined up five-deep. And
Hooters waitresses still attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of catering to 150,000 or so race fans, businesses
are serving hundreds of firefighters who have battled the fires for
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hooters sent its waitresses to fire stations delivering chicken
wings, while other restaurants converted to relief stations.
</P>
<P>
   Houligan's Sports Pub, about five miles from the front lines of
Volusia County's fires, has become the favorite spot for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cases of Gatorade and water, ice, food, underwear,
baby powder, eye drops and dozens of socks sit where beer bottles
and happy hour food usually are seen.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle sits Houligan's owner Walter Curtis. Curtis
jokingly acknowledges he didn't have much choice but to become a
Good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops came in Wednesday night and kicked everybody out,''
Curtis said. ``They evacuated the whole area, so what the hell else
was I going to do? I had an empty restaurant and a lot of people
who needed help, so it made sense. But, yeah, it kills a HUGE
weekend for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many people who have pitched in to help, one tourist
stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Loomis of Columbus, Ga. came to Ormond Beach four days ago
for a family reunion. Instead, he's become a reluctant celebrity, a
volunteer who organized a massive relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in two towns talk about him as they take breaks
from the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just one of those do-gooders saving the day,''
Loomis said. ``It keeps me off the street and out of trouble, I
suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Others handled their ruined vacations differently. Greg and Dana
Cline of Columbia, Mo. arrived Monday with their two young sons,
hoping to see their first race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we knew it was like this, we never would have come,'' Dana
Cline said. ``It's been difficult, but we are going to go back to
safe homes, so it puts things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get rid of our tickets, because we're not
coming back,'' Greg said.
</P>
<P>
   That should be no problem. Several men lined Speedway Boulevard
Friday carrying ``I need tickets'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   It's seems scalpers survive any natural disaster.

EDITORIAL: A CHALLENGE TO SENATE SECRECY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Iowa)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   In one of its final acts before the holiday recess, the Senate
endorsed a small but significant procedural reform. By a unanimous
vote, lawmakers added an amendment to the Defense Appropriations
bill that would end the practice of allowing individual lawmakers
to block items they object to by imposing a secret ``hold.'' The
unanimous vote may not mean much. The Senate easily approved the
same measure last September only to have it mysteriously omitted
from the final version of the spending bill it had amended.
</P>
<P>
   For that omission to take place again would be inexcusable. The
system of ``holds'' began as a courtesy to lawmakers who wanted to
put off a debate until they could be there to participate. Now
every session of the Senate gets bogged down by a proliferation of
anonymous holds, some so confusing that even Majority Leader Trent
Lott can have trouble figuring out who is causing the delays.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, senators could still place holds on
nominations and legislation. But they would no longer have the
luxury of hiding. They would be required to identify themselves by
placing a notice in the Congressional Record. That may not sound
like much. But the measure's chief sponsors, Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, are aiming to restore accountability.
Lawmakers who use their power to hold things up should be required
to stand up and defend their positions.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many of the senators who just voted again to end
anonymous holds cherish the prerogative and would prefer to see the
reform quietly killed in the conference committee now meeting
behind closed doors. Lott has the muscle to prevent that. He should
use it.

EDITORIAL: THE RITES OF INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth of July seems almost to steal over a small town
daydreaming the summer away.
</P>
<P>
   A young boy rides his bicycle in a serpentine pattern down the
middle of a dusty street. Blue sky divides a broken pavement of
clouds. The road out of town seems to stretch farther than usual
before it fades out of sight between fields of corn or soybeans,
alfalfa or cotton. Near a railroad siding, the silence of noon is
broken by the sound of a mechanic's hammer ringing against steel in
the darkness of a repair shop. An old horse sleeps in a small
corral behind the drive-in. The mail fails to arrive. A firecracker
goes off in the alley.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that such towns still exist. Harder still
to realize how many of them there are, once you leave behind the
cities and the suburbs and the unincorporated sprawl and break out
into the open. But in those towns the Fourth seems to come into its
own, whether it is a hamlet like Texas, Ohio, little more than a
bait shop on the bank of the Maumee River, or a place like Lander,
Wyo., where the Fourth goes off like the crack of doom.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth is a holiday that celebrates indigenousness as well
as independence _ the condition of being American as well as the
declaration that began to make us so. It has no precise rituals.
Some families serve potato salad at their picnics _ those that have
picnics _ and some serve Waldorf or coleslaw. The bunting comes out
of mothballs, and the high school band _ in some disarray now that
the seniors have graduated _ prepares to march down Main Street
playing Sousa. If the town is small enough, the parade will turn
around and go back.
</P>
<P>
   The self-reliance of small towns is easily mistaken for
complacency, and the casualness of the Fourth in such places can be
misread as indifference. The Declaration of Independence is not
necessarily read aloud, nor is the Gettysburg Address. But when
dusk comes and fireflies and crickets begin to go off under the
trees, the park fills with people who have walked the few blocks
from home for the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Grandeur is not on the program, nor is exaltation, just some
modest municipal detonations, some rockets that rise shrieking over
the fairground or river, worrying every dog in town. The sound of
pale thunder breaks right overhead, and for once the lightning
lasts long enough to see, raining earthward in a shower of sparks.

</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 4:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China, like most presidential
journeys abroad, was carefully choreographed to further the
interests of host and guest. Both sides hoped to move relations
past the lingering trauma of the Tiananmen Square massacre nine
years ago, and largely succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also burnished the leadership credentials of President
Jiang Zemin, let Clinton talk about human rights directly to the
Chinese people and furthered the easing of tensions between
Washington and Beijing. But the hardest issues between the two
countries were not resolved, and there was a fair amount of show in
place of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has become more assertive and liberal over the past 16
months as he emerged from the shadow of Deng Xiaoping. He used his
appearances with Clinton to present himself as a statesman who
could meet on equal terms with the leader of the world's richest
and most powerful country.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, through his own statements and by allowing
several of Clinton's appearances to be shown live and uncensored on
Chinese television, Jiang signaled that he is willing to tolerate
more open public debate than China has seen since the period just
before the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also embraced the opportunity for ceremonial
statesmanship, a welcome relief for him from troubles at home. More
substantively, he wanted to use this trip to show American
audiences that today's China is too complex to be understood simply
in terms of army tanks rolling through Tiananmen Square in 1989. By
doing so, Clinton hoped to strengthen domestic support for building
closer economic and military links with a country many Americans
understandably see as a repressive dictatorship and a potential
strategic rival.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's repeated declarations to Chinese audiences about the
importance of human rights and individual freedom, while less sharp
than they might have been, have won him some political latitude on
these issues at home. But legitimate misgivings remain about the
wisdom of U.S. commercial dealings with companies controlled by the
Chinese military and Beijing's alleged attempts to buy influence in
U.S. politics.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-day Clinton visit marked a modest gain for relations
between the United States and China, which were dangerously frayed
as recently as two years ago. Increasingly frequent meetings
between Clinton and Jiang are improving communication and trust
between the two leaders. Last week's agreements on issues like
retargeting nuclear missiles, working together to resolve the Asian
financial crisis and restraining missile sales to Pakistan were
largely symbolic, but at least sent the right signals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang failed, however, to resolve some of the most
serious problems between the two countries. These include the
illicit transfer of U.S. space technology to China, Beijing's
reluctance to lower trade barriers to qualify for the World Trade
Organization and the continued refusal of China to renounce force
in its dealings with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Having posed for their flattering photo ops and reaped their
intended political rewards, both men are now obliged to grapple
with these difficult but important problems.

FLORIDA FIRES FORCE EVACUATION OF ENTIRE COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for addition; 2nd take is new)  (EDS: See also FLA-FIRES-WINTER, as well as estensive coverage of
the Florida wild fires from Cox.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE MARY, Fla. _ The dislocation of communities in northeastern
Florida worsened Friday when an entire whole county was ordered
evacuated as three brush fires threatened to merge into one and
trap about 35,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Flagler County fled south to hotels and Red
Cross shelters in neighboring Seminole County and Orlando as more
than 800 firefighters struggled in 100-degree heat to contain
dozens of runaway fires. The fires have been especially fierce
because they are fed by Florida's extreme drought conditions and
steered by unpredictable winds.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the evacuation of Flagler County, 10,000 other
residents were ordered out of their homes in Brevard County south
of Daytona Beach after a brush fire jumped over a highway to menace
their community.
</P>
<P>
   The fires, raging mostly through forest and rural areas in north
and central Florida since Memorial Day, have caused no deaths and
relatively few injuries or loss to property, but the potential for
disaster remained as they threatened to race into cities and towns.
The evacuations raised the number of people forced out of their
homes this week in northeastern Florida to about 85,000.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said that about 124,000 of the 453,000 acres
ravaged by the fires since May have burned in the last 24 hours
alone, primarily in the counties of Flagler, Brevard, Volusia, St.
Johns and Orange. Gov. Lawton Chiles said equipment and
firefighters were coming from 41 states. He added, ``We have about
half of the country's firefighting assets in Florida right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation of Flagler County, an agricultural area that
includes several coastal towns, came after officials worried that
three brush fires burning near the city of Bunnell and the town of
Palm Coast would ``converge and you'd get one big fire,'' said Don
North, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. To
let county residents evacuate, state officials re-opened southbound
lanes of Interstate 95, which remained closed to motorists for more
than 100 miles south of Jacksonville because of smoke and the
threat of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our cars packed for three days _ pictures, wills,
important papers,'' said Rosemary Ratusz, an elderly widow who left
in a caravan of six cars, eight neighbors and two pets from
Willoughby Place, a street in Palm Coast. ``We could see smoke,
red, black and white. It looked like the whole place was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ratusz and her neighbors sought refuge at a Red Cross
shelter at Lake Mary High School in Seminole County after putting
lawn sprinklers on the roof and leaving them on to try to protect
their homes. They said they had lived with the stench of smoke for
weeks, but that until the last minute they had believed they would
be spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured with all these firefighters around these fires
couldn't get out of control,'' said Eddie Jensen, 40, a postal
clerk who left with his wife and two teen-age children. ``People
don't realize how rural Florida really is. They think beach, palm
trees and bikinis.''
</P>
<P>
   Help has come from the Army, National Guard, Bureau of Indian
Affairs and fire departments from across the country, and fire
officials say they are using every resource at their disposal, from
trucks and bulldozers to planes and helicopters. This includes
three World War II bombers that can drop 2,000 gallons of water
each and a C-215 tanker aircraft from North Carolina, nicknamed the
``Super Scooper,'' that can scoop up 1,400 gallons of water in 10
seconds as it skims over large lakes.
</P>
<P>
   But while the cost for battling the 1,785 fires so far this
summer amounts to more than $80 million, many firefighters on the
field say that the only resource that can ultimately help them is
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources are here,'' said Hank Strickland, 41, a
firefighter from South Carolina fresh from a 13-hour work shift in
northern Brevard County. ``It's the dryness and Mother Nature. If I
had my way? Rain with no lightning.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   U.S. Forest Service officials say the Florida fires are
different from those fought in the west because there are so many
of them. Instead of one or two major fires consuming thousands of
acres, firefighters here are contending with as many as 100 smaller
but separate blazes, many endangering populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Steve McNerney, who has fought fires here for 11 years with
the Brevard County Fire Department, said torrential rains in the
winter ``greened up a lot of things that don't normally green'' and
those have now dried up because of extreme drought conditions. The
cycle has turned Florida into a tinderbox.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, any flying ember, any little spark, starts a fire,
and routine methods like cutting a line with a bulldozer and a plow
to stop the advance of a fire often fail. ``We can always count on
I-95 as a fire break,'' he said. ``At most, it burns to the road.
But with such dry conditions it has burned right over. It's
unbelievable. This is beyond anybody's control.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the job is also difficult because fast-moving
fires have burned only the top brush, leaving a smoldering
underbrush that later erupts into secondary fires that force
firefighters to return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shifts in winds have made the fires so erratic that Chiles on
Thursday urged residents to be ready to leave their homes at a
moment's notice and ``decide now what you need to take with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have never seen fire behavior like we're seeing it
right now,'' said Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Money Brevard
County. ``It's a factor of the dryness and the temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials have also hit snags as they try to keep up. Some
firefighters waited idly for fire engines today for several hours
in the town of Mims in Brevard County, while airplanes that drop
fire retardant were grounded Wednesday and Thursday when they ran
out of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fires, heavy smoke has saturated the region
and the Florida Division of Air Resources Management is urging the
elderly, children and those with respiratory ailments and heart
disease to stay indoors. Area hospitals reported treating over 170
people for respiratory ailments and at least 30 firemen have been
treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration and exhaustion.

 &HT;    Residents return home to surevy fire damage
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ Pete Knox, 62, walked as fast as he could down the
dirt road he had lived on since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys fought hard,'' he said as he rounded a bend and saw
his mobile home surrounded by charred forest. Some of the siding
was torn off, apparently by firefighters working to save his
property. In the back, a shed was destroyed. But across the street
lay what he had been afraid of. A chimney and the screen enclosure
for a pool were all that were left standing of his neighbor's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Without a firefighter in sight, a lonely fire chewed on what's
left of another neighbor's shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate them boys,'' Knox said. ``I'm going to buy 'em a
6 pack of beer, no a 12 pack. A whole damn truckload.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox was among the 9,000 people evacuated from northern Brevard
County Thursday night. Some were able to get passes to return for
two hours Friday morning, or like Knox, rode in with deputies.
</P>
<P>
   For all the devastation, the 45,000 acres burned in Brevard,
only about 30 of the 2,000 homes in the fire zone were destroyed by
late afternoon Friday. Another 20 were damaged to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reflect the efforts of 650 firefighters from around
the state and the country. While U.S. Forestry Service officers
worked on a way to stop the fires, local firefighters did nothing
but try to save homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One problem firefighters were not anticipating is septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several instances where fire trucks have crashed
through septic tanks and become stuck, immobile for 30 minutes or
even more,'' Brevard County Fire Chief Don Boykin said.

 &HT;    Fire forces county to evacuate
 &HT;    By By Jenny Staletovich and Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ An entire county _ neighbors, schools, churches,
diners, even the local hardware store _ surrendered to wildfire
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   About 45,000 residents of tiny Flagler County, 504 rural square
miles shouldered between Daytona Beach and St. Augustine, were
ordered to leave. Most took to the local highway, lined with
American flags for the holiday, and snaked west in bumper to bumper
traffic to escape fires converging on their county seat.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the small town was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind were fires so fierce even firefighters gave up
trying to control them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a potential for a catastrophic event,'' Raymond
Geiger, chief of field operations for the state Division of
Forestry, said as fires marched from the north, south and west.
``It's called a firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Banning fireworks _ a statewide order issued by Gov. Lawton
Chiles last week _ seems beside the point here.
</P>
<P>
   If fires collide, they could suck air inward, spreading flames
even faster, a phenomenon used in Allied bombing of Nazi Germany in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't put enough resources on the fire line to stop
it,'' said Larry Scovotto, executive director of the Florida Fire
Chiefs Association.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, a dawn to dusk curfew had been set.
</P>
<P>
   Further south in Brevard County, the largest fire burned out of
control as smaller fires crept into marshes out of firefighters'
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been saying at the state level that this has been the
worst disaster since Hurricane Andrew,'' Titusville Fire Chief Tom
Harmer said. ``I think we're changing that. This is worse than
Andrew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires, still most dangerous in Flagler, Volusia and Brevard
counties, claimed another 165,000 acres statewide Friday, bringing
the total to 452,876 covering 707 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Some 72,000 people in Volusia County remained under Thursday's
evacuation order, officials said. In Brevard County, of the nearly
10,000 evacuated, all but those living in about 50 houses still
threatened by fire were allowed to return home late Friday. About
200 structures from Titusville north to the Palm Coast
neighborhoods in Flagler County have been destroyed and 55 people,
most firefighter, injured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile billowing smoke crept south, draping Palm Beach County
and the Treasure Coast in a gauze of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   And in what is becoming a depressing daily ritual, state
officials predicted worse awaits us.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible day, a terrible week,'' said Sen. Bob
Graham, who came to the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee
with Federal Emergency Management Agency director James Lee Witt
Friday to tour scorched counties by helicopter. Gov. Lawton Chiles
later cancelled the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sea breezes Friday afternoon provided a little relief and
by 7 p.m., a steady rain was falling on Flagler County. A half hour
later, the rain arrived in Volusia County. The three fires
threatening to join forces in Flagler County never met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness the Good Lord gave us some relief,'' Chiles
said.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem to matter on roads.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 150 miles of Interstate 95 remained closed from
Jacksonville to Cocoa Beach, with only a small stretch opened to
evacuees fleeing Flagler County south. In the most dangerous areas,
dozens of other roads closed. Tolls on Florida's Turnpike remained
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the Flagler evacuation was a gasoline shortage.
Fuel distributors refused to send tankers loaded with gasoline over
roads lined with flames, forcing emergency management officials to
dip into fuel stores saved for hurricane evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   And many evacuees fond Palatka shelters, expected to hold about
2,000, full and pushed on through to Gainesville, an additional 40
miles west. Elsewhere shelters opened to offer accommodations: 12
in Putnam County just west and two in Seminole County. A Disaster
Medical Assistance Team to assist rescue workers was also
dispatched to the area.
</P>
<P>
   With so many homes empty, officials ordered 1,500 members of the
Florida National Guard to report for duty and stand guard. Earlier,
562 members of the Guard arrived to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fighting fires remained the biggest concern. In the
northeast corner of Flagler County where the worst blazes raged,
rescue workers struggled to get close to several ritzy Palm Coast
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a difficult time even getting back there with
telephone poles and trees down,'' said Richard Wieser, spokesman
for Flagler County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile firefighters unaccustomed to fighting wildfires found
themselves facing a different enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In Volusia County, firefighters surrounded a $200,000 house in
the Hunter's Ridge subdivision. They stood, backs to the wall,
prepared to fight flames that came too close but willing to let
them burn, as long as they destroyed shrubs and fuel leading to the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem we have is that most of the firefighters are
structural firefighters, so they want to put everything out right
away,'' said Lt. Charles Davis of Coral Gables. ``That's fine, but
we're trying to teach them to be forestry firefighters, where you
only want to control and let it burn itself out. It's difficult,
but everyone's learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Further south in Brevard County, supervisors shared worries
about firefighters in unpredictable circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They're ``taking chances they shouldn't,'' said Brevard County
Fire Chief Dan Boykin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have burned out areas all the way around homes and I know
the homes are there because (firefighters) took chances they
shouldn't be taking,'' he said. ``It's very frustrating for a
firefighter to lose a home. They don't understand it. They don't
comprehend it. Neither do I.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six firefighters have been injured in Brevard County,
most from heat exhaustion because they are working in heavy bunker
gear designed for structure fires. Wildfire gear is being flown in
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Daytona International Speedway, where today's
Pepsi 400 was postponed until October, firefighters and evacuees
found themselves housed in a posh hospitality pavilion and other
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But what a Fourth of July it will ben. Most threatened areas
have no plans for fireworks _ properly licensed public displays are
permitted despite the private ban. Still, some will go on with the
show. Disney, which mounts daily fireworks shows, will hold its
display along with many in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The family of a teen-ager suffering from inoperable brain
tumors, who had asked for a special fireworks show in Putnam
County, considered their neighbor's ordeal and cancelled their
request.
</P>
<P>
   But common sense did not necessarily rule the day.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fires worsened and evacuations mounted, one Ormond Beach
resident ignored warnings to leave and waited until flames
surrounded his house, then called 911 for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to pull crews off and go in with a helicopter,'' said
Mike Pleus, Volusia County emergency management spokesman. ``That
really puts a strain on our resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Which even the rain won't help. As Geiger, with the state
Division of Forestry cautioned, thundershowers likes the ones that
provided quick relief late Friday, can also start more fires than
they put out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every lightning bolt that you hear in the woods is a
wildfire,'' he said.

LIFEGUARDS LIMIT PICKS, BUT A BEACH IS A BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ESTHER B. FEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lifeguard shortage that has vexed New York City
this year, causing vast stretches of beaches to be closed, seemed
little burden to holiday bathers Friday, basking under a perfect
robin's egg sky, with just enough of a breeze to keep a kite up but
not so much that it ruffled the pages of a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Where a beach was closed with a ``No Lifeguard on Duty _
Swimming Prohibited'' sign posted, people walked, without a fuss, a
few hundred yards to the nearest section where orange-suited
lifeguards patrolled the waters.
</P>
<P>
   But to a triad of teen-agers who had set out for a day on the
beaches of Far Rockaway, the closing of Beach 74, because of a
shortage of people who had passed the city's lifeguard test, was an
affront.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the indignities that could befall a group of teen-agers
on a quest to be cool and aloof, they were stuck going to a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich of a beach, the kind of beach filled with
little children and their pails and umbrellas and those incessant
parental cries of ``Put on more sunscreen'' and ``Don't go out too
far'' that they thought they had outgrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy four is supposed to be where everyone hangs out,''
said Jose Santiago, 19, from East New York, on a day off from his
studies to be a computer technician. ``It's famous. You go to 74,
and you know you're going to bump into somebody you know. Now we
got to go there with all those kids and the pails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to be with the FAMILIES,'' said Charlie Collazo, 15, a
sophomore at Bushwick High School in Brooklyn, with that special
sort of disdain teen-agers reserve for anything that reminds them
that they are not quite adults.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Ramos, 16, a student at John Adams High School in South
Ozone Park, Queens, looked longingly at the swath of sand roped off
with red plastic flags, then motioned to his friends to get over it
and move on. ``It's still the beach, man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Department officials said Friday that slowly, the
lifeguard shortage was easing. Through recruiting efforts and with
high school students who had passed the test finishing their
classes, making them free for midweek shifts, the city was able to
safely open more beaches. Alas, not Beach 74.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Colasante recalled that when he was younger, all of his
friends went to Beach 116 in Far Rockaway. ``We'd hang out, listen
to rock 'n' roll, drink beer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's 32, an electrician in Local 3, married, and the father
of 3-year-old little Mike. And so, he's on Beach 119. ``It's
calmer,'' he said, swinging his delighted son in the surf. ``I'm
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharlene Rodriguz said she had gone out to Orchard Beach in the
Bronx looking forward to the solitude of section one, at the very
tip of the beach, which is radio-free and this year, unfortunately,
a swimming-free zone, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it was open _ it's really quiet out there,'' said Ms.
Rodriguz, a 34-year-old chef from the Bronx. She had to settle for
section two, a few feet from the orange streamers that marked the
closed area, but still, she had to admit, pretty quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Being a lifeguard used to be the ultimate summer job, said Peter
Cholakis, a handyman at Beach Channel High School in Far Rockaway,
who was swimming Friday with his children, Nicholas, 9, and
Elizabeth, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest job,'' said Cholakis, who is back at the
same beach, 119, that he went to with his parents. ``Now, not even
the kids who grow up around here go out for it anymore. Now more
kids are going to college, and they want internships in their
fields. The economy's good and there are, you know, classier jobs
for them. They don't want to be lifeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Carey, a 20-year-old student at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice sharing duty at Beach 26, said being a lifeguard
was still the best summer job he could think of _ and this is his
fifth summer doing it. ``You can't beat this,'' he said, his nose
already burned a light shade of tomato soup. ``I'm getting paid to
sit in the sun, at this point about $11 an hour. I'm 20. I live at
home. I don't need much else.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of Marvin Mullings' friends wanted to be lifeguards; they
just could not pass the test. ``They're out of shape,'' said
Mullings, 17, a third-year lifeguard who just graduated from Far
Rockaway High School and is headed for Greensboro College in North
Carolina at summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   From his perch atop the lifeguard chair at Beach 26, the sand
was not too crowded, the day not too warm. ``Too bad for them,'' he
said of his unsuccessful mates.
</P>
<P>
   As if trying to minimize any bad publicity to the city that the
beach closings had caused, none of the city parks workers in Far
Rockaway, Coney Island or Orchard Beach would give their names or
answer anything more than basic questions about the closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk or jog along the surf and you can hang out up to
the flags,'' said one parks enforcement officer in Far Rockaway who
declined to give her name. ``But after the flags, you can't swim or
lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   A few sea gulls disobeyed, but the officer did not seem to mind.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)  
 (Eds: Please note sub slug for BANK-MERGERS)  
 (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Union Avenue between East 156th Street and
Westchester Avenue in the Bronx is a small, humble block lined with
squat apartment buildings marked by occasional splashes of
graffiti. Chain-link fences hem in some yards; nearby, subway cars
rattle loudly on an overhead track.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, drug dealers controlled the neighborhood
and many of its buildings. Today, the dealers are gone, pushed out
by the police and by new residents who have rehabilitated some of
the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last week, people chatted amiably on stoops and
sidewalks. Some of them would like to see others _ particularly
banks _ share their faith in the neighborhood's future.
</P>
<P>
   George Rabel, 38, the owner of La Marketa Barioa, a tiny bodega
on Union Avenue, is among those hoping that a broader economic
revival is in store for the neighborhood. But he has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in business for nine years and I go to the bank
looking for a credit line when I get short of cash,'' he said.
``They tell me no. To get credit you have to have a credit history,
but you can't have a credit history if nobody gives you a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As an unprecedented merger boom continues to spawn new giants in
the banking industry, the needs of borrowers like Rabel are at the
center of a heated debate among community groups, lenders and
politicians over the financial service industry's commitment to
low-income neighborhoods across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The partners in both of the biggest recently announced mergers _
Citicorp-Travelers Group and Nationsbank-BankAmerica _ recently
unveiled multibillion-dollar lending packages to low-income
communities that dwarf similar commitments previously made by other
banks.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges build upon what activists and regulators acknowledge
to be a vastly improved record by banks when it comes to low-income
lending _ one that has helped, along with a strong economy, to
bring some vitality back to many low-income communities in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   But community groups complain that some of the outsized lending
programs announced lately are designed to curry favor with the
Federal Reserve Board, which must approve the mergers, rather than
truly meet credit needs in disadvantaged areas. The most egregious
example, community advocates say, is Citicorp, the New York bank
that is merging with Travelers Group to create the world's largest
financial services concern.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their merger application, Citicorp and Travelers,
which will be known as Citigroup, have promised the Federal Reserve
that they will make $115 billion in loans to low-income and
minority communities over the next 10 years. Community groups say
that figure, large as it appears, is small relative to pledges from
other banks _ notably a $350 billion, 10-year pledge by Nationsbank
and BankAmerica Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, moreover, low-income lending programs were designed
with the needs of a bank's local market in mind. But the
Citicorp-Travelers deal is all about creating financial
supermarkets, not opening local branches. And community groups say
the lack of geographic specificity in the partners' lending pledge
may make it less meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Citicorp and Travelers are promising about $60 billion in
consumer loans, a large but unspecified portion of which will be
credit cards presumably bearing high interest rates _ hardly the
stuff that fuels home-buying or economic development, say the
companies' critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It erodes the concept of community lending to have the most
powerful financial institution in the country disinterested in
it,'' said John Taylor, executive director of the National
Community Reinvestment Coalition, a Washington organization that
represents 678 community groups. ``A substantial portion of their
commitment represents what has historically been a problem in
low-income communities: credit card debt.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Citicorp, which has been orienting its entire
business toward more affluent customers and which, until recently,
sharply scaled back its mortgage operations in low-income areas,
says regulations governing low-income lending do not specify or
favor certain types of loans. Citicorp says it considers credit
cards to be a legitimate form of low-income lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each institution, each bank, has to pursue its business and
emphasize those things it's good at,'' said Pamela Flaherty, senior
vice president for community activities at Citicorp. ``We happen to
be good at consumer lending and student loans and credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives community groups a forum is the Community
Reinvestment Act, a federal law passed in 1977 that requires a bank
to help meet ``the credit needs of its entire community, including
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe
and sound operation'' of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Because a poor record under the law offers regulators grounds
for scuttling a merger (though that almost never happens), merger
time has come to mean negotiating time for banks and community
groups. Last month, the Fed held public hearings in New York on the
Citicorp-Travelers merger, evoking a spectrum of responses,
including a protest by activists brandishing red umbrellas like
those that Travelers uses as its logo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, community groups and Banc One have reached an
impasse in negotiations surrounding the bank's merger with First
Chicago NBD Corp. The activists would like top executives to commit
to a reinvestment plan, but Banc One says it prefers to make
commitments market by market.
</P>
<P>
   While many bankers privately say that the negotiating process
leaves them feeling shaken down by community groups, activists say
that is hardly their intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of community groups is not to be opposed to
financial modernization, per se,'' says Matthew Lee, executive
director of Inner City Press-Community on the Move, a New York
group that often challenges big bank mergers. ``It's to ensure that
CRA doesn't get watered down by these combinations and that
low-income people retain access to the financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because of ambiguities about how the Community Reinvestment Act
was to be enforced, the law lay mostly fallow until 1989, when
regulators issued clearer criteria for judging banks' compliance.
In 1992, Congress followed up by requiring lenders to make data on
mortgage applications publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   The fuller disclosure _ and heightened scrutiny by the Clinton
administration _ strengthened the hand of community groups and
contributed to big increases in banks' low-income lending.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, lending commitments under the law have totaled $875
billion, compared with just $8.8 billion in pledges from 1977 to
1991, according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that banks' volume of lending in
low-income and minority census tracts has increased dramatically,''
Lee said. ``On the downside, the CRA as written doesn't speak to
the type of loans being made or what exactly constitutes lending to
low-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report soon to be released by the Urban
Institute, a research group in Washington, greater access to
housing loans has improved the quality of life in many
disadvantaged areas. In low-income areas in 22 of 23 cities studied
for the report, access to housing loans remained stable or went up
between 1991 and 1997. In 11 of those 22 cities, ``significant
improvements'' were registered.
</P>
<P>
   But community groups say they are concerned that other types of
lending, particularly lending to small businesses, might fall by
the wayside as big banks link up.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about how broadly the Community Reinvestment Act should
be construed have gained momentum because of the changes sweeping
through the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed combination of Citicorp and Travelers, for example,
would mesh traditional banking with brokerage services, insurance,
mutual funds and stock and bond underwriting. But of these
businesses, only banking falls under the purview of the law. And as
such mergers continue, community groups worry that the momentum
gained in low-income lending will be undercut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the same kind of redlining problems with home insurance
as we do with lending, but insurance isn't covered by CRA,'' said
Patrick Woodall, a policy analyst with Acorn, a community group
based in Washington. ``And if you can't get home insurance, you
can't buy a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Many banks feel unfairly singled out by the law, arguing that
the responsibility for community lending should be extended to
competitors like mutual fund companies and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 70 percent of the traditional deposit dollar is now
deposited outside of traditional banks, and that issue needs to be
addressed,'' said Catherine P. Bessant, Nationsbank's president for
community investment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that any expansion of the law's scope
is on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate's consideration of a bill that would break down
the Depression-era legal barriers separating banking and other
financial services, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and other members of
the banking committee have proposed doing away with the
community-lending law entirely.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who is chairman of the committee, all
oppose gutting the law. So observers say the law is likely to
survive without significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups, however, say the act already has been weakened
by banking regulators too willing to give high marks to the vast
majority of banks for their low-income lending.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, according to the Federal Reserve, 11 percent of the
banks it examined received ``outstanding'' ratings under the act,
and 80 percent received ``satisfactory'' marks. Only 8 percent were
judged ``need to improve'' and 1 percent deemed in ``substantial
noncompliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has changed during this decade. Although banks previously
given low marks receive the closest scrutiny, so far this year,
19.7 percent of the banks examined by the Fed have received
``outstanding'' marks, 78.2 percent were judged ``satisfactory,''
1.6 percent were graded ``need to improve'' and 0.5 percent were
found in ``substantial noncompliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Community activists also complain that the Fed _ one of several
agencies that can perform compliance reviews, depending on how a
bank is chartered _ is predisposed to big banking mergers. They
note, for example, that the Fed held public hearings on the
community impact of the First Union Corp.'s recent acquisition of
Corestates Financial only after the agency was pressured by
activists and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding a certain amount of grade inflation in
community-lending examinations, Edward Gramlich, one of seven
members of the Federal Reserve Board, said that does not mean the
Fed disregards banks' lending patterns when it reviews mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not as quantitative as we might like it to be, but it's
certainly not a pro forma approval process,'' Gramlich said.
``There is no formal enforcement mechanism because of the way the
law was written. The main enforcement tool is when we look at
merger applications, and from my vantage point, we look at them
pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramlich acknowledged that the scale of some of the latest
bank mergers has complicated the regulators' ability to assess
compliance with the lending law, especially as some banks begin to
spread their wings across the entire country. The issue is what
``community'' a bank should be reinvesting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the megamergers that are engulfing the whole country, it
does become difficult to understand what the assessment area is,''
Gramlich said. ``I think the process will become one of banks
negotiating with their regulators about where their assessment area
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, anyone trying to examine a pledge under the Community
Reinvestment Act is confronted with a welter of numbers that
complicate efforts to compare banks' records or sort out exactly
what a given bank considers to be a community development loan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a study released last month by the Treasury
Department's inspector general's office criticized as unreliable
examinations in 1996 and 1997 by the comptroller of the currency,
another bank regulator. And while the comptroller's office says it
has addressed the problems, officials insist that the real issue is
not reliability, but the subjective standards of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not create a bright-line standard that establishes a
certain percentage or number of loans in a certain category to
generate a rating,'' said Steve Cross, the deputy comptroller for
community and consumer policy. ``What the inspector general
characterizes as inconsistencies, I would characterize as the
appropriate exercise of judgment by an examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   From the banks' perspective, the law results in what sometimes
seems like little more than a numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``CRA has become a volume-oriented game, with up being good and
down being bad,'' said Ms. Bessant of Nationsbank. ``I worry about
crazy pricing and crazy credit as everybody tries to generate more
loans in order to get a better rating.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nationsbank, the company's critics contend, is hardly above
playing the numbers game itself as it pursues its merger with
BankAmerica. The two banks say that their huge CRA pledge, $350
billion over 10 years, is about the same as the total amount
pledged by all other banks over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in that pledge, however, are loans that other banks do
not typically count as community investment. For example,
Nationsbank is including mortgage loans to upper-income members of
minority groups, even though the reinvestment act emphasizes income
levels _ not race _ in its guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot in that commitment that is outside of CRA but
expands the idea of community development,'' Ms. Bessant said. ``To
the extent that minority borrowers have had a more difficult time
accessing credit, it's very relevant under this commitment to
report our minority lending at all income levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many numbers, how the lending pledges are construed
depends on who is doing the construing.
</P>
<P>
   On an annual basis, Nationsbank and BankAmerica are promising to
lend about 6 percent of their combined assets to low-income
borrowers _ a figure that the partners pointedly noted in a press
release will not include credit cards. By comparison, the new
Citigroup pledges to lend about 1.7 percent of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Nationsbank and BankAmerica will have more traditional
domestic retail deposits than Citicorp and Travelers, noted Ms.
Flaherty of Citicorp. Judged against that base _ which, she said,
is a better measure of a bank's local lending activity _
Citigroup's lending pledge is more formidable: about 21 percent of
the merged companies' domestic deposit base, versus about 10
percent for the combined Nationsbank-BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   However the numbers are added up, community groups say the
merger partners' big promises are too vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $350 billion CRA pledge could have no impact on low-income
and minority communities because CRA can be interpreted so
broadly,'' said John Gamboa, executive director of the Greenlining
Institute, a San Francisco advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups say small-business loans to liquor stores or
check-cashing outfits can be part of a community-investing tally in
a low-income area, even though many residents do not see those
kinds of businesses as contributing to economic development. And
mortgage loans for low-income borrowers can be structured in ways
that make them inaccessible to the borrowers who need them _ if
required down payments are too high, for example, or repayment
schedules too swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the commitment is not tied to a specific local credit and
capital need as identified by the lender in conjunction with
community investment leaders, and does not include a mechanism that
allows for community involvement in the monitoring and evaluation
of that commitment, then it isn't real,'' said Taylor of the
National Community Reinvestment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp, Travelers, Nationsbank and BankAmerica, he said, put
together their big pledges very quickly and with minimal input from
community groups.
</P>
<P>
   But bankers are extremely reluctant to be more specific about
the types or locations of loans they will make under their
community investment pledges, arguing, as does Nationsbank's Ms.
Bessant, that such precision would ``prevent us from having market
flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Bronx, just a few miles north of the world's banking
center, Union Avenue residents talk about the risks they have taken
putting up their own cash to renovate apartments that were once
uninhabitable. Now, they would like to advance another notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are small businesses and people going to get the money
they need to move the neighborhood to another level?'' asked
Roberto Suero, 22. ``We have initiative here, but no banks.''

DISMISSED CNN PRODUCER STANDS BY HER STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since she entered the television news business in the
mid-1980s, April Oliver has impressed her colleagues as an
extremely confident and dedicated journalist. She gathered and
synthesized details quickly. Her brisk, articulate presentations
inspired trust.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Oliver and her style are at the center of what has
become the latest in a series of news scandals _ CNN's retraction
of its report on its news magazine ``NewsStand: CNN &AMP; Time'' that
the United States used nerve gas in Laos. It was overconfidence,
said Floyd Abrams, who investigated the affair for CNN, that was a
prime factor in a series of calamitous journalistic errors.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Princeton graduate, fired along with her
immediate superior, seasoned senior producer Jack Smith, is
standing by her story _ which also appeared in Time magazine _ and
in fact blames her superiors for a lack of care in handling it.
Both say they had argued for an hour-long broadcast that could have
captured more of the complexity than appeared in the more blunt
18-minute version.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams and her colleagues say she might have been better
served by a less committed and dogged approach. When fundamental
objections were raised within CNN in the final days before the
broadcast June 7, she provided such a spirited and detailed defense
of the piece that even her most skeptical colleagues felt she had
to have a strong foundation for her work.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even Wednesday, as Abrams was finishing his report, she
sent a letter to Richard Kaplan, the president of CNN/US, saying
she welcomed the investigation but that ``anyone attempting to
retrace my eight months of reporting in two weeks _ in this
extraordinarily hostile environment _ will simply not be able to
match my work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was typical, say those who worked with her. Long before
last fall, when she started looking through 27-year-old manuals of
military ordnance and making herself fluent in the old Vietnam-era
military jargon, she moved smartly up the ladder of television
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired her on the strength of her experience and presentation
of herself,'' said Smith, a former CBS Washington bureau chief.
``She was one of the best reporters and the quickest reporters and
the quickest writers that I ever worked with,'' added Smith. ``I
worked with Bill Mooney at The Chicago Daily News _ the fastest
rewrite man in history, God rest his soul _ and she's almost as
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Oliver's response to the report released Friday that
repudiates her work as ``journalistic overkill'' is a passionate
defense of what she and Smith still believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were strong interests about there who wanted to
discredit this report,'' she said in an interview Friday. ``The
clear tactic was to kill the messenger _ me. They're portraying me
as the producer from hell who takes special forces veterans and
pushes them against the wall and makes them say things they don't
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep the piece to 18 minutes was made by the
show's senior executive producer, Pamela Hill, who resigned
Thursday, saying she agreed with Abrams' conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great to put a lot of things in,'' Ms.
Oliver said Friday. ``But there was a time issue. You can overload
your audience with detail. There are two main points here. Nerve
gas and defectors. To put in all these little details _ maybe this
person was a Russian not an American, maybe it was a CIA coverup _
you can overload the audience. There are a lot of maybes in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we had hard confirmation from multiple sources,
some of whom had read the script. So getting into the various
potential cover stories could possibly be confusing to audience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About five days before the broadcast, she gave detailed and
courteous responses to her colleague, CNN's Pentagon correspondent
Jamie McIntyre and his producer, Chris Plante, who had challenged
the report and pointed out that no one quoted on camera directly
supported the report's central conclusions about nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver responded, and still vigorously contends, that in the
following exchange, Adm. Thomas Moorer, the 87-year-old former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had confirmed the use of
nerve gas _ variously code named CBU-15 and GB _ during the mission
Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, as aired in the broadcast, began with Ms. Oliver
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it fair to say that Tailwind proved that CBU-15, GB is
an effective weapon?''
</P>
<P>
   Moorer responded. ``Yes, I think _ but I think that was already
known, otherwise it would never have been manufactured.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams concluded that Moore was a questionable source, partly
because his answers were often given in response to hypothetical
questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before the broadcast, she and Smith said, her
156-page briefing book, which contained 35 pages of information
from what she calls ``naysayers,'' or witnesses denying the
allegation, was sent to the network's top executives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The rough cut of the broadcast at that time included a 10-second
clip from a pilot named Art Bishop saying that he had been told his
plane was loaded with tear gas. But according to Ms. Oliver, Smith
and Ms. Hill, after various superiors requested inserts that gave a
historical context for the events of 1970 and added an interview
with an expert in chemical warfare, Ms. Hill had Bishop's denial
cut to a glancing reference. The denial did not appear in the Time
version.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Oliver said that she never believed that Robert Van
Buskirk, a crucial source, who had been a lieutenant in the
commando unit in Laos and told CNN he had called in a gas attack to
save his men, had experienced repressed memory syndrome. That
syndrome was attributed to him in later interviews with reporters
form other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Sources like Van Buskirk clearly remember Ms. Oliver's certainty
about her facts. ``They got convinced that it was the nerve gas
sarin somewhere beyond me,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, on a program called ``Insight,'' which is seen on CNN's
foreign outlets but not in the United States, Friday said of Ms.
Oliver and Smith, ``I think that what they did was fall in love
with their reporting and come to believe their reporting despite
what they might have been learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of major information was left out of the piece, and
while they may have done it because, out of good fiath on their
part, they believed they were doing the right thing, the fact is it
doesn't stand up journalistically.''

LEV ROKHLIN, 51, YELTSIN FOE, IS SLAIN; WIFE IS ACCUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Lev Rokhlin, a onetime Russian lieutenant general,
national legislator and leader of a splinter movement aimed at
deposing President Boris Yeltsin, was killed with a shot to his
head July 3 after a family celebration at his country home outside
Moscow. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Radical members of the lower house of parliament, in which
Rohklin served, quickly asserted that Rokhlin had been silenced to
cover up scandals in Yeltsin's Defense Ministry. But investigators
said later that Rokhlin's wife, Tamara, had confessed to the
killing, saying it was ``due to a hostile relationship'' with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rokhlin said she had shot her husband about 4 a.m. Friday
as he slept after a birthday celebration for his son, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Rokhlin was one of Yeltsin's fiercest critics in parliament.
Since 1997 he had traveled throughout Russia, seeking to organize
military servicemen and retirees into a political force that could
force the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for such a force seemed huge. Conditions in the
military have deteriorated markedly in recent years, Yeltsin's
1994-96 war against Chechen rebels sapped military morale and
thousands of servicemen have been discharged with little prospect
of finding work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent opponents of Yeltsin, including his former
security chief and a former defense minister whom the president
dismissed on national television, threw their support behind
Rokhlin.
</P>
<P>
   But Rokhlin's group, Movement in Support of the Army, never
gained traction against the Yeltsin government. In May Rokhlin
tried to stage a mass protest of army servicemen, but the only
notable result was the detention of two members of his former army
unit for ``illegal political agitation.'' And later that month,
supporters of Yeltsin in Parliament struck an unlikely alliance
with Communists to strip Rokhlin of his post as chairman of the
defense committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rokhlin was born in Kazakhstan and was a star student in
military academies of the former Soviet Union. He was decorated for
his service in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the early
1980s and later for service during the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to parliament in 1995 as a member of a
pro-Yeltsin political party, which he later quit to organize his
own political movement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just a modest cultural note for all the patriots whose
hearts will swell and ears will ring to the sky-lighted explosions
of the 1812 Overture on Saturday night: It all started here.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Revolution _ though that, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the Boston Pops tradition now practiced in scores if not
hundreds of spots around the country, that the orchestra caps its
Fourth of July concert with Tchaikovsky's (undeniably non-American,
but who cares?) 1812 Overture and air-splitting rounds of cannon
fire along with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a quirky friendship between two men: Arthur
Fiedler, the late, legendary, curmudgeonly conductor of the Boston
Pops Orchestra, and David Mugar, a millionaire Boston businessman
who has sponsored every one of Boston's Fourth of July concerts
since they took on this explosive form 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Mugar and Fiedler bonded partly because they shared an
eccentric love: driving around the city listening in on police
radio traffic and hustling to the scenes of fires. When Fiedler
mentioned to Mugar that he was concerned about the dwindling
attendance at the Pops concerts at the Hatch Shell, the stage that
sits like a giant open clam next to the Charles River, Mugar
devised a pyrotechnical plan and provided the money to implement
it.
</P>
<P>
   Mugar persuaded Fiedler to offer the 1812 Overture, replete with
howitzer fire and the church bells Tchaikovsky had written into the
score. And, he said, ``I came up with the idea, just by luck, I
guess now, of having fireworks at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugar said he told Fiedler he was not sure the explosive ending
could be coordinated well, to which Fiedler replied, ``Oh, don't
worry about it, just let all hell break loose at the end of the
piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The public loved it, to the point that just two years later, in
the bicentennial celebrations, an estimated 400,000 people gathered
for Boston's Fourth of July concert, gaining it entry into the
Guinness Book of World Records as the best-attended classical
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance _ which depends heavily on the weather _ has never
matched that record, though organizers have hopes for this year,
given last year's audience of 375,000. More sound towers and, for
the first time, giant television screens have been added.
</P>
<P>
   If the concerts have not been getting bigger, they have been
getting more technologically ambitious and complex. Ken Clark, a
Boston-based fireworks artist, has begun creating pyro-musicals
that use exactly timed bursts to mirror the music, painting the sky
in time with it. This year, his display, which is being kept secret
beforehand, is to last a half-hour, up from 25 minutes last year.
</P>
<P>
   And so fireworks that cost perhaps $10,000 in the early years
now cost around $200,000, said Mugar, who owns several malls,
hotels and other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   On a barge loaded with mortars in the middle of the Charles,
Clark said on Thursday that technology has so progressed that a
one-second fireworks effect that would once have taken two crews
half a day to wire up can now be done with a swipe and click of a
computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to marking the 25th anniversary of the 1812
fireworks, Saturday's concert is likely to mark the end of a
tradition. Mugar and his nonprofit organization, Boston's Fourth of
July, have been paying pretty much the entire bill for the party,
nearly $1 million this year. He has finally said that his pockets
are not bottomless.
</P>
<P>
   Probably next year, he said, he will seek the kind of discreet
sponsorship that another Boston tradition, the Boston Marathon,
has, with company logos here and there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The change goes a bit against the grain. Peter Fiedler, Arthur
Fiedler's son, who cues the cannons at the concert, recalled that
one year, an advertising blimp ``flew over the Esplanade during the
concert and David went berserk'' because he did not want the event
commercialized.
</P>
<P>
   But injections of money would allow the Boston Pops to bring in
ever greater stars as guest performers, he said, and allow ever
more advanced technological feats, possibly including a giant
television screen mounted on a barge in the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, asked about the direction in which he would like to take
the concerts, Mugar, their executive producer and an unabashed
aficionado of the logistics involved in such huge events, mentioned
a homey vision.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has always seen the Pops concerts as gigantic
versions of the town picnics, oompah band concerts and little
fireworks displays in smaller locales. So, maybe someday, he said,
``I think it'd great if we could give everybody free hot dogs and
Cokes and ice cream. Something real American.''

FOX MAY BROADCAST HALF OF RED SOX GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Fox will probably be looming large in your living rooms in the
near future. Word has it that Fox-TV network's Channel 25 is
closing in on a deal with the Red Sox to broadcast half the team's
games, and farther down the road airing nearly all of them. At
present, NESN and Channel 68, owned by Boston University, split the
Sox schedule, airing 75 games each with the rest going to ESPN or
Fox's national broadcasts. Fox is looking to hunt down Channel 68
first by wrestling away the games on free TV. And then is expected
to make a deal to buy NESN. The Red Sox own half of the cable
network. Fox's goal appears to be to add the Red Sox and NESN to
its ever-expanding telecasts of Major League Baseball across the
nation. Boston has the last indepedent cable TV affiliation. The
Red Sox hope to push their local TV income well over $20 million
and then make a huge score on the sale of NESN, giving them more
money to invest in a new Fenway Park.

   Bill Fitch on when he knew Larry Bird was special: ``It took
about two weeks. That's how long it took for him that first year
(1979-80 season) to learn our system and what his own job was
within that system. Once he had that down, then he started to put
the Larry Bird touch on it. He was great at doing all the things he
could in his own personal game, and yet always doing them within
the system. He wasn't about doing a one-on-one thing. Larry wanted
the team to excel and to make the players around him better, and he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitch's most vivid memory of Bird: ``It was the year we went
down 3-1 in the playoffs to Philly and then came back to beat them.
The morning after we lost that third game I had to talk to the team
knowing that most of them probably thought we were finished. I
talked about winning the next game and just focusing on that.
Because if we won the second game, that would be like winning the
third game (in Boston) and if we got them to 3-3 then it would be
Choke City on them and we could beat them. Every time I said one of
these things Larry sat there nodding his head yes. And doing it in
such a way that everyone else on the team could see him nodding his
head yes. He was sending the message to the other guys that this
could be done. And then they all went out and made it happen.''
Bird announced this week that Fitch will be one of the two
presenters when he is inducted to the Hall of Fame next spring.

   Jerry Glanville, former head coach of the Houston Oilers and
Atlanta Falcons, on multi-talented outfielder Brian Jordan of the
St. Louis Cardinals who played three years in the Falcons'
defensive back field: ``Put this in the famous last-words category.
Jordan is playing safety for me on the Falcons. He wants a new
contract. I go to management and tell them: `This kid is as good at
safety, as Deion (Sanders) is at corner.' And he was. He wanted
another $100,000 more. For that, he would have stayed with us and
not gone to baseball. But (management) said, `Don't worry, he'll be
back. He can't hit the curveball. What a laugh that turned out to
be.'' Jordan has led the National League in hitting most of the
season, and is one of the best all-around athletes in pro sports.
``I coached 31 years of football and he is the only one I was ever
around I can say that he never missed an open-field tackle. And
every time he made a tackle, he came up with a smile on his face.
He loved to play that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The past couple of weeks have been big ones for Glanville, who
is a race car driver when he's not broadcasting for Fox or doing
the Patriots' exhibition games. ``I won my first race ever last
Saturday night,'' said Glanville. ``It was a great thrill for me. I
beat the guy (Ronnie Sanders) on the final curve of the final lap.
You don't see that happen and very often. And for coincidence, I'm
sponsored by a Boston outfit, Unifirst Uniforms. (Today) I'll be
racing on CBS in Milwaukee. I've got races for most of the rest of
the summer and in between I've got to do four Patriot preseason
games on TV. They like me in Boston because of my (Southern)
accent. They can't figure out what I'm saying, which makes us even,
because I can't understand them either.''

   Nomar Garciaparra has an unsual All-Star bonus package. If he
makes the All-Star team four of the next five years, he could end
up making an additional $500,000. His contract gives the Red Sox an
option for 2003 at $10.5 million. If Nomar makes the All-Star squad
four times before then, that amount becomes $11 million. But he
missed out on the chance to get the first one this season.

best two teams into the finals. There were a lot of good games in
the playoffs this year, but they were all before the finals. The
Bruins could have gotten to the final. They were better than
Washington. They just didn't win the series.''

   As sports fans, we have become used to owners getting their
butts handed to them whenever they square off with player unions in
labor negotiations. But this NBA lockout might be different. In the
past, the unions have threatened to decertify, but that may not
have the clout it did before. In Brown vs. NFL, a 1996 case, a a
judge's ruling made it more difficult to use decertification
(giving up a recognizied labor union to become a trade association
with no bargaining powers) as a negotiating tool. The NFL Players'
Association went this route and decertified for four years. It then
went to court on an anti-trust basis and beat the owners for $190
million in damages. However, in the Brown case (he was Antony
Brown, a practice squad player with Washington) the court opinion
frowned on using decertification as a tactic, and hinted that any
union trying to do so in the future should have to do it for a long
time and not as a charade, before being allowed to move forward on
an anti-trust basis. Right now, the owners are holding the cards.
At impasse, they can implement their own rules if the players come
back to play. The feeling is that no new deal will be done; that
the league will stay out of business at least for a month into
December. Meanwhile, the owners will be getting money from the TV
networks to keep their franchises going, and the players will be
losing big money with every missed game.

   Thornton was a big disappointment for the Bruins this past

HULL SIGNS WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Tom Hicks went dipping into his wallet once
again yesterday and stunned the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars owner came up with his third consecutive summer of
successfully luring a major free agent to Dallas when the Stars
signed All-Star winger Brett Hull to a three-year, $17 million
contract. The move automatically answers the Stars' biggest need
for a high-scoring winger and renders moot speculation that the
team would pursue lesser stars Geoff Courtnall or Wendel Clark.
</P>
<P>
   While Stars general manager Bob Gainey said the Stars still have
interest in Clark, the signing of Hull is significantly more
important. A three-time first-team NHL All-Star with the St. Louis
Blues, Hull brings a pedigree for guaranteed scoring backed by 554
career goals in 801 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player with a great knack for scoring goals,''
Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who turns 34 Aug. 9, joins goalie Ed Belfour (three years,
$10 million) and winger Pat Verbeek (three years, $9.3 million) as
free-agent home runs hit by Hicks, who has owned the Stars since
1995. As Belfour did last season, Hull turned down more money from
another team, according to his agent, Mike Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a chance to play for a franchise like Dallas, to have a
legitimate chance to be a champion, every player wants that,'' Hull
said. ``This is a great organization that is very serious about
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won the bidding for Hull over a host of suitors that
included the Chicago Blackhawks, who signed Doug Gilmour to a
three-year, $18 million contract yesterday, as well as the
Washington Capitals and Los Angeles Kings. Hull's father, Bobby, a
member of the Hockey Hall of Fame nicknamed ``The Golden Jet.''
played for the Blackhawks and pushed hard for Brett to follow in
his footsteps. Adam Oates, a former teammate of Hull's, plays for
the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   But still, the Stars closed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of strong ownership and good management and
quality players on our team, that has made us very attractive to
people like Pat Verbeek and Ed Belfour and now Brett Hull,'' Stars
president Jim Lites said. ``It has seemed to get easier for us as
the years have gone on. We don't have to do the big sales pitch
now. It's a part of the hockey mind-set that Dallas is a great city
to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hull joining the team, the Stars have a collection of
forwards that includes Mike Modano (21 goals), Joe Nieuwendyk (39
goals), Verbeek (31 goals) and Hull (27 goals). Toss role players
Jamie Langenbrunner and Jere Lehtinen (23 goals apiece) and the
Stars seem to have a roster that should be able to survive the rash
of injuries that cripple the team's offense in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this gives us is just one more great player to add to the
room,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I don't think you can
ever have too much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Hull likely will be placed on a line with Modano
and Lehtinen. Hull's natural position is right wing, but he has
played the left side with the Blues for the past season and a half.
Lehtinen also could switch to left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll experiment with things in training camp and during the
exhibition season, but that's definitely how it will start out,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who labeled himself ``primarily a goal-scorer,'' is coming
off the lowest goal-scoring season of his 12-year NHL career,
tallying 27 goals in 66 games and missing 16 games with a broken
hand. But he also had 45 assists, and his 72 points would have led
the Stars. Nieuwendyk was the Stars' top scorer with 69 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed last season that he can play in a defensive-minded
system,'' Hitchcock said, when questioned about Hull's defensive
deficiencies. ``Obviously, that was a concern, but \RSt. Louis
coach\S Joel Quenneville's system is very similar to ours, and he
played very well in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not well enough for the Blues to keep him, however. Hull was
close to signing a three-year, $15 million deal with the Blues last
month but balked when they didn't include a no-trade clause in the
contract. The Stars, while reluctant to do so at first, Barnett
said, worked a trade-veto clause into their contract, which will
pay Hull $4.5 million next season, $5.5 the next and $7 million in
2001-02. Hull also has an option for a fourth year at $7 million.
The Stars can automatically sign him at that amount, or he can
choose to take the option if he meets certain performance
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a player that we had targeted early,'' Gainey said. ``We
obviously had a need for goal-scoring, and he was the top
goal-scorer available. We didn't know what he was interested in,
and we didn't know what other teams might offer, but we were able
to come to terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms that have Hull so happy, he said he isn't disappointed to
leave St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly not,'' he said. ``I spent 11 years there and had
a great rapport with the fans. But with the new regime that came
in, there was never any real attachment to that. So I'm very
excited to be part of the Dallas Stars.''

POLLUTION PROBLEMS FESTER SOUTH OF THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Repeating to add photo note; no other changes.)  
 (JT)

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Every day Juarez, the Mexican city across the
Rio Grande from El Paso, produces 75 million gallons of raw sewage,
much of which flows through irrigation ditches into the river, the
prime source of water for nearly every community in both Mexico and
the United States between here and the Gulf of Mexico. Juarez has
no sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   In Tijuana, Mexico, near San Diego, a sewage treatment system is
in the planning stage, but for now the city continues to discharge
sewage into the Pacific, periodically requiring American health
officials to close beaches in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to provide
the border area with billions of dollars to address air and water
pollution _ and, in fact, both Juarez and Tijuana recently had
financing for sewage treatment systems approved by the bank set up
under what were known as NAFTA's side accords.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly five years after NAFTA was ratified, not a single
environmental project financed by the bank is in operation. To the
more than 10 million people living along the border between the
United States and Mexico, the money promised for the region's
serious environmental problems is too long and too little in the
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened so far does not at all meet the great promises
that were made,'' said Beatriz Vera, a program officer with the
Paso del Norte Health Foundation, which works to improve health
conditions in El Paso, Juarez and southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that environmental conditions along the border
are making people sick. On the Texas side, rates of hepatitis,
diarrheal diseases and gastroenteritis _ all commonly linked to
water and sanitation problems _ are two to six times the state
average. And conditions are worse on the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say pollution problems along the border are
especially daunting because the solution often lies on the other
side, in Mexico. That is true for water pollution in the Rio
Grande, stretches of which remain a dumping ground for human and
industrial wastes, and for air pollution like the gray haze that
periodically engulfs the remote Big Bend National Park in Texas,
giving it the smoggiest air of any national park in the West.
</P>
<P>
   American officials trace much of the haze to a mammoth complex
of coal-fired electricity plants in northern Mexico, about 125
miles upwind of Big Bend, but they have been unable to negotiate an
agreement with Mexico to build scrubbers that would cut the plants'
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico remains strapped for money, and many elected officials on
the American side are urging that the United States give it much
more assistance to develop solutions that could help people on both
sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look upon the border as an economic and political dividing
label,'' said State Rep. Andrew Nichols, a Democrat from Tucson,
Ariz., who also is director of the rural health office of the
University of Arizona College of Medicine. ``But disease knows no
border. If we worked more collaboratively with the Mexican
government, if we took that broader perspective, we'd be helping
our own people. It's not just generosity, it's self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But spending American money on projects like sewage treatment
plants in another country is a sticky diplomatic and political
issue. ``It's very hard to convince Congress we need money to deal
with problems that seem to be in Mexico,'' said Doug Farquhar, an
expert on environmental health issues for the National Conference
of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, NAFTA provided for a binational agency, the
Border Environment Cooperation Commission in Juarez, to certify
cleanup projects, and a $450 million commitment from both nations
for a bank to finance the work. President Clinton and other
proponents of the free-trade pact said the bank, the North American
Development Bank, could use its lending authority to leverage up to
$8 billion for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the devaluation of the peso in 1994 forced many Mexican
communities to curtail plans for landfills and sewage treatment
plants, even with low-interest loans available. In other cases,
Mexican officials have disagreed over what technological steps are
needed to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has certified 21 environmental projects costing
$473 million, including the sewage treatment plants in Tijuana and
Juarez. But the bank has provided only a fraction of the money so
far, and no project is operating yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that NAFTA's environmental side accords
were flawed from the start because they did not provided a specific
way for Mexican or American cities to identify tax revenue from new
commercial activity generated by the pact's removal of trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still no system in place by which the growth,
especially on the Mexican side, can begin to pay for itself,'' said
Mary Kelly, director of the Texas Center for Policy Studies, an
environmental research group that has conducted extensive studies
of the border's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the problems originate south of the border. Mexican
officials express outrage over Texas' plans for a low-level
radioactive waste dump in Sierra Blanca, a town 80 miles east of
here near the border, and anger over that issue has hampered
negotiations on air pollution in Big Bend and on other cross-border
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the border's environmental problem is simply the
population growth on both sides. It is most striking in Mexico;
Juarez, for example, which had 250,000 people in 1960, now has five
times that number. The overall border population has more than
doubled, to more than 10 million, and is expected to double again
in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they express frustration over the belated progress, some
experts here see signs of hope in the fact that the development
bank is approving loans, such as the $31.2 million for the first
two waste water treatment plants in Juarez's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow, but this is much more than a technical problem,''
said Jim VanDerslice, a professor of environmental sciences at the
University of Texas-Houston School of Public Health at El Paso.
``It's politics, it's people, it's organizations. When you're
working binationally, it's just difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of cleanup plans say they are working as
fast as they can. ``A lot of people would say it's slower than
expected,'' said Angeles Villarreal, a spokeswoman for the
cooperation commission. ``But once you are working on these
problems, you realize that it takes a while. These are complicated
issues.''

INSURERS LIKELY TO PRESS FOR ANTI-SEX-HARASSMENT POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insurance companies are likely to press New Jersey employers to
develop strict policies for preventing and remedying sexual
harassment in the wake of a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court
that workers' compensation insurance must pay for injuries arising
from sexual harassment, insurance industry executives and lawyers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, lawyers and insurance companies are still studying
the June 15 decision, which appears to have national implications.
The court ruled that as a matter of public policy, insurance
companies cannot exclude sexual harassment damages from their
workers' compensation coverage, which every employer is legally
required to buy. Such exclusions are now standard in workers'
compensation policies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may raise the cost of workers' compensation
policies, insurance executives say, and may prompt companies and
their insurers to seek relief by lobbying the state Legislature for
a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, insurance companies are likely to start
requiring clients to have the kind of anti-harassment policies and
remedies that were outlined last month by the U.S. Supreme Court in
two landmark decisions on employer liability in sexual harassment
cases. The court held that a lawsuit cannot succeed if a company
has an anti-harassment policy with an effective complaint procedure
in place and the employee has unreasonably failed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between this kind of decision in New Jersey and the Supreme
Court's decision on supervisory liability, clients will have to pay
a lot of attention to developing their own internal compliance
mechanisms,'' said Carmine Iannaccone, a partner at the law firm of
Hannoch Weisman in Roseland, N.J., which represents companies that
are suing their insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in several states have rejected efforts to have workers'
compensation policies cover sexual harassment damages. But rulings
by the New Jersey Supreme Court have proved influential with other
high courts around the country, said Kevin Bruno, another partner
at Hannoch Weisman.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey decision should also make it easier for victims
of sexual harassment who win damages in court to collect them, said
Elizabeth Zuckerman, a partner in the firm of Zuckerman &AMP; Fisher in
Lawrenceville, N.J. She represented Lisa Schmidt, the plantiff in
the lawsuit _ against Personalized Audio Visual Inc. and its
president, Dennis Smith _ that was at the center of the New Jersey
Supreme Court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schmidt said that Smith had fondled her and demanded sexual
favors, which caused not just emotional distress but also bodily
injury in the form of an eating disorder and an attempt at suicide.
In 1994, a jury awarded Ms. Schmidt $80,000 in damages plus legal
fees, but she could not collect because the company had gone out of
business, Ms. Zuckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's insurance carrier, USF&AMP;G, argued that coverage for
such injuries was excluded under its workers' compensation policy,
a position that was rejected by the court because of Ms. Schmidt's
physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company has asked the court to reconsider its
ruling; the lawyer representing USF&AMP;G, Kevin Wolff, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey decision comes as the number of sexual harassment
lawsuits is soaring and as companies are increasingly trying to
find ways to get insurance companies to cover the heavy costs of
defending against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is THE growth area in labor law,'' said Samuel
Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at
New York University Law School, ``and these cases are expensive and
very hard to defend against.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, lawyers around the country are likely to make
similar arguments in trying to get insurance companies to cover
sexual harassment cases through workers' compensation policies.
``This creates a framework for sharp attorneys in how to get
coverage,'' said Kenneth Martino, a senior executive at the
consulting firm of Tillinghast-Towers Perrin in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies do not believe that workers' compensation
policies were meant to cover sexual harassment damages, said Doreen
Spadorcia, a senior vice president of Travelers Property &AMP;
Casualty, a leading seller of commercial insurance. ``I think this
will be a decision that most insurers will say doesn't make
sense,'' she said, adding that many companies, including hers,
offer separate policies specifically to cover wrongful employment
practices.
</P>
<P>
   If the New Jersey decision stands, insurance companies will
probably raise the price of workers' compensation policies, said
Keith Anderson, a spokesman for Travelers. Such price increases, he
added, may well prompt New Jersey's Legislature to change the law
to keep workers' compensation policies from having to cover
harassment injuries.

LAWRENCE CAMPBELL, 84, CRITIC, PAINTER, AND ART INSTRUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawrence Campbell, a critic who chronicled New York's
contemporary art scene for nearly four decades, while also
painting, teaching art history and working as an editor, died June
30 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 84 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was most closely associated with the Art Students
League on West 57th Street, where he went to study painting in 1946
and to some extent never left. Working in an office filled with
books he willingly lent to interested students, he became known as
the school's ``resident intellectual.'' He edited and contributed
reviews to its newsletter, wrote and designed its catalogs (many of
which won awards) and became so knowledgeable about the school
itself that he was often called its historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our legacy because it was preserved by Lawrence
Campbell,'' Joanne Kuebler, the school's director, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's innate understanding of the league's loose atelier
system, in which students studied with the artists of their choice
and did not receive degrees, may have reflected his own peripatetic
education. At the league, he studied with Vaclav Vytlacil, Morris
Kantor and Will Barnet. He often questioned the usefulness of a
university education for most artists.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was born in Paris on May 21, 1914. His father, James
Lawrence Campbell, a painter, was descended from 17th-century
settlers of Virginia; his mother, Alice Ormond, a writer, from
French Huguenots who came over on the Mayflower. He attended
Westminister School in London, where he learned French and German,
as well as the London Central School of Arts and Crafts and the
Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris. Enlisting in the U.S.
Army in 1941, he served in the Counter-Intelligence Corps, mostly
in North Africa and Iran, and was part of a detachment that assumed
the duties of the U.S. Secret Service at the Tehran Conference in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the league, Campbell's hundreds of articles and reviews
appeared mostly in Art News and Art in America, but also Craft
Horizons, Portfolio and Today's Art. He was known for his fairness
and generosity as a critic and for his advocacy of all kinds of
representational painting. His taste and knowledge were extremely
broad. His subjects ranged from abstract painters like Burgoyne
Diller and Harry Holtzman, to figurative painters like Graham Nixon
and Robert De Niro to artists who operated somewhere in between,
like Elaine de Kooning and Steve Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also taught at Brooklyn College for many years and,
from 1959 to 1990, at Pratt Institute. He had his first exhibition
in New York at the Contemporary Arts Gallery in 1951 and
subsequently exhibited at the Tanager Gallery, the Kornblee Gallery
and the Green Mountain Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Audrey Holtmann; a son,
Ian B.R. Campbell, of Mapleton, Utah; a daughter, Sarah A.O.
Campbell, of New York City; a son from an earlier marriage, Richard
E. Campbell, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; and one grandchild.

POPE'S GUIDANCE ON DISSENT PROVOKES NEW DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In issuing an apostolic letter this week deeming some
of the most controversial issues within the Roman Catholic Church
beyond debate _ including euthanasia, the ordination of women and
sexual relations outside marriage _ Pope John Paul II ignited new
debate among Roman Catholics in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the letter made clear that the pope was addressing
Catholic theologians in the United States who question the
Vatican's authority on doctrine, threatening ``just punishment''
for dissenters, it left the pope's supporters and his questioners,
parish priests and lay people, trying to decipher precisely what
the decree means, whether it restricts freedom of speech, and how
it is to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would see it rather as a clarification of certain issues
that have been discussed by theologians,'' Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York said in a statement criticizing claims that the
letter's effects would be stifling, and that it was a slap at
liberal elements in the church.
</P>
<P>
   His statement added, ``I welcome it and I am looking forward to
seeing the entirety of the document so that I can promulgate it in
the archdiocese of New York in the manner I think it was
intended.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was not alone in waiting to read the pope's letter. One
problem for priests and lay people was that the letter, which
inscribed into church law the articles of faith that are
``definitive'' and binding to all Catholics, was released only in
Italian and Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as ``a priest in the trenches,'' not a
theologian, the Rev. Walter Modrys, pastor of St. Ignatius Loyola
Church on Park Avenue in Manhattan, said he was struggling with the
prospect of explaining and possibly defending the letter in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people in the church don't accept the
prohibition against women being ordained,'' Modrys said. ``To
declare that the church believes this is an infallible truth, when
a lot of people in the church don't believe that or understand it,
raises serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it then up to the laity to decide what to accept and what to
reject?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Modrys said, ``it is not the personal whim of the pope
that determines what is infallible, nor is it a popularity contest
to be decided by vote. But there is a great deal of wisdom and
grace in the laity and we must not ignore that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Lawrence Baird, a spokesman for the Diocese of Orange
County in California, which has 606,000 Roman Catholics in its
jurisdiction, called the pope's words ``comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have norms and guidelines,'' Baird said. ``We have
to be able to recognize what is the truth and what isn't. This
should be seen as liberating, not oppressive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jo Iannello, a Catholic living in Los Angeles, said she fully
supported the expansion of canon law and punishment for dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests are there to interpret the reading of the gospel, not
to foist their opinions on people,'' Ms. Iannello said. ``They can
think what they like, but they can't vocalize it. I'm a Catholic
person who believes in the pope, certainly not blindly, but I
believe in church policy. I don't believe in smorgasbord Catholics
who think that they can take parts of the religion that they want
and leave the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one issue that predominated, it was what some see
as severe restrictions on speech and thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disturbing that he would attempt to shut down public
debate over issues that people feel so strongly about in their
church,'' Suzanne Snyder of St. Paul said as she walked out of St.
Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. ``I think that's oppressive.''

TEACHERS' UNION CHIEF STRESSES QUALITY OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In his two years as president of the National
Education Association, the nation's largest labor union, Bob Chase,
has repeatedly been accused of sleeping with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Those accusations started last year when he began to push the
union in a radical new direction, calling on it to discard its
industrial-style, us-against-them tactics and instead cooperate
with school boards to help them improve education.
</P>
<P>
   But while shunning the tactics of blue-collar unions, Chase has
often surprised his union's 2.3 million members by saying they have
an important lesson to learn from the steelworkers. For decades, he
explains, steelworkers focused on pushing their wages ever higher,
while worrying little about product quality, the result being that
customers turned to imports, the industry declined and thousands of
unionized workers lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If public school teachers do not work to improve the quality of
their product, Chase warned, the push for vouchers might gather
steam, channeling many more children into private schools and
jeopardizing the jobs of public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If unions don't accept that quality is their issue, if they
say quality is just up to management, then problems are
inevitable,'' said Chase, a 55-year-old former social studies
teacher in Danbury, Conn. ``The best insurance there is for
members' jobs is for members to make sure their workplace is
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase even endorsed peer-review programs that pressure bad
teachers to move into other professions, or, failing that,
recommend their dismissal. For many teachers this was out-and-out
heresy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you were a social studies teacher before you became
president of the NEA,'' one outraged group of Wisconsin teachers
wrote him, ``you should understand the result of appeasement in
Eastern Europe in the '30s and '40s.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chase is hearing a new round of accusations of heresy
as he campaigns 18 hours a day to persuade 10,000 union delegates
gathered here that they should vote to merge with the education
association's archrival, the American Federation of Teachers.
Joining the two unions together would create a colossus with almost
3.3 million members, giving the teachers even more clout in
Washington as well as a single voice to fight foes pushing for
vouchers and an end to tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders acknowledge that the delegates might narrowly
reject the merger by not giving it the required two-thirds majority
when they vote on Sunday. But Chase remains optimistic,
notwithstanding attacks from anti-merger teachers who say the AFT
is too militant.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association was founded in 1857 as a
genteel professional association that shunned collective bargaining
for over a century. But when the teachers' federation flexed its
muscles in the 1960s and 1970s and made giant strides in wages and
benefits, the NEA quickly imitated the American Federation of
Teachers and became a regular union, although many association
members still perceive the teachers' federation to be more
confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Many NEA members also oppose the merger because it would push
the association into the AFL-CIO, which many see as an organization
for blue-collar workers, not for lofty professionals like
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, many merger opponent love the National Education
Association as it is, and their logic is, ``if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing what could be his biggest test ever, Chase said,
``What we're talking about is a very historic opportunity that is a
very difficult thing for a lot of members to accept. There's an
enormous amount of passion for the NEA, and many are wary of
putting together something that will mean the dissolution of the
NEA and the creation of a new organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the two unions agreed on a set of principles for
the merger, which aims to end a bitter rivalry in which the two
spent more than $100 million over the past two decades competing
with each other to recruit members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending our wasteful rivalry would enable the NEA and AFT to
serve our members and advance public education with far greater
strength, vigor and focus,'' Chase said in his keynote speech
Friday as the convention opened.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, amiable man, Chase talks with the neat logic of
an appellate lawyer and the ease of a born politician. Born in
Wellfleet, Mass., he went to Providence College, spent two years at
a seminary, but then decided to forgo the priesthood in favor of
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   His first teaching job was at a school for delinquents in
Providence, where his salary was $4,800. From there, Chase, who is
divorced and has two grown daughters, moved to Danbury, where he
taught for 25 years, interrupted by a two-year hitch in the Army.
While in Danbury, he began his steady climb up the NEA's ladder.
</P>
<P>
   If the education association delegates approve the merger this
weekend and if the teachers' federation delegates do likewise at
their convention in two weeks, Chase and AFT president Sandra
Feldman would serve as co-founding presidents of the new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two often say they get along so well that they often finish
each other's sentences. ``He has played an unprecedented role in
getting out front on important issues as president,'' said Ms.
Feldman. ``He's someone who cares very much about kids and public
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that whether or not the merger is approved, he will
plow ahead with his plans to emphasize not just bread-and-butter
issues, but the teachers' role in improving schools.
</P>
<P>
   He has even won praise from some longtime critics of teachers'
unions, although other foes say his change in direction is mere
window dressing, complaining, for instance, that only about 30 of
the union's 13,000 locals have adopted reforms like peer review.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of a Gorbachev figure,'' said Chester Finn, a senior
fellow at the Hudson Institute. ``He's attempting to take an almost
completely harmful institution and at the very least put a very
different face on it and perhaps also modernize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Chase, the union has endorsed charter schools, innovative
public schools that are allowed to operate free of many of the
bureaucratic rules. While he vigorously opposes merit pay and
vouchers, he is constantly urging school districts to spend more
money on professional development so that teachers can keep up with
what is new in pedagogy and in their fields of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Every chance he gets, Chase hails peer review, a system in which
expert teachers advise other teachers on how to teach better.
Despite criticisms that peer review throws some teachers overboard,
Chase said it is good for the profession and children if
unsatisfactory teachers who fail to improve have the choice of
finding another profession or not having their contracts renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Defending this controversial stance, he said, ``It's not an
I-gotcha program. It's good for the profession. It helps enhance
the skills of educators. Those who are unable to take advantage of
the process, it recommends that they go into other professions. The
primary focus is improved instruction. If that happens, everyone
wins.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ENTERTAINING WITH FLASH AND PANACHE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eddie Layton's perky organ music rises from Yankee
Stadium, wafts across the Harlem River, mixes with the blare of
hip-hop from Rucker Park at 155th Street and floats through my
dining room window.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankee home run triggers a siren that wails in celebration;
when someone dunks down below, makes a great block or a great pass,
a searing, swelling ``oooooooohhhhhhhh'' erupts from the crowd.
This is the real basketball season, a time from July and August
when the game is put outside and allowed to run without shackles or
leg irons.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers' center, showed up at the
Entertainer's Basketball Classic, the annual summer tournament at
Rucker Park. There was no wild mob scene. Just kids, lots of kids,
who had never seen Shaq before. He patiently signed plenty of
autographs. Then the crowd let him be, and O'Neal sat in the stands
and took in the theater of the game as it was meant to be played.
</P>
<P>
   The Entertainer's Basketball Classic league replaced the Rucker
tournament at this location several years ago; the Rucker is now
located at 145th Street and Lenox Avenue. This is a different scene
at the Entertainer's Classic, a different crowd, much younger and
livelier and putting a premium on excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rucker crowd liked excitement, too, but was very
knowledgeable about the game,'' said Rodger Murray, an official for
tournaments at the site nearly 20 years and the scoreboard operator
for the Knicks. ``They looked for the nuances and the intricacies.
The pick and rolls, the back door. Now you have a much younger
crowd. Here we're talking about a lot of glitz, the flashy moves,
the dunks, a lot of hip-hop things.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue has taken notice. Tommy Hilfiger, Perry Ellis and
Reebok are among several sponsors whose banners hang on the fence.
The styles of the inner city fuel fashion trends throughout the
country, on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Each glitzy game has its defining moment, when the winner of the
game within the game is decided. That moment Thursday came with
Sugar Hill leading Kenny's Kings by 60-54. There had been a running
debate between the fan on my left and a younger fan on my right
about fundamentals versus glitz. The embodiment of fundamentals was
the 5-foot-10-inch Kareem Reid, of the University of Arkansas by
way of St. Raymond High in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   For the younger fan, the 5-8 Edward ``Booger'' Smith of Brooklyn
was the real truth. Smith, from Westinghouse High and an Arizona
junior college, was featured on the cover of a national sports
magazine and was part of a documentary on the Brooklyn Soul in the
Hole tournament. This was his first time he was coming Uptown with
a reputation to uphold. The older fan remarked that Reid made
smart, snappy passes; the younger fan roared each time Smith made
one of his signature passes, though not always to the right man.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Smith raced down the left sideline and tried to take
the baseline against the stronger Reid, who cut him off. Smith
tried to shake free with speedy crossover dribbles, but Reid held
his ground. The older fan shouted, ``Look at that defense, look at
that ...''
</P>
<P>
   But before he could finish, Smith picked up his dribble, reached
around Reid's neck, put up an underhand shot that he banked in and
drew a foul from a bewildered Reid. The crowd roared. The fan who
had argued Reid's case leaped out of his chair. Even Reid gave
Smith five.
</P>
<P>
   Reid tried to get even. He drove and drew a foul on Smith, but
the crowd was still buzzing over Smith's Globetrotter-like shot.
</P>
<P>
   The older fan boasted that Reid's team won, 102-93. The younger
fan said: ``Who cares? Booger won the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the deejay/public address announcer was building the thunder
for Monday's game featuring the Bad Boys: Ron Artest, a bruising
forward, and Eric Barkley, the freshman guard who will be his
teammate at St. John's next season. The fans filed out, some
mingling with the players, others talking about who did what to
whom, most simply enjoying the ambiance of a summer with good
basketball. They'll come back full force Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the crowd had thinned, four of us stood around
talking about the evening's events, wondering what it all meant.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these players go off to big colleges. The cream will
sign contracts and probably won't be back. Madison Avenue rides the
wave of urban chic. This generation's legends _ the Boogers, the
Alley Mo's, the Skip to My Lou's, the Black Widows of Harlem _ will
provide more fodder for some other explorer's documentary, someone
else's book.
</P>
<P>
   And cheers will flow eternally over Harlem.

CALIFORNIA FEDERAL BANK PARENT TO REFINANCE DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The parent company of California Federal Bank
said it plans to refinance $1.8 billion worth of debt and preferred
stock to take advantage of lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   First Nationwide Holdings Inc., a privately held financial
institution based in San Francisco, expects to replace
substantially all of its long-term debt and California Federal's
preferred stock with new notes, or debt.
</P>
<P>
   The notes will be issued under a new company that will be formed
when it completes its merger with Golden State Bancorp, the parent
of Glendale Federal Bank, based in suburban Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, in which new shares of Golden State will be issued
to First Nationwide's owners, is expected to close by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Thrift officials said Thursday they're refinancing the debt to
take advantage of lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's expected to be significant savings in interest expense
to do this,'' said Richard Terzian, chief financial officer of
California Federal.
</P>
<P>
   First Nationwide will take a refinancing charge in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Wagner, a fixed-income analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's
in New York, said the refinancing will improve overall cash flow
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   First Nationwide's balance sheet already benefits from the
merger with Golden State, which does not have any long-term debt,
Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger announcement, First Nationwide's notes were put
on S&AMP;P's credit watch with positive implications, meaning they
could be given a higher rating. The higher the rating, the better
the capability of the company issuing the debt to repay it.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's, another New York rating agency, on Thursday upgraded
First Nationwide's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Terzian said the new debt will be issued in the next few weeks
or months. Terms of the notes were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to refinance is good for investors because it will
lower interest costs for the new company.
</P>
<P>
   As for its institutional bondholders, who benefit from higher
interest rates, Terzian said they will receive a premium for
holding the debt in the past.

INDEPENDENCE DAY ONCE DIVIDED AMERICANS RATHER THAN BRING THEM
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category code ``e'')  
(JT) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hottest holiday argument this weekend may be
over whether a day at the beach is worth half a day spent in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But there were Independence Days two centuries ago when the
consummate celebration of American nationalism decayed into bitter
disputes between rival political parties, exceeding even the
political passions that the early Republic displayed for the other
364 days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At a lecture this week in the National Archives, historian Len
Travers of the Massachusetts Historical Society described how the
day became ensconced as a central rite of the emerging republic.
And in his book, Celebrating the Fourth (University of
Massachusetts Press, 1977), he recollects an era from the
ratification of the Constitution until the War of 1812 when, in
some cities, there was nothing nonpartisan about the Fourth of
July.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, a fellow could be beaten for wearing the wrong
party's colors on his hat, and Boston routinely threw two separate
celebrations, each controlled by one of the two contending
political parties of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It was like if today's Republicans, being the majority in
Congress, sponsored the nationally televised orchestral performance
this Saturday on the Capitol's west lawn (with pops conductor Erich
Kunzel, to be sure, plus Sha Na Na and other entertainers), while
President Clinton and the Democratic National Committee sang the
blues with Koko Taylor downtown by the Washington Monument
(supported in the parade by any marching bands that fell under
control of the commander-in-chief).
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, the parties were the Federalists, who
viewed the revolution as beginning with the Declaration of
Independence and ending neatly with the Constitution, and the
emergent Republicans, who saw a dynamic, continuing revolution and
who thrilled at its echoes in France.
</P>
<P>
   Although most American revolutionaries had hoped to avoid a
slide into partisanship, these parties, much like today's, often
sharply disagreed over economic and international policies. The
debate colored America's relations with England and France as those
foreign powers, still entrenched on the American continent, fought
for global dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston especially, these groups organized competing
celebrations, to a large degree transforming the Fourth of July
into an occasion for boisterous rallies for the party faithful,''
Travers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the rhetoric became more confrontational, July 4
sometimes carried with it an atmosphere of potential violence. By
1794, during negotiation of the Jay Treaty, which would have cast
in America's lot with Britain rather than with rival France,
something that Republicans opposed, Philadelphia's celebrations
verged on mayhem. But marching Republican tradesmen ultimately
retreated rather than fight the fully armed Federalist cavalry that
mobilized to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Boston was edgy, as crowds ransacked a British
vessel in the harbor two weeks before the Fourth. Had news of the
terms of the Jay Treaty not been delayed until July 6, Travers
wrote, bloodshed might not have been avoided there in 1795.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words, symbols and sometimes fists went on for years.
One year, a Boston merchant with Federalist sympathies roughed up a
French diplomat who wore a tricolor cockade on his hat. The scrap
of cloth was a provocative political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   According to Travers, the very idea of making the Fourth a
holiday took hold in part because the political parties wanted more
people at liberty to attend the contending rallies.
</P>
<P>
   By 1800, the year of Thomas Jefferson's election to the
presidency, the Federalists were in disarray, but they still
controlled Boston's city government and the city's official
celebrations. By 1802, the Republicans were mounting regular
counter-celebrations and the competition persisted for the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Federalist oratory reverberated in the Old South Meeting House;
the Republicans, not to be outdone, held their events at Faneuil
Hall, complete with Republican militia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1806, after the Republicans trounced the Federalists in
statewide elections, Boston's Federalist selectmen took revenge on
the victors with the news that Faneuil Hall was ``preengaged by the
federalists'' for Independence Day that year and the next year and
every year after. Driven out of Boston, the Republicans crossed the
Charles River and celebrated thereafter on Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the War of 1812, and the peace of 1815, did the
political winds shift enough to abate this partisanship. From then
on, Independence Day was mainly a nationalist event, Travers says.
</P>
<P>
   But he told his audience to listen carefully and think hard
about what modern Democrats and Republicans _ or for that matter,
speakers from third parties _ might say through the smoke of
Saturday's supposedly neutral barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The non-partisan was always the ideal,'' he told his audience
today. ``However, the subtext was often partisan, and I submit that
it often is, even today. Rituals have a purpose.''

CROATS BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Since splitting off from Yugoslavia seven
years ago, Croatia has made its name on the world's sporting field,
in basketball and soccer and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing it has accomplished rivals what it can achieve tonight
when it takes on Germany at Lyon's Stade Gerland for a berth in the
World Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nearly incomprehensible possibility for the tiny Balkan
nation of 4.7 million people, something that would reverberate far
beyond sporting boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just sport there are political repercussions, too,''
says Miroslav Blazevic, who has guided the surprising Croats into
the elite eight of the world's greatest soccer tournament. ``Before
(the victory over Romania in the second round), maybe 5 percent of
the people knew Croatia. Now, maybe 15 percent know. So, of course,
that is important to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   It is vital as the Croats continue to build relationships with
the rest of the world, an enterprise it has been pursuing since its
bloody civil war with the Serbians who wouldn't let go. That
Yugoslavia, better touted than its rival, has been eliminated from
the Cup while Croatia plays on is a matter of significant national
pride.
</P>
<P>
   And as unlikely as reaching the final four might appear Germany
has reached the World Cup final in five of the previous eight
tournaments Croatia is confident it can pull off an upset. Its
faith is built on what occurred two years ago, in the its first
major soccer tournament since the war. The Croats reached the
quarterfinals, where they lost to Germany, 2-1, in a controversial
match that left many in the country feeling they'd been cheated.
Avenging that defeat is certainly part of the motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's revenge,'' Blazevic admits. ``We'll do everything to beat
Germany. The Germans are our friends, and there's nothing better in
sport than beating your friends. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this German phenomenom. That's annoying for them. I
hope I know what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croats' key figure is Zvonimir Boban, a playmaking
midfielder regarded in his country the equal of any ``freedom
fighter'' for his actions one night in 1990. It occurred at a match
between Red Star Belgrade, the top Serbian club, and Dynamo Zagreb,
Croatia's No. 1 team, in which the tensions between the peoples
spilled out into fighting between the clubs' fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagreb supporters were chased onto the field by Red Star
fans, where they were met by Belgrade police, who began swinging
batons. Boban, then only 21, attacked an officer he saw beating a
couple Zagreb fans. He was punished by the Yugoslav federation but
hailed as a hero in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what any normal person would do and defended innocent
people who had no way of protecting themselves from their
attackers,'' said Boban, who has starred the past seven years at AC
Milan. ``I love my country, and I love my people, and anyone who
takes them on takes me on as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's ready to take on the Germans, unlike in '96, when he
let his overwhelming passion prevent him from having any impact on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotblooded player of 1990 returned, and I lost it
completely,'' he admitted. ``Maybe it was the occasion and
thinking, `Wow, Croatia is on the verge of something big in our
first major tournament,' and I just let my patriotism get the
better of my reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that having come through the (World Cup) group matches,
that I will be a lot calmer and able to give the German midfield a
real run for their money. This is yet another historic occasion for
our young nation, and I want them to feel proud about it, and not
ashamed.''

HULL SIGNS WITH STARS; HAWKS LURE GILMOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo., Ill., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars finished with the best record in the 1997-98
regular season and were among the final four teams in the National
Hockey League playoffs. But one of their best attackers, Joe
Nieuwendyk, was injured early in the tournament, and the rest of
the Stars did not have enough scoring punch in the third round to
get past the Detroit Red Wings, who went on to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to correct one of their few deficiencies, the Stars on
Friday signed Brett Hull, the biggest star among the unrestricted
free agents. They will pay the 33-year-old right wing, who had been
with the St. Louis Blues since 1988, $17 million for three seasons.
The contract also includes a fourth season, at the Stars' option,
and a no-trade clause, something Hull wanted but could not get from
the Blues last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was not the day's only major signing. Chicago paid center
Doug Gilmour $18 million for three years to leave the New Jersey
Devils and try to revive the Blackhawks. In 63 games last season
with the Devils, Gilmour had 13 goals and 40 assists. He scored
five times in their six playoff games. The Devils were eliminated
in the first round by Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who scored 86 goals in his best season seven years ago,
scored only 27 in 1997-98. He has 554 goals and 987 points in 801
NHL games, and he was also wooed by Chicago, the city where his
father, Bobby Hull, was a superstar. ``Things couldn't get worked
out,'' Brett Hull said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So he signed with the Stars. ``We needed to improve our goal
scoring,'' said Tom Hicks, the owner of the Stars. ``I think we did
that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said: ``I have an opportunity to play with a strong team
with so many character players. They are the closest to anyone of
winning the Stanley Cup. The main thing is to win and be a
champion. I wanted to do it in St. Louis, but I'm not in St. Louis
anymore. I thought this was the best opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Hull earned $4.2 million with the Blues. Although
it was widely reported that the Rangers had tried to sign Hull, a
team spokesman emphatically denied that the New York team was
involved in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmour, paid $3.55 million by the Devils last season, will get
$6 million per season from Chicago. He recently celebrated his 35th
birthday. The Blackhawks apparently decided to concentrate on
Gilmour when the bidding for Hull went beyond what they wanted to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Murray, general manager of the Blackhawks, said: ``We took
the guy who is going to help the hockey team the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Gilmour at center, the Devils have Bobby Holik, Bob
Carpenter, Denis Pederson, Petr Sykora and Brendan Morrison.
However, Holik and Sykora are restricted free agents in the Group 2
category.

<P>
   Friday's Hull and Gilmour deals were the biggest in the first
three days of the signing season, which began on Wednesday. In the
previous two days, defenseman Steve Duchesne got about $15 million
for four years to leave St. Louis for the Los Angeles Kings and
defenseman Gary Suter got $10 million for three years to leave
Chicago for San Jose. Left wing Geoff Courtnall got $10.5 million
to stay with St. Louis for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from goalies, the most sought players still available in
the unrestricted category are center Ron Francis of Pittsburgh and
defenseman Uwe Krupp of Colorado. The Rangers have talked with
representatives of both players. They also have negotiated for Marc
Bureau, a checking center with Montreal last season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unrestricted goalies on the market are Mike Richter of
the Rangers and Curtis Joseph of Edmonton. The Rangers and the
Philadelphia Flyers will probably bid the highest for both,
although neither team has aggressively pursued either player yet.
Both players are thought to be seeking from $5 million to $7
million per season on multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slow pace of bidding for goalies might be the
supply and demand realities of the market. Teams failing to sign
either high-profile goalie have a safety net of several others,
including Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck, Edmonton's Bob Essensa, San
Jose's Kelly Hrudey, Vancouver's Arturs Irbe, and Philadelphia's
Sean Burke.

LINK BETWEEN TCE, ILLNESSES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melody Baker says tainted groundwater in west Phoenix caused her
rare blood disorder. The companies she blames for the contamination
point to other possible culprits: cigarettes, maybe even her hair
dye.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Phillips says trichloroethylene in the water gave her
grandson leukemia. But the companies say she should worry more
about the cigarettes she smoked, the power lines near her home or
the pesticides sprayed around the house to kill bugs.
</P>
<P>
   People across the Phoenix area _ and across the country from
Simi Valley, Calif., to Webster, N.Y. _ say TCE silently is
attacking their neighborhoods. They say the solvent used by
industrial companies for years is making people ill, and sometimes
killing them.
</P>
<P>
   But despite years of litigation involving millions of dollars in
attorneys' fees, proving a connection between the two has been
nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants in most lawsuits involving TCE appear to have gained
the upper hand. The outcome is especially important in Phoenix and
Scottsdale, where plumes of groundwater containing the solvent have
spread through parts of the aquifers underneath the cities,
potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their cases, Phoenix-area defendants, who include
Motorola and the city of Phoenix, have researched many of the
plaintiffs' lives. &UR; In stacks of documents filed in Maricopa County
Superior Court, the lawyers point to everyday habits they say could
be as much to blame for health problems as TCE, or more so: using
breast implants, smoking cigarettes, pumping gas, being exposed to
chemicals at work. And don't forget using coffee, anti-lice
shampoo, saccharin or oral contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone is subjected to so many possible
environmental contaminants, they say, that it's difficult to pin
the blame on TCE.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The defendants also have produced expert witnesses with
impressive credentials who say the amount of TCE in the drinking
water was not nearly enough to cause cancer, leukemia or other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The legal arguments paid off this month for the defense when a
Maricopa County Superior Court judge all but dismissed part of
``Lofgren vs. Motorola,'' a lawsuit against Motorola, Phoenix and
numerous other defendants involving tainted groundwater. &UR; Judge
Steven Sheldon ruled that, in the case of 18 east Phoenix and
Scottsdale residents, they failed to link TCE in the water near
their homes to their health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the outcome has been much the same. There is not
enough scientific evidence &UR; to &UR; show TCE is responsible for cancer,
leukemia and other diseases blamed on the solvent, says Dr. Ginger
Gist, senior environmental health scientist for the Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in Atlanta, a sister agency
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a number of things,'' she said. ``If they fill
their own gas tank, they've been exposed to pretty high levels of
benzene (a carcinogen). Or if they pick &UR; up the dry cleaning . . .
tetrachloroethylene is a common agent in some dry cleaning. Or if
they're smoking. . .''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reevaluating its
cancer classification for TCE pending further studies, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's decision will be appealed, the residents' attorneys
promise. But the ruling suggests trouble ahead for related
TCE-contamination cases working their way through Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, residents of west Phoenix, east Phoenix and Scottsdale
believe TCE will be identified as the source of their medical
problems. &UR; Something attacked their bodies and lowered their
property values, they say, and it must have been TCE.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So far, one thing is certain: TCE did contaminate the
groundwater in portions of Scottsdale and Phoenix. &UR; Phoenix shut
down about 10 drinking wells and at least one park well in the
1980s after TCE was discovered. The solvent was popular for decades
as a way to clean industrial components such as circuit boards. It
allegedly was dumped into septic tanks or onto the ground and
quietly made its way into the water in parts of Phoenix and
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Six lawsuits filed over TCE contamination in the Phoenix area
have been consolidated in Maricopa County Superior court, leaving
``Lofgren vs. Motorola'' and ``Baker vs. Motorola.'' &UR; Both suits
involve Motorola and target numerous defendants. The stakes are
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So far, the city of Phoenix alone has spent more than $8
million defending the lawsuits. &UR; Attorneys for those who sued have
suggested that defendants could have to pay $1 million to $3
million for each person who died or became seriously ill because of
TCE exposure. &UR; Plaintiffs also want programs set up to monitor the
health of people who may have been exposed. One estimate for the
cost of such a program was $40 million to $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   And others want to be paid for damage to their property values.
One estimate filed with the court said the ``stigma'' from
contamination in the West Phoenix area triggered a $300 million
drop in the area's property values.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs' chances of being awarded large amounts of
money may be fading in the wake of Sheldon's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Melody Baker, the lead plaintiff in ``Baker vs.
Motorola,'' has no doubt that the demon that took her health away
is TCE.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 44, lived between four wells in west Phoenix _ two at
39th Avenue and Earll Drive and two at 47th Avenue and Indian
School Road _ that were among those contaminated with TCE and shut
down in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Her symptoms started out as spells of blurred vision and
numbness on one side of her face. There were headaches and slurred
speech. Seizurelike episodes. She eventually was diagnosed as
having a blood disorder that can lead to leukemia and other
diseases. The disorder causes blood clots, like one last year that
blocked a vein that serves her liver.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baker is certain TCE caused her illness, she
acknowledges that even her doctor can't say the chemical is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my doctor what could have caused it. He said he truly
didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nationally, there have been some high-priced settlements
involving TCE cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Xerox agreed to pay $4.75 million to two families who
said TCE from a New York plant harmed their health. Without
admitting fault, the company relocated the families and bought
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s in Woburn, Mass., a high number of leukemia
cases appeared. TCE was found in the water, and W.R. Grace Co. and
Beatrice Foods were sued. In 1986 a jury absolved Beatrice, but
found Grace guilty of polluting wells. The company settled for $8
million; another company paid $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Hughes Aircraft Co. settled for $84.5
million with 1,620 Tucson residents who sued because of TCE-tainted
water.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has a regulatory limit of five parts per billion for
TCE.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix-area cases, plaintiffs say in court records that
levels of TCE in drinking water reached 79 parts per billion in
Scottsdale and up to 32 parts per billion in east Phoenix. They say
maximum readings for drinking water in west Phoenix reached up to
148 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials say those numbers are ``greatly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds &UR; Jim Lemmon, a former state hydrologist who worked for two
decades on groundwater contamination cases: ``I never found
anything in a drinking-water well in the Phoenix area much over 40
(parts per billion) that I can remember, and those were often wells
that had already been disconnected for other reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmon said most drinking-water wells he tested registered far
less.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, state health officials completed a years-long study of
the Tucson TCE problem and could not link the TCE to health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Others have their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Horacek of Phoenix isn't part of any of the lawsuits. But
living by ``the pond'' where used TCE was dumped by a nearby
company, he looks at his own neighborhood and worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my street, within one city block, we have nine deaths from
cancer,'' he said. He can't prove TCE caused the deaths, ``but it's
not just a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Horacek acknowledges he ``used TCE like water''
for decades to clean circuit boards as a worker at that nearby
plant, but has no medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Defendants in the Phoenix area-cases say the TCE fears are
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen a connection between our operations and
those illnesses,'' said John Godec, director of issues management
for Motorola. He said ``nine independent studies'' confirmed that
the public is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials say the rate of diseases in the affected areas
is virtually the same as among the ``unaffected'' population.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The city has met or exceeded all standards for drinking water,
adds Deputy City Manager David Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``There's no question some people are very ill, some have
passed away. They had pretty drastic problems,'' Garcia said. ``The
leap we are being asked to make is that those people were ill
because of very low levels of TCE over a limited time. That's been
a hard case to make.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Expert witnesses with impressive credentials agree. The
president of the American Cancer Society and the director of the
toxicology program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
said the levels of TCE found in Phoenix drinking water and air
could not have caused the health problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Because of Sheldon's decision to dismiss part of ``Lofgren,''
defendants in the rest of ``Lofgren'' and in ``Baker'' are
confident. They say much evidence in other cases is the same as in
the portion discounted by Sheldon. &UR; And Baker admits the judge's
ruling floored her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I afraid? Oh yeah,'' she said. ``Am I afraid medically and
financially, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She believes her problems all started with the groundwater. She
knows it is difficult to prove. But just to be safe, she drinks
bottled water these days. &QL;

 NEW JERSEY SET TO CELEBRATE A 4th OF JULY LIKE NO OTHER  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ With victory still fresh in their border war with
New York, the top elected officials of New Jersey will journey to
Ellis Island _ that's Ellis Island, NEW JERSEY _ for a bit of
ceremonial gloating on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   In an emphatic demonstration of New Jersey's newly won
sovereignty over most of Ellis Island, Gov. Christie Whitman and
the state's two U.S. senators, Robert Torricelli and Frank
Lautenberg, plan to raise the New Jersey state flag on the island's
sole flagpole to fly below the Stars and Stripes for an
Independence Day bill-signing ceremony that will also include the
announcement of Ellis Island's new New Jersey ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the National Park Service who are based on Ellis
Island initially rebuffed Whitman's request to raise the state
banner on the federal flagpole, but they were overruled by more
senior Park Service officials after Torricelli intervened in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey flag, in the official colors of buff and Jersey
blue, and emblazoned with the state's coat of arms, will fly only
for the afternoon, but officials on all sides acknowledged that it
would provide a symbolic backdrop for a Fourth of July victory
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of the history that New Jersey played and
that Ellis Island, New Jersey, played in the history of American
heritage, and tomorrow is the day all Americans celebrate their
heritage and their freedom,'' said Pete McDonough, the governor's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't read too much into this. We're just happy to be
there.'' But he also acknowledged that New Jersey officials,
particularly Torricelli, had gone out of their way to mark Ellis
Island's first Fourth of July in the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Supreme Court ended a nearly 200-year-old dispute
between New York and New Jersey over Ellis Island, ruling in a 6-3
decision that nearly 90 percent of the island is New Jersey
territory. The high court ruled that only the original 3-acre
island belonged to New York while the 24 acres of landfill that had
been added over the years belonged to New Jersey, including a
portion of the historic main immigration building, which is now a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Triumphant New Jersey officials moved swiftly to exercise their
authority over the island. Whitman appointed a 13-member advisory
commission to consider the island's future while state Attorney
General Peter Verniero fired off 15 letters to the heads of various
state and federal agencies informing them of the court's decision
and urging them to adapt procedures where necessary, including
officially adding the island to the New Jersey map.
</P>
<P>
   At the Independence Day ceremony, Whitman is to sign a bill
extending state veteran's benefits to men and women who served in
military operations in Somalia and Bosnia. McDonough said the
governor would also announce that the postmaster, in recognition of
the court's decision, had assigned a New Jersey ZIP code to the
island: 07305-1776. (The reference to the nation's birth year was
intentional.)
</P>
<P>
   Scott Pferinger, the chief ranger at the national monument
complex that includes Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, said
he could not recall another flag flying with the Stars and Stripes
on Ellis Island, though he said the Red Cross flag had flown under
the U.S. flag on Liberty Island during March, which is Red Cross
month. Permission to fly a second flag must be requested by a high
government official and can only be granted by Park Service
supervisors at regional or national headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Service official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Diane Dayson, the superintendent of the Statue of
Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum, had
objected to raising the New Jersey flag and had pointed out that
New York in all of the years that it had sovereignty over Ellis
Island had never insisted on raising its state flag.
</P>
<P>
   Told of that view, McDonough replied, ``New York never owned the
island.'' He said that Torricelli began lobbying for the
flag-raising after the initial objections were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dayson did not return phone calls on Friday, but, through
Pferinger, she said that parks officials in Washington had approved
the flag-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service official who telephoned a reporter because he
objected to the decision criticized the New Jersey politicians for
playing politics with a the landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put on this hollow display of false patriotism, what is
this going to say to the New Yorkers who have been contributing to
this site?'' the official said. ``It's just some empty display to
show New York that New Jersey won.''

MAYOR ASSAILS OFFICIALS OVER ABUSED GIRLS SENT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an unusual and pointed rebuke of his own
child-welfare officials, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized New York
City's Administration for Children's Services on Friday for
allowing two foster children to return to their natural parents,
who were later arrested on charges of raping and sodomizing them.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani reserved his sharpest criticism for a Family Court
judge and officials at a private foster-care agency who approved
the return of the two teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   But his reprimand of the Administration for Children's Services
was striking because the mayor is usually a passionate cheerleader
for the agency he created two years ago to protect New York City's
most vulnerable children.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said Friday that it was crucial to learn from the
mistakes highlighted by the disturbing case. He said the entire
system had failed the two girls. The girls' parents, Daniel
Robacker and Theresa Fremgen, and Ms. Fremgen's ex-boyfriend and
two brothers were arraigned on Thursday on charges of raping and
sodomizing the two sisters and an 8-year-old boy, who had once
lived in the same apartment.
</P>
<P>
   And he accused the judge, Nora Freeman, as well as the city's
lawyers and social workers, of buying into what he described as a
flawed liberal philosophy that emphasizes keeping troubled families
together.
</P>
<P>
   Child-welfare officials, who removed the girls from a filthy
apartment in Brooklyn, said they thought the girls would be safe at
home if their parents received counseling, and help from a
professional housekeeper known as a homemaker. Giuliani said they
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendation by ACS to the judge should have been not to
return the children at all,'' Giuliani said. ``It was a wrong
decision by the social-service agency to urge the children be
returned. It was a wrong decision by the judge to return the
children.''

ARIZONA RAINBOW FAMILY GATHERING ATTRACTS 20,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGERVILLE, Ariz. _ A frenzied beat rises from dozens of
pounding drums as a milling, tie-dyed crowd of Rainbow family
members dance and sing, wildly proclaiming their message of
freedom, harmony and togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   Long hair flying, bare feet caked in dust, and dressed in a
motley array of colors, the latter-day hippies look as though
they've come through a time warp from the '60s. Young people
dressed as flower children mingle with grizzled Woodstock veterans.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, most of the crowd huddle for a lengthy group hug
with a cast of thousands voicing a collective ``om'' in the fading
light.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange and unlikely scene on this isolated Alpine meadow
deep in the Ponderosa pines where more than 20,000 men, women and
children, plus thousands of wandering dogs, have come for the 27th
annual Rainbow Family of Living Light National Gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just beautiful,'' says a 22-year-old
Philadelphian who identified himself as Abraham. ``It's a
demonstration of how we can all live together.''
</P>
<P>
   With the air of a Grateful Dead concert, a gypsy camp and a
medieval fair, the Rainbow Family has come together to enjoy a
temporary paradise of autonomy and anarchy, thumbing its nose at
the uptight workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   People are dressed or undressed as they please, sometimes with a
bizarre effect. The sweet smell of marijuana smoke wafts on the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, wearing a loose, multicolored robe that hangs over his
blue jeans, stands on the edge of the swirling crowd as he reflects
on how it might look to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could seem scary for a lot of people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But what Rainbow people call ``mainstream society'' seems far
away from this meadow. So does the ring of Apache County sheriff's
deputies, Department of Public Safety patrolmen and U.S. Forest
Service rangers who are stationed just beyond the gathering's
perimeter and on all the access roads.
</P>
<P>
   The loose-knit reunion is expected to attract more than 20,000
peace advocates, social activists, zealots, idealists and street
people to this patch of Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest west of
Springerville for a massive camp-out that culminates in a
meditative July Fourth prayer for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement people say the event should have no effect on
Valley people's plans for July Fourth trips to Springerville,
Greer, Big Lake or other nearby areas. Aside from heavier traffic,
there should be no effect on vacationers as long as they stay out
of the immediate area of Carnero Lake, about 16 miles west of
Springerville.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering officially started Sunday, but people began
arriving for the event several weeks ago. As people enter the site,
they are greeted with ``Welcome home,'' the Rainbow gatherings'
cheery slogan. That's also the name of the group's Web site,
www.welcomehome.org.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer scale of the event near the small lake has struck a
nerve in this rural area, especially among Forest Service people
who are concerned about what a huge crowd could do to the fragile
ecology of the high desert area.
</P>
<P>
   There's been much discussion about whether the Rainbow Family
will successfully clean up after itself, policing the grounds when
the event is over and repairing the inevitable damage from the many
thousands of camping, walking, eating and latrine-using people.
</P>
<P>
   There's also controversy about water rights and, as usual, the
group's refusal to gain a permit from the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to that resource to make sure it's
protected,'' says Faith Duncan, a Forest Service spokeswoman. ``I
can understand why people want to pray for peace on Earth, but I
have concerns for the Earth as well, and protecting it for our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 DPS officers and 60 Forest Service personnel are on the
National Incident Management Team that has taken up headquarters at
the Round Valley Middle School in Eagar to monitor the gathering,
joining the Sheriff's Department and local law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seems absurd to Rainbow veterans, who point out the
passive nature of the gatherings and claim a past record of
peaceful camp-outs and successful cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the Forest Service should be proud is
happening,'' says Garrick Beck, one of the founders of the Rainbow
Family gatherings. ``Young people can come up here and have an
educational, peaceful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck says the Forest Service creates an atmosphere of hysteria
in communities where the gatherings occur, spreading rumors and
inflating the effects on the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Michaels, of Eugene, Ore., disputes the notion that the
Rainbow Family is a cult, pointing out that there is no sort of
organized indoctrination or religious bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blending of everything,'' he says. ``In a broader way,
it's the same in all of America, that we all want to work together.
We add to the notion that we all want to do it for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no centralized group who ruins it. Something
of a paradox, but there's a kind of poetry to it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the inevitable culture shock between conservative
residents of the twin towns of Springerville and Eagar, with a
permanent population of about 5,000, and the influx of
strange-looking beings. Many encounters are at the local Safeway
supermarket, where groups of Rainbow people gather to collect bulk
food items at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they're nice enough,'' said a middle-aged Eagar woman
after shopping at Safeway, ``and I like the way that one fellow
plays guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only they weren't so dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to earlier reports of shoplifting and other
store thefts, Safeway employees say they've had no problems with
the strangers _ other than their appearance, that is.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some reported instances of panhandling, but most
area residents say the Rainbow gathering has not affected them.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the Rainbow people stay in their encampment, with chance
sightings by local people who see them on the highway, hunkered
down in brightly painted buses and beat-up cars, or hitchhiking.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some minor incidents, mostly traffic and
illegal-drug citations, and an arrest Tuesday of a Rainbow camper
who is accused of harassing a mounted Forest Service patrolman,
says Forest Service spokeswoman Rose Davis. The arrest nearly
turned ugly when a crowd surrounded the officers trying to make the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, officers from Arizona Game and Fish, DPS and the
Sheriff's Department were called to the scene, arresting an
unidentified man on suspicion of interfering with the mounted
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside one of the gates where people enter the
gathering site, Apache County sheriff's spokesman Jim Morse says
there have been no serious infractions observed by the deputies, a
half-dozen of whom are standing around their dusty vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very friendly, warm and open,'' Morse says of the
Rainbow people, ``and we haven't had any kind of problems so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow people and the Forest Service have been at odds for
weeks over the legally required permit for such an event. The issue

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since she entered the television news business in the
mid-1980s, April Oliver has impressed her colleagues as an
extremely confident and dedicated journalist. She gathered and
synthesized details quickly. Her brisk, articulate presentations
inspired trust.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Oliver and her style are at the center of the latest in
a series of news scandals _ CNN's retraction of its report that the
United States used nerve gas in Laos in the Vietnam War as part of
a secret mission to kill U.S. defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, the noted constitutional lawyer who investigated
the affair for CNN, said overconfidence was a prime factor in a
series of calamitous journalistic errors in the CNN report.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver, 36, a graduate of Princeton University, was
dismissed along with her immediate superior, seasoned senior
producer Jack Smith, in the aftermath of the report, which appeared
on the program ``Newsstand: CNN and Time.'' But Ms. Oliver stands
by her reporting, which also appeared in Time magazine, and blames
her superiors for a lack of care in handling it. Both Ms. Oliver
and Smith said they had pressed for an hourlong broadcast that
could have captured more of the complexity than appeared in the
blunt 18-minute version that was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams and Ms. Oliver's colleagues said she might have been
better served not by more time but by a less committed and dogged
approach. When fundamental objections were raised within CNN in the
final days before the broadcast on June 7, she provided such a
spirited and detailed defense of the piece that even her most
skeptical colleagues felt she must have had a strong foundation for
her work.
</P>
<P>
   And as late as Wednesday, as Abrams was finishing his report,
she sent a letter to Richard N. Kaplan, the president of CNN/US,
saying she welcomed the investigation but that ``anyone attempting
to retrace my eight months of reporting in two weeks _ in this
extraordinarily hostile environment _ will simply not be able to
match my work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was typical, say those who worked with her. Long before
last fall, when she started looking through 27-year-old manuals of
military ordnance and making herself fluent in the old Vietnam-era
military jargon, she moved smartly up the ladder of television
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired her on the strength of her experience and presentation
of herself,'' said Smith, a former chief of the Washington bureau
for CBS. ``She was one of the best reporters and the quickest
reporters and the quickest writers that I ever worked with,'' Smith
added. ``I worked with Bill Mooney at The Chicago Daily News _ the
fastest rewrite man in history, God rest his soul _ and she's
almost as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Oliver's response to the Abrams report, which was
released on Thursday and repudiates her work as ``journalistic
overkill,'' was a passionate defense of what she and Smith still
believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were strong interests out there who wanted to discredit
this report,'' she said in an interview Friday. ``The clear tactic
was to kill the messenger _ me. They're portraying me as the
producer from hell who takes special forces veterans and pushes
them against the wall and makes them say things they don't mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to keep the piece to 18 minutes was made by the
show's senior executive producer, Pamela Hill, who resigned on
Thursday, saying she agreed with Abrams' conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great to put a lot of things in,'' Ms.
Oliver said Friday. ``But there was a time issue. You can overload
your audience with detail. There are two main points here. Nerve
gas and defectors. To put in all these little details _ maybe this
person was a Russian not an American, maybe it was a CIA coverup _
you can overload the audience. There are a lot of maybes in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we had hard confirmation from multiple sources,
some of whom had read the script. So getting into the various
potential cover stories could possibly be confusing to the
audience.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About five days before the broadcast, she gave detailed and
courteous responses to a colleague, CNN's Pentagon correspondent,
Jamie McIntyre, and his producer, Chris Plante, who had challenged
the report and pointed out that no one quoted on camera directly
supported the report's central conclusions about nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver responded, and still vigorously contends, that in the
following exchange, Adm. Thomas Moorer, 87, the former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had confirmed the use of nerve gas _
variously code-named CBU-15 and GB _ during the mission Operation
Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, as broadcast, began with Ms. Oliver saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it fair to say that Tailwind proved that CBU-15, GB, is
an effective weapon?''
</P>
<P>
   Moorer responded. ``Yes, I think _ but I think that was already
known, otherwise it would never have been manufactured.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams concluded that Moorer was a questionable source, partly
because his answers were often given in response to hypothetical
questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before the broadcast, Ms. Oliver and Smith
said, her 156-page briefing book, which contained 35 pages of
information from those she called ``naysayers,'' or witnesses
denying the allegation, was sent to the network's top executives in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The rough cut of the broadcast at that time included a 10-second
clip from Art Bishop, a pilot, saying that he had been told his
plane was loaded with tear gas. But according to Ms. Oliver, Smith
and Ms. Hill, after various superiors requested additional material
that gave a historical context for the events of 1970 and added an
interview with an expert in chemical warfare, Ms. Hill had cut
Bishop's denial to a glancing reference. The denial did not appear
in the Time version.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Oliver said that she never believed that Robert Van
Buskirk, a crucial source, who had been a lieutenant in the
commando unit in Laos and told CNN he had called in a gas attack to
save his men, had experienced repressed memory syndrome. That
syndrome was attributed to him in later interviews with reporters
from other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Sources like Van Buskirk clearly remember Ms. Oliver's certainty
about her facts. ``They got convinced that it was the nerve gas
sarin somewhere beyond me,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, on a program called ``Insight,'' which is seen on CNN's
foreign outlets but not in the United States, Friday said of Ms.
Oliver and Smith, ``I think that what they did was fall in love
with their reporting and come to believe their reporting despite
what they might have been learning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of major information was left out of the piece, and
while they may have done it because, out of good faith on their
part, they believed they were doing the right thing, the fact is it
doesn't stand up journalistically.''

   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ of Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Express recently needed tractors that could push at
least 50,000 pounds, and much more in inclement weather. Large
tractors made by Harlan competitors would do the job but at a cost
near $100,000. The smaller Harlan tractors then being made were
cheaper but not large enough.

<P>
   Harlan ended up designing a tractor to push the load and still

   In the future, the company expects to bring in even more

HARLAN CORP., A TRACTOR MANUFACTURER, GETS BIG JOBS DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ When it comes to moving the biggest and
heaviest commercial loads, standard tractors just don't make the
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes. Ammunition. Auto parts. They all have to be hauled
somewhere. And every day, across the world, tractors designed and
built at Harlan Corp. in Kansas City, Kan., are getting the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   These are no ordinary tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines such as American and Qantas use Harlan tractors to push
aircraft and pull baggage trailers. Auto manufacturers such as
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler use Harlan tractors to transport
parts. A Las Vegas casino recently ordered a Harlan tractor to move
large trees and plants in an atrium.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government uses hundreds of Harlan tractors. The
military uses them to move supplies and nudge fighter planes out of
their hangars. NASA uses them in its work, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian air force has 250 Harlan tractors, and the
country's army recently purchased 18 to supplies and munitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find Harlan tractors on all fronts,'' said Stephen
Jacobs, a program analyst for the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency. In
fact, Harlan machines are used by airlines, businesses and
governments in 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Jim Kaplan first demonstrated a talent for
tinkering more than 50 years ago by transforming scrap parts and a
washing machine motor into a motorcycle. The motorcycle is history,
but since then Kaplan has managed to steer Harlan from a small
surplus business into a company of international reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan, which employs 106 persons in its Kansas City, Kan.,
plant and a half-dozen in its China offices, celebrates its 40th
anniversary this year. Kaplan is currently chairman of the company;
his son Jamie Kaplan is president; and John Revere, whose career
includes a stint as a Chrysler executive, is chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kaplan established the company as a seller of surplus items,
including forklift parts. But the focus changed in 1962 when a
company forklift was severely damaged and a forklift company gave
no guarantee about the cost of repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan rebuilt the forklift himself. That work was seen by
another company, which then asked him to rebuild other forklifts.
That led to a request by a GM executive for Harlan to supply
forklifts to area plants. Kaplan rented forklifts, then leased them
to GM.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing an opportunity, Harlan soon was making parts for
forklifts. Today, Harlan is a leading parts supplier to forklift
manufacturers such as Clark and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   From this opportunity came a greater opportunity. Forklifts,
Kaplan pointed out, are cousins to the type of tractors that move
aircraft at airports. So in the early 1970s, Kaplan decided to
undercut competitors in that very market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kaplan said, the company is poised for growth and he
expects it to bring in $100 million in annual sales within four
years. Last year, sales were up nearly 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly line currently makes two tractors a day, with plans
to increase production to eight tractors a day.
</P>
<P>
   The tractors are about the size of a compact car. One model is
4.5 feet wide and nearly 10 feet long. But small doesn't mean
lightweight. Because they're built to move heavy loads, the
tractors must be heavy to transport and stop the loads.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and newest model is made with slabs of steel up to 8
inches thick. That model weighs 14 tons. Other models start at
6,000 pounds. A Harlan tractor costs $20,000 to $60,000, depending
on the model.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the engine and transmission, the Harlan plant makes
all the parts for the tractors. And the company plans to soon begin
manufacturing the tractor's transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The work is done by a diverse work force that includes Russians,
Cambodians and Vietnamese. Recently, two Bosnian refugees came to
work for Harlan.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring refugees and immigrants has become something of a
tradition at Harlan in part because Jim Kaplan's grandparents
emigrated from Russia in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hire them because we were once immigrants, too,'' Kaplan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tractors are fitted with diesel, electric or gasoline
engines and fitted with other options ordered by customers _
including seat belts, turn signals, even air-conditioned cabs.
 &LR; brk:Getting the job done  &LR; tx:Then there are the special touches
that have helped burnish Harlan's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say they go out of their way,'' said Jacobs of the
U.S. Defense Logistics Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force, for example, likes a special pivot hitch
that allows one person to attach a load to the tractor. Once the
government asked for tractors to be sent to Alaska with snowplows.
They got them.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian army recently asked for tractors that could safely
go into underground munitions bunkers and be powerful enough to
move over difficult terrain when they left the warehouse. The
specially built Harlan tractors have electric and diesel engines,
which the driver can switch between, depending on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Harlan can cater to these requests is because it
makes the parts, Kaplan said. The Las Vegas casino order, for
example, required a tractor that could move with a heavy load at a
low speed up an incline. Harlan made a drive axle that could handle
the stress of that assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to build and design tractors also allows Harlan to
go after more civilian business _ in particular, supplying tractors
for airlines. Harlan has about five to 10 percent of the market for
these type of tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Properly powered tractors are a crucial concern for airlines as
they strive for on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that people take for granted, but I'm in the
middle of it and I can't,'' said Bob Cool, national manager for
ground support for Continental Express, a subsidiary of Continental
Airlines. MORE
</P>
<P>
   Continental Express recently needed tractors that could push at
least 50,000 pounds, and much more in inclement weather. Large
tractors made by Harlan competitors would do the job but at a cost
near $100,000. The smaller Harlan tractors then being made were
cheaper but not large enough.

CHILDREN FROM BELARUS ARRIVE IN U.S. FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Olga Borisova is a child of Chernobyl. The
world's worst nuclear disaster occurred when she was seven months
old, in 1986. Seventy percent of the radioactive fallout drifted
her way, to Belarus, a small country 75 miles north of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Now Olga deals with the aftereffects: a contaminated land where
food, air and water are suspect. Her village of 700 people, Maisky,
has only two stores, both general stores, and one automobile for
everyone. ``It is difficult'' there, a translator says.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, when Olga arrived at Kansas City International
Airport, she weighed 80 pounds. On Thursday, at the doctor's office
in Kansas City, the 12-year-old was up to 89 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good!'' exclaimed Olga's host mother, Sharol Young of
Lee's Summit, Mo. She gave the girl a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Olga is taking part in the ``Children of Chernobyl'' program
sponsored by Project Restoration, a non-profit group started in
1994 by Laurann Schlapper of Merriam to help Belarussians. Eleven
other youngsters from Belarus, ages 10 to 12, also are here.
</P>
<P>
   The children are receiving medical and dental care, taking a
respite from low-level radiation and reveling in swimming pools,
stuff they can buy at stores and newfound friends. All of them got
their medical checkups at Pediatric Associates in Kansas City; the
final four children got their checkups Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are slender but not terribly malnourished and
otherwise seem to be in good spirits,'' said Michael Kasper, the
physician who has examined all the children.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Chernobyl, he said, the children have weakened immune
systems and are at increased risk for various cancers, particularly
thyroid cancer. All the children checked out fairly well, he said.
One girl had an enlarged thyroid; she will see another doctor about
that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the World Health Organization reported that thyroid
cancer among children had increased 200-fold since the disaster in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Olga and two other girls who visited Kasper's office Thursday
seemed to be having a fine time together in the waiting room. They
stood next to each other, two of them holding hands, all of them
smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   All their clothes were new, they said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   The children arrived in Kansas City with very little, said
Young, Olga's host mother. It took Olga a while to adjust, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ```She wouldn't eat or drink anything the first 48 hours we had
her,'' Young said. ``I cried, she cried, my daughters cried. It
broke our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Young's husband called a friend who lives in the
Ukraine. The friend told Olga that the Youngs wanted to be her
friends and that she should drink the juice they wanted to give
her. Olga did. Then he asked her to tell him what she wanted next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hot dogs, no bun and mashed potatoes,'' was her reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that for her and after that everything was just fine,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year that Project Restoration has brought
children from Belarus to Kansas City. Last year's group received
prosthetic limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Schlapper became interested in Belarus after visiting the
country in 1991 on a mission trip. Operating from her home, she has
persuaded individuals and groups to donate services, products and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Families on both sides of the state line are acting as hosts to
the children this year, she said, and many in the medical and
dental field have offered their services free. St. Luke's Hospital
is providing free labwork and free physicals for the two
translators who accompanied the children.
</P>
<P>
   Schlapper said some families in Belarus are so poor that they
cannot afford toothbrushes or must use the same one for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Yulia Alekhina had 18 cavities, Schlapper said,
and she was scheduled for four extractions today, which she didn't
know about Thursday. Through a translator, Yulia said she brushes
her teeth twice a day and doesn't know why she needs so much dental
work.
</P>
<P>
   Does she like going to the dentist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said. Is she afraid of the dentist? ``I'm not
afraid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The children will leave July 16 to return to Belarus.

PROFESSOR LEADS TEAM THAT ANALYZES 8,300 YEAR-OLD SANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHASHANK BENGALI  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Using a cutting-edge carbon dating technique, a
University of Missouri-Columbia researcher has determined that a
prehistoric sandal is more than 8,300 years old, making it the
oldest shoe discovered east of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Brien, a professor of anthropology, led a team that
studied six sandals in the university's collection that were
excavated between the mid-1950s and 1981 in central Missouri's
Callaway County.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent shoe was determined to be about 800 years old.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the findings, detailed in this week's issue of
Science, shed light on the resourcefulness of early inhabitants of
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This very early shoe construction shows how people were making
use of environmental resources,'' he said. ``And it shows that the
knowledge to build shoes is ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   The sandals, especially the more recent ones, were built much as
they are today, with support for the heel and toes connected by a
softer sole.
</P>
<P>
   And like their modern-day descendants, prehistoric Midwesterners
wore their shoes until they fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoes in our collection are worn out in the same places as
today's shoes: on the heels and the balls of the feet,'' O'Brien
said. ``And many of them have been repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandal makers then favored a native plant called the
``rattlesnake master,'' a relatively durable weaving material.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is significant for this part of the continent,
O'Brien said, but older artifacts have been discovered west of the
Rockies on the Colorado Plateau, where the arid environment is more
favorable to preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The university's collection of 35 ancient shoes had for almost
two decades sat on display in an archaeological museum.
Researchers, though long eager to determine the shoes' age, didn't
think they would withstand the rigorous dating process.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien's team took advantage of a technique called
accelerator mass spectrometry, which requires just a thread to be
taken from the material, as opposed to the several grams that
less-advanced carbon dating methods need.
</P>
<P>
   The technique was developed in the mid-1980s to date the Shroud
of Turin, the cloth that some believe Jesus Christ was wrapped in
after the Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   For the dating process, the team selected six shoes from the
collection that represented different types of construction.
O'Brien said they were in somewhat poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sandals are perishable, and the fact that we had any
material at all was really good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said there are no plans to date any of the other shoes
in the university's collection. The process is expensive, costing
$600 per shoe.
</P>
<P>
   The next task for O'Brien's team is creating a database on this
and similar cultural construction materials.
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased with the findings, O'Brien is keeping them in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the cure for cancer,'' he said, ``but a lot of people
are interested in prehistory. It shows that ancient peoples weren't
that different, in a lot of ways, from us.''

MISSOURI GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL TO KEEP SEX PREDATORS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Murder victim Stephanie Schmidt would have
turned 25 on July 4. And Thursday, with July 4 approaching, her
parents watched the signing of a new law giving Missouri some of
the toughest sexual-predator laws in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan signed a bill to allow the state to keep
``sexually violent predators'' confined beyond their prison
sentences if they seem inclined to repeat their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is called ``Stephanie's Law'' in remembrance of the
former Pittsburg State University student and Leawood resident who
was murdered by an ex-convict and repeat sex offender five years
ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Gene Schmidt crusaded successfully for laws that allow
Missouri and Kansas to keep predators confined longer than their
prison sentences and to require released predators to register
their whereabouts. Missouri passed predator laws in 1996 and this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this legislation, I think we now have the strongest
one-two punch in the country in dealing with sexual predators,''
House Speaker Steve Gaw said Thursday of the two recent Missouri
laws. Gaw credited the Schmidts for changes in Missouri and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have turned their tragedy into something positive so that
others may not have to go through what they did,'' Gaw said. ``It's
a good day for Missouri families and for safer streets and safer
homes in our state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schmidts said they are working in eight other states to pass
laws similar to those in Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of states are taking baby steps,'' Peggy Schmidt said
after the bill-signing. ``We say, `Why do you want to do that?'
We're talking about saving lives. Missouri is taking giant steps.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 of the approximately 24,000 prison inmates in
Missouri are confined for sex-related crimes, said Corrections
Director Dora Schriro.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, a committee appointed by mental health and
corrections officials would review an inmate's record before the
person's scheduled release.
</P>
<P>
   If the inmate is deemed to have a ``mental abnormality'' that
will continue to make that person a violent sexual predator, the
state's attorney general could seek to have a judge order the
detainment and treatment of the offender. The court would then
conduct an annual review of the committed person's case. If there
is sufficient progress in the opinion of state mental health
officials, then the person could be released.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the law say it could punish people for crimes they
may or not commit in the future, but the U.S. Supreme Court last
year upheld the law in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said it would make predators more likely
to seek treatment so they can be released when their sentences end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation provides a legally sound, very structured
system for identifying potentially violent sexual predators and
assuring they remain away from Missouri citizens, particularly our
children,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had strong support from Republicans and Democrats,
including co-sponsor Rep. Carson Ross, a Republican from Blue
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the father of three daughters and the grandfather of
five,'' Ross said. ``This is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Stephanie's death and her birthday are only
three days apart. The Schmidts said the week is always difficult
but that this year it was special because of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reliving of the tragedy happens every year this time of
year,'' Gene Schmidt said. ``I don't know if the reliving of it is
(as important) as doing something about it so that it doesn't
happen again.''

PAK ROLLS ON WHILE LOPEZ MAKES EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., N.C., S.Korea)  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ For Se Ri Pak, Friday's round was another
impressive performance by an extraordinary 20-year-old from South
Korea who seems to save her best golf for the biggest tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   For Nancy Lopez, Friday ended with a tearful goodbye, her
career-long quest to win a U.S. Women's Open still unfulfilled
after a horrific 12-over-par 83 sent her home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was that type of roller-coaster day at the Open, with a few
high moments and many high scores. Double-bogeys and 3-putts were
plentiful. Subpar rounds were precious commodities. And, as the
pressure mounts, with pin placements expected to get tougher at the
already challenging Blackwolf Run course, whoever wins the
tournament may do it over par.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 1-under-par 70, and threatening to win her
second consecutive major, Pak was the clubhouse leader by one
stroke at 3 under par (139) when second-round play was suspended by
darkness. Liselotte Neumann, who also shot 70 Friday, was in second
place at 140 and Brenda Corrie Kuehn, an amateur from Fletcher,
N.C., shared third place with Chris Johnson, Mhairi McKay, and
Dottie Pepper at even par (142).
</P>
<P>
   There was a 51-minute suspension because of lightning in the
area, and 21 players were still on the course when play was halted.
The second round will be completed Saturday morning. After the
second round, the 36-hole cut will be made, and when Friday's play
ended the projected cut was 8 over par (150).
</P>
<P>
   Pak and Neumann were the only players under par when play ended,
as one by one, competitors were foiled by undulating greens that
made putting and approach shots tricky and treacherous. Laura
Davies, who started tied for the lead with Kim Williams, shot a
4-over 75, falling to 1 over for the tournament. Williams fell out
of contention with a horrendous 81, while Pat Hurst, who started
the day at 2 under, shot a 75.
</P>
<P>
   But Pak played like a seasoned veteran, putting together a
steady round that featured three birdies and two bogeys. Having
already won the LPGA McDonald's Open in May, Pak could become the
first woman to win back-to-back majors since Meg Mallon won the
LPGA Championship and the Open in 1991. Pak could also become the
first rookie to win two majors in the same year since 1984, when
Juli Inkster won the Nabisco Dinah Shore and the du Maurier
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel nervous,'' said Pak, who said she enjoyed playing
in front of Friday's gallery, estimated at more than 25,000 by the
U.S. Golf Association, setting a record for Friday. ``I feel
confident.'
</P>
<P>
   Lopez meanwhile handled her worst round at an Open with the
class that has made her the most popular player in women's golf.
With Lopez's huge gallery watching in disbelief but still cheering
as she approached each green, she found it even more difficult to
show her anger.
</P>
<P>
   After making par on the first four holes, Lopez shot 11 over par
during the next eight holes, and never made better than a bogey.
From the fifth hole through the 12th hole, Lopez's card read bogey,
double-bogey, bogey, bogey, double-bogey, double-bogey, bogey,
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   With her playing partners, Mallon (11 over) and Jane Geddes (15
over) also struggling, the disappointed threesome made light of
their plight as they approached the 18th green, holding their
putters aloft with a towel attached to the top, giving the
white-flag surrender sign. The crowd gave them a standing ovation,
but after her 22nd attempt to win the Open without a victory, Lopez
cried, knowing she had no chance to make the cut.

ENTREPRENEURS CAN FIND VACATION IMPOSSIBLE WITH GROWING BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer are here
again -- days when most kids close their books and head for the
beach and employees at big companies flee their cubbyholes for some
extended rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's vacation time for some people, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ask some local owners of small, growing companies about their
vacation plans and you're likely to get a response much like the
one from Sandra Yates-Thompson, president of New Millennium
Computer Services in suburban Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a vacation?'' she asked with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent study showing that the number of entrepreneurs
who will take vacations this year has risen by 20 percent over last
year, some self-employed people like Yates-Thompson say they don't
have time to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, not until the business is further along, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to maybe take a couple of days off -- like a
weekend -- but I'm not really looking at taking a vacation now,''
she said. ``Actually, I haven't had a vacation for a while -- it's
been two years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by American Express, 74 percent of the
nation's independent business owners plan to take vacations this
year, up from 63 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rise? The robust economy, said Alice Bredin,
a small-business adviser in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people, they have the means to take the trip they
were not able to afford in prior years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many business owners who have been in business five or
more years and were waiting for a more opportune time for a
vacation have realized that time is as elusive as tomorrow -- it's
always in the future. So they might as well take some time off to
recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more the aging baby boomers, realizing they'd actually
like to enjoy their lives rather than working all the time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bredin suggested that all entrepreneurs make time for
some downtime, saying business owners need the chance to recharge
their batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise you'll see dwindled problem-solving,'' she said.
``That's what being an entrepreneur is all about --
problem-solving.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommended that business owners do one of three things when
they go on vacation: Have a competent and trustworthy staff member
run the business, shut the business down or refer clients to
similar firms while they're gone -- which many small-business
owners are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Bredin said a business owner who is serving a client well
shouldn't worry that the customer will defect. ``Your relationship
with the customer is based on much more than if they don't have
your competitor's number,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Janet Barnett, owners of Woodland Hills-based Rock'n
Motion Image Design, said they have always made it a point to take
time off -- usually a weekend here or there -- from their
8-year-old graphic design firm.
</P>
<P>
   But not in the summer, Janet Barnett noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave around the (winter) holiday season because things are
kind of shut down anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes are able to barter with clients. For example, one
time they accepted a cruise from a client in lieu of payment for a
project. And this time they're talking about trading for a trip to
the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Barnett added that they work vacations around their
clients' demands and give those customers plenty of notice when
they do plan to take time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been able to get away,'' he said. ``As the
company grows, it gets easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yates-Thompson will continue doing what she's done
since starting the company two years ago: working 12- to 14-hour
days six days a week. (She gives herself a break on Sundays, when
she works three or four hours.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, oh, you must love having your own business -- you
can take off whenever you want,'' she said. ``I just laugh. One of
these days it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that day comes, just try to find her. ``I'd like to
take a vacation someplace where there are no people and no
telephones -- somewhere where there's no people but my husband and
I.
</P>
<P>
   ``And silence.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO DO BEFORE TAKING OFF
</P>
<P>
   American Express recommends that small-business owners take the
following steps to ensure that their vacations are as worry-free as
possible:
</P>
<P>
   --Make a list of completed projects, current work and coming
assignments. Then make a list of all possible issues that could
arise for each item and devise ways to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
   --Do worst-case planning for things that will undoubtedly go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   --Tell key clients and customers about your vacation two to
three weeks in advance, and add who to contact while you're gone
and how this person can help them.
</P>
<P>
   --Plan for incoming messages. For example, leave phone numbers
for whoever is covering for you on your voice mail's outgoing
message, arrange with someone to read your faxes so that issues are
addressed, or forward your faxes to another number where you will
receive them.
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure you leave sufficient supplies and cash for your
staff.
</P>
<P>
   --Pay bills or sign checks that you can entrust to someone who
can mail them for you by the due date.
</P>
<P>
   --Leave emergency contact information.
</P>
<P>
   --Double-check things like housekeeping and security
information.

ARRESTED SENATOR BLAMES OFFICER FOR SCUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ada Smith, the veteran New York state senator whose
occasionally erratic behavior has sometimes overshadowed her
political work, on Friday denied biting a police officer as he
tried to arrest her in Brooklyn, instead accusing the officer of
roughing her up and making racial comments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said she planned to file a lawsuit against the city
and a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I can be boisterous and loud, but this time I was
dumbfounded,'' Ms. Smith said Friday. ``He threw me against the car
and I was handcuffed. I was told by witnesses that I was hit in the
face. The handcuffs were so tight that they cut off the circulation
to my left hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said the officer, Seth Kaufman, who is white, also
made disparaging remarks about Puerto Ricans. Ms. Smith is a
light-skinned African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Kaufman sprayed Ms. Smith with Chemical
Mace and handcuffed her during the exchange at an intersection at 8
p.m. Thursday. They said Ms. Smith had become annoyed at the
officer and his partner, Michael Nemes, as they questioned the
driver of the car ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith was charged with resisting arrest, a misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in jail, and with disorderly conduct and
failing to comply with a lawful order, both violations punishable
by up to 15 days in jail, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smith, who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens, gave
a drastically different account of the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not bite Officer Kaufman,'' Ms. Smith said in a
telephone interview Friday. ``I'm still waiting to see these teeth
marks. If I bit him, don't you think he would have gone to the
hospital to get some medical attention?''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman refused medical attention from emergency workers who
arrived at the scene that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who in 1988 became one of two black elected state
senators and who once served as an aide to former Rep. Shirley
Chisholm, has earned a reputation for being somewhat volatile,
mostly with staff members. But she is also known among colleagues
in Albany for her high attendance rate and her committee work on
education, criminal justice and women's health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whom Ms. Smith endorsed over Democratic
mayoral candidate Ruth Messinger last fall, and Martin Conner, the
Senate minority leader, of Brooklyn, declined to comment on the
incident Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police account, Ms. Smith became upset when she
was stopped behind another car whose driver was being questioned by
Kaufman and Nemes. Ms. Smith, who was driving her private car, a
1987 black Lincoln Continental with state Senate license plates,
told the officers they were blocking traffic and demanded that they
move.
</P>
<P>
   An argument followed, and when the officers asked Ms. Smith to
produce her driver's license and registration, she refused,
Pentangelo said. She then refused to step out of her car, and when
Kaufman attempted to pull her out, she bit him on the hand, the
detective said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smith gave this account: She was on her way home from a
butcher shop when she saw the police cruiser ahead with flashing
red and yellow lights. She pulled over to the side of the street
because she was unable to pass the cruiser. After Kaufman had
finished questioning the driver of the other car, he walked to her
car and asked if she was trying to intimidate or distract him from
his duties. When she explained that she could not pass his cruiser,
an argument ensued and the officer demanded her license and
registration. She refused, saying that he knew who she was, because
he had referred to her by name.
</P>
<P>
   The officer grew more argumentative, Ms. Smith said, and tried
to pull her through the car window. She said he then opened her car
door, sprayed her with Chemical Mace and handcuffed her.

 &HT;    Gardner Patterson, a prominent trade economist and a prolific
writer who helped negotiate several important international
treaties, died at his home in Washington, on June 26. He was 82.
 &HT;    Patterson died from lymphoma.
 &HT;    A native of Burt, Iowa, Patterson had a doctorate in economics
from Harvard University.
 &HT;    In 1946, at the age of 30, Patterson was one of two advisers to

PERILOUS FIGHT VS. SINGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The national anthem survived Jose Feliciano, whose
Latin jazz stylings at a World Series 30 years ago sent
traditionalists into apoplexy. It survived Roseanne, whose
rendition at a San Diego Padres game was too ghastly to relive
here, and Lucy ``Xena'' Lawless, whose display at an Anaheim Mighty
Ducks playoff game wasn't ghastly at all.
</P>
<P>
   It survived Johnny Paycheck (``What so loudly we sang, as the
daylight's last cleaning...!''), Willie Nelson, Bobby Vinton, Carl
Lewis and the famously forgetful Robert Goulet. It survived Stevie
Ray Vaughn, who sang the anthem before a Dodgers game at the
Houston Astrodome while accompanying himself on air guitar. It
survived Tommie Smith's and John Carlos' political protest and
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's religious stand _ or sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is a tough old guy, like the
Star-Spangled Banner, tattered and powder-burned but still waving.
</P>
<P>
   But now on the Fourth of July, the question to ponder is whether
the anthem can survive all the nameless, faceless ``recording
artists,'' off-Broadway actors, players' wives and screeching
7-year-olds whose oh-so-personal interpretations cause ears to
bleed and eyes to roll in stadiums and arenas from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame singers who pull a Goulet and forget the words are only
amusements, not the real threats to the anthem. The real threats
are all the wannabe Barbra Streisands and Lou Rawlses who treat
their moments at midcourt as personal auditions. It's not unusual
to see the too-cool anthem singers at Lakers games walk off the
court and into the stands with a stack of business cards to hand
out to music-industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just nostalgia, or didn't the anthem always used to be
sung by Robert Merrill or Kate Smith or somebody else of stature,
not by any garage band looking for a break?
</P>
<P>
   I make no claim to have conducted scientific research on the
subject, but in 15 years of listening to anthems from press boxes
and press rows, I'd estimate that a patriotic 76 percent of singers
find some way to screw it up.
</P>
<P>
   A sportswriter friend of mine agreed, saying, ``Jose Feliciano
never knew what a disservice he was doing'' in 1968 when he
pioneered the do-it-your-way approach to honoring the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing that fans stand still for it.
</P>
<P>
   An admission of some hypocrisy: I don't sing along with the
anthem and I don't always pay rapt attention to it, although I do
always stand up for it. I'll chat with a neighbor, write the
lineups on a scorecard, or mark the scratches in a racetrack
program.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one of those people who, at the sound of the ``Oh
say...,'' stop walking in the middle of a ballpark parking lot and
face a flag they can't even see with hands on their hearts. A rule
to live by: If you can't see the flag, you aren't obligated to
salute.
</P>
<P>
   It's partly a generational thing, most of those who do sing
along have literally been through the wars. And, if I may shift the
blame, it's largely because the performers and the teams that hire
them demand so little respect.
</P>
<P>
   If the playing and singing of the anthem were truly a patriotic
occasion, instead of a publicity stunt for the cast of ``Smokey
Joe's Cafe,'' a lot of people like me would show more reverence.
</P>
<P>
   There are two possible solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stop playing the anthem before every sports event, a ritual that
apparently began with major-league baseball during World War II.
Make it special again by saving it for national holidays _ today,
for one _ and truly national events like Super Bowls, World Series,
Indy 500s and U.S. soccer coach firings.
</P>
<P>
   Or raise the standards for anthem singers. Establish some rules:
</P>
<P>
   __ If celebrities are going to be allowed a microphone, make
sure they're real celebrities with reputations to lose if they mess
up.
</P>
<P>
   __ Every anthem singer must carry to the mike an index card with
the lyrics printed on it, just in case. Anybody who's too proud to
do that is too self-centered for the job.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a ``perilous fight,'' not a ``perolis night,'' as half
the anthem singers seem to think. !arrow!!off!Remember, it's a
90-second song. Maximum: two minutes. You don't get paid by the
note, so see if you can chop a few syllables out of ``Oho say does
thahat star-spahanguhulled bahaneher yehet waihahaihave oer the
lahand of the freeheeheehee and the hooome of thuhuhuhuhuh
brahahahave!''
</P>
<P>
   __ No sound effects. At Edison Field, they set off fireworks,
``bombs bursting in air,'' jolting singers into sour notes and
introducing younger fans to the concept of shell shock.
</P>
<P>
   __ Singers should not bow, say ``thank you'' for applause or
wave to the crowd. ``Hello, Cleveland!'' is inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   __ In short, adopt the philosophy of the Los Angeles Kings, who
review tapes and preseason auditions, according to media-relations
director Mike Altieri, with a preference for those who ``just get
up there, sing the song, and sing it the way it's supposed to be
sung.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Remember: The anthem is not about you. Want to impress the
impresario in the front row? Just sing the blessed song crisply and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Leave your personal flair at home, right next to your business
cards.

PENALTY KICKS COME BACK TO HAUNT ITALY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Roberto Baggio didn't miss this time. That
fell to someone else. But the result differed not in the least.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, damned to relive its nightmare once more, exited the
World Cup on Friday in the cruelest manner imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Another scoreless draw, another bout of penalty kicks, another
heartbreaking defeat _ this one to the hosts, who in everyone's
eyes except Italian coach Cesare Maldini's thoroughly deserved the
push into next week's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Luigi di Biagio assumed the role that teammate Baggio played
last time in the 1994 final, drilling the decisive kick into the
crossbar, then collapsing in disbelief as the French celebrated
around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hardly seems fair to lose the World Cup in this way,'' he
said, choking back tears. ``It's a dreadful feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a just finish to a dreadful match played before an
adoring audience of perhaps 77,000 at the Stade de France. Zinedine
Zidane, brilliant as always, guided the French to near-complete
domination of the quarterfinal showdown, but that counted for
little _ a few blown opportunities and some of the prettiest play
seen in this tournament _ as Maldini's destructive tactics, using
Italy's unbending defense, kept highlights to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Italian tactician had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the score,'' he said, ``you can see that
nothing went wrong. It was nil-nil. My team had a faultless
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Karma arrived after 120 minutes of the stuff, a 4-3 shootout
victory for France, which advances to face the winner of today's
Germany-Croatia match on Wednesday night at the Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if I've been put through the wringer,'' said France
coach Aime Jacquet. ``In the end, the best team won, even if
penalties are always a bit of a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third successive World Cup the Italians have been
eliminated in a shootout. Argentina did the trick in the 1990
semifinals, and then there was Brazil's triumph in '94, when Baggio
smashed the ball well over the crossbar, which left them pondering
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves a very bitter taste,'' Baggio moaned. ``I would have
preferred to lose in open play or, failing that, on a `golden
goal.' Penalties are the worst way to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Maldini: ``It seems like we're cursed or something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for the tremendous performance of their back line,
particularly right back Fabio Cannavaro, the Italians would have
lost much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane, one of seven French starters who played last season in
Italy's Serie A, did pretty much as he pleased wherever he chose to
go; that his forwards could do little with the service was
testament to the manner with which the Azzurri shut off access to
their goal and the frightful mess the French made of the few
chances that fell to them.
</P>
<P>
   France got off 24 shots in all to just seven for Italy. But
aside from an early flurry, in which Zidane fired wide and Azzurri
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca knocked a stunning back flick by
Emmanuel Petit over the bar, and a couple blown chances by Youri
Djorkaeff one an open net just missed before halftime the French
found the Italians impossible to break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple times during the first half where we were
in danger, but that was it,'' noted Maldini, whose son, Paolo,
teamed with Cannavaro, Giuseppe Bergomi and Alessandro Costacurta
in the back. ``The French strikers (Stephane) Guivarc'h, (David)
Trezeguet, (Thierry) Henry, Djorkaeff didn't really create any
problems for us. I don't think our goalkeeper had much to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French tried to attack, but basically they were never all
that threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy, it often seemed, didn't even try to attack. Christian
Vieri, who entered the match with a Cup-leading five goals, was
outmuscled by Marcel Desailly, and midfielders Petit, Didier
Deschamps and Christian Karembeu closed off space so that the
Italians rarely strung more than a couple passes together before
surrendering possession.
</P>
<P>
   Too negative? Not according to the elder Maldini.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to, obviously, gauge the strengths and threats posed
by the opposition ...,'' he said. ``I had my strategy, I stuck to
my guns, and I think I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's game picked up once Baggio was brought on for
disappointing Alessandro Del Piero in the 67th minute. He sparked
the Italians, who came close twice to scoring _ a hard shot by
Gianluca Pessotto in the 89th that was directed it at French
netminder Fabien Barthez, and a Baggio volley from just right of
the goal that sailed inches wide of the far post almost halfway
through the 30-minute overtime.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Italy until the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Baggio made his try on Italy's first kick, answering a Zidane
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Pagliuca then halted a poorly placed drive by France's Bixente
Lizarazu. That left Demetrio Albertini the opportunity to give
Italy control, but he was stopped by Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   The next five shooters _ Trezeguet, Henry and Laurent Blanc for
France, Costacurta and Vieri for Italy _ connected. Then di Biagio
booted the ball he'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he murmured later. ``It's really
hard to accept.... I'm very sorry.''

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ President Clinton Friday called Jiang Zemin, the
president of China, a visionary leader who could be the figure who
brings China to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a news conference that closed his nine-day trip to
China, gave what amounted to a vigorous personal endorsement of the
Chinese president, saying Jiang had the imagination needed to
transform China from a single-party Communist state to a
pluralistic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The president also praised Premier Zhu Rongji, architect of
China's current economic policies, saying, ``There's a very good
chance that China has the right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sounded increasingly hopeful about China's future as
his trip progressed, offering his most optimistic assessment of the
nation's political prospects just before departing to return to
Washington to celebrate Independence Day. But Clinton's words could
come back to haunt him should repression in China harden, leaving
Clinton open to the charges that he was taken in by a seemingly
open Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there will ever be democracy in China, Clinton
said, ``Oh, yes. I believe there can be, and I believe there will
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what I would like to see is the present government, headed
by this president and this premier, who are clearly committed to
reform, ride the wave of change and take China fully into the 21st
century and basically dismantle the resistance to it,'' he added.
``I believe they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The president answered questions for 43 minutes, most of them on
his trip to China but others touching on the troubled Japanese
economy, the prospect of violence in Ireland this weekend and the
continuing ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered an overwhelmingly positive summation of his
five-city journey through China.
</P>
<P>
   He said that profound differences remained between China on the
United States on questions of individual liberty, and he warned
that powerful forces still oppose change here.
</P>
<P>
   But he defended his engagement with the Chinese leadership as
the course most likely to yield progress on a range of issues from
human rights to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The coming months and years will tell whether these few days in
early summer were the beginning of a positive new epoch in
relations between the United States and China or merely a sidestep
in an ambiguous relationship. There are groups in both countries
with a political investment in confrontation rather than
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton and Jiang say or do as their nations' leaders,
they are but one part of a complex interplay between two diverse
and dynamic societies, a nexus that will be shaped as much by
transnational corporations, the media, the church, and even the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to reflect that diversity in his appearances here,
meeting with villagers, middle-class homeowners, young
entrepreneurs, scholars and students.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the president's schedule was any session with
outspoken opponents of the government. Clinton defended that
decision Friday, saying that he sought to deal with human rights
concerns in China ``in a way most likely to yield progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best to meet with people who represented all elements
of Chinese society,'' Clinton said. ``The decisions I made on this
trip _ and, I remind you, the first trip by an American president
in a decade _ about with whom to meet and how to handle it were
basically designed, were based on my best judgment about what would
be most effective in expanding human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said that Clinton did not want to
risk retaliation against those who met with him and that he
believed that pressing Jiang to release groups of political
prisoners would be more effective than a theatrical encounter with
dissidents.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking weary from a grueling schedule, said in his
opening remarks that his trip to China _ the longest of his
presidency to a single country _ had shown him ``the glory of
China's past in Xian, the vibrancy of its present in Beijing and
the promise of its future in Shanghai and Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to
appreciate the remarkable transformation that is underway in China,
as well as the distance still to be traveled,'' the president said
in the news conference, held in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt
hotel in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly was struck by the city's wealth and vitality, and
said the region, which reverted to Chinese control just a year ago,
could be the model of China's development.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his most extensive assessment of Jiang and Zhu, praising
them in elaborate language.
</P>
<P>
   The president said of Jiang: ``After I met with him for the
first time, I felt very strongly that his chances of becoming the
leader of China for a sustained period were quite good because he's
a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot of vigor
for his age, or indeed for any age. And I think he has a quality
that is profoundly important at this moment in history when there's
so much change going on. He has a good imagination. He has vision.
He can visualize. He can imagine a future that is different from
the present.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton acknowledged that Jiang has
``constituencies'' who oppose him and who distrust U.S. motives in
engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Clinton said: ``I hope more of them understand that
America wishes China well, that we are not bent on containing China
and that our human rights policy is not an excuse for some larger
strategic motive. It's what we really believe. We believe it's
morally right, and we believe it's best for them as a practical
matter over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to another question, he noted that ``democracy is a
universal aspiration,'' an answer to Jiang's assertion that China's
history and culture have led it to different definitions of human
rights from those accepted in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The president welcomed the recent release of several well-known
dissidents, but said that he now looked to Beijing to release whole
classes of prisoners. He particularly cited the 150 people still
held on charges related to the Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations that were brutally put down by the government in
June 1989. He also called on Beijing to release an unknown number
of prisoners held for political activities that the government has
declared no longer criminal.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had raised with Jiang charges that China imposes
abortion on women to enforce China's one-child policy. ``They all
say the same thing,'' Clinton said. ``They say that that is not
Chinese policy, and it violates Chinese policy.'' Clinton added
that his view was that ``there may be an insufficient monitoring of
what's being done beyond the capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offended many in Taiwan this week when he repeated
Beijing's preferred formulation of U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which
Beijing considers a breakaway province. But he defended his
decision, saying that he had not changed the substance of U.S.
policy, which is to oppose Taiwanese independence and support
peaceful reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I did the right thing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from a reporter from the Irish Times,
Clinton deplored the recent burnings of churches in Ireland and
called for high-level talks among Catholic, Protestant and British
authorities in advance of the annual sectarian marches scheduled
for this weekend that have led to violence in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered tempered praise for a package of banking and
financial reforms announced by Tokyo in recent days. He said that
Japan's economy had substantial underlying strength and expressed
hope that the recession there would bottom out soon and growth
would resume ``in a reasonable amount of time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, the president offered nothing beyond a hope that
Belgrade would show restraint. ``There is some uncertainty about
who is willing and who is not willing to even negotiate about it,''
Clinton said. ``And we're working on it as best we can.''

   NEW YORK _ The Yankees carried a 58-20 record, some bumps and
bruises and a thinner roster into Friday night's series opener with
the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. But as usual this season,
they were also on the verge of reaching another milestone.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees were to sweep Baltimore this weekend, as they did
in May, they would enter the All-Star Game break with a 61-20
record and match the best 81-game mark this century, shared by the
1902 Pittsburgh Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Yankees were to win half of the 84 games that
remained before Friday night's contest, going 42-42, they would
reach 100 victories for the first time since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees were playing a few bodies short against the
Orioles Friday night, and Bernie Williams might still be a week
from returning from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' starting second baseman in all but
two games, was out of the lineup with a sore right knee. Knoblauch
slid hard into second base on a force play in the 10th inning
Thursday night against the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman said the
injury was not considered serious and they did not expect Knoblauch
to require an extensive examination. Torre indicated there was a
chance Knoblauch could play Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, who normally starts in place of Knoblauch, returned
to his home in Illinois after learning that his father-in-law had
died. That made Luis Sojo the starter at second base, despite a
hyperextended left elbow, an injury he sustained while taking
batting practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trip to Florida for Williams
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams took batting practice and ran the bases before
Friday night's game, and he is not quite at full speed. The plan
seems to be to send Williams to Florida and have him play at least
two games in the Florida State League, on an injury rehabilitation
assignment, on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams does well, he could be activated in time for the
series against Tampa Bay that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rough Going for Irabu
</P>
<P>
   After an outing on Thursday in which Hideki Irabu gave up five
runs and failed to get an out in the fourth inning against the
Phillies, opposing batters have an .894 slugging percentage against
Irabu over the pitcher's last three starts, raising his ERA from
1.68 to 2.91.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankee pitching coach, spoke with
Irabu before Friday night's game to explore reasons for the slump.

HULL WILLING TO TRADE BIG STATS FOR CUP RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Is Brett Hull the missing piece for the Stars in
their search for a Stanley Cup?
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to think so.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who earlier in the playoffs accurately predicted a certain
defeat for the Stars in their series with the Detroit Red Wings,
had to eat his words yesterday. Then again, the gregarious Hull
never truly eats his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that because I know how good \Rthe Red Wings\S are, and
I also know how to beat them,'' Hull said after signing a
three-year, $17 million deal with the Stars. ``Hopefully, now we
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocky? Nah. Just good ol' Brett Hull honesty. Ask around the NHL
about the favorite to win the 1999 Stanley Cup, and Dallas has to
come up high on the list. And signing Hull is a big reason why.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has 554 career goals and 987 points in 801 games. Of those,
62 goals and 101 points have come against the Stars _ more than any
other team he has played against. A naturalized citizen of the
United States born in Belleville, Ontario, he has been a standout
performer in international competitions, including one of Team
USA's best players in the 1996 World Cup victory. He has never
played in a Stanley Cup Finals, but that's one reason, he said, he
joined the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to win and to be a champion,'' Hull said.
``They were as close as anybody to winning a Stanley Cup and to
have them want me to be a part of that I thought is a great
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will, of course, come. Are the Stars now loaded
with too many stars? Will one puck be enough? Can Hull fit into
coach Ken Hitchcock's scheme, which calls for short shifts, rolling
four lines and everyone playing Q5 &LR; 9M? Will he be a distraction in
the locker room?
</P>
<P>
   All the answers yesterday were positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to win,'' center Guy Carbonneau said. ``Whatever you
want to say about Brett Hull, he's coming here because he wants to
win now. And that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau played one season with Hull for the Blues and said
Hull's reputation as outspoken or tough on management stemmed from
his role as an icon in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy. When he was in St. Louis, he took a lot of
blame for things simply because he was sticking up for other
players,'' Carbonneau said. ``He got into a lot of trouble because
he was constantly taking on management, but I don't see that
happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said he was ready to come in and be a piece in the Stars'
puzzle. He will no longer have to carry a franchise, simply help it
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how much I score, as long as we win,'' he said.
``I don't care if I play left wing, right wing or defense, as long
as we win.''
</P>
<P>
   He already is taking a step in the right direction. Hull has
worn No. 16 throughout his career, but said he had no intentions of
taking that number from Stars winger Pat Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``New team, new house, new city, might as well make it a clean
start and get a new number, too,'' he said. ``I'll probably have my
wife pick it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that doesn't sound like the kind of guy who would be a
disturbance in any locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one has Brett Hull stories about things he's said or
done,'' said center Joe Nieuwendyk, who was Hull's linemate when
the two were rookies with the Calgary Flames in 1987. ``But the
bottom line is nobody wants to win more than Brett Hull. He plays a
lot harder than people give him credit for. He plays a lot better
defense than people give him credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll fit right in here,'' Nieuwendyk added. ``This
might be just what he needs.''

Stats lose luster for Griffey 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ken Griffey Jr. doesn't need the newspapers
to keep up with Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. He also insists he
doesn't check out ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to do than watch television,'' Griffey said.
``I'd rather spend a couple hours talking on the telephone, or on
the computer, surfing the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said he usually gets his updates on the Great Home Run
Chase from the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will bring radios to the game or see it on the
scoreboard and yell, `Hey, he hit another one!'' Griffey said.
``I'll just sit there and shrug my shoulders. What do you want me
to do about it? It's not like I'm the one throwing it up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The race to break Roger Maris' home-run record is going full
blast as baseball approaches the All-Star break. McGwire is leading
the field with 37 home runs, going into last night's game, but
Griffey is coming on strong. He came to Texas with 35, having hit
four in his past four games. Sosa, who set a major-league record
with 20 in June, has 33.
</P>
<P>
   All of baseball seems to be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I keep up with it,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``I think it's great for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey insists he's not keeping up or getting excited by it.
His perception of the season to date is colored by what has
happened to the Mariners, a team that started the year with World
Series aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Those aspirations are fading as the summer progresses. A team
that won two division titles in the past three seasons entered a
three-game series with the Rangers in last place in the American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' Griffey said. ``It would be
frustrating to anybody when they're doing what they like to be
doing and the team isn't doing what they're supposed to be doing,
and that's winning. I don't like to lose. Sometimes I have to when
I'm playing my son, but that's different. Other than that, I want
to win at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is not the only Mariners who feels that way. Shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, who will join Griffey in Colorado for the All-Star
Game, began last night's game hitting .310 with 27 home runs and 23
stolen bases. The possibility exists he could join Barry Bonds and
Jose Canseco in the exclusive ``40-40'' club for home runs and
stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez doesn't care, not when the Mariners are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Griffey Show, the Rodriguez Show or the Randy
Johnson Show,'' Rodriguez said. ``This is the Mariners Show. This
is about a team, not individuals. I get sick of people who look at
us as individuals and not as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Griffey, ``Do you see a calculator in my locker? I just go
out there, see the ball, hit it and run. I don't look at numbers.
That's for you guys sitting in your little offices, comparing who
is doing what and who's not doing what. I don't think there's
anyone in this locker room who has a stats book.''
</P>
<P>
   As for McGwire and Sosa, Griffey said, ``I don't care about
them. I don't care about anybody outside this locker room. What am
I supposed to do. Call up Dionne Warwick and find out when they're
going to hit another home run? I've got 24 guys I worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers might mean more if the Mariners were winning, and
both Griffey and Rodriguez insist it's not too late. The Mariners
remember 1995, when they made up 14 games in the second half of the
season and won their first division title by beating the Angels in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Rodriguez said. ``We still have three months of
baseball left. We've got a talented team, and there's great parity
in this division. Obviously, the Angels and Rangers have a great
advantage because they're so far ahead. But I don't think they're
in a position to take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners want to be in a pennant race. The Great Home Run
Chase holds no interest, particularly for the man involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win,'' Griffey said. ``What's so hard about that?
What's so hard about going out there, playing hard and winning?''

RANGERS SHAKE UP ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With his offense slumping to the offbeat tune
of a .176 batting average, manager Johnny Oates shook up both the
lineup and the pregame routine.
</P>
<P>
   He moved Will Clark from the No. 5 spot, where he had batted all
season, to No. 3. Clark was one of the few Rangers not slumping,
with a .444 batting average in his past seven games. Oates wanted
him batting in front of Juan Gonzalez, who had gone five games
without a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will's been swinging the bat well, and Juan hasn't had a
chance to swing the bat with people on base lately,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates also moved Mark McLemore to leadoff and dropped Tom
Goodwin, who was batting .147 in his past 10 games, to ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The change in routine came when Oates elected to cancel outside
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to change it up, mix it up a little bit,''
Oates said.
Greer stays out
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer missed his third consecutive game because of a tight
left oblique muscle, which continues to heal slowly. Oates said if
Greer isn't ready today, he probably won't play until Friday in
Oakland, the Rangers' second game after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Even if healthy, the left-handed-hitting Greer wouldn't play
tomorrow against Mariners left-hander Randy Johnson. The Rangers
expect to face Athletics lefty Kenny Rogers on Thursday, the first
game after the break.
</P>
<P>
   There might come a time when Greer becomes a candidate for the
disabled list, but that decision wouldn't come until after the
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be that,'' Oates said. ``But I've said
that before and it ended up being that.''
Drew fallout
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals' signing of J.D. Drew figures to have an
impact on teams that haven't signed their first-round draft picks,
including the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will make it harder for everybody else to sign their
guys,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Pena, the 10th overall choice in the June draft, hasn't
responded to the Rangers' offer of a $1.35 million signing bonus.
His asking price probably went up when the Cardinals signed Drew to
a four-year, $7 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Drew's contract could be worth as much as $8.5 million over the
four years. On a per-year basis it's not much less than the $11.5
million over five years Drew was asking last year, when he was
drafted second overall by the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Drew refused to sign, and went back into the draft this year.
The fact he got close to what he originally wanted even after
sitting out a year concerned Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to prevent a guy sitting out a year, saying I can get
what I want anyway?'' Melvin said.
Pitching plans
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' tentative post-break rotation has John Burkett
pitching Thursday in Oakland, followed by Rick Helling on Friday,
Aaron Sele on Saturday, Darren Oliver on Sunday and Todd Van Poppel
on Monday in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That flip-flops Helling and Sele, on the assumption Sele will
pitch at least one inning in the All-Star Game on Tuesday night.
Hull impact
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' signing of free agent Brett Hull caused rumblings
down the freeway with the other team owned by Tom Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he the player to be named later in the Bobby Witt deal?''
one front-office wag wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   One-liners aside, the signing of a premier free agent is another
indication Hicks is willing to do what it takes to put together a
winner. However, it doesn't mean there's help for the Rangers
around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have patience,'' Oates said. ``There's no such
thing as a free agent in baseball in July. At least not a quality
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's the one-liners. Like the one from
Melvin as Hull was about to throw out the first pitch last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll sign a guy and let him drop the puck,'' Melvin
said.
Farm report
</P>
<P>
   Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): The RedHawks defeated
Albuquerque, 7-2, Thursday, snapping a season-worst seven-game
losing streak. Terry Clark pitched six innings for the victory, and
Jeff Granger pitched the final three innings for his first save.
Rene Gonzales hit a grand slam and had five RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers lost at Midland,
10-5, snapping a six-game winning streak. Ruben Mateo went 3-for-5
with two doubles to extend his hitting streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): The Rangers lost their
third consecutive game, 8-5, to Clearwater despite Shawn
Gallagher's 15th homer and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats lost to
Charleston, 13-2. Reliever David Lundberg gave up nine runs _ five
earned _ in the ninth inning.

   PALATKA, Fla. _ This was ground zero for chaos Friday as
thousands of people fleeing fire endured a snail-paced procession
of vehicles full of pets, clothes and anything else that could be
crammed in or lashed on for the journey to someplace safe.
</P>
<P>
   Many evacuees said they had no idea where they were going.
Hotels rooms were as rare as rain showers, directions were scarce,
shelters were late in opening, families were split and worry was
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worrisome. It's scary. You don't know where you are going
and what you are going to go back to, if anything,'' said Pat Reed
of Palm Coast, standing on a Palatka sidewalk with her cockatiel,
Rascal, and dog, Rocky. ``I guess we'll find someplace, maybe
Gainesville, but we don't know the route.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Flagler County, at least 30,000 people, was ordered
evacuated Friday. They joined about 40,000 others who had been
ordered out of their homes in two other East Coast counties,
Brevard and Volusia, earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   State Road 100 west and Interstate 95 south were the only roads
open to Flagler evacuees. Palatka is the first city on SR 100 past
the Flagler County line.
</P>
<P>
   Some people left quickly, packing just a few belongings. But
State Road 100 resembled Route 66 during the Okie exodus of the
1930s Dust Bowl _ these modern trucks and cars loaded with lawn
mowers, bicycles, barbecue grills and lots of other household
items.
</P>
<P>
   Many were towing boats packed with belongings. Horse trailers
were also numerous, and it seemed every other car had a dog lapping
at hot air out the windows and cats ensconced in pet carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a guy with his riding lawn mower and his dog and I
thought, this guy knows his priorities,'' said Putnam County
sheriff's deputy G.L. Bowling, standing in the middle of State Road
100 to flag on motorists and answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just asking about motel rooms and directions.'' he
said. ``A lot of them just don't know where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Palatka hotel rooms filled up quickly. The Holiday Inn was
commandeered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, forcing
owner-manager Connie Revels to deny rooms to reservation holders.
</P>
<P>
   Revels said she would open the banquet room for cots if
necessary to accommodate firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some firefighters here all week,'' Revels said.
``Last night, a lady firefighter got in late and saw the pool and
said she would love nothing better then a swim. The guard let her
in, even though the pool had been closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Laveda Frieze of Jesup, Ga., was one of those reservation
holders who found herself roomless. In fact, she was out of an
entire vacation because of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to go to the Pepsi 400 in Daytona, but that got
canceled because of the fires, `` she said. ``But I don't feel
sorry for myself. These fires are a terrible thing and the
firefighters need this hotel more than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they had gotten no information or wrong
information about the availability of shelters in Palatka.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience store parking lots were packed with evacuees
stocking up, exchanging information or looking for family and
friends. Hotel driveways were a parade of drive-by room seekers
who, instead of stopping, would call out to others about room
availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a nightmare. What's most difficult is that we can't
find a motel,'' said Bertha Reddin of Palm Coast in a car with four
adults and two kids. ``They gave us 15 minutes to get out. We don't
even know where any shelters are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross did not establish a shelter in Palatka, though
several churches were taking in people and a school was open. The
Red Cross did open a shelter in Melrose, in Gainesville, and in
Waldo. Waldo had been evacuated by wildfires last month.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a place to stay was only part of the stress for
evacuees. Worry about what they left behind and will find when they
get back was also a heavy weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just grabbed what we could and threw it in the car,'' said
Pat Reed. ``What do you pick? How do you go through things and say,
`This treasure means more'? I'm worried about friends. I don't know
where any of them are. I just hope we have something to go back
to.''

 &HT;    Braves edge Mets, up lead to 10 1/2
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Mets might have come to make an issue of the NL
East, a dormant thing these past three months.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Glavine winning his 12th, the Braves opened a weekend
series with a 3-2 victory that left them in their most commanding
position of the season. Atlanta increased the division lead to a
season-high 10 1/2 games, moved to a season-high 28 games above
.500 while the Mets lost for the fifth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made it a one-run game in a wild eighth with a run off
Dennis Martinez, who with two outs gave up an infield single to
Luiz Lopez, a bloop single to Carlos Baerga and an infield single
off the plate to Rey Ordonez that scored Lopez to make it 3-2. But
when Brian McRae singled hard to center, Andruw Jones preserved the
lead by throwing out Baerga at the plate for Jones' 10th assist of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (12-3) allowed one run through seven innings, permitting
eight hits while walking two and striking out four. He is now 8-1
in his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets broke through with a run in the sixth off Glavine. With
two outs, Butch Huskey singled and Luis Lopez followed with an
infield single on a 3-2 count to bring up Baerga, who was hitting
.325 with runners in scoring position and two outs. He sent a
dribbler up the middle to bring in Huskey to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored twice in the fourth for a 3-0 lead and Glavine
was right in the middle of it. He followed up a Tony Graffanino
double with a single (his fourth hit in his last eight at-bats),
giving the Braves runners on first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss next brought in Graffanino on a suicide squeeze and
when Gerald Williams served an opposite-field single to right,
third-base coach Bobby Dews waved Glavine around. From right field,
Huskey's throw to the plate may have been in time but it
short-hopped catcher Mike Piazza and Glavine slid past for the
third run while the ball bounced to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves went out 1-0 in the third but also lost a run on a
call against Williams, who laid down a fine bunt on the left side
and wound up on second after third baseman Lopez's throw went all
the way to the tarp down the right field line. But plate umpire
Greg Bonin called Williams out for running inside the baseline _
both feet appeared to be in the infield grass as he neared first _
bringing an angry protest from Williams and manager Bobby Cox, who
argued that the ball was not catchable.

   Tough course doesn't faze Stacy
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Sheeley
</P>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ No stranger to stout U.S. Women's Open
performances, Savannah native Hollis Stacy made her presence known
Friday with a 3-under-par 68 in the second round. While others were
surrendering to the Blackwolf Run Golf Course and cursing designer
Pete Dye, Stacy demonstrated how she become a three-time U.S.
Women's Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy started briskly in her morning round, making birdies at
the first two holes and repairing some damage from Thursday's
opening 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to play the weekend, especially because I've
missed the last two cuts (at the Open),'' said the 44-year-old
Stacy, a resident of La Quinta, Calif. ``Since I birdied the first
couple of holes, I felt more like I could just play golf and not
sweat bullets about the cut.''
</P>
<P>
   None of what bothered other players _ wind, length, tight
approaches, undulating greens _ seemed to faze Stacy Friday. She
birdied the 10th and 13th and bogeyed only the 17th, finishing 36
holes at 2-over 144. Had it not been for the local wildlife, Stacy
might have played a flawless round. She 3-putted the 17th green
after waiting for deer prints to be fixed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' she said, ``he wasn't (going) spikeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy, who told the U.S. Golf Association this year that she did
not want an exemption, made it here as a qualifier from the
Broadmoor sectional in Colorado Springs. It's the 29th consecutive
Open appearance for Stacy, who has six USGA championships _ Opens
in 1977-78 and 1984; and U.S. girls junior titles in 1969-71.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy's play was more solid than her physical condition. She's
been on a daily regimen of strengthening and stretching exercises
since injuring her back in February ``from hitting lots of golf
balls with my new equipment, playing in cold weather and a lovely,
six-hour flight to Hawaii and lifting up a 40-pound golf bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stacy, ``I'm not 24 anymore, where I would walk out onto
the practice tee, hit one ball and go to the first tee. I have to
stretch for 15 minutes to hit a bucket of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar impersonation
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the performance of another ACC player, Georgia
Tech's Matt Kuchar, in the Masters and U.S. Open, Duke senior-to-be
Jenny Chuasiriporn shot an even-par 71 for 143. She made the cut
last year, also, eventually tying for 56th at Pumpkin Ridge. ``It's
always nice to see another amateur do well,'' said the Curtis Cup
player from Baltimore, who met Kuchar playing junior golf. ``He is
actually a good friend of mine. It will be nice to see what he does
from here.'' Chuasiriporn's parents, who are natives of Thailand,
are in attendance, having closed their restaurant, the Bangkok
Palace, in Baltimore. ... Karen Noble eagled the par-4, 340-yard
first hole Friday, holing out from 110 yards with a 9-iron. ...
Early Georgia finishers: Cindy McCurdy, Newnan (77-74_151);
Stephanie Lowe, Lawrenceville (74-75 _ 149); Nanci Bowen, Tifton
(77-74 _ 151).

 &HT;    Rookie holds lead at halfway point
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ South Korea's 20-year-old Se Ri Pak, who already
owns a major championship in her rookie year on the LPGA Tour,
could be moving into position for another one. With a 1-under-par
70 Friday, Pak assumed a one-stroke lead at 3-under-par 139 after
36 holes of the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of a United States Golf Association event, par has
become an enviable score. Only eight players broke par on the
demanding Blackwolf Run Golf Course Friday and only two are under
par through 36 holes -- Pak and her closest challenger, Sweden's
Liselotte Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, 32, who made the 1988 U.S. Women's Open her first U.S.
win, shot her second straight 70 Friday and is a stroke behind Pak
at 2-under 140.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament drew a another record crowd Friday, about 26,000
people -- 7,000 more than the average for the tournament's second
day. With 47,000 attending for two days, the first major ever held
in Wisconsin has a chance to break last year's four-day Women's
Open record of 109,000.
</P>
<P>
   The only LPGA rookie to win two majors in the same season was
Juli Inkster, who captured the Nabisco Dinah Shore and du Maurier
Classic in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''This course, you miss one shot and it is really difficult to
make a par or bogey,'' said Pak, who won the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in May. ''I have two days left. I do not know what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is over for Albany's Nancy Lopez, 41, who
collapsed to a 12-over-par 83 Friday and will miss the cut at
18-over 160. Also gone is defending champion Alison Nicholas
(78-78--156). The projected cut is 8-over-par 150.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she's doubting whether an Open win ever will
materialize, Lopez said, ''No, I don't want to think that. I've
never been a negative person. I just have to keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   First-round co-leader Laura Davies, who shot a 68 Thursday,
slipped to a 75 Friday and is four shots back at 143. After a round
that included two water hazard penalties, Davies, after a restless
Thursday night, was pleased with her position.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't sleep all that well last night,'' Davies said. ''I've
won 52 times and here I am worrying about a cut from the leading
position. But that's what this game does. It works on your
mind....I supposed it's just because it (the Open) means so much to
me. When you miss four of the last five cuts over here, it tears
you completely apart and just destroys your confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Neumann, ''I'm extremely happy just being on contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Three shots off the lead at 142 are Dottie Pepper, with a second
71; Scotland's Mhairi McKay, whose 70 came after a back-nine 32;
Chris Johnson (72-70); and amateur Brenda Corrie Kuehn, who bogeyed
the 18th hole for 72.
</P>
<P>
   Statesboro native Dale Eggeling (71-72) is in a group of five
players at 143, a shot better than three-time champion Hollis Stacy
of Savannah, whose 68 was the day's low round.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time champion Annika Sorenstam is at 146 after a 75..
</P>
<P>
   First-round co-leader Kim Williams dropped to an 81 after an
opening 68.
</P>
<P>
   Seven groups failed to finish play because of darkness and will
complete their second rounds at 6:45 a.m. today, followed by the
cut to the top 60 and ties. Play was suspended earlier for 51
minutes because of lightning.

 &HT;    Klesko visits team but still feels pain
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Ryan Klesko dropped by the clubhouse Friday afternoon
and, following a routine of bed-rest and a diet of sherbet, did not
appear to be ready to lace up the cleats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better,'' he said, four days after his
appendectomy. ``The doctors want me to walk around so I was up
doing that for about an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be OK once he gets a little food in him,'' said manager
Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's return remains unsettled. Though Cox had anticipated
getting his left fielder back for the first post-All-Star series in
Florida, Klesko said he did not expect to even try batting practice
until next Thursday, when that series is scheduled to open at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Klesko said. ``Yesterday, I couldn't
get out of bed. I don't know. I'm feeling a lot of pain. I'm not
supposed to do a lot for a couple more days.''
</P>
<P>
   He walks very stiffly, in part due to the three small incisions,
and says most discomfort comes from ``laughing, coughing and
burping,'' which would impose deeply into Klesko's daily routine.
He will spend the All-Star break at his North Palm Beach home and
then join the team in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if doctors saved the appendix for Klesko for a souvenir,
team trainer Dave Pursley said, ``They couldn't find a jar big
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Family affair
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss returned home Thursday night to find son Brody, 3,
was also returning home after 13 nights at Scottish Rite Childrens
Medical Center, where he fought off a serious E. coli infection.
The family was exploring with doctors the chance Brody might be
able to attend the All-Star game in Denver next week, where his
father will be the starting shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a while until he's his old self,'' said
Weiss, ``but the worst is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day . . .
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers did not pitch for the Richmond Braves Friday night
and Atlanta officials were glad of it. Wohlers made a third
straight appearance against Charlotte Thursday and gave up another
run, walking two, striking out two and allowing a runner to score
on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish (Richmond pitching coach Bill Fischer) will handle it
from now on,'' said Cox, ``because if you leave it up to Mark,
he'll want to pitch every night. If his arm falls off, then you've
got nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   After three outings in Richmond, Wohlers worked 2 2/3 innings,
allowed seven runs on five hits while striking out four and walking
six. He has also thrown two wild pitches. This is hardly the stat
line of a pitcher who is close to returning to the major leagues.
The Braves have no clue when to expect him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has the answer to that,'' said general
manager John Schuerholz. ``What we're going to do is keep throwing
him for as long as he can, until he gets to the point where, in our
opinion, he'll be a useful amenity for us. To be honest with you,
Mark will know the right time before we will.''

 &HT;    On Deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    ByThomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS; 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (9-4, 4.78; 0-0,
18.00 ERA vs. Mets) vs. RHP Masato Yoshii (4-3, 3.45; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Millwood, making his first start in 10 days after his
turn was skipped, is having his roughest stretch since joining the
club last July 12. In two starts against Montreal and the New York
Yankees, he lasted a total of 4 2/3 innings and gave up 14 hits
(three homers and two doubles) and 12 earned runs. His curveball
has been particularly vulnerable. Since going 7-1 in his first 10
outings, Millwood has since gone 2-3, accumulating an 8.87 ERA
since May 30. His only previous appearance against the Mets was an
unfortunate spot of relief work on the last day of the 1997 season,
when he gave up four hits and two runs. He has not pitched in
relief since. Yoshii, 33, came to the Mets as a free agent last
January after accumulating a 73-51 record in 13 seasons in the
Japan League. He was a teammate of Hideo Nomo for five years in
Kinetseu. Like Nomo, he throws the forkball, although after an
excellent start (4-1, 2.33 ERA through first nine games), the
league may be solving him. He is 0-2 in his last six starts with a
5.79 ERA.

 &HT;    Millwood back on fat-free diet
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The sabbatical was brief but well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   A few encouraging side sessions, no unnecessary overtime out of
the bullpen and a diagnosis by Dr. Leo should restore Kevin
Millwood's fat-free fastball.
</P>
<P>
   After missing one turn in the rotation, Millwood returns to the
mound tonight for the first time in 10 days and the last time
before the All-Star break. In his first career start against the
Mets, he also hopes to return to the form that produced a 7-1 start
before his ERA jumped a run-and-a-half in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes up and down during the season,'' said Millwood.
``I think that's what separates young pitchers from (Greg) Maddux.
Consistency, that's what I've got to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first two months of his first full big-league
season, he consistently impressed and improved. A May 25 win
against the Cubs was Millwood's fourth straight and left him 7-1,
with a 3.27 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning with a May 30 shelling in Chicago (three innings,
nine hits, six earned runs), Millwood has lost three of his last
five decisions, his ERA ballooning to 4.78. In those five starts,
he's allowed 32 hits (including six homers) and 23 runs (all
earned) in 23 1/3 innings, an ERA of 8.87.
</P>
<P>
   The last two outings have been painful. Millwood lasted just 1
1/3 innings in Montreal June 19, giving up seven runs on seven hits
(two homers). On June 24, he got a quick 2-0 lead over the Yankees
and led 2-1 entering the fourth inning before they knocked him out
with four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun when you're having outings like that,'' said
Millwood, who was charged with five earned runs on seven hits.
``But everybody has 'em. Not always two in a row, but everybody's
had 'em. I think it has something to do with not knowing how to get
out of some situations.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more with a fat fastball. ``My fastball's cutting a
little bit, coming over the plate,'' said Millwood, who was
bypassed in the rotation when the Braves had an off-day last Monday
and became available for spot bullpen duty the next two nights in
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have a couple of days off, to work in side
sessions on my mechanics,'' he said. ``Just trying to get
everything in sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Dr. Leo. ``His arm angle was too low,'' said pitching
coach Leo Mazzone. ``Because he's striding out too far, getting all
spread out. That causes him to go underneath the ball.'' Thus
causing his fastball to stay up, and fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying too hard. When you do that, you drop your
backside, which makes his pitches up or out _ fat,'' said Mazzone.
``He got boxed around in Montreal. His way of trying to get better
is with super stuff and super control. When you try to do that, you
overexert, you muscle up, you get spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   You get hit hard. Now, Mazzone says, ``He looks fine. All
pitchers go through those things over a period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying not to overthink the whole thing, not make it
something it's not,'' Millwood said. ``Just stick to basics and get
back on a roll again.

METS GET 12 HITS BUT LOSE TO BRAVES, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The all-star game break cannot come soon enough for
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when it looked as though the Mets' offense, which
produced 19 runs in the previous two games, might be getting on
track, Edgardo Alfonzo was scratched from the starting lineup
shortly before New York's first meeting Friday night with Atlanta
because of soreness behind his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets banged out 12 hits, eight against the starter,
Tom Glavine, but lost, 3-2, to the Braves at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Andruw Jones preserved the victory for the Braves
in the eighth inning when he threw out Carlos Baerga at the plate
as he was trying to score on a Brian McRae single with two out.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising that the Mets were even in the game by then,
after they had failed to get to Glavine early. The New Yorkers left
the bases loaded in the top of the first and could not score with
runners on first and second with one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Glavine (12-3), who allowed just one run in his
seven innings, became stronger as the game went along. And then,
after the Mets came up one run short against the 43-year-old
right-hander Dennis Martinez in the eighth, the Braves had pulled a
season-high 10 1/2 games in front of the second-place Mets, who
more than likely have only the wild card to look forward to the
rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Mets (44-37), who have dropped five of their last
seven games, can regroup after the break, which begins this Monday.
Because there has been a lack of continuity to their lineup,
because of injuries and trades, almost since the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe Todd Hundley's presence, which could manifest
itself as soon as next week, can bring some stability to a talented
group that, aside from its starting pitching, has underachieved for
much of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Bernard Gilkey _ one of the main underachievers _
hit lead-off for the first time this season and only the third time
in two years. Once Alfonzo, who is listed as day to day, went down,
Benny Agbayani batted second in the injured third baseman's place.
He singled off Glavine with one out in the top of the first, before
being thrown out on an attempted steal of second for the second out
of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, who has caught fire again in the three games he has
hit in front of Mike Piazza, followed with a double inside of
third, before Glavine issued one of those so-called
``unintentional'' intentional walks to Piazza to give the Mets
runners on first and second. Butch Huskey then walked, and the Mets
had a chance at a big inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Luis Lopez, who was playing at third for Alfonzo, grounded
back to Glavine to end the threat. And then with the teams still
scoreless in the top of the third, Huskey grounded into a
second-to-short-to-first double play to end the inning, as
consecutive one-out singles by Olerud and Piazza went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta responded with a run off Brian Bohanon _ he was making a
spot start of his own in place of the injured Al Leiter _ in the
bottom of the third. And it was almost if the Braves needed
something controversial to get them going.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, the former Yankee Gerald Williams appeared to beat
out a bunt, as Bohanon threw wildly past John Olerud at first. But
with Williams standing on second thanks to the apparent error, home
plate umpire Greg Bonin ruled that Williams had run inside the
first-base line and ruled him out, bringing an angry Bobby Cox out
of the Atlanta dugout to argue.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won the argument, but lost the battle. Chipper Jones
followed with a two-out double. After an intentional walk to Andres
Galarraga, Javy Lopez singled Jones home. And it was 1-0 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored twice more in the fourth on a Tony Graffanino
double, the first of Glavine's two singles, a perfectly executed
suicide squeeze bunt from Walt Weiss to score Graffanino, and a
single by Williams to score Glavine. The pitcher beat Huskey's
throw from right field, which skipped away from Piazza at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, it was 3-0 Braves. And now, the Mets' only hope
was to get to the Atlanta bullpen, which has been just as shaky as
the Mets' pen this season.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the Mets pushed across a sixth-inning run against
Glavine with a two-out rally that was capped by a run-scoring
Baerga single (both Baerga and McRae _ who are switch-hitters _
batted left-handed against the left-handed Glavine Friday evening).
</P>
<P>
   Then came Martinez _ and the Mets' best chance to tie. With two
out, Lopez reached on an infield single, and Baerga moved him to
third with a bloop single to left. Rey Ordonez followed with a chop
over the mound for a run-scoring infield single, and it was 3-2.
But Jones threw the head-first sliding Baerga out on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga argued. So did manager Bobby Valentine. But this time,
the argument went against the Mets. And so soon would the game.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Mets announced they have reached a verbal agreement with
outfielder Jason Tyner, their No. 1 pick in this summer's draft
(21st overall). A 21-year-old left-handed hitter from Texas A&AMP;M, he
will sign his contract pending a physical in Manhattan next
Wednesday. Tyner will join the Mets here and take batting practice
with them before Saturday night's game ... As expected, the Mets
announced that 19-year-old left-hander Geoff Goetz is the player to
be named later in the May 22 trade that brought Mike Piazza to the
Mets from Florida. Goetz, the Mets' top selection in last season's
draft (sixth overall), was 5-4 with a 3.96 earned run average in 15
starts with Class A Columbia.

YANKS BEAT ORIOLES, 3-2  
 (HLW)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baltimore Manager Ray Miller said he wouldn't
hesitate to use Armando Benitez in Yankee Stadium, in spite of
Benitez's status of Public Enemy No. 1 following the brawl the
relief pitcher instigated with the Yankees on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller would not use him in a situation tailored for Benitez
on Friday night, and the Yankees took advantage to win the game in
the ninth inning, 3-2, when Scott Brosius singled home Chad Curtis
from third base with one out. Andy Pettitte pitched nine innings
for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 59-20. Should the Yankees sweep Baltimore here
this weekend, as they did in May, they would be 61-20 and match the
best 81-game records in the 20th century, tying the 1902 Pittsburgh
Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs. Even if the Yankees won just 41
of their remaining 83 games _ less than .500 ball at 41-42 _ they
would win 100 games for the first time since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines pinch-hit for Darryl Strawberry to start the ninth
inning for the Yankees, and the Baltimore left-handed reliever
Jesse Orosco plunked him in the thigh, the first time in two years
Orosco has hit a batter. Curtis chopped a grounder to the right of
Mike Bordick at shortstop, a ball that could have resulted in a
force play at second. But Bordick fumbled the hop _ the play was
scored a single _ and the Yankees had first and second and nobody
out.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Sveum pinch-hit for Ricky Ledee and bunted into a force
play at third. With four right-handed hitters in a row due to bat,
it was a natural situation to use the right-handed Benitez. Miller
stayed with Orosco.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, leading off second, took advantage of Orosco's
deliberate delivery and swiped third base. Miller went to the mound
to discuss the situation, with Benitez ready in the bullpen. But
Miller stayed with Orosco _ though he needed a strikeout _ and
Brosius popped a single over second base, to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken opened the Oriole ninth with a walk and was removed
for a pinch-runner, Jeff Reboulet, churning up memories from May 1,
1996, when Manny Alexander pinch-ran for Ripken in a game against
the Yankees, the first time Ripken had been replaced with the
outcome of a game still in doubt during his record-breaking
consecutive game streak.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander immediately was picked off that night _ and Reboulet
was promptly picked off by Pettitte Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk that the Orioles' front office will begin major
restructuring and trade Roberto Alomar and possibly Rafael Palmeiro
later this month and try to inject some youth into its aged roster.
</P>
<P>
   On a given night, in a given inning, however, the Orioles can be
formidable, particularly when Mike Mussina, their ace, has a good
fastball and a darting curveball, as he did Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Yankees to just six hits in the first seven innings,
often making them look foolish. Scott Brosius struck out on three
pitches with a runner at second and one out in the second, and
Mussina zipped a two-strike fastball past the next hitter, Joe
Girardi, for a strikeout. Girardi, normally reserved, threw his
helmet and bat angrily, barking at home plate umpire Marty Foster
about the call.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill chased a neck-high fastball in the third, Tino
Martinez waved weakly at a curveball in the fourth; Mussina had a
2-1 lead, but that one-run mountain seemed to steepen with every
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   When Chad Curtis batted with two out in the Yankee fourth,
having doubled in his first at-bat, he fell behind 1-2 after he
fouled off a fastball. But he kept fouling off pitches, four in a
row. Mussina tried getting him to chase a high fastball, Curtis
didn't. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat, Mussina threw a
belt-high pitch that appeared to be a fastball and Curtis _ not
overswinging, keeping his weight back _ drove the ball to deep
right center, where it cleared the wall by a few feet, tying the
score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had retired the first six Baltimore hitters, breezing
through the first two innings with only 22 pitches. But the Orioles
jumped on him in the third, pulling inside pitches down the lines.
Joe Carter opened by looping a single to left and Chris Hoiles
smacked a 2-0 fastball into the left field corner for a double,
Carter stopping at third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick then muscled a high fastball to deep left center,
where Ricky Ledee ran down the ball against the fence. Carter
tagged up and scored, Hoiles ambled to third. Two batters later,
B.J. Surhoff smashed a double past the first baseman Tino Martinez,
and Hoiles scored, giving Baltimore a 2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees swept Baltimore here in May, and as badly as the
Orioles have played, they must have had some sense of doom in the
very first inning, after the Yankees scored the game's first run in
their first turn at bat. Derek Jeter hit Mussina's first pitch to
right field for a single _ before the game, Jeter had said he would
swing at the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo was next, filling in for sore-kneed Chuck Knoblauch,
in Sojo's first appearance since June 21. Sojo faked a bunt on
Mussina's first pitch, and then perfectly executed a hit-and-run:
Jeter broke for second, Sojo hit the ball behind him, through the
first base hole, and Jeter scampered to third.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neill drove a fly to deep left, Jeter tagged up and
scored. All very neat, efficient, the sort of stuff you expect from
a team that has won nearly three-quarter of its games.
