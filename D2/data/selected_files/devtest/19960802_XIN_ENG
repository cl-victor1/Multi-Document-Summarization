<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Increases in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. increased by 1.2 percent in June but spending on residential
homes declined, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that spending on residential,
non-residential and public projects totaled 565.9 billion dollars,
up from a revised spending of 559.2 billion dollars in May, when
spending fell for the first time in three months.
</P>
<P>
U.S. construction spending in June was 3.8 percent higher than
that in the same month of 1995 and it mainly resulted from an
increase of non-residential spending.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential spending jumped 6.7 percent to 139.7 billion
dollars, wiping out a 3.5 percent loss a month earlier. Most
categories posted gains, including outlays for factories, office
buildings, hotels and motels and commercial projects such as
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
But residential spending was down by 0.2 percent to 246.1
billion dollars from 246.7 billion in May. It was the second
decline in a row.
</P>
<P>
Single family outlays slipped 0.1 percent after remaining
unchanged in May. Most analysts have expected housing activity to
cool down because of high mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, sales of both new and existing
homes fell in June and building permits -- a barometer of future
activity -- also were down.
</P>
<P>
Often-volatile spending on multi-family structures such as
apartments and condominiums, which are not as interest sensitive,
fell by 2.4 percent in June, the second straight month of decline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spending on construction fell by 0.5
percent to 141.1 billion dollars after four months of gains.

<HEADLINE> China Replaces Polluted Water in Dianchi Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The long-waited project to
replace polluted water in the scenic Dianchi Lake, in southwest
China's Yunnan province, was launched today.
</P>
<P>
The much-publicized Dianchi Lake, with an area of 300 square
kilometers, has been seriously polluted for 20 years by domestic
and industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection official said that about 150
million cubic meters of waste water pours into the fresh water
lake each year, making it one of the most seriously polluted in
the country.
</P>
<P>
To get rid of the pollution in the lake, the province has
raised three billion yuan for the project.
</P>
<P>
The lake attracts large numbers of tourists from both home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
China also plans to solve the pollution problem in Taihu Lake
in Jiangsu province and Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province.

<HEADLINE> Britain Starts Destroying 3,000 Clinic Embryos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- British fertility clinics started
the destruction of some 3,000 fertility clinic embryos today
following the expiry of a five-year government storage time limit.
</P>
<P>
Under a law passed in 1991, all fertility clinic embryos would
have to be destroyed after a five-year storage time limit unless
the consent of the "parents" was given.
</P>
<P>
The move has provoked passionate protests from anti-abortion
groups and the Life group has appealed to the Official Solicitor
to "come to the protection of human beings."
</P>
<P>
The embryos are the product of laboratory fertilization for
couples desperate to have children and in most cases, the donor
parents have been contacted and either given permission for their
embryos to be destroyed, or requested their storage.
</P>
<P>
But around 3,300 embryos, which remain unclaimed because the
parents cannot be traced, are to be destroyed by being dropped
into a solution of alcohol and vinegar for a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ian Graf, who is in charge of the task of destroying
the embryos, said that he understands the emotions of campaigners
calling for a six-month reprieve, but he insists that this is not
a matter of killing new life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Graf said that the time frame of five years for the
storage of embroys is too short, and that doctors should have more
time to try to contact those who donated them.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan Continue Semiconducter, Insurance Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Japanese trade
officials continued their efforts today in a bid to resolve
disputes over the sale of American computer chips and insurance in
the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Johnson said negotiators were still
at work after the five-year U.S-Japanese pact on semiconducter
expired on July 31, and with no plans for a news conference or
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Jay Ziegler, chief spokesman for the U.S. Trade
Representative's Office, said earlier that talks went all night in
Vancouver, Canada's province of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
He said the overnight talks were conducted at the deputy
minister level by representatives of the two governments, while
industry negotiators underwent their separate talks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators of the world's two economic giants were working
against a July 31 deadline set at a meeting in June between
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, as the midnight deadline approached, the two sides
agreed to keep talking indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Representative from the U.S. and Japanese computer chip
industries met throughout the day Wednesday. Acting Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky also met with her Japanese
counterpart, Shunpei Tsukahara.
</P>
<P>
The computer chip dispute involves a 1991 agreement, that set a
20 percent target share for foreign products sale in the Japanese
semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have refused to renew the agreement because they
argued that a current foreign market penetration of more than 30
percent, far surpassing the expected target and the agreement is
no longer needed. They preferred a multilateral forum which
includes the 15-nation European Union to the bilateral pact.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side took the position that without a transition
agreement, the gains foreign chip producers have made in the
Japanese market could be lost.
</P>
<P>
On insurance matters, U.S. officials said talks have been
disappointing. A major barrier remains a U.S. dissatisfacation
that Japan is not living up to an October 1994 agreement to open
its primary life insurance sector, which includes services such as
auto, fire and life insurance, to foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Imports More Goods Through Assab Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The volume of imported goods
through Assab Port had increased to 400,000 tonnes from 339,200
tonnes during the just ended Ethiopian fiscal year (from July 8,
1995 to July 7, 1996).
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly newspaper Abiyotawi Democracy, organ

balance through Djibouti and Massawa ports.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the main imported goods are fertilizers and
salt.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the increase to the growth of trade and
development activities of the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU Denies Plans To Cut Aid to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Thursday
denied reports that its member countries are considering reducing
cooperation with the Zimbabwean government over its continued
condemnation of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation of European Community to Zimbabwe, Michael
Laidler said today there was no intention on the part of the EU or
the EC to link future aid to Zimbabwe with its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
''As far as we are concerned, we think there is no initiative for
serious violation of provisions specified by the Lome Convention,''
Laidler said.
</P>
<P>
Some western diplomats had reportedly been advised by their
governments to check Zimbabwe's human rights record following the
ban, for the second year, of an exhibition by gays and lesbians at
the Zimbabwe international book fair from July 30 to August 3.
</P>
<P>
Since Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's scathing condemnation
of gays and lesbians as ''sodomists and sexual perverts'' last year,
local and international groups have been questioning Zimbabwe's
stance on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The gays and lesbians of Zimbabwe challenged the ban on its
participation at the book fair in the high court on Wednesday and
won, but the government is appealing in the supreme court.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Food Reserve in Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Although Zambia has reaped a bumper
harvest this year, the country's food reserve is in a shortfall of
250,000 tons because of limited government funding.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Food Reserve Agency has said that parliament
only allocated 10 billion Kwacha (about 8 million U.S. Dollars),
which can only purchase 50,000 tons of grain for strategic
reserve instead of the required 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
But a program has been worked out for the gradual collection of
grain until it finally reaches the 300,000 tons mark.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaer today quoted Director of the Reserve Agency
Chance Kabaghe as saying that the sourcing of the grain for the
strategic reserves will however mark the start of the market support
for economically disadvantaged areas.
</P>
<P>
"The grain will be sourced from uneconomic surplus areas where
traders least go because of inaccessibility," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Demonstrate Against Abuse Of Force By Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinians took
to the street in the West Bank city of Nablus today against the
abuse of force by Palestinian police, which led to the death of
Mahmoud Jumayyil, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Furious citizens rallied in the old city of Nablus and marched
toward the Nablus governor headquarters. Palestinian Authority
(PA) police were extensively deployed in the area but only
watched the procession from high building roofs.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators obstructed traffic for some time. They also
shouted slogans against Ghassan Shak'a, Nablus Mayor and Member
of the Palestinian Legislative Council, charging that he is
responsible for reopening the investigation against Mahmoud
Jumayyil after eight months of arrest.
</P>
<P>
Crowds also gathered around the home of Mahmoud Jumayyil in
Harat al-Yasmina neighborhood, where negotiations between
Mahmoud's father and Haj Ismai'l, PA General Security Commander in
the West Bank took place. Mahmoud's father also demanded the
release of his other son My'ayyad Jumayyil.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud, 27, was a Fatah member belonging to Fatah Hawk in
Nablus. He was arrested on December 5, 1995, and imprisoned in
Jericho Prison and then moved to Junaid Prison near Nablus. On
July 27, Mahmoud was taken from Junaid Prison to Rafidya Hospital
in Nablus due to his critical health condition. Then he was
transferred to Ramallah Hospital and later to Hadassa Hospital in
Jerusalem. He died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Jumayyil's father said that his son was subjected to torture
by the Palestinian security personnel, and that beating and
torture marks could be seen on his body.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat said in Bethlehem
Wednesday afternoon that the PA would not forgive any
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"There is no one above the law, from the head of the
state to the guard," he added. Arafat ordered three officers
involved in the torture to report to the PA Military Attorney
General.

<HEADLINE> Security at Pakistan Airports Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Following the bomb blast at the
airport of Punjab provincial capital of Lahore, security at all
airports in Pakistan was further tightened.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken and put into implementation were explained
in detail by the chief of Airport Security Force (ASF), Rasheed
Malik, at a briefing today in the southern port city of Karachi,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASF will be responsible for airport security, from
the "first entry" to the "air side".
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, people carrying the baggage of
others will not be allowed to enter the airport. All screening
machines of the ASF will be kept operating during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is being asked to remove
congestion from verandahs of the airport while the ASF will cover
the security of verandahs and parking area.
</P>
<P>
Events at the parking area will be filmed and night patrolling
on foot and mobile will be increased.
</P>
<P>
The ASF is issuing new stickers for car parking to employees of
various agencies working at the airport.
</P>
<P>
About Airport Entry Passes, which allow holders to enter
airport freely, the ASF chief pointed out that their misuse will
be dealt with a heavy hand and the misusers will not be issued
passes again.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASF hopes to collect 150 million (4.29 million US
dollars) as airport security charges every year, which will be
spent on acquiring screening machines for the ASF and to further
modernize the security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The ASF Chief said the security measures being taken may cause
some discomfort to passengers and all other concerned but they all
will have to bear it under the prevailing conditions.

</P>
<P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Hashimoto's Weird Justification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The homage paid by Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to the Yasukuni Shrine on Monday has
badly hurt the feelings of the people of other Asian nations which
had suffered the atrocities of Japanese militarism in World War II.
</P>
<P>
China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic
of Korea and Singapore as well as some Japanese public opinions
have all strongly condemned the act of Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
However, Hashimoto refused to make any self-examination of his
behavior. Instead, he argued that he went there to mourn the war
dead, including his cousin, not the war criminals. He even
accused other Asian nations of ignoring his "personal feelings."
</P>
<P>
His justification is so weird.
</P>
<P>
How could Hashimoto, as a Japanese, not know that in addition
to his cousin, the Yasukuni Shrine houses the memorial tablets of
14 class-A war criminals, including Hideki Tojo, who owed Asian
people heavy debts of blood? On display in the shrine are the
"glorious war feats" of the so-called "martyrs" who died for the
war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Every year on August 15, the anniversary of Japan's surrender
in World War II, a farce is staged at the Yasukuni Shrine to deny
Japan's history of aggression and to complain the "injustice" done
to the war criminals. An official visit to the shrine in 1985 by
the then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone triggered a wave of
indignant condemnations from other Asian nations. The Yasukuni
Shrine has become an extremely sensitive political issue in the
relations between Japan and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
How could Hashimoto, as a long-time politician, not know that
the Japanese war of aggression had brought enormous losses and
sufferings to the people of other Asian nations? Most Japanese
politicians do not deny that.
</P>
<P>
How could Hashimoto, as Japan's prime minister, not know which
is more important -- relations with other nations or his "personal
feelings?" Japanese leaders often claim that the guideline of
their country's foreign policy is to have "heart-to-heart
exchanges" with other Asian countries. But what matters most in
Japan's relations with other Asian countries is not Hashimoto's
"personal feelings" but Japan's political attitude -- a sincere
sorrow over Japanese militarists' killing of numerous innocent
people of those countries and a deep self-examination of its war
of aggression. If Hashimoto chooses to ignore this, then what is
the use talking about "heart-to-heart exchanges?"
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reportedly argued that visiting the shrine on his
birthday instead of August 15 could help avoid "overseas
criticisms." But this is just like plugging one's ears while
stealing a bell. A prime minister paying homage to the shrine two
weeks ahead would have far worse implications, for his action
undoubtedly represents a green light to some people who would
advocate militarism on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto even said after his visit to the shrine, "I think it
is time to stop letting that sort of thing complicate our
international relations." But it is impossible for the people of
other Asian countries to forget the atrocities committed by Japan
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
So paying homage to the shrine of war criminals, no matter when
it is done or who does it, would always be an insult to the
feelings of the people of other Asian countries and therefore
should be opposed and condemned.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Hashimoto signed the visitor's book in the
capacity of "prime minister" also proves that he knew very well
the implications of his visit. So, the visit was indeed an act
under deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit to the shrine and his sophistry can only make
people believe that today's Japan, capitalizing on its status as
an economic power, is increasingly ignoring its own history of
aggression and the feelings of the people of other countries. It
says something nice to others' face, but attempts something else
in its heart. Sending troops abroad, opposing nuclear tests and
expanding military cooperation with the United States are all
moves of this nature. If Japan carries on like this, its road
ahead will become narrower and narrower. "An economic giant yet a
political dwarf" will always be what Japan looks like to the rest
of the world.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Transmission of BSE Does Occur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The British Agriculture Ministry
announced today that mad cow disease can be passed from mother to
calf, but it denied that people were in any greater danger of
catching it.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry said today in a statement that there
may be a very low level of maternal transmission of BSE in cattle,
but there is no evidence that milk is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
It said all the measures necessary to protect public health are
already in place and no new measures are needed in the light of
the new information.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a research program which began in 1989
indicate that maternal transmission could occur at the rate of 1
percent. That is to say 1 percent of calves born to cows which die
of BSE will themselves die of BSE caught from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
"This information is the first concrete evidence that maternal
transmission occurs, albeit infrequently," Kevin Taylor, the
assistant chief veterinary officer, told a new conference today.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the research, which has been conducted by
Britain's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, made up of
scientists, veterinarians and other experts, will not be available
until the project ends in November.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that they still do not know how the disease
is transmitted, but said it is almost certainly not through milk
since the calves in the study were not allowed to drink their
mothers' milk.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said, "It could be all sorts of things. It could be
infection through the embryo. It could be the placenta. It could
be at the time of calving, calving is a messy business."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Britain's Chief Veterinary Officer Keith
Meldrum would pass the information to colleagues in Brussels later
today.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Larsen Ends Asians' Domination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Dark horse Pour-Erik Hoyer-Larsen
of Denmark broke Asians' domination of all the five titles when he
toppled world number one Dong Jiong of China 15-12, 15-10 to win
the men's singles gold medal at the Olympic badminton tournament
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Larsen, winner of the All-England Open, was in
her best form when he hauled his way back from 7-12 down in the
first game with his delicate net play and sharp smashe, beating
the Chinese in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The win gave the Dane a 3-1 lead in their encounters.
</P>
<P>
Potential Dong beat Larsen in straight sets in the finals of
the China Open last November. However, the Dane won their last
encounter in the Thomas Cup final in May in Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
"I think Dong is a little bit nervous today and I'm relaxed,"
Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us played well today, but Larsen controlled the net
and using back-court smashes to win the game," the Chinese
shuttler said.
</P>
<P>
Experienced Bang Soo Hyun, 23, handed a badminton lesson to the
promising 16-year-old Indonesian Mia Ausina by winning the women's
singles title.
</P>
<P>
Mia found the match tougher than she had expected. She led the
first set, but Bang rallied to come back and allowed Mia to score
no points in the following play.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, the Indonesian again took the lead 7-5 with
her superb wristy flicked overhead drops and controlled slices.
However, Bang stromed back again with her all-around technics and
cross-court smashes, ending the match 11-6, 11-7 in 38 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Mycenaean Tomb Unearthed in Northern Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists in northern Greece
have unearthed an intact Mycenaean tomb in the so-called
archaeological "Gold-Mine" of Makriyialos community in Pieria,
northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's Archaeological Department today, the
tomb is dated to the Iron Age (1100-700 bc) and contains the
skeletons of three people belonging to the same family.
</P>
<P>
Clay vessels and jewelry made of gold, copper and iron were
found beside the skeletons.
</P>
<P>
A staircase leading to an underground chamber is,
archaeologists believe, a clear indication that Mycenaean
settlements had survived the demise of civilization in southern
Greece at approximately 1100 bc. The tomb also reveals that the
settlement had close ties with southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
"The tomb's style proves that it was created during the
Mycenaean age," Manthos Besios, director of archaeological
excavations in the area, said.
</P>
<P>
Besios added that the settlement was important during the early
years of the Macedonian Kingdom. The tomb is located north of the
cemetery of the significant ancient Macedonian city of Pidnas,
where archaeologists have excavated over 1,500 tombs.
</P>
<P>
"The finds in Pidnas in recent years confirm the view that the
region holds a position of utmost importance for the study of the
early phases of Macedonian history," Besios said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Plans Big Push in Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the world's
software giant, is preparing an aggressive new push in application
programs this fall, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project includes an overhaul of its popular Office package
that will offer animated on-screen assistants to give personalized
tips to puzzled users, it said.
</P>
<P>
Office 97, a suite of eight products that includes the
company's popular spreadsheet and word-processing programs, is
being revamped to add multiple Internet features as well as a
program called Outlook that combines scheduling, electronic-mail
and address-book functions.
</P>
<P>
The new suite is expected to ship in November, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Office effort, more than two years in the making, is likely
to have a big impact on the company's revenue in the next 12
months, according to the report. An official from Microsoft said
that the company has invested twice as much on the new suite as on
its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
In combination with a forthcoming version of Microsoft's
browser software for the World Wide Web, users can use tools from
the company's word processor to create and find Web pages without
leaving the browser to launch those programs.
</P>
<P>
But the paper said the applications business faces a series of
new challenges, the biggest of which is that many companies
already own Office and aren't eager to spend more on new versions.

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Sergei Bubka
of Ukraine withdrew from the pole vault Wednesday because of an
injured right Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, who has set the world record 35 times, 18 indoors and 17

</P>
<P>
Four years ago in Barcelona, Bubka failed to clear the opening
height at the Olympics. He won the gold medal in Seoul in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Bubka said the injury had bothered him for months and he had
undergone numerous injections.
</P>

<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and world top
table tennis player Deng Yaping of China edged out 1988 Olympic
champion Chen Jing in a gruelling five-set women's singles final
to win her fourth Olympic title here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deng repeated her singles-doubles glory in the Barcelona Games
after beating Chen, a former Chinese national team member who now
represents Chinese Taipei, 21-14, 21-17, 20-22, 17-21, 21-5.
</P>
<P>
"That's normal that Deng and Chen, both trained by the Chinese
national team, finished one-two," said Chinese vice sports
minister Xu Yinsheng, also the President of the International
Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Both had played to their best," Xu said. "In the deciding
game, Deng overwhelmed Chen by more aggressive play."
</P>
<P>
Deng's killing forehands worked today as she won half of her
points by forehand. Chen won 35 percent of her points by forehand.
</P>
<P>
In the first two sets, Deng used her long-pimpled backhand,
which can produce funny spin with different flick of wrist, to
push Chen into defence and then got the kills.
</P>
<P>
Chen got used to Deng's play and made her rival off balance
with well-placed shots.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Chen saved a match point to take the third set
and jumped into a 20-14 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
After Deng made an serve error, the two entered a tie-breaking
fifth set.
</P>
<P>
The highly motivated Deng didn't give any chance to Chen in the
final set. She pumped her fist into the air after winning a
point.

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Talented Fu Mingxia became the
first Chinese diver to bag home two gold medals when she outwitted
her rivals in the women's three-meter springboard event Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
This was a feat that had never been achieved by the Chinese
divers since 1960.
</P>
<P>
Early, Fu Mingxiao retained her Olympic crown by winning the
women's 10-meter platform gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Russian Irina Lashko was in the distant second place with
Canadian Annie Pelletier getting the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals this afternoon, Fu Mingxia ranked a lowly
third place, behind Russian Vera Ilyina and Lashko.
</P>
<P>
However, the finals turned over the previous scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
After first two dives, Ilyina slipped down far away with her
rigid routines while the Chinese fully displayed her talents with
difficult but perfect dives.
</P>
<P>
Under strong challenge from the Chinese diver, Lashko lost her
stamina in the semifinals and had to settle for the silver medal
by lagging behind 35.49 points.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Cases Mount in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of malaria cases
has increased, and in some places dramatically, in Cambodia this
year compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephan Hoyer, the World Health Organization (WHO) medical
official for malaria control in Cambodia, attributes the increase
to an early rainy season.
</P>
<P>
While investigative reports were not yet complete on all
provinces, there had been a ten-fold increase in the
mosquito-borne disease in some districts, Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
Although the number was higher this year, diagnosis and
treatment had improved so mortality rates were decreasing, said
health officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were more than 100,000 cases reported, with 600
deaths. But, the real number of cases was likely much higher,

<P>
PYONGYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) severely criticized Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for his recent visit to Tokyo's
Yasukuni Shrine, saying that Hashimoto's move reveals Japanese
militarists' renewed ambition of war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary Thursday, the official newspaper Rodong
Sinmun pointed out that Hashimoto's move has shown that Japan's
militarism has not changed a bit in the years despite its shameful
failure in World War Two half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Asian nations and their peoples should be on
guard against Japan's tendency of reviving the defeated spirit of
militarism, the paper warned.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto broke a decade-long taboo on prime
ministerial visits to the shrine, which honors Japan's dead in its
war of aggression, and has provoked strong reaction both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official visits to the shrine have long been a sensitive
political issue in Japan's internal politics and for the victims
of its war.

BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
said today it has approved the funding of a supplementary plan for
the rehabilitation of Cambodia worth 9.5 million ECUs (some 12.3

the local administration, and to provide on-the-spot monitoring
and follow-up for European Union programs.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when the Paris peace accords were signed, the EU

assistance for refugees and returnees and by implementing
development programs worth 161.4 million ECUs (some 210 million US
dollars) up to the end of 1995.

During the talks, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov is

Russia and Ukraine should have signed an agreement of

dispute over the fleet were settled.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko voiced the hope that his visit will "give a fresh
impetus to the bilateral dialogue on various issues," which has
been put on hold due to the presidential elections in Russia and
the adoption of a new constitution in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the Ukrainian guest will meet Alexander Lebed,

</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, Greece outmucsled and outshot China
115-75 to claim the berth to play Brazil for the 5th spot Friday.
</P>
<P>
NBA champion Chicago Bulls guard Toni Kukoc had the ball
stripped when he was trying a three-pointer attempt for Croatia,
who were down by three points with 13 seconds left on the clock.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Croatia was eliminated from the top four Tuesday after going

</P>
<P>
The Brazilians extended the 12-point halftime lead to as many

12-0 run rally by Croatia over the next 2:45 narrowed the gap to
three and the lead figures never came back to double figures.
</P>
<P>
The Croatians reduced the gap to just two points at 76-74 with
23 seconds left but were unable to get over the hump with their
low shooting percentage of 0-3 from the the arc.

<HEADLINE> US Develops Bomb-Proofing of Cargo Holds for Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. companies have
developed airliner baggage containers strong enough to limit the
explosive force of a bomb, according to a report by the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Bomb-proofing cargo holds became a popular idea after Pan Am
103 was blown up in 1988 and research was carried out, the paper
said. But little came of it because aviation safety officials
didn't push the issue.
</P>
<P>
Now, it's being revived as investigators focus on an explosion
as the likely cause of TWA Flight 800's crash two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Omega Engineering, one of the designers, said it is able to
deliver the product in weeks if Washington turned on the green
light for it.
</P>
<P>
The other company named Jaycor said it has already built six of
such containers.
</P>
<P>
Both companies claimed that their boxes have passed real-world
tests and Jaycor has produced a videotape showing its device
withstanding an explosion.
</P>
<P>
But experts said bomb-proof containers alone would not make all
planes secure. Even the strongest containers would be useless in
limiting damage from bombs in carry-on bags or elsewhere on the
main deck.
</P>
<P>
The new containers also wouldn't protect narrow-body planes
such as 737s and DC-9s because they don't use baggage containers.
</P>
<P>
Advocates for better containers say they could well prevent
another Flight 103 and could possibly even saved TWA Flight 800 --
if that proves to have been brought down by a cargo-hold bomb.
</P>
<P>
The two "bomb-proof" container designers that are ready for
manufacturing use opposite methods to limit the force of an
explosion on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
Jaycor's version contains the force in its super-hard walls.
Omega Engineering's container mitigates a blast by puncturing a
hole in the plane's fuselage large enough to provide a vent for
the explosive force but small enough so that the plane still
flies. Both the containers are within the range of weight of
current standards, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> France Worried About "Oil for Food" Program Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
worried about the delay of the application of an "oil for food"
agreement signed between Iraq and the United Nations in May as the
United States opposes the holding of a session of the Commission
of Sanctions Against Iraq in New York.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman told Agence France Presse
that France is "worried about the delays which now appear, while
this agreement is aimed at responding to the humanitarian needs of
the population of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
France supports the application of the "oil for food"
agreement, which has already been discussed many times and for a
long time, said the spokesman whose name was not given in the AFP
report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation in the U.N. headquarters in New York told
the Commission of Sanctions Against Iraq Wednesday that it has not
received "necessary instructions" on the adoption of the
agreement, the president of the commission, German Ambassador to
the U.N. Antonius Eitel, told the press in New York on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
The "oil for food" agreement, signed on May 20 between Iraq
and the U.N. Commission of Sanctions, will allow Iraq to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of crude oil in each quarter of a year
to buy food, medicines and other civil supplies.
</P>
<P>
The application of such an agreement, signed between Baghdad
and the commission, has to be unanimously approved by the 15
members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
All the other 14 members of the Security Council have indicated
their support for the agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Fire heavily damaged a black
church in a Rural area in south Carolina today and investigators
were trying to determine the cause.
</P>
<P>
The fire at the Springhill AME Church in Dillon started shortly
after 1 a.m., State Law Enforcement Division Chief Robert Stewart
said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be treated as an arson unless and until it can be
proven differently," The Associated Press quoted Stewart as
saying. "We are not ready to make a conclusion at this point."
</P>
<P>
Helping in the investigation were the FBI, the federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the State Law Enforcement
Division, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
Dillon is located in a rural area 110 miles northeast of
Columbia near the North Carolina line.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 70 suspicious fires at church
properties belonging to predominantly black congregations in
Southern states since 1995. An equal number of fires have been
reported at white churches in the region.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence of racism in at least 18 of the fires. Racial
motivation has been ruled out in more than two dozen other cases,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Purchase 12 Combat Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has signed an
agreement with the Franco-German Eurocopter company to purchase 12
"Cougar Mark II SAR" combat helicopters, the French Defense
Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The 3-billion-franc (600 million U.S. dollar) contract includes
delivery, training, logistic and technical support, said the
Defense Ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Ministry sources said this is the first
important success scored by France in selling its weapons to the
Saudi air force, which resulted from "hard competition putting
into the game several planes of different countries."
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed several days ago by the representatives
of French Defense Minister Charles Millon and those of Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan ben Abdel Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The purchase could significantly improve the financial
situation of Eurocopter, which has been suffering from the drop of
sales in the world aeronautical market, and will save 3,500 French
jobs, said the ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The SAR (Search and Rescue) helicopters are specialized in
searching and rescue missions in the high seas and behind enemy
lines.

<HEADLINE> Economic Sanctions Imposed on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- African leaders of the
Great Lakes region bas agreed to impose economic sanctions on
Burundi in response to last week's Tutsi military coup.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity Salim
Ahmed Salim announced the decision last night after the day-long
regional summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will be very effective in the sense that they
signify a concrete manner to resolve the conflict in Burundi,
according to the OAU chief.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope the regime will come to their senses and
implement the provisions taken by the regional summit. It is also
our expectation that this will be achieved at a minimal cost for
the people of Burundi," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions took immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Salim urged the Burundi regime to start immediate
and unconditional negotiations with all the political parties and
armed factions in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to cooperate
in the sanctions, saying if implemented immediately they will be
less costly and avoiding military intervention.
</P>
<P>
If the Burundi regime is stubborn, then other options will
have to be considered to restore peace and stability in the
country, the OAU chief warned.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Set Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will soon set a minimum wage
standard in a bid to improve the living standard of the people and
reduce unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor Abdul Hafez Shakhanbeh has said that the
minimum wage will not be below the poverty line, which was 132
Jordan dinars (about 184.8 dollars) in 1994 and could be around
150 dinars (about 210 dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the fixing of a minimum wage is
expected to help reduce the current 15 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the minimum pay should be indexed according to
the inflation rate and the increase in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
The existing low wages is widely blamed for driving Jordanian
workers away and encouraged employers to employ non-Jordanian
workers who accept less wages for more work time.
</P>
<P>
Sources here say in some of the Jordanian private businesses,
foreign workers consitute 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Al Hattab, a writer for Arabic-language daily Al Rai,
said that the unemployment in Jordan is bound to continue to rise
and the problem of poverty is bound to aggravate if the government
does not work out regulations concerning wages.
</P>
<P>
The minister rejected criticism of some economists who warned
that if a minimum wage is fixed, it will discourage investment
and trigger higher unemployment when employers respond by laying
off their workers.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that by specifying a minimum pay, the country
would be assisting Jordanians to replace more than 300,000
foreign workers in the kingdom and would also be altering the
negative perception towards some jobs.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the unemployment problem was embedded in low
wages and once this aspect is rectified, many young Jordanians
will accept the available job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that the government will not be able to
hire new employees except to fill vacancies in a year from
now on.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there was a total of 135,000 people working
for the government, that account for 36 percent of the total
Jordanian workforce.
</P>
<P>
He described the figure as a very large number if measured
against the total number of the country's population.

<HEADLINE> Peaceful Dialogue Reaffirmed As Only Way to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' National Council, the
island's top advisory body on the Cyprus problem, reaffirmed
today that a solution to the Cyprus issue will only be reached
through a peaceful dialogue under the auspices of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The National Council made the announcement in a written
statement following a meeting chaired by President Glafcos
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the majority of the National
Council members have agreed to the commencement of a dialogue
between the commanders of the National Guard and the Turkish
forces in Cyprus in order to reduce tension along the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue was proposed by Madeleine Albright, a
U.S. permanent representative to the U.N., during her brief visit
to the island last month.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. sources here, some U.N. officials are still
working hard to arrange a meeting between the commanders of the
two armies, but so far no invitation has been sent out by the
U.N. to either party.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
the country and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is still trying hard to bring the two sides on the
island closer to a settlement of the protracted Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> Syria Rules Out Lebanese-Syrian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese presidential sources today
excluded a reported summit meeting between Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad next week,
according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted the sources as saying that reports on arrangements
for the summit are not correct.
</P>
<P>
But they underlined the continuation of contacts between Beirut
and Damascus on peace process developments.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that preparations are underway for convening a
Syrian-Lebanese summit in Damascus to discuss a reported Israeli
suggestion known as "Lebanon First."
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli proposals, Israel will withdraw its troops
from a enclave in south Lebanon in exchange for Syria's help in
disarming the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas and the deployment
of Lebanese army troops along the border to prevent cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
But Hrawi today rejected the Israeli proposals in a speech
marking the 51th anniversary of the founding of its army.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel is convinced that its occupation in southern Lebanon
does not guarantee its security and is determined on the
withdrawal, it has no other choice but to implement Resolution
425."
</P>
<P>
Indicating that Lebanon would not sign peace accords with
Israel ahead of Syria, Hrawi said that "Lebanon is for just and
comprehensive peace and is with our Arab brothers, and it will be
the last to sign peace agreements with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's peace talks with Israel have been stalled for about
two years because of a lack progress in Israel's peace talks with
Syria, a major power in Lebanon where it keeps 40,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Travelers Advised Not to Worry about </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Ministry of Health today
reassured foreign travelers that there is no reason to worry about
the recent outbreak of meningitis on the island.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been 156 reported cases of meningitis, a
disease that causes the outer part of the brain to swell, since
its outbreak earlier last month, with majority of them in
Limassol, a southern coastal city in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
An information bulletin published by the Ministry of Health
said that travelers to Cyprus are not under any risks, provided
they observe all rules of hygiene.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin, there is no risk of catching the
disease either from the sea or from swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
It said that the main symptoms of the disease appear to be
fever, vomiting, headache and stiff neck, and a full recovery
usually takes 10 days following the appearance of the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Viral meningitis cannot be contracted through swimming pools,
hotels or apartment blocks, or any other outside sources, the
ministry's bulletin added.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has taken all measures to prevent the
disease from spreading, the bulletin said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Coalition Calls for Florida Travel Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian group called Wednesday
for a boycott of Florida tourism this winter in retaliation for a
U.S. law that punishes foreign investors in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The coalition of more than 20 organizations of Protestants,
activists and students said it is targeting the Title III section
of the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
Title III section allows U.S. citizens and companies to sue
foreign firms using property confiscated after the 1959 Cuban
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Seismology, Computer Scientists Cooperation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Seismologists and computer
scientists and engineers should strengthen their cooperation in
seismology, a new report from the U.S. National Research Council
called recently.
</P>
<P>
Advanced computers are important to the field of seismology
because of their growing use in data acquisition, communication,
modeling and analysis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of using large, expensive supercomputers, many
seismologists today use smaller and cheaper computers in complex
simulations of earthquake effects for hazard mitigation, automated
processing of seismic records for detecting clandestine nuclear
explosions and visualization of three-dimensional seismic images
for oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
The report said such high-performance computing applications in
seismology have widespread scientific, social and economic value,
but collaboration between seismologists and computer scientists
should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Seismology has entered a new era characterized by significant
increases in recorded seismic data and "real time"recording from
global seismic networks. Full use of these data will require an
upgrade of the data communication and storage infrastructure,
the report concluded.
</P>
<P>
The National Research Council is the principal operating arm of
U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. National Academy of
Engineering. It provides independent advice on science and
technology issues.

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Rate Up Slightly in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- the U.S. unemployment rate
increased slightly to 5.4 percent in July as job creation
slackened, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the unemployment rate in the U.S.
edged up from 5.3 percent in June which was the lowest level since
5.2 percent in June 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of new jobs totaled 193,000 in
July, down from 220,000 in June. Job creation averaged 273,000 a
month during the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The report also eased concerns that wage pressures were about
to boost prices. The average hourly wage fell by two cents to 11.80
dollars after it went up by eight cents in June.
</P>
<P>
It said that most of the new jobs in July were in retail trade,
nearly half in restaurants and bars. Construction employment
increased by 25,000, bringing to 208,000 the number of new jobs
since the first month of the year.
</P>
<P>
And manufacturing payrolls fell by 20,000 after losing 9,000 in
June. Manufacturing has lost 282,000 jobs since its most recent
peak in March 1995, with the net loss concentrated almost entirely
among nondurable goods industries.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe the latest employment data could have a
strong influence on the U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers when
they weigh a raise in short-term interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported Thursday that the economy grew at
a robust 4.2 percent annual rate during that quarter, but many
economist believe the latest employment report is a fresh sign
that the U.S. economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Without commenting directly on the fresh figures, U.S.
President Bill Clinton said today that "there is now no
substantial evidence of inflationary pressure in this economy."

<HEADLINE> Explosion in French Post Sorting Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A post package sorting center in
Creteil, southwest of Paris, exploded Thursday evening. Police
said it was probably caused by a bomb, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police have found fragments of a gas bottle among the debris on
the site of the explosion, which led to speculation that
explosives were placed in a demijohn sent as a package.
</P>
<P>
Police also said that it was possible that the sorting center
was targeted by an attacker who used a remote control engine to
blow it up.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or injured in the explosion. Only one
employee lightly suffered from a shock.
</P>
<P>
A postman working in the center at the time said he smelled of
powder just before the explosion, and some employees at a post
office nearby said they sighted a big flame rising from a heap of
packages in the sorting center.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Group Seeks Truth of Germ Warfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Japanese scholars
have arrived in East China to seek the truth about their country's
germ warfare against China in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The dozen scholars are in Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang
Province to look into war crimes committed by Japanese invaders
during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The province was one of the areas that were seriously affected
by germ warfare launched by the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
Their visit is part of a new peace movement, set up to look
into the truth of germ warfare by the Japanese army during its
invasion in China between 1930s and 1940s. The unofficial movement
involves both Chinese and Japanese people from various circles.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from Shizuoka and other places of Japan told Xinhua
today that during the World War II, Japanese invaders not only set
up the notorious "731th Detachment", specializing in germ warfare
in Harbin of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, but also
established germ warfare troops in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Japanese scholars agreed that true and lasting peace is
possible between China and Japan only after the germ warfare
crimes committed by the Japanese troops are truthfully and deeply
studied.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the visit made by Japanese Prime Minister Ryuntaro
Hashimoto to the Yasukuni Jinja Shrine, the scholars suggested
that the visit clearly indicated that the Japanese government had
no remorse for the country's war crimes in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Yasukuni Jinja Shrine is a Tokyo-based shinto religious place,
where memorial services are held for Japan's war dead, including
seven class-A war criminals executed at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The visit constituted an "untolerable humiliation" to the
people in China and other Asian countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two people from Shizuoka will travel to Jiangsu, Jiangxi
and other parts of the the country to investigate into germ
warfare crimes committed by Japanese invaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- "Episodes", the international
Geoscience Newsmagazine published by the International Union of
Geological Sciences, has devoted its latest edition entirely to
China.
</P>
<P>
The focus on China's geology is to mark the 30th International
Geological Congress, which is to begin Sunday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This special issue is being distributed to all participants in
the congress, as well as to the regular Episodes subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Carrying 21 articles written by leading Chinese geologists, the
special issue makes a comprehensive introduction of China's
achievements in geology study, and highly praises the country's
development in geosciences.
</P>
<P>
W.S.Fyfe, president of IUGS, wrote an editorial for the issue,
saying that the issue as a whole will provide a valuable
introduction and overview not only for Congress participants, but
for all who are new to the geology of China.
</P>
<P>
Fyfe said an extensive program of field trips, covering most of
China is planned, both before and after the congress, providing a
unique opportunity to learn about the vast and rapidly developing
nation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xun, a famous geologist and ex-minister of Geology and
Mineral Resources, also wrote an article for the issue, reviewing
the progress and achievements in geological work in China.
</P>
<P>
The article said that China, with 168 varieties of mineral
resources found, is one of the few countries that have an almost
complete range of mineral commodities, leading the world in proved
reserves of 25 minerals, including coal, lead and zinc.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also numbered China's great achievements in the study of
earth kinetics, hydrogeology, environmental science and geological
hazards.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China has made much progress in the study of
plate tectonics and orogeny in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Qinling,
which is expected to be a hot topic during the 30th IGC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Down in June Despite Income Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer spending fell in
June despite a surge of incomes, the first decline since last
January, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that personal incomes in the U.S. rose by 0.9
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual level of 6.46 trillion
dollars in June, the biggest rise in a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
But personal spending in the month fell by 0.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual level of 5.15 trillion dollars, the
largest decline since January when heavy snows closed many
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The disposable income -- income after taxes -- also rose by 0.9
percent in June after a 1.4 percent surge in May. The increase in
May was the biggest gain in two years.
</P>
<P>
The decline of consumer spending in June, coupled with large
income advance, pushed the U.S. savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable income -- to 5.1 percent, the highest
since last January.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending report fits with economists' belief
that debt-burdened consumers have finished a spending spree that
helped propel economic growth in the second quarter at a 4.2
percent annual rate, the strongest in two years.
</P>
<P>
They are anticipating much slower growth in the second half of
this year and financial market traders hope that the surge of
economic growth in the second quarter will lead the U.S. Federal
Reserve to raise the short-term interest rates next month.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Settlement Building Freeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today
authorized simpler procedure for granting permission for Jewish
constructions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to
ease the settlement building freeze imposed by the previous
government.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session,
following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the
previous government of handicapping the natural developments of
Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on
Palestinian buildings.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish
settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee
in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue
like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that any proposal to build new
settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be
that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no
operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the
settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, the council also expressed its disappointment that
there has been no decision on actual developments and buildings
of the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member of Meretz,
Yossi Sarid said he had information on government plans for an
unprecedented settlement campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led
government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest
enemy of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice
to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead
to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would
lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Reach Semiconductor Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States
have reached an agreement on foreign access to the Japanese
semiconductor market, Japanese International Trade Minister
Shunpei Tsukahara announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Canada's western coastal city of
Vancouver, where the outgoing talks took place since July 30, both
Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators immediately claimed victory
for their respective sides.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fantastic agreement," Tsukahara said. "The contents
are almost exactly the same as Japan's version of the plan."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement, which
expired on July 31, foreign chip producers were guaranteed at
least 20 percent of the Japanese semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
The United States wanted to renew the agreement, but Japan
adamantly refused, arguing the foreign sales share in the Japanese
market had reached 30 percent, far exceeding the expected target
and the government should minimize its involvement in any more
market monitoring efforts.
</P>
<P>
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the
deal follows the U.S. line that, while the semiconductor
industries in both countries will be responsible for collecting
and analyzing data on market share, they will report the
information to their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky has repeatedly postponed plans to return to
Washington due to slow progress in the four-day bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Block Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
said today that it would block passage of a treaty with India on
border river development in the Nepali parliament .
</P>
<P>
The coalition government is expected to table the Nepal-India
treaty on Mahakali river to the on-going parliament session for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
President of the opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) Man
Mohan Adhikari said at the lower house that the treaty could only
be presented to parliament six months from now after extensive
discussions on every aspect of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the treaty, which needs at least a
two-thirds majority in the house, would be unlikely without the
support of the UML, which holds 89 seats in the 205-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the UML formally declared its
position on the Mahakali treaty, which was signed in New Delhi
last February by Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and the
then Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides that Nepal has rights over any future water
project on the border river on an equitable basis.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Record Turnover of Retail Sales in Consumer Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai people sent shop money
tills ringing to the tune of 56.3 billion yuan in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
It was a record consumer spending spree in China's largest
city, with retail sales of consumer goods rocketing by over 22
percent compared to the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local supplies of consumer goods caught up with, and exceeded
demand during the period. Thanks to the Spring Festival, the
city's turnover of retail sales in consumer good reached its first
10.5 billion yuan, followed by another leap in sales of household
appliances in April owing to a cut in customs duty.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, the city's price index of retail
sales dropped by 8.4 percentage points from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Commercial circles generated 11.1 percent of local GDP this
year, compared with 10.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Though the city issued some financial policies earlier this
year to lift inflation proof savings deposits, and reduce deposit
interest rates, remaining savings in local banks by June this year
rose 50.5 percent over the same period in 1995 to reach more than
176 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Asks UN to Stop Iranian Attacks on North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked the United Nations
Security Council to take its responsibility to deter the Iranian
incursion into Kurds-held northern Iraq, demanding an immediate
withdrawal of Iranian forces from the area.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf made the request
in a letter delivered Thursday to U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the official Iraqi News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He described in the letter the Iranian incursion into Iraqi
territory as a "flagrant violation" of the U.N. charter and the
rules of the international law as well as the 1987 U.N. ceasefire
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister reiterated Iraq's call for Iran to stop such
military operations which "contradict with principles of good
neighborliness."
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged Iran to stick to its claims that it has
the desire to solve the outstanding problems between the two
countries and normalize bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, 3,000 Iranian armed forces
infiltrated into Iraq's northern province of Sulaimaniya and
headed for the town Kwaisinjaq on July 26. The Iranian forces have
occupied the mountain of Haibat Sultan and suburbs of Kwaisinjaq.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the civilian quarters in the area were intensively
shelled, killing and wounding a number of civilians and
inflicting heavy damage to property there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has demanded Iranian compensation for the property damage
sustained by its cross-border attack on rebel Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping Meets Hong Kong Media people (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, today met a
Hong Kong media group who are attending a seminar in Beijing. He
answered questions from the journalists.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that after 1997, Hong Kong will enjoy freedom of the
press, but the press can not advocate either the subversion of the
Central Government, "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", nor
"Hong Kong independence".
</P>
<P>
He cited the United States, where it is illegal to advocate the
overthrowing of the American government.
</P>
<P>
Freedom of the press is completely different from stirring up
trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on the method for the establishment of
the Selecting Committee of the first government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), Lu said that in accordance
with the stipulations of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, the
Selecting Committee will include members of the fourth sector in
Hong Kong such as political personages, Hong Kong deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC), and Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Selecting committee will also be composed of
members from the other three sectors of industrial, commercial and
financial; the professionals; and labor, social services,
religious and other circle.
</P>
<P>
He said that the panel for the Selecting Committee of the
Preparatory Committee suggested that the Selecting Committee
comprise 40 original Hong Kong political personages, 26 Hong Kong
deputies to the NPC, and 34 representatives of Hong Kong members
of the National Committee of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
According to this proportion, Lu said that the number of the
original Hong Kong political personages in the Selecting Committee
has in fact surpassed one-third of the total number of 100 in the
fourth sector.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment an assertion made by a Hong Kong
newspaper that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council has a list of names intended to be members of the
Selecting Committee, Lu said: "this is pure fabrication."

<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the door of the Selecting Committee is open to
those Hong Kong residents, regardless of their party affiliations,
so long as they conform to the requirements and stipulations, and
support the policy of "one country, two systems", and the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
On the question raised by a few people in Hong Kong that the
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR should be elected in an
unofficial way, Lu Ping said that this is a complete farce and not
worthy of comment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Selecting Committee is shouldering tasks of
selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR and of electing
the provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed the belief that the 400 members of the Selecting
Committee will take a cautious and responsible attitude towards
the voting, by proceeding from the overall and long-term interests
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said he has the full confidence in Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent resignation of Leung Ming-Yin, director
of the Hong Kong Immigration Department, Lu said that he believed
that this was an isolated case and had nothing to do with the Hong
Kong public servants' confidence in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Surely it will not set off a chain reaction among the civil
servants in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the leading body of the Hong Kong SAR
designated, Lu said that after the Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong SAR is selected, it is certain a leading body of the Hong
Kong SAR designated will assist in his work.
</P>
<P>
Such specific issues as the numbers and scale of the leading
body will be decided by the Chief Executive designate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed the hope that before June 30, 1997, the Hong Kong
Government will maintain its effective operation, adding that it
should not overstress civil servants' dual recognition.
Otherwise, he said, this will put the civil servants in a
difficult position, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the year of 1997 approaches, there are many issues related
to the transfer of political power. Not overstressing the dual
recognition will benefit the smooth transition of the power in
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar held in Beijing from July 29 to August 4 is
sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for the
purpose of increasing mutual understanding between media people in
China's inland areas and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Thank Central Government for Primary School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A teenage Tibetan boy has given a
special thank-you to 'Grandpa Jiang' for helping to open up his
horizons.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Puncog concentrated his eyes on his teacher and the
blackboard, fearing that he might miss one word being taught in
his classroom.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old is a fourth-grade pupil in a primary school in
the suburb of Xigaze, the second largest city of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, next to the region's capital city of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
"I was given the opportunity to study by Grandpa Jiang (Chinese
President Jiang Zemin) in Beijing," he said, "therefore, I have to
work hard to be enrolled at a middle school and a university and
live up to the expectations of Grandpa Jiang."
</P>
<P>
Following President Jiang Zemin's example, officials and other
working staff with central government departments donated some
250,000 yuan in 1994 to help poor Tibetan child school drop-outs.
</P>
<P>
With the money, the Tibet regional government made a decision
to construct a primary school in the suburb of Xigaze City, where
local children received a poor education.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi Puncog was born into a farmer's family and began his
schooling at seven. But after five years of on-and-off studies at
a village primary school he completed only three grades.
</P>
<P>
In September last year the primary school, backed by the
central government, was completed. The local people gratefully
call it "central school".
</P>
<P>
There are six classrooms and 54 rooms serving as dormitories
for teachers and students. The hand-picked 12 teachers give the
pupils lessons on Tibetan and Chinese languages, maths, art and
basic science.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately Zhaxi became one of the first group of 82 poor
children to be admitted to the school, and has been chosen as
class monitor for his hard work and outstanding studies.
</P>
<P>
Zhaxi said his biggest wish is to see 'Grandpa Jiang' one day
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Every Monday morning, a national flag-raising ceremony is held
on a high platform just inside the school gate, attended by all
teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
With no electricity, teachers have to lead students in
singing the national anthem in the flag-raising ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The children cannot speak fluent Chinese, but every one is
engrossed in the singing," said Baiba, a young vice principal of
the school.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand began today celebrations
of the 20th anniversary of Thai-Vietnamese diplomatic ties with a
day-long seminar focusing on future relations.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Thai Foreign Ministry and Thammasat
University, the seminar featured an exchange of views on
political, security, trade and investment issues between
diplomats, businessmen and experts from both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established formal diplomatic ties on August
6, 1976.
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday, Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay Virawan and
Vietnamese Information and Culture Minister Tran Hoan will sign a
cultural cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Thailand started investment in Vietnam in 1988 and has become
the 12th largest foreign investor, with 60 projects worth 540
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade in 1991 was worth 3.54 million baht (141,000
US dollars) and rose to 12.72 million baht (509,000 dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent thorny issue between the two countries is an
overlapping zone of 6,500 square kilometers in the Gulf of
Thailand. There has also been long-standing differences over
fishery.

<HEADLINE> Experts Urge Halt to Drug Trafficking in Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on drug
fighting, which ended here today, urged cooperation in curbing
narcotic trafficking in the central-Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Some drug-trafficking groups are turning Kazakhstan into a
distribution center and a transit point, representatives from the
five central-Asian countries -- Kazakhstan, Tadzhikstan,
Kirghizstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan -- pointed out at the
two-week seminar.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers usually smuggle narcotics from Afghanistan and
Pakistan to Kazakhstan via Tadzhikstan and then to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tadzhikstan has no effective means of fighting the crime due to
its unstable domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
The seminar disclosed that nearly 10,000 drug smuggling cases
were uncovered in the central-Asian region in the first half of
the year, with a total of 4.5 tons of drugs seized.

TIANJIN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A new transport route opened
today with the first cargo of containers loaded onto a nonstop
train in North China's Tianjin Municipality to head for the
Republic of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Extending through northern and northwestern parts of China, the
3,969 kilometer-route is the shortest link from any China port
city to Alataw Pass in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin started its trial transit transportation service to
neighbouring Mongolia in 1989, and is already a major transfer
port for export goods from Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The transport volume has increased steadily ever since. With
the continental bridges from Tianjin handling about 4,500
containers annually, Tianjin ranks as the top transfer port in
that field.
</P>
<P>
As an important port city in North China, Tianjin has opened 30
regular shipping lines to more than 300 foreign harbors, handling
over one million containers annually.

BONN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The German government will request
the extradition from Italy of former Nazi officer Erich Priebke
who was freed on Thursday by an Italian court, Justice Ministry
spokesman Bernhard Boehm said today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the public prosecutor in Germany has a warrant

</P>
<P>
Priebke, now 83, took part in the massacre of 355 hostages on

free man despite being found guilty of the massacre of 355
hostages.

The verdict sparked an explosion of anger and protests in and

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Competition Becoming Tougher In China's Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company of
China, the country's biggest insurer, has completed a major
shake-up, with the last of its three subsidiaries inaugurated at a
ceremony in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The newly launched PICC Reinsurance is also China's first
reinsurance company, considered a good start for China's insurance
industry in its move towards commercialization.
</P>
<P>
Wang You, deputy secretary of the Insurance Institute of China,
said that the insurers will see tough competition in the Chinese
market, with more insurance companies elbowing in for a slice of
the action.
</P>
<P>
China now has three nationwide insurance companies, People's
Insurance Company of China, Pacific Ocean and the Ping'an
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of the insurers will double in the coming
five years, since the country's central bank has promised to open
the domestic insurance industry to investors home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up of state-owned PICC also signaled an end to its
dominant role in China's insurance market. Because it was
state-owned it had governmental support when expanding its
business.
</P>
<P>
PICC now has three subsidiaries, specializing separately in
life and property insurance, and reinsurance.The three companies
will take the form of liability-limited companies.
</P>
<P>
This is considered as a curtain-raiser for PICC to face up to
tougher market competition, in a struggle to win back lost market
shares.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, about 75 foreign insurers have opened 115 offices in
major Chinese cities, besides the three Chinese giants and the
three joint venture insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The number of the insurers in China market will continue to
rise. Also, some of the overseas insurers will soon be permitted
to opened for business in China.
</P>
<P>
PICC subsidiaries now have to compete with other home and
overseas firms in the market on the equal-footing, after its
reshape as a share-holding company.
</P>
<P>
China is a big cake both at home and overseas for insurers, who
have already started the fight for bigger market shares in the
major Chinese economic cities and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Their competition will soon become nationwide, one local
observer said.
</P>
<P>
The American International Assurance Company, who started its
business early in China among the foreign insurers, has gained 50
percent of the local life insurance market in Shanghai, the
country's trading and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
While in Beijing, the ambitious Ping'an employees are trying to
sell their policies in the buildings near to the PICC's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Li Dan, director of Ping'an Beijing Office, said that Ping'an
holds about 8 percent of China' insurance market shares, and is
expanding its businesses.
</P>
<P>
This competition has led to a decline for PICC in the domestic
market, a top official of the PICC said. And the PICC position in
the market will continue to drop as the market competition becomes
tougher.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's insurance industry still remains
under-developed.
</P>
<P>
So far only one fifth of the Chinese population have bought
life insurance policies, with less than three percent of the
working population having pension insurance. And no more than one
fifth of the commercial and industrial enterprises have turned to
property insurance.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that total turnout of China's
insurance industry will top 200 billion yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pacific Ocean Insurance Company says that the
figure will, at least, rise to 300 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In order to win more market shares, most of the domestic
insurers in the large and medium-sized cities have started
door-to-door services to sell their policies, as the AIA is doing
in China.
</P>
<P>
The competition will soon expand into the inland cities, and
rural areas.

KUNMING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Ten-year old Li Ang practises on
his accordion for two hours each day after finishing school and
homework.
</P>
<P>
It means that he virtually has no time to play, except on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Li Ang, a third year primary school pupil in Kunming, capital
city of south China's Yunnan province, has followed this routine
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
His father is a technician in a local hospital, and he believes
that mastering more skills means more opportunities for his son,
particularly when it comes to competition.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese parents than ever, both in urban and rural areas,
are inviting tutors for their children to learn computer
knowledge, art, dancing, calligraphy and music.
</P>
<P>
Many parents even start such out-of-school training when their
children are only two or three years old.
</P>
<P>
Some educationists take exception to such actions, suggesting
it places more burdens on children. The experts say that it is
better to give children more time to play, since this is good for
their physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
More experts point out that children should learn knowledge on
various branches, instead of concentrating on certain fields. What
is more important is to let them cultivate good habits, be honest,
kindhearted and brave, experts say.
</P>
<P>
However, many parents believe that their children need to learn
more knowledge outside the school curriculum. This is partly
intended cultivate their children's willpower and perseverance, as
well as competitive spirits, the parents say.

<HEADLINE> Infant and Children Mortality Drops in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The infant mortality rate in
China has dropped to 36 per 1,000, 27.5 percent lower than the
figure in 1989, according to a report released today by the
Ministry of Public Health (MPH).
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry's monitoring network of infant and
children mortality in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and cities
show that in 1995, the mortality rate of children under the age of
five dropped to 45 per 1,000, 27 percent lower than the 1989
figure.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic decrease in mortality among infants and children
indicates that the living conditions of Chinese children have been
upgraded in keeping with improvement in the nation's quality of
life, said Wang Fanglan, director of the MPH's Women and Children
Health Care Department.
</P>
<P>
She said that major causes of death for children under five
include pneumonia, asphyxia, premature birth and diarrhea, which
are all on the decline.
</P>
<P>
Children's mortality from diarrhea has dropped by 57.3 percent
and the rate from pneumonia by 31.2 percent, due to the
implementation of the World Health Organization's healthcare
techniques for children. These include control of pneumonia and
the use of oral dehydration salts for diarrhea patients.

SEOUL, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia will repay part of South
Korea's loans with enriched uranium and helicopters instead of
steel as earlier agreed on, the Finance and Economy Ministry

</P>
<P>
The replacement of loan payment items was agreed upon after a

<HEADLINE> Mortality Rates of Pregnant Women, Children Drop in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Mortality rates for expectant
mothers and children under five have dropped by about 30 percent
in China in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from a national maternal mortality monitoring
network show that the rate dropped to 62 per 100,000 people last
year, from 1989's 95 per 100,000 people, according to Wang
Fenglan, director of the Women and Children Health Care Department
under the Ministry of Public Health, who spoke at a news
conference today.
</P>
<P>
Another network to monitor mortality of children under five
also found the rate declined by 27 percent in the 1991-95 period,
a drop from 61 per thousand to about 45 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that according to the Chinese government's outlines
for healthy development of women and children, the country will
decrease its maternal mortality rate by 50 percent, and the death
rate of children under five by more than 30 percent by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the achievements to the joint efforts of
government departments at all levels, medics and people who work
in the fields of women's and children's health.
</P>
<P>
In China, obstetric hemorrhaging has been the leading cause of
death among pregnant women and women who are in labor for an
excessive period.
</P>
<P>
But because hospitals have taken additional preventive
measures, deaths due to obstetric hemorrhage have dropped from 36
per 100,000 people in 1989, to about 25 per 100,000 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wang also cited the cause of death of infants and children
under five to show that the widespread use of oral dehydration
salts for babies has led to a decline in their mortality rate,
down 57.3 percent from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the ministry set up the monitoring network for
maternal mortality and another network to oversee mortality of
children under five, covering populations of 100 million and 8.55
million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also surveyed physical conditions in children ages
0-7 in 1975, 1985 and 1995 in nine major cities, including
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The survey results showed that on average, the height and
weight of Chinese children had increased, Wang told the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
She said that these results, added to the declining mortality
rates, indicate improvements in the health conditions of Chinese
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the conference were officials from the Beijing
offices of some international organizations, including the
U.N. Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, and the
U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The officials praised China's achievements in healthcare for
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the ministry will work to improve health
conditions for women and children who live in the vast rural and
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In the future, priority will be given to those areas for
receiving government allocations and technical training, she
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A new survey has revealed that as
the economic fortunes of Chinese cities grow, so does the
offspring of citizens.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released today demonstrate the link between a
king-sized economy and the height and weight of children.
</P>
<P>
The improved health care and daily diets generated mainly by
wealth have helped Chinese children become higher and stronger
than their counterparts 20 years ago, national surveys showed.
</P>
<P>
A six-year-old boy in 1995 was 3.2 centimeters higher and 1.72
kilograms heavier that a boy of the same age in 1975, according to
the surveys, made among children under seven years old age, in
urban and suburban areas of nine major cities, such as Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, in 1975, 1985 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The results were released at a news conference held by the
Ministry of Public Health today. The conference was also told that
maternal mortality and mortality among under-fives was also
decreasing in China.
</P>
<P>
In the 1985-95 period, figures of height and weight of urban
boys aged 6-7 increased 1.7 cm and 1.16 kg respectively, and those
of girls climbed 2 cm and 1.28 kg.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the year 1985, suburban boys of the same age
group were averagely 2.5 cm higher and 0.99 kg heavier, and girls
were 2.2 cm higher and 0.82 kg heavier last year, the surveys
found.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the past decade witnessed a greater leap of rising
of children's height and weight compared with the 1975-1985 period.
</P>
<P>
The heights of six-year-old boys and girls increased 1.7 and 2
cm in last decade, while they rose 1.5 and 1.2 cm in the previous
decade.
</P>
<P>
"The different increasing rates indicate that children's
nutritional status and physical development levels have seen a
much better improvement in the past ten years," said Wang Fenglan,
director of the Women and Children Health Care Department under
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although children in northern part of China, such as in
Beijing, Harbin and Xi'an, are still higher and heavier than those
in Guangzhou, Fuzhou and Kunming in south China, the traditional
large gaps between them are being gradually shortened, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The surveys also found that increasing speeds of children's
height and weight varied from city to city, depending on the
levels of economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to the average height and weight of 6-7-year-old
children, big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing always
walked-tall in the first-three places since 1975.
</P>
<P>
But in the past decade, Guangzhou and Fuzhou in prosperous
coastal areas in south China have made a giant leap forward in the
total ranking, while the inland cities of Kunming and Xi'an ranked
last.

<HEADLINE> Breath-Test on Drivers Helps Reduce Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of the
breath-test regulation on drivers last December has helped the
reduction of road accidents in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Traffic Headquarters, the number of
Hong Kong's traffic accidents and casualties in the first half of
1996 fell by 4.3 percent and 3 percent to 7,99 and 9,574
respectively over the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of fatal traffic accidents dropped by 17.2 percent
to 106 while the number of deaths fell by 18 percent to 109.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Chi-sum, chief superintendent at the headquarters, said
that breath-testing had made motorists more aware of the dangers
of drink-driving.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new rule for the test was one of major
factors in decreasing road accidents in the first six months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than one in six motorists breath-tested by
police had been drinking before taking to the road.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,321 drivers screened by police up to the end of July,
242 were found to be over the drink-drive legal limit and another
159 had alcohol in their systems but were below the legal limits,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-six drivers have been convicted of drink-driving
offenses since the introduction of the breath-test regulation on
December 15.

<HEADLINE> Indian MPs Call for New National Sport Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- MPs of India's Janata Dal party
and Bharatiya Janata Party today urged the government to formulate
a new national sport policy and raise the country's sport level.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Indian contingent's performance was poor at
the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"What is the use of spending so much money on sports when we
are not able to bag a single medal," they said at the Lok Sabha
(lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
They said it was most unfortunate that such a vast country as
India had not been able to win a single medal at the Olympics
whereas other smaller countries have won many.
</P>
<P>
Noting that India is applying for hosting the 2006 Asian Games,
the MPs called for the immediate start of the preparation of
Indian sports teams and the establishment of a high-level
committee for the selection of athletics for major sports meets.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Plans Bond Floatation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) plans to
go back to the international bond market to raise fund for its
four billion US dollar refleeting program, a senior PAL official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
PAL deputy president Jaime Bautista told reporters that
financing for the refleeting program will come from equity,
foreign and loan syndication, Eximbank financing and the Eurobond
flotation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, PAL will pay first the holders of the 100
million US. dollars of Eurobond it floated in August 1993. The
Eurobond is maturing this month.
</P>
<P>
PAL has to pay on time its maturing Eurobnds in order to prove
PAL's creditworthiness in the international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
PAL is purchasing 32 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus
industries to upgrade its aging fleet,
</P>
<P>
The refleeting program would hopefully wipe out the 10.7
billion pesos (409 million dollars) of accumulated losses of the
airlines over the past 12 years, Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that a PAL bond float would enjoy a
better reception in the market with the improving creditworthiness
of the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> China's Geological Investigation Tours Attract Overseas Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,400 geological
experts from overseas have applied to participate in a series of
79 geological investigation tours that will be held during the
coming 30th International Geological Conference.
</P>
<P>
The international gathering is scheduled for August 4-14 in
Beijing. Six thousand Chinese and foreign scientists are
expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Anze, deputy head of the conference's
Geological Tour Committee, included among the 79 routes are tours
through the western part of the Kunlun Mountains and the central
and northern parts of the Hengduan Ranges, all in western China.
</P>
<P>
Another route extends through Tarim Basin, one of the world's
largest basin areas. A number of other routes have been opened
with special permission for the first time to the overseas experts.
</P>
<P>
Tours of 14 routes had started on July 23 and most of the
foreign experts are interested in the investigation tours in
northwest and southwest China, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas scientists also have been attracted to the
geological structures in the Three Gorges region, where China is
building a gigantic water conservancy project; the world's largest
rare earth mine in north China's Inner Mongolia; and the diamond
mine in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The high number of tours is an attempt to let geologists from
other countries to know that China has ample varieties of
geological structures, and that the research level of Chinese
geologists is becoming advanced, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China's aviation, railways, pubic health and public security
departments are arranging the tours.
</P>
<P>
Tour guides are all outstanding Chinese geologists, including
some academicians of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.

<P>
SHENYANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A village in Liaoyang County in
northeast China's Liaoning Province has a large number of people
who enjoy quite long lives, with an average age of 80.9 years.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 1,771 villagers in 486 households in the mountainous
eastern part of the county, there are 122 above the age of 70 and
seven above the age of 100. All of these people are members of the
Manchu ethnic group that governed China in the Qing dynasty (1644
and 1911).
</P>
<P>
People in the village above the age of 70 can often be seen
working the farmland, cutting fire-wood, or tending sheep and cows
in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Song Yuxi, 104, is still able to do farm work, while Wang
Caoshi, 101, still has quick reflexes and can do some needle-work,
although she is a bit deaf.
</P>
<P>
People here cherish the folksy harmony of three or even four
generations living together, and criminal behavior is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
The village is surrounded by mountains and the water here is
very clean and the scenery beautiful. The village's 1,850 mu
(about 123 hectares) of farmland is treated with natural
fertilizers, and the dinner table has locally produced vegetables,
 fish, pork and eggs.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the villagers are healthy and seldom feel ill, and
not a single case of cancer has been reported in the
village.

<TEXT>
<P>
MUDANJIANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Women in China have organized
a network of organizations across the country to combat gambling
and to promote healthy ideas and culture.
</P>
<P>
At a national anti-gambling conference in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, the All-China Women's Federation called for
the setting up of more women's organizations in villages and towns
to deal with gambling as part of a national drive to reduce
gambling and eventually eradicate it.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100,000 women's anti-gambling groups have
been formed in Heilongjiang, Shanxi, and Hunan provinces which
have taken the lead in the fight against gambling.
</P>
<P>
These groups have come up with a series of measures, a
reporting and surveillance system, and anti-gambling classes to
help reduce gambling.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, in Heilongjiang alone, local anti-gambling groups
helped the police look into more than 3,000 gambling cases.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal city of Weihai in east China's Shandong
Province, a total of 3,437 anti-gambling groups, composed of
13,000 women, are now operating.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS)'s working group on environment has approved two projects
proposed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to improve the
environment and natural resource management in the Mekong river
subregion.
</P>
<P>
One of the ADB projects is targeted at addressing rural poverty
and resource degradation in the upper watersheds areas of the GMS
to help protect significant biodiversity in the areas, according
to an ADB press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the ADB will work together with the Mekong
River Commission to provide regional program setting and assist
the GMS countries to build a coordinated policy framework to
address the poverty and soil erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will test these poverty and environment programs at the
highest priority sites throughout the subregion to pave the way
for investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The other project approved at the second meeting of the working
group, which was held here on Wednesday and Thursday, focuses on
the improvement of management of critical wetlands in the lower
Mekong basin, especially the Tonle Sap (great lake) in central
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is also planning programs on training and information
exchanges to reinforce the projects.
</P>
<P>
The working group meeting was co-sponsored by the ADB and the
United Nations Environment Program. Representatives from the six
MGS countries - Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam
- and international organizations attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two projects will be further developed and submitted to the
sixth ministerial-level conference on subregional economic
cooperation scheduled for next month at Kunming, capital of
China's Yunnan province.

<HEADLINE> China Envisages Independent Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish an
independent banking system to speed up the commercialization of
state-owned specialized banks and minimize the impact of bad loans
to state firms, according to a senior central bank official.
</P>
<P>
The system will make it easier for state-owned enterprises to
directly apply for loans from designated banks and their branches,
the official of the People's Bank of China said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities also plan to use the system to separate
general loans from those for state-owned enterprises, thereby
reducing the harmful impact on the banking system brought by bad
loans to the unprofitable state sector, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a certain amount of funds will be set aside to
support enterprise reform and mergers, takeovers and bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Another official said the central bank has drawn up a policy to
prevent loans to state-owned enterprises from being turned into
fiscal spendings.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, the central bank will issue short-term loans
to the state-owned enterprises that have marketable products but
are suffering losses.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Firms in Flood-Stricken Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wuhan, August 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 foreign-funded
enterprises in Wuhan have maintained normal operations despite the
current flooding, the second-heaviest in the central China area
since 1865.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded factories that produce beer and cotton cloth
continue to send their products to other parts of the country and
abroad, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Due to persistent rains and flooding along the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River, Wuhan has been threatened by rising river
water, which at one point reached 28.66 meters at the Wuhan Guan
Observation Point. The riverbank there collapsed in 1931 from high
waters.
</P>
<P>
It is the second highest river level reported in this portion
of the Yangtze since 1954.
</P>
<P>
The city government has mobilized over 100,000 armymen and
local residents to join the anti-flood campaign. Guards have been
patrolling the banks of Yangtze River around the clock, and banks
close to foreign-funded manufacturing plants are receiving extra
police protection.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these efforts, local people have been able to lead a
renormal life, according to official sources. Local markets have
been stable, though prices of vegetables have risen slightly. All
of the city's communications and telecommunications systems are in
operation. No casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the water level has dropped to about 20
meters, far lower than the danger level.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is the capital of Hubei Province in central China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A first case of bank computer
theft happened in the Romanian Development Bank recently.
</P>
<P>
Someone stole billions of lei by transferring funds between the
bank's head office and its branches through its computer system,
local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Development Bank, a commercial bank, is now
running as usual despite the theft.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the theft could mostly be committed by bank
staffs because its computer system operates according to its own
code, which could be learned only by those working for the bank.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a Romanian college student stole money, not through
computer, but through deposits and transferring accounts among
banks.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Mortality Rate Drops in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The maternal mortality rate in
China has dropped to 62 per 100,000 women, one-third less than the
1989 figure, according to a report released today by the Ministry
of Public Health (MPH).
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry's monitoring network of maternal
mortality in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
show that the maternal mortality rate in urban areas had dropped
from 50 per 100,000 in 1989 to 39 per 100,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the rate was 76 per 100,000 last year, compared
to 115 per 100,000 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Though the rate in the rural areas has dropped dramatically,
large regional gaps still exit, said Wang Fenglan, director of the
MPH's Women and Children Health Care Department.
</P>
<P>
In large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, the
average maternal mortality rate has reached the level reported in
developed countries, down to 24 per 100,000. In southwest China,
the figure is 120 per 100,000, still at the level of other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the six major causes for the maternal mortality
include obstetric hemorrhage (45.3 percent of the total),
hypertension (14.2 percent), amniotic embolism (8.8 percent),
heart disease (8.1 percent), liver disorders (3.9 percent) and
puerperal infection (three percent).
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate due to obsteric hemorrhage, the leading
cause of death for women in labor, has dropped to 25 per 100,000,
compared to 36 per 100,000 in 1989. The death rate due to
puerperal infection has dropped to four per 100,000, from 1995's
two per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that among all the social, environmental, economic
and cultural factors that affect maternal mortality, the economic
conditions of the women's families, their range of health care
knowledge and the professional skills of the healthcare workers at
grassroots levels are the major causes.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries, Regions Discuss Anti-quake Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Achievements in seismological
research, anti-earthquake measures and disaster reduction methods
are on the agenda of an international assembly scheduled through
this weekend in Tangshan.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 delegates from more than 30 Asian countries and
regions are participating in the Regional Assembly of the
International Association of Seismology and Physics of Earth
Interior (IASPEI), which opened Thursday in the north China city.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan was seriously hit by an earthquake 20 years ago, which
killed more than 240,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangli, director of China's State Seismological Bureau,
said at the opening ceremony that the conference will focus on
Asia, which has been frequently hit by natural disasters and where
the most serious earthquakes have occurred.
</P>
<P>
He said the task of coordinating economic construction with
damage reduction is a common concern among Asian countries, as
many of them are still developing and have limited resources.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government always attaches importance to
anti-quake and disaster reduction work," said Chen, adding that
China has learned from disaster experiences in other countries,
and has formed an anti-quake system that includes disaster
prevention techniques, earthquake emergency, disaster relief and
post-quake reconstruction measures.
</P>
<P>
IASPEI president Froidevaux said that extensive international
exchanges and cooperation will lead to worldwide advances in
seismology.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing conference has offered experts from Asia and other
countries the opportunity to share opinions and discuss
achievements in seismological study, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conference will promote cooperation in
anti-quake and disaster relief among Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference will close on August 4.

<HEADLINE> Damming of Yangtze Won't Affect Navigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts said that
navigation on the Yangtze River will not be affected by the
damming that will be done next November as part of the massive
Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was made after a group of water conservancy and
navigation experts examined a preliminary design for navigation
facilities, navigation routes and harnessing of the Yangtze
navigation channel.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary design, during the six years
following the damming of the Yangtze, navigation will be made
possible by using a water diversion channel and a temporary
shiplock. After 2003, a permanent shiplock will be used for
shipping.
</P>
<P>
Experts said when the flow volume of the Yangtze is less than
20,000 cubic meters per second, ships can pass through the water
channel. There is a nine-month period during which any ships can
pass through the channel, which is 3,726 meters long, 350 meters
wide and 58 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
But in high-water season, when the flow volume of the Yangtze
exceeds 20,000 cubic meters per second, the channel cannot be used
for navigation. Therefore, after next November and through 2003,
navigation in the remaining three months will be carried out with
the help of a shiplock and a shiplift.
</P>
<P>
The temporary shiplock and the shiplift, which are connected,
are located on the north bank of the Yangtze. They can provide
passage for a fleet of 3,000-ton vessels.
</P>
<P>
China is moving fast to build the water diversion channel, the
temporary shiplock and the shiplift and harness the Yangtze
navigation channel, in order to guarantee navigation after the
Yangtze is dammed, project officials said.

<HEADLINE> NP to Launch Anti-poverty Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua)-- The National Party (NP)
would launch a new workable anti-poverty initiative as an
alternative to its reconstruction and development program (RDP),
NP leader f w De Klerk has said.
</P>
<P>
"The Star" paper today quoted De Klerk as saying that the
NP's policy initiative was part of a plan to prepare a set of
policy alternatives to the African National Congress (ANC) in
time for the next general election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk made the remarks at the opening of the party's
three-day federal congress on Thursday in Cape Town, which was
attended by over 2,000 NP delegates from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The congress, under the theme of "opposition with a mission",
was the NP's first national meeting since its withdrawal from the
ANC-led government of national unity on June 30.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech delivered at the congress, De Klerk said
the NP supported the RDP, but was deeply concerned about the way
it was being managed.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk claimed the ANC had lured the votes of millions of
people on the basis of the RDP, but had failed to manage the
program "as a comprehensive and cohesive anti-poverty action
plan".
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the NP had decided to launch an alternative,
comprehensive and workable anti-poverty strategy to address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, in a stinging attack on the ANC's handling of the
RDP, said the ANC policies were heading the country for a crisis,
not only financially but in education and health.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is slipping. Things are beginning to go wrong.
The danger limits are flashing," he added.
</P>
<P>
As opposition party, De Klerk said the NP would criticize the
NP "without mercy" on behalf of the broad public, not only making
negative criticism but also constructive cooperation on all
fields with which the party agreed.
</P>
<P>
By 1999 the NP hoped to be able to give the voting public
clear policy alternatives to reverse the country's decline and to
build confidence, he said, adding the NP would do something
really worthwhile in the fight against poverty and deprivation.

LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government efforts to restore faith in the beef
industry suffered a new setback Thursday after it revealed
evidence for the first time that "mad cow" disease can be passed
from mother to calf.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Franz Fischler, European Union agriculture commissioner,
warned Thursday night that the framework for lifting the export
ban on British beef might be delayed following the disclosure that
BSE, or mad cow disease, could be passed from cows to calves.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A task force to be held at 24-hour readiness to tackle

</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Signs that Britain's increasingly competitive
telecommunications market could deteriorate into a legal morass
came as BT, itself facing allegations of misleading customers
about its rivals, served notice that it was to sue America's

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Terms Visit to US as Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
termed his visit to Washington as successful, saying that the
U.S. stressed its sustained support for the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Nile TV a few minutes before
his departure from the U.S. capital, which was broadcast today,
Mubarak said he conferred with a number of U.S. Administration
officials and Congressmen on several issues of mutual interest
with emphasis on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the peace drive requires further cooperation by
the parties concerned including Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt considers the U.S. role in the Middle East peace march
an important and vital one, and it will be very difficult to
continue the peace process without Washington's efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that upon his return home he would hold contacts with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to inquire about his
views on what should be done and to offer aid to implement all
the agreements reached.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of
Hebron has delayed because Netanyahu has to discuss all the issues
and review agreements reached when he assumed power in June.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will wait till Netanyahu draws up his plan," he said,
adding that he hoped the Likud-led government would be able to
solve these problems and start withdrawing from the town.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also said his visit to the U.S. embraced meetings
between the Egyptian and American businessmen and the two sides
exchanged views on the issues of investment and economic reform in
Egypt which had recently made a big stride toward the eradication
of many obstacles, giving good impressions to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed the conviction that his visit to the
U.S. this time would culminate in attracting much American
investment to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that studies are under way to guide American
investors to investment opportunities in the Governorates of Suez
and Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak emphasized that stability and security are among the
most important pillars that encourage foreign investors to come to
Egypt, adding that the climate of investment in Egypt embraces all
investors, foreigners and Egyptians alike.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Media Slam Japanese PM's Shrine Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's media have strongly
denounced Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's recent visit
to the Yasukuni Shrine, urging him to explain and apologize for
his action.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Daily News said in its July 31 editorial that
Hashimoto's visit to the shrine showed that he advocates the
righteousness and legitimacy of the history of Japanese
imperialism. Hashimoto should not act so hastily for the sake of
building a relationship of mutual-trust between South Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Daily News said in an editorial Thursday that
Japan must acknowledge its history of aggression and do nothing
that will harm the S.Korean-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The Korean National News pointed out in an editorial that the
South Korean people have always maintained vigilance over the
Japanese government's attitude toward imperialism since Hashimoto
came to office, who has visited the Yasukuni Shrine before.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urged Hashimoto to stop making remarks or taking
actions which would also upset other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto visited the Yasukuni Shrine which honors
Japan's war dead, breaking a decade-long taboo on prime
ministerial visit to it.
</P>
<P>
Right after the visit, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said
if it really wants to establish friendly relations with its
neighbors, Japan must respect the feeling of its neighbors that
have suffered from its imperialistic aggression.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until it
was defeated in 1945.

<HEADLINE> Greater Interest In Family Education Among Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese parents really want
to know what are the best ways to tell their children what they
should and should not do, and over half say that they are not
qualified teachers at home.
</P>
<P>
These answers came out in a survey conducted by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences and China Women's News which found that
96.2 percent of the parents polled expressed an interest in
learning how to teach their children.
</P>
<P>
China Women's News published the results of the survey in March
after receiving nearly 5,000 responses and hundreds of letters
from readerships within six weeks. The CASS analyzed 1,111
randomly answer sheets from across the country.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that 83.5 percent of the parents chose the
ways of "convincing" and "encouraging" in answer to "what methods
do you use to educate your children," while 8.9 percent responded
with "blame" and "spank".
</P>
<P>
A CASS assistant research fellow, Bu Wei, who did the analysis,
concluded that the frequent response of "convincing" and
"encouraging" means that most parents do believe that these are
good education methods. However, when parents fail to convince or
encourage their children, they resort to blaming or even spanking
their children.
</P>
<P>
Bu said that, as a matter of fact, parents themselves are not
entirely pleased with the "carrot-and-stick" method, which is why
so many parents hope to learn something more about education
methods.
</P>
<P>
Bu also found that about 58 percent of the parents did not
consider themselves good educators, and 4.1 percent said they did
not have the ability to educate their children. Only one out of
four was confident of his or her child education methods.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 74 percent of the parents learn how to be
a good parent mainly by reading publications about family
education. Some 60 percent of them would like to discuss the issue
with friends or colleagues, too.
</P>
<P>
The child's teacher is sometimes the parents' teacher,
too. More than 40 percent of the parents said that they go to the
teachers looking for help.
</P>
<P>
"Family", a monthly Chinese publication relevant to family
education with an annual circulation of 2.5 million, won a prize
for excellence last year.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Terms Visit to US as Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
termed his visit to Washington as successful, saying that the
U.S. stressed its sustained support for the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Nile TV a few minutes before
his departure from the U.S. capital, which was broadcast today,
Mubarak said he conferred with a number of U.S. Administration
officials and Congressmen on several issues of mutual interest
with emphasis on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the peace drive requires further cooperation by
the parties concerned including Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt considers the U.S. role in the Middle East peace march
an important and vital one, and it will be very difficult to
continue the peace process without Washington's efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak indicated that he would be meeting soon with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat to brief them about the outcome of his visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He added that upon his return home he would hold contacts with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to inquire about his
views on what should be done and to offer aid to implement all
the agreements reached.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of
Hebron has delayed because Netanyahu has to discuss all the issues
and review agreements reached when he assumed power in June.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will wait till Netanyahu draws up his plan," he said,
adding that he hoped the Likud-led government would be able to
solve these problems and start withdrawing from the town.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated the importance of making progress in
the peace process along the Palestinian track before the
convocation of the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit,
due to take place in Cairo in November, so as to encourage all
parties to participate.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has exerted intensive efforts for the
continuation of the peace march and to encourage all parties to
adopt positive stances during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also said his visit to the U.S. embraced meetings
between the Egyptian and American businessmen and the two sides
exchanged views on the issues of investment and economic reform in
Egypt which had recently made a big stride toward the eradication
of many obstacles, giving good impressions to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed the conviction that his visit to the
U.S. this time would culminate in attracting much American
investment to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that studies are under way to guide American
investors to investment opportunities in the Governorates of Suez
and Port Said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak emphasized that stability and security are among the
most important pillars that encourage foreign investors to come to
Egypt, adding that the climate of investment in Egypt embraces all
investors, foreigners and Egyptians alike.

NEW DELHI, August 2 ( Xinhua) -- India's Foreign Investment
Promotion Board (FIPB) has decided to reject outright all pending
applications for foreign equity participation in the deep sea
fishing sector, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ban extends to wholly-owned subsidiaries of foreign
companies as well as joint ventures with Indian partners. The
decision has sealed the fate of about a dozen such applications
which had been pending with the FIPB for several months.
</P>
<P>
"The government has taken a clear decision not to allow foreign
investment in deep sea fishing. Therefore, keeping so many
applications in abeyance does not make sense. We have decided to
reject outright all such applications and have sent letters to
some clearly stating so," said the official.

<HEADLINE> Modern Life Infiltrates Remote Tibetan Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Dado, a young farmer from a remote
Tibetan village, was baffled the first time he saw modern dance in
a movie. But he was quick to learn it, and is now an outstanding
disco dancer.
</P>
<P>
Dado and his fellow villagers, the natives of ethnic Deng
group, mainly inhabit Zayu County in the Tibet Autonomous
Region. In the 1950s, locals of the ethnic Deng group still lived
in a primitive, sometimes vicious society.
</P>
<P>
They used to record figures, such as the amount of their daily
income and expenditure, by weaving knots in a rope or making cuts
in a piece of wood.
</P>
<P>
To relax and revitalize themselves after a day's hard work,
they dance. "Dancing helps alleviate the fatigue after a whole day
of labor," Dado said. "At the same time, it allows us to have a
more colorful life in our village."
</P>
<P>
Modern dance offers a sharp contrast to traditional local
ethnic dance, but the young villagers are ready to follow new
trends, and want to keep pace with the lifestyle of their urban
peers.
</P>
<P>
Now Dado and many of his friends wear Western clothing,
especially blue jeans. But the folks of the older generation
retain their native lifestyle, wearing earrings and long
sleeveless robes.
</P>
<P>
During festivals, Dado and his friends often flock to a
courtyard or a patch of grassland, where they dance to tape
recorded music through the night.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are well-to-do, we want to have a better sense of
modern life," Dado said.
</P>
<P>
After 1959, when Tibet began democratic reforms, the local
government helped the Deng minorities people to move their homes
out of the deep forests, reclaim wastelands and establish new
villages. As a result, their lives have changed profoundly.
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the tide of modern life has had an impact on the
natives who live in almost all villages of Zayu County.
</P>
<P>
People go to work on bicycles, trucks rumble down the roads
with full loads of goods, roadside stores sell daily necessities
to local people, and children recite texts and sing with joy
popular songs.
</P>
<P>
The wealthier villagers have filled their living rooms with
tape recorders, television sets, sofas, wardrobes, and
high-quality bedding.
</P>
<P>
Farmers tend irrigated land, raise domestic animals and fish,
and grow sugarcane, bananas and citrus trees. And the more
business-minded villagers have opened small stores.
</P>
<P>
Despite the changes, some ethnic Deng people still cling to
century-old, outdated traditions, such as polygamy.
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be stopped by administrative decrees, all we can
do is to let people make their own decisions, but with more
education," a county official said.

<HEADLINE> Most Macao People Confident in Future: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in Macao shows that
most Macao residents are confident in their future after China
resumes its exercise of sovereignty in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey among 1,641 residents in Macao shows that some 63
percent of the respondents said they have confidence in the future
of Macao, and only less than 20 percent people said they are
unconfident.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly sponsored by the Macao Federation of
Neighborhood Communities and the Education and Youth Department of
the Macao Government. Those surveyed include people of various
ages and careers, according to the organizer.
</P>
<P>
More than 76 percent of those surveyed said that they believe
that the transitional period of Macao can pass smoothly, and more
than 53 percent said that they believe the Chinese government will
be able to maintain the economic prosperity in Macao.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey shows that about 50 percent of those who
answered the questionnaire said that they are unaware of the three
leading issues of the transitional period, namely the localization
of civil servants, localization of law and the use of Chinese as
an official language. But among those who know the issues, half of
them said the implementation process of the three issues is too
slow.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that local residents now mostly care
about the economic growth, social security and welfare in Macao.

<HEADLINE> hka-- Japan-U.S. Insurance Talks End Without Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States ended
three-day talks with no agreement to solve their bilateral
insurance dispute, Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in Vancouver, Canada, between senior
Japanese and U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service quoted Kubo as saying to reporters that it
is a pity that the talks ended without any agreement. Acting
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky was also
disappointed with the result of the insurance talks.
</P>
<P>
No new talks have been arranged. But both sides have expressed
the wish to complete the insurance talks with agreements reached
in every sector.
</P>
<P>
At the Vancouver meeting, the U.S. refused proposals made by
Japan to deregulate its auto insurance market and showed no
flexibility in discussions on the scope of the so-called "third
sector" insurance products to be handled by life and nonlife
insurance subsidiaries which Japanese insurers plan to set up as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
The third sector covers sickness, accident and nursing care
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
If Tokyo approves its major life and nonlife insurance
companies to establish such subsidiaries without agreement with
the U.S., Washington could resort to trade sanctions under Section
301 of the U.S. omnibus trade act of 1974, Kyodo News Service
reported.

CHENGDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The pig-raising industry in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, which plays an important role
in keeping China's pork business in balance, showed a steady
increase in the first half of the year.
</P>

Official sources report that the province produced 34 million
head of pigs during the January-June period, an increase of 1.3
percent over the same period last year. Pork output during the
period was 2.35 million tons, up 5 percent, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, Sichuan province also supplied a total of
117,000 head of pigs to other parts of the country, which is

</P>
<P>
Sichuan attaches great importance to its pig-raising business
and has taken steps to deal with any problems that may hurt local
pork producers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it developed its poultry, cattle, and sheep
sectors rapidly in the first six months, with meat output of
Sichuan in the period totalling 2.8 million tons, an increase of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Property Market Finds Turnaround Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- As Thailand's economy is slowing
down this year and the overall real estate market has been
depressed for three years, property values are likely to further
depreciate, according to property observers.
</P>
<P>
Prices of land and housing units have fallen since the Gulf War
of 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the decade, the property market was booming
with prices of almost all types of property inflated by domestic
and foreign speculators.
</P>
<P>
Since then, decline has seen many people stuck with property
they cannot sell unless they take a loss. Developers unable to
sell units cannot avoid high interest costs.
</P>
<P>
Cash-hungry owners are being forced to sell as they cannot
shoulder higher interest, according to Ballobh Krityanavaj of the
Government Housing Bank.
</P>
<P>
Price-slashing and special deals will increase in many segments
such as housing, land sub-division and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
A source at Cathay Trust Co. said land prices were declining in
certain areas and that owners cannot sell their land at higher
prices as there are no buyers.
</P>
<P>
Some emerging suburbs of Bangkok have plenty of land and prices
could drop sharply, market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, land values in Bangkok's central business district
would not fall because demand is high and supply of land is
limited. In some growing areas the price will also remain high.
</P>
<P>
"The overall real estate business is saturated. Some land
owners who have no potential to develop their own projects now
accept to sell their plots at affordable prices to reduce interest
cost," said Sonirat Sontijiwawong of Tanyathorn Co.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, sales of luxury
condominium units in Bangkok slowed down but residential leasing
market remained active.
</P>
<P>
Some companies on the stock exchange said if developers keep
building, the oversupply and misery in the market will last
longer.
</P>
<P>
It takes about three years for a development to complete. With
cranes still on the horizon, it means that it will take at least
three years before the property market is back to normal and
demand comes back to the industry, investors say.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some companies listed on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) are refusing to be involved in new Bangkok
projects.
</P>
<P>
Some developers have also decided to halt development because
they do not want to risk seeing their performance plummet further.

<HEADLINE> French Archbishop Killed in Oran, Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Monseigneur Pierre Claverie, the
French Catholic Archbishop of Oran, west of the Algerian capital
Algiers, was assassinated Thursday evening presumably by the
Algerian Islamic extremists, the French Foreign Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We express our horror and our indignation over this
assassination," said a foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The assassination took place several hours after French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette made a visit to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Claverie, 58, is the 40th French national killed since 1992,
and the 19th Christian missionaries assassinated since May 8,
1994, all by Algerian Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
De Charette held a meeting with French Catholic missionaries in
Algiers on Thursday, and Claverie was killed on his way back to
Oran from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Algerian Interior Minister Mostefa Benmansour
strongly condemned the killing Thursday evening, calling it "a
criminal and barbaric act against a place of worship and
victimizing an esteemed person of the Algerian Church." He vowed
to capture the killer with all means necessary.

<HEADLINE> Roman Gold Coins Discovered by Sino-Japanese Archeologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, Augest 2 (Xinhua) -- Four gold coins from the Eastern
Roman Empire have seen the light of day after hibernating for more
than a thousand years.
</P>
<P>
The coins, whose faces are still quite clear, were unearthed
from a tomb of the Northern Dynasties (A.D. 386--A.D. 581) in
Guyuan County, in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo Feng, deputy director of the Guyuan Museum,
the four coins were from the period of the early Byzantine Empire
and are about 1500 years old.
</P>
<P>
Four gold coins discovered in one tomb, according to Luo, are
the first of their kind to be found in China. "This reflects the
long history of cultural exchanges between Ancient China and
Rome," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The excavation was a joint effort of Chinese and Japanese
archeologists.

<HEADLINE> Modest But Steady Economic Growth in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Jiangsu province,
one of China's most developed areas, recorded moderate growth in
the first half of the year, with a GDP that grew by 13 percent to

<P>
The output of summer grain totalled 12 million tons, 11.9
percent more than last year's figure.

in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the provincial statistics bureau predict that
Jiangsu's economy will continue to rise in the latter half of the
year. Annual GDP growth is expected to increase by 12 to 14

<HEADLINE> National Bio-Medicine Center to Be Built in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a national
bio-medicine research and manufacturing center in Shanghai's
Pudong New Area in a move to boost the country's national
pharmaceutical research and production capacity.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was signed in Beijing today to establish the
center in Shanghai's Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park by Zhu Lilan,
executive vice-minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission (SSTC), Chen Minzhang, minister of Public Health, Zheng
Xiaoyu, director of the State Pharmaceutical Administration, and
Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Pudong New Area, the center is expected to
manufacture 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) worth of
bio-chemical products by the year 2000 -- about one-third of the
city's total.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the three government departments
and Shanghai will jointly formulate the development strategy,
regulations and preferential treatment for the construction and
development of the center.
</P>
<P>
The three government bodies also promised to give priority to
the center to determine the location of major bio-chemical
industrial projects and research projects, and provide information
and channels for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai promised to give priority to the national center for
the construction of civil works there, and for loans and
employment of specialized personnel. The park, which covers 27
sq. km., will give preferential treatment for land-use prices to
the projects included in it.
</P>
<P>
Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of SSTC, said that the center is
designed to make full use of Shanghai's potential in
bio-technology, medicine research and development. It will also
help upgrade the city's research and manufacturing capacity, and
facilitate the formation of pharmaceutical industrial groups which
are dominated by the national pharmaceutical industry and are
internationally competitive.
</P>
<P>
Hua Jianming, vice-mayor of Shanghai, said there are about 200
firms in the municipality that specialize in bio-technology and
pharmaceutical research, development and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The firms produce about half of the country's raw medicinal
ingredients and preparations, which were valued at about six
billion yuan (722 million US dollars) in the first half of this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are seven national laboratories, nearly 30 research
institutes and more than 10 colleges and universities specializing
in bio-medical research and development, that employ a total of
18,000 professional workers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Shanghai, the largest industrial center in China,
has allocated 20 million yuan each year to subsidize the
low-interest loans for industrialization of bio-pharmaceutical
products, and about 10 million yuan to fund the researches and
development for biological study and new drugs.

NEW DELHI, August 2 ( Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit in the
first quarter of the current financial year (April-June) rose to
933.4 million US dollars despite a decline in import growth, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the corresponding period of last year was

growth of 11.74 percent over the monthly figure last year.

Imports in the first quarter this year were estimated at 9.14

TOKYO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Japan's Social
Democratic Party (SDP) said that Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine is "incredible".
</P>
<P>
The SDP, a major partner of the three-party ruling coalition of
Japan, met on Thursday, during which officials criticized
Hashimoto's Monday visit to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based Yasukuni Shrine is a place where memorial
services are held for Japan's dead in its war of aggression,
including class-A war criminals such as the wartime prime minister
Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
SDP Secretary-General Kanju Sato and Chairman of the Policy
Board Shigeru Ito both agreed that the prime minister's visit is
"incredible".
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to ask Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazo
Watanabe to pass the party's criticism to Hashimoto, the first
serving prime minister to go to the shrine since 1985, when a
similar move by then serving prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
triggered strong protests from the Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit has already drawn criticism from China, the
People's Democratic Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and
other Asian nations.

finance (10.2 percent), commerce and trade (10.1 percent) and
transport (9.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
In terms of contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) in
1995, increased productivity contributed 70 percent against 66
percent in 1994 while employment contributed 29 percent against 33
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's productivity growth has outpaced that of the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and
Canada since 1990, according to the NPC.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will start a trial of
possible HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) vaccine by the end of
this year, reported +the New Vision+ paper today.
</P>
<P>
Citing Professor Roy Mugerwa of Makerere Medical School, the
report said a seminar to discuss the trial will be held in
Kampala on September 9-12 after which fifty people will be
selected for trials.
</P>
<P>
The 50 people will receive four injections of a vaccine called
Alvac with GP 120 boost over one-year period.
</P>
<P>
+The vaccine has been found safe in other parts of the world,+
Mugerwa said yesterday, adding, +the trials are to find out
whether it is safe to try the vaccine on a large scale under our
conditions.+
</P>
<P>
The trials in Uganda will be under phase one. Similar vaccine
trials have been conducted in the USA, France and elsewhere where
trials have now gone into phase two involving hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
The trials in Uganda only on the people with low risk
behaviors and the experts will monitor their response to the
vaccine, the professor said. He warned that there is no treatment
still for Aids and the trials should not cause any excitement.
</P>
<P>
The International Aids Research Institute based in the U.S.
said the trials are safe and capable of creating significant
antibody upon which further research will be conducted.

<HEADLINE> China's Urban Jobless Rate Reaches 2.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- China's urban jobless rate
reached 2.9 percent by the end of June, 0.01 percent up from the
same time last year, the Labor Ministry said in a report released
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is optimistic about its goal to curb the jobless
rate in cities within 3 percent by the end of this year, according
to the ministry report on the labor situation in first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, over 1.64 million out of work people
were employed in the first six months, but another 1.63 million
were simultaneously laid off.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the number of the unemployed was 5.25
million, up 9.4 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Labor Ministry, "state-owned
and collectively-owned businesses, engaging in the transformation
of operational mechanism for higher efficiency and better profits,
have seen their ability dwarfed to take in workers."
</P>
<P>
"And the jobless rate will continue to rise as a considerable
number of enterprises are unwilling or refuse to sign contracts
with workers," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, statistics show that the number of workers employed by
private businesses are on a rapid rise. They employed 910,000
more than a year ago, compared with 810,000 more taken in by
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And the number in collectively-owned enterprises was 1.49
million less than a year ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The average income for Chinese workers was 2,628 yuan in the
first six months this year, 14.9 percent up from the corresponding
period of time in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Those working in private business have seen the quickest rise
in income, averaging at 32.9 percent over the 1995 period.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Hussein Meet Secretly in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu secretly met in Britain last weekend with King Hussein
of Jordan, who was there for medical convalescence, Israel Radio
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
After the Israeli media disclosed that Netanyahu had slipped
out of Israel with top aides last Friday and returned Saturday
night, senior Israeli government officials late Thursday night
confirmed that the meeting took place in London.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti suddenly flew to London last Friday to join King
Hussein, who is scheduled to visit Syria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio said that the meeting was kept quiet, so King
Hussein would be publicly seen as meeting Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad before meeting Netanyahu, who is to visit Jordan Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that apparently it was important for Netanyahu
to meet Hussein before the latter meets al-Assad, and there is
speculation that the two discussed ideas surrounding Netanyahu's
"Lebanon First" initiative.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Lebanon First" idea, the Israeli army would
withdraw from the Israeli self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon for a promise of quiet on the Israeli northern border.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser
Dore Gold left Thursday night for talks with U.S. officials in a
bid to further advance the prospects on the Syrian track,
particularly for the "Lebanon First" approach.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi said Thursday, before
his trip to Syria, that Lebanon could not agree to such an
approach, since this would leave Syria exposed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Syrian sources and Netanyahu's office Thursday
denied the reports that Syrian President al-Assad dispatched an
envoy to Israel last month to meet with the Israeli premier in an
effort to explore peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Syria is vehemently opposed to secret
talks, favoring the utilization of the U.S. as a mediator and
believing only the U.S. is capable of pressuring Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post, an American citizen with
strong Syrian connections met an official in the prime minister's
office in mid-June during a private visit.
</P>
<P>
He then reportedly traveled to Syria, and apparently met with
senior Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper added that the same man has visited Israel
several times in the past and met frequently with late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 230 tons of copper about to
be smuggled out of Zambia have been seized by the Zambian police
in Livingstone, Southern Province of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The police intercepted the train of six Zambia railways wagons
of the copper in Livingstone on Thursday, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The highly organized swindle was uncovered with a tip from a
Zambia railway's employee in Lusaka, who told the police that
three armed men had approached him and forced him to remove
documents on the wagons showing East London of South Africa by
replacing new documents showing the destination to Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The Livingstone police swung into action and positioned
themselves at the railway station where they intercepted the
wagons immediately they came in.
</P>
<P>
Ephraim Mateyo, southern province commanding officer, said
that he was shocked with the scandal and the amount of copper
which the nation would have lost had the police not moved in
quickly.
</P>
<P>
The stolen copper was from Kitwe and Mufulira of Copperbelt
province en route via South Africa to some overseas markets,
according to the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Xiamen has
started to suspend telephone service for those who illegally paste
up advertisements on the city's streets, in the first action of
its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, illegally posted ads on streets have become a
public nuisance, marring the local setting and the environment.
</P>
<P>
On many local streets, all sorts of ads have appeared claiming
to cure venereal diseases, collect unpaid debts, teach martial
arts and do housework, at the side of building entrances, at bus
stops, on walls and poles, and in elevators and toilets.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the city government has set up more
than 100 billboards and urged people not to stick ads just
anywhere in public places. It has also sent out people to remove
ads that are already there.
</P>
<P>
The city has looked into over 400 instances of illegal posters,
removed more than 100,000 such advertisements, and suspended phone
service for 30 units and individuals who refused to remove illegal
ads by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that most of those who have been penalized will not
put up ads out on the street again, because they are afraid of
losing contact with the outside when their phone lines are
cut.

<HEADLINE> Samper Raps U.S. Isolation Against Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Ernesto Samper
said today his European tour was a start of a diplomatic offensive
against the U.S. efforts to isolate his country.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day official
visit, alleged that "some circles" in Washington were trying to
isolate his government from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy, he said in an interview given to the French
daily Le Monde, would only further destabilize his country.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who became the Colombian president in August 1994 and
concurrently holds the presidency of the Non-Aligned Movement, was
revoked entry visa by the U.S. government on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government sanction, based on allegations that drug
cartels helped bankroll Samper's election campaign in 1994, has
aroused a strong outcry in the Latin American world.
</P>
<P>
The president, who denies the charges, said the U.S. stance was
contributing "to seriously worsen 15 years of cooperation between
the two countries over the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against drugs cannot be furthered by unilateral
action by one country against another, but only by collective
action," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Samper met French President Jacques Chirac
and discussed, among other topics, anti-drug policies and
anti-terrorism efforts, a French presidential spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president is scheduled to leave France on Friday
for Spain.

A total of 746 security personnel were taken to court in 1995
with the army leading with 301 (40.3 percent), the report added.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku has declared last week's coup in
Burundi as "unacceptable," saying he fully backed African leaders
on economic sanctions against the military junta in Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Business Times paper at the Dar Es Salaam
International Airport shortly after arrival for a six-day working
visit to Tanzania on Thursday afternoon, Chief Anyaoku said he
would recommend to his 52-member club to support Great Lakes
regional leaders in censuring Major Pierre Buyoya's regime.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes summit held in Arusha, Northern Tanzania on
Wednesday has decided to impose economic sanctions on Burundi and
appealed to the international community to support these
measures.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku said the Commonwealth is opposed to any action
to grab political power through unconstitutional and undemocratic
means, adding that military take-overs were among issues of
serious concern to the club.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief, who was met at the airport by
Tanzania's Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete, said he would use the
visit to discuss a bit more about the Burundi crisis with
Tanzanian leaders.

HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- World Bank deputy resident
representative Kapil Kapoor said the long-term development of
Zimbabwe's tourism hings on the success of the indigenisation
program in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said contrary to public perceptions, the tourism sector is
not the domain of minority whites but also offers vast
opportunities for the indigenous blacks who had the required
resources.
</P>
<P>
''You should note that for the long-term development of the
tourism sector, it is critical for us to press on with the
indigenisation program so as to allow the un-fettered
participation of blacks,'' Kapoor said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of an aggressive marketing
strategy, saying the tourism sector should stop moaning about
lack of support from the government.
</P>
<P>
Kapoor added tourism should intensify its training programs to
ensure the sector keeps abreast of international trends.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Zimbabwe's fastest growing sectors and the third
largest foreign currency earner, which earned about 130 million
U.S. Dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nazi Re-arrested After Innocent Verdict Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A former Nazi captain was
re-arrested today for a wartime mass massacre, as infuriated
relatives of victims and national leaders protested the innocent
verdict declared on him just hours before.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Erich Priebke, 83, accused of taking part in
the Ardeatine Caves massacre of 335 Italian civilians in 1944, and
reportedly drove him to a non-military prison.
</P>
<P>
A military court declared Priebke's freedom Thursday, agreeing
he was just following orders, which touched off a wave of protests
immediately in the country. Relatives of the victims erupted with
tears and scores of angry Jewish youths -- 75 of the victims were
Jews -- stormed the courthouse, blocked Priebke and his lawyer for
more than seven hours and injured at least five officers in the
scuffles.
</P>
<P>
However, defense lawyer Di Rezze said the re-arrest was "an
Italian injustice."
</P>
<P>
"He was barely acquitted and he is immediately arrested," Di
Rezze said, indicating an appeals court must confirm the arrest
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The crowd eventually dispersed after Justice Minister Giovanni
Maria Flick announced the police would re-arrest Priebke "in view
of the German request for extradition," following a meeting with
law enforcement officials midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Italy's president, premier and leading politicians, as well as
Jewish leaders, also expressed outrage at the court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
"The massacre wounded humanity and, with humanity, the Italian
people. Today, the wounds reopen," President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Senate declared a moment of silence while Mayor
Francesco Rutelli ordered Rome's monuments darkened and Premier
Romano Prodi went to the site of the massacre, expressing "extreme
bitterness" at the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Priebke admits shooting two people and marking off others'
names as they were led to be shot. He would have faced a penalty
of life in prison if convicted of the charges of taking part in
mass murder aggravated by premeditation and cruelty.
</P>
<P>
But a three-man tribunal found him guilty of taking part in
murder, a charge with a 30-year statute of limitations, thus
allowing Priebke to go free.
</P>
<P>
Germany's justice ministry said a German arrest warrant was
still outstanding and they will pursue an international arrest "so
that no matter what country he goes to, his extradition will be
sought."
</P>
<P>
Argentina, where Priebke lived openly for decades until his
arrest in 1994, has barred his return.
</P>
<P>
During the three-month trial, the defense argued that the
massacre on March 24, 1944, was a legitimate wartime reprisal and
that Priebke would have been killed himself if he disobeyed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Welfare Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today voted
78-21 to approve a welfare reform bill that would end six decades
of guaranteed cash assistance to the poor.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who had vetoed two previous bills, said
Wednesday he will sign the new one, which had been passed by the
House earlier with 328-102. All 53 Republican senotors were joined
by 25 Democrats in passing the bill, 21 Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The vote followed hours of debate in which outraged Senate
opponents criticized the White House and the Republican-designed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
As the vote began, 10 protesters shouting "Shame! Shame!" and
blowing whistles from the visitors' gallery. About two dozen U.S.
Capitol Police officers carried several from the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The bill, expected to save taxpayers an estimated 54 billion
dollars over six years, would end the 60-year federal guarantee of
open-ended assistance to the poor.
</P>
<P>
It would set a lifetime limit of five years of welfare per
family and require an able-bodied adult to work after two years
but allow hardship exemptions for up to 20 percent. States would
get block grants to run the programs as well as the authority to
set most of the rules.
</P>
<P>
On the Senate floor, attacks against the bill and Clinton's
embrace of it were led by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York.
</P>
<P>
Rather than reform welfare, he said, the bill "terminates the
basic federal commitment to support dependent children in hopes of
altering the behavior of their mothers... with absolutely no
evidence that this radical idea has even the slightest chance of
success."
</P>
<P>
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged Clinton to veto the bill,
saying, "Do not sacrifice the fate of poor children and disabled
adults to election-year posturing."
</P>
<P>
Supporters like Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
a Republican of Delaware, hoped the package will "reorder our
confused and confounding system of welfare", but others
acknowledged it may have some unintended results.
</P>
<P>
About 200 bill opponents marched outside the White House. "It
will plunge 1 million children into poverty," said civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson, citing a figure from an Urban Institute
study.
</P>
<P>
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said almost half the
bill's projected savings, 27 billion dollars, would come from food
stamps, and 18 billion dollars of that would come from families
with children.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Cause Extensive Damage in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The forest fire in Marmaris,
Mugla province along the Mediterranean coast, which was taken
under control two days ago, has destroyed a total of 4,350
hectares of forest, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News quoted officials as saying that Turkey had spent
430 billion Turkish liras (over 5 million U.S. dollars) on
extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Thursday the state will
help the villagers who have suffered in the fire when he inspected
the devastated area of Marmaris.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said, "We will heal the wounds caused by the fire at
once. Our state is strong and compassionate. The state
compensates for one's losses. Do not feel any anxiety."
</P>
<P>
"Our foremost target is forestation. The Forestry Ministry is
very experienced on the issue. We will bring the area to its
former state in the shortest time possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the forest fire on Dilek Peninsula, which is still
being extinguished and damped down, has destroyed 750 hectares of
forest area and bushes as well as 550 hectares of agricultural
land, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Erol Bese, deputy director of the National Parks in the
Aegean, said that the fire had caused the death of a great number
of animals including reptiles, insects, birds, boars and
squirrels.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Get Loan from World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will receive a World Bank
loan of 90 million US Dollars for its economic and social
adjustment program in economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister of Finance Ronald Penza last
night, saying that the credit was approved at a World Bank
meeting in Washington on Thursday and he was only informed of the
outcome at about 18:30 hours.
</P>
<P>
''I am proud to inform you that i have just received a message
i have been waiting for the whole day. This message states that
the World Bank, at its sitting in Washington, has approved a
total of 90 million US Dollars for Zambia,'' Penza said, quoted
by the local press.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''i am excited with the bank's decision. It shows
that it is a true multilateral institution which is above
politics.''
</P>
<P>
There have been fears in the past few weeks that the World
Bank might withhold 45 million US Dollars which was part of the
90 million Dollar two-year economic and social credit facility to
Zambia because of pressure from some donor countries who were not
happy with the political developments in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Happier Lives For Elderly In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has become one of the first provinces to face the issue of an
aging population, with the number of people above the age of 60
reaching more than 5 million, or 11.78 percent of the province's
total population.
</P>
<P>
To see that elder people live better lives in their remaining
years, the provincial government and social organizations have
raised money to establish a welfare fund for the elderly, and more
than 20 cities and counties have set up their own welfare fund,
which now amounts to 28 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has 1,510 homes for the aged that can accommodate
20,900 elder people.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 142 special hospitals and clinics for
them, and other 150 hospitals have outpatient services and wards
for the elderly, as well as hospice services for those who are not
expected to live much longer.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has 2,077 businesses run by elder people, and they
employ 1.29 million people, with an annual output value of 1.437
billion yuan, more than 5.7 million yuan of which is used for a
welfare fund.
</P>
<P>
A total of 106 colleges and 346 schools offer courses in
calligraphy, painting, photography, and medical science for the
elderly. More than 100,000 elder people have attended these
courses.
</P>
<P>
There are also tens of thousands of recreation areas for senior
citizens and all prefectures, cities, and counties have special
organs taking care of the affairs related with the elderly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Foster Parents Sentenced for Torturing Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Foster parents in
Philadelphia, the United States, were sentenced to five to 20
years in prison for torturing a nine-year-old girl by scalding her
with boiling water and smearing hot-pepper paste on her genitals,
the Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The couple, Anna Gradiz, 42, and her husband Elman, 37, were
guilty of "one of the most appalling cases of child abuse," the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
The little girl, dubbed Tara M., has had three skin grafts and
wears a protective stocking all but two hours a day in the fifth
month of recovery from burns over more than half her body, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Tara, born to a mentally retarded 15-year-old who was herself a
foster child, had already been shuffled between at least eight
foster homes when she was just 6. She was sexually and physically
abused in some of the previous homes.
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit was also entered charging the city with neglect.
Despite Anna's history of psychological disabilities, the Gradizes
were selected to take the child by Association Puertorriquenos en
Marcha, a private agency that provides foster care.
</P>
<P>
The child was taken to a hospital's emergency room three months
after she entered the Gradizes' home. Doctors found that Tara had
been scalded over half her body and suffered two black eyes,
puncture wounds in her back and inflamed genitals.
</P>
<P>
The report cited police as saying the couple punished the girl
by stripping her, forcing her into the bathtub and dousing her
with buckets of scalding water.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Flocked to Study Chinese in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty thousand foreigners
flocked to China to study Chinese in 1995, more than twice the
number reported two years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the State Leading Group For
Teaching Chinese As A Foreign Language, 27,000 foreign students
came to China in 1994 to study the native language, double the
number in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An official with the group said that in the first half of last
year, those universities authorized to recruit foreign students
were unable to accept any more overseas applicants because of a
shortage of dormitories and apartments.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, an increasing number of young Chinese
people who live overseas are studying their native language and
culture. An upward trend in the field of study also has been
reported among families of foreign diplomats and businessmen in
China.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese fever" has been attributed to the country's rapid
economic growth and rising international standing, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 1,000 schools in over 60
countries worldwide offer Chinese language courses, and that there
has been widespread academic research related to the Chinese
teaching.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, neighboring and developing countries saw
a growing demand for Chinese teachers, and the popularization work
of Putonghua, the standard Chinese language, has developed fast in
Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Christopher: U.S. Must Have Regular High-Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, August 1 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said today that the United States must
have regular high-level contacts with China in order to pursue the
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee,
Christopher said the U.S. had restored "a positive momentum" to
engagement with China after a period of difficulty in the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the U.S.-China understandings on nuclear exports,
the Agreement On Intellectual Property Rights as well as China's
important role in the world. He said the two countries also shared
"an interest in cooperating on issues like drug trafficking, alien
smuggling, and the environment."
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that during his meeting with Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Djakarta last
week, he laid out proposals for a series of "high-level visits
over the next years between cabinet officials, our leaders, and
Chinese leaders."
</P>
<P>
"I also personally accepted an invitation to visit Beijing in
November of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that if President Clinton is re-elected,
there will be an exchange of visits at the highest level,
including the Vice President, including the President, in the
years ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the Most Favored Nations treatment was a normal
trade treatment, its annual review by the U.S. produced "tensions
and anxieties in relationships that are not entirely healthy."
</P>
<P>
The recent approval of normal relations with China by the
Congress was an indication that "maybe we can move to a new level
there and avoid this annual period of tension and divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
"But that will be up to the Congress," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said China would be admitted to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), if it agreed to open more market access for
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE>   Christopher Calls for Restraint in U.S. Arms Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Warren Christopher cautioned today that the United States
should exercise restraint in sales of advanced weapons to foreign
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was responding to questions by Democratic Senator
Paul Sarbanes during a hearing of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. Sarbanes argued that the issue of U.S. sales
of conventional weapons is increasingly important because it is
the largest supplier of those arms worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"In an overall sense and just speaking for myself, I think we
should show great restraint in introducing new or higher levels of
weaponry into areas where they don't presently have them,"
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to encourage countries to put their money into
things that are greater benefit to their citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher's remarks seem to be at odds with major U.S.
military industries and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and major American weapons
makers have urged the lifting of restrictions on U.S. sales of
advanced weapons to Latin America and other world regions.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the U.S. administration had not yet
decided what to do about a ban on weapons sales to Latin American
countries, Christopher said his "strong conviction is we should be
very careful about raising the level of competition in countries
with respect to arms sales."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that arms sales often led to an arms race in a
region.
</P>
<P>
If the United States sold high performance aircraft to one
country, then neighboring countries often felt compelled to
purchase the same equipment, Christopher said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Returns Partial Whitewater Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Arkansas bankers were
acquitted Thursday on four of the 11 conspiracy and fraud charges
against them and a mistrial was declared on the remaining counts.
</P>
<P>
The partial verdict came following five days of deliberations
in the case against Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert M. Hill on
charges related to the 1990 campaign for re-election as governor
of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Arkansas bankers were cleared on charges that involved
White House Deputy Counsel Bruce Lindsey as an unindicted
co-conspirator, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Whitewater prosecutors, who brought the charges, alleged that
the three conspired to keep campaign cash transactions from the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Hill were also accused of using bank funds to
reimburse themselves and family members for contributions to
Clinton and other Arkansas politicians during the 1990 election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton testified in the trial via videotape.
</P>
<P>
Clinton testified that he appointed Branscum and Hill to state
posts after the 1990 election because they were qualified for the
jobs, not because they contributed money to his campaign as
prosecutors argued.
</P>
<P>
One element of the prosecution's case was that Branscum and
Hill funneled campaign funds to Clinton to curry favor with the
governor so that they could win appointments to the state highway
commission and state bank board.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Hill were accused of conspiring with Lindsey to
keep the bank from reporting to the Internal Revenue Service that
30,000 dollars had been withdrawn before the May 1990 primary
election and 22,500 dollars prior to the November general
election.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Takes Steps to Fight Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Interior Ministry
recently decided to take concrete measures to fight against
terrorism in the country as a result of increasing blasts.
</P>
<P>
The police will increase and strengthen their night and day
patrols at such important public areas as cultural palaces and
railway stations, said Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev at the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Dobrev, there were 92 terrorist blasts in Bulgaria
during the first half of this year, which was obviously on the
rise compared with those of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics from the country's Police Station headquarters
showed that the armed robberies were also increasing.
</P>
<P>
What worried the government most was that some security
companies were involved in the robberies, providing information
for the gangs, said a senior police officer at a press
conference.

ATHENS, Georgia, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Tiffeny Milbertt scored
the winner at the 68th minute to give hosts the United States the
first ever Olympic women's soccer gold.
</P>
<P>
The American eleven, who edged world champions Norway 2-1 in
the semi-finals, opened the scoring at the 19th minute through
Shannon MacMillan when she slamed home a rebound from the left
post.
</P>
<P>
But 14 minutes later, Sun Wen levelled the score for China as
She lobbed over American Briana Scurry after a fast
counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
The two teams deadlocked at the 1-1 tie until the 68th minute
when Chinese defenders made a fatal mistake and let their American
opponents hit in the controversial goal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team tried harder thereafter but their higher and

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Official-English Bill Amid Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House today passed an
official-language bill that requests almost all federal government
business to be conducted in English, which the Democrats denounced
as divisive, anti-immigrant and disrespectful of minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-sponsored bill was passed by a vote of 259-169
after an emotional debate between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican from Georgia, said
English is the tie that binds the country together, and mastery of
the language is critical for immigrants who expect to do well.
</P>
<P>
"While I cherish every person who comes from anywhere who comes
here legally..., I want them to become American, and part of
becoming American involves English," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton administration threatened a veto. "This
highly objectionable bill is unnecessary, inefficient and
divisive," said a statement released by the White House Office of
Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jose Serrano, Democrat from New York, while criticizing
the bill, suggested that the bill be amended to bar presidential
candidates from using the federal campaign funds to advertise in
Spanish. His suggestion was voted down 257-171 but drew Democratic
applause.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the federal government would have to print most
of its documents in English and citizenship ceremonies would have
to be conducted in English.
</P>
<P>
But government employees and officials would not be barred from
speaking with a person in any foreign language, and agencies
involved in international relations, trade, the census and
national security could use other languages as well.
</P>
<P>
Agencies also would be allowed to communicate in other
languages during emergencies that threaten the public health or
safety, according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the bill said that the federal government
shouldn't have to print documents in all of around 320 languages
residents speak. And some said that language difficulties reported
in bilingual nations such as Canada would erode U.S. unity.
</P>
<P>
But some Democrats said the bill would keep hard-working,
tax-paying, patriotic Americans from getting information they need
from the federal government only because they are unable to speak
English fluently.
</P>
<P>
While Texas Democrat E. "Kika" de la Garza criticized the bill
as "making us the laughing stock of the world," another Democrat
from Pennsylvania, Thomas Foglietta, said, "Since we're
legislating an official language, how about an official religion
to go along with it?"

<HEADLINE> China, Cuba to Battle for Olympic Volleyball Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Both China and Cuba won their
respective semifinals Thursday evening for a grand finale of the
women's volleyball tournament at the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
China, Asian champions, defeated Russia 12-15, 15-5, 15-8 and
15-12 while Cuba breezed over Brazil 5-15, 15-8, 10-15, 15-13 and
15-12.
</P>
<P>
After losing their initial lead 7-1 and 11-7, the Chinese women
spikers, third-place finishers at the World Cup last November, won
the last three sets in a row to secure the first berth in the
final slated for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
From 1-6, the Russians who upset Cuba in the preliminaries,
rallied back to win the first set with seven solid blocks.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese who finished third and seventh in the
previous two Olympics, beefed up their stamina by taking the
second 15-5 with 10 straight points for 13-4.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, China surged ahead 4-0, 7-1 and 10-3 and kept
its lead before their Russian opponents sorted out their problems.
</P>
<P>
Once lagged behind 8-10 in the fourth set, the Chinese women
spikers remained to be hard nuts for the Russians and tied 10-all
and 12-all before ace spiker Li Yan broke the deadlock with her
fierce attack into the back court.
</P>
<P>
Then, China capitalized on an off-side attack from Russia to
lead 14-12 and sealed the competition with a winning block.
</P>
<P>
In a late semifinal, reigning world and Olympic champions Cuba
breezed across world runners-up Brazil to secure the other final
spot in the women's volleyball tournament.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, paced by ace spiker Mireya Luis, rallied back from its
first set deficit and won the last two to eliminate Brazil, the
pre-tournament top favorite for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
After tied 2-2 in the first four sets, Cuba broke the 3-all
deadlock to surge ahead 5-3 in the decider where each serve scores
one point for either side.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, also fourth place finishers in Barcelona, committed two
errors by hitting the net, enabling Cuba to stand on a comfortable
9-5 lead before their tearful celebration.
</P>
<P>
The gold-medal match between China and Cuba is scheduled on
Saturday while Brazil can only vie for a bronze medal in a battle
against other semifinal loser Russia.
</P>
<P>
China that missed the world title for ten years, once dominated
the world volleyball arena with five world titles in a row from
1981 to 1986, including the World Championship, World Cup and the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
However, the grand final will be a tough game for either side.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Authority Not to Extradite Indicted Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and army commander Ratko Mladic will not be
extradited to the Hague for trial, an aide of Bosnian Serb Justice
Minister Marko Arsovic said here today.
</P>
<P>
The aide said at the airport after arriving in Belgrade from
the Hague that an agreement had been reached with the Hague-based
criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that the Serb citizens
would not be extradited to the Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after three days of discussions
between a serb delegation led by Arsovic and the Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Arsovic's aide said there are no legal provisions or basis for
the extradition of Karadzic and Mladic.
</P>
<P>
He described as "groundless" the indictment by the Hague
tribunal against Karadzic and Mladic, saying the charges were
raised under the so-called "objective responsibility principle"
which does not exist in any prosecution process.
</P>
<P>
The official added that legislation concerning the extradition
of Serb citizens would only be worked out by a Bosnian federation
parliament formed after general elections. But he said he doubted
whether the parliament will draw such a legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal has so far listed 75 war criminals in the
former Yugoslavia, of whom 54 are Serbs, 18 Croats and three
Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Defends Currency on Foreign Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank has taken
an unprecedented step of intervening in Singapore and Hong Kong
currency swap markets to defend the Thai currency of baht.
</P>
<P>
Governor of The Bank of Thailand Rerngchai Marakanond declined
to reveal how many U.S. dollars the bank had spent on its
intervention.
</P>
<P>
However, central bank sources believed that the bank may have
spent up to 500 million dollars on Thursday both locally and
overseas to restore confidence in the baht, central bank sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The baht has come under intense pressure recently from rumors
of an impending devaluation to stipulate exports and improve
current account situation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that during the first six months of this
year, many sectors in the Thai economy, including exports,
inflation, current account and the stock market, all showed
poorer-than-forecast performances.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank Thursday intervened in the markets by
asking a handful of banks in Hong Kong and Singapore to quote the
baht swap premium, following concern that the premium had risen
too high.
</P>
<P>
Swap premium is a risk fee that dealers levy on one another
when they trade two currencies with different interest costs.
When a currency is seen as weak, the premium rises. Premium is
frequently quoted with a one-week or one-month rate.
</P>
<P>
The intervention, starting at 11 a.m., worked effectively as
the one-month baht/dollar swap premium rate fell sharply from 22
percent to 11 percent in the afternoon, and the six-month swap
premium rate fell from 47 satang to 42 satang (100 satang to the
baht).
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the intervention was successful because it
had a powerful psychological effect -- impressing upon the market
that the baht will be defended at all costs.
</P>
<P>
It was also because market sentiment was inclined toward
selling the dollar, which had been over-bought following rumors of
an impending baht devaluation that had come largely from the
Singapore market since last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Swedish PM Murder Report Indefinitely Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The long-expected report on the
assassination of Sweden's Prime Minister Olof Palme has been
suspended until the investigation committee gets a new president.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Palme, in a Stockholm street on February 28,
1986, remains a mystery as the gunman is still unidentified, the
murder weapon undiscovered and the motive not established.
</P>
<P>
The ten years of efforts to find a killer made a downturn when
Sigvar Marjasin, the former president of the government-appointed
commission overseeing the police investigation, resigned in May.
</P>
<P>
"Each day that goes by puts our work back a little more," said
Hans-Gunnar Axberger, one of the four commission members, who
announced the indefinite postponement of the report's release.
</P>
<P>
Besides the report, due out in October, "everything is
suspended until the government appoints a new president," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also would be delayed was a meeting between Swedish
investigators and agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
Marjasin left the commission after his personal expenses during
his governorship in the central province of Oerebro aroused the
suspicion of the national auditors.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Launches Public Awareness Drive on Vitamin A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has recently launched a
public awareness campaign on vitamin A in the country's far
western region where children often suffer from eye diseases and
malnutrition due to the lack of the essential substance.
</P>
<P>
A basic training course for women volunteers was also organized
under the National vitamin A program, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 women from remote villages took part in the
three-day training course and would begin to feed more than 50,000
children aged six months to five years in five districts in the
mountainous region with vitamin A capsules this week, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers would also provide knowledge on child nutrition
and the importance of vitamin A to local parents.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that public awareness was the most important
 factor to make the vitamin A program successful.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Nepali children, especially those in remote areas,
become victims of prolonged diarrhea, measles, night blindness and
malnutrition because of the vitamin A deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's National Vitamin A Program, established in 1993 under
the Health Ministry, had already launched vitamin A capsule
distributing drive in 27 districts in the country and an estimated
1.4 million children benefited from the program.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States has given 4
million U.S. dollars worth of environmental protection aid to
Bulgaria to help the East European country implement its forestry
protection programme.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and the
Bulgarian Ministry of Environmental Protection signed an agreement
on the aid here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said the aid was based on
recognition that Bulgaria, with rich natural resources and
abundant fauna and flora, had the potential to become an example
in forestry management and protection.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Ministry of Environmental Protection and the
Forestry Committee had already drawn a plan to use the aid to
create several environmental protection zones in the Balkan and
Rila mountains.
</P>
<P>
It was derived from a 1992 plan to set up people's parks in
mountains and achieve an environmental variety program.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria had built 70 forestry parks with distinguishing
features relating to different natural conditions over the past
ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, due to econ=omic difficulties, it was difficult for
Bulgaria to implement the 1992 plan.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Keen to Enhance Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is keen to deepen
friendship with Russia but the long-disputed Black Sea Fleet is
still a thorny problem between the two countries, visiting
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said today.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Dmitry Ryurikov, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's aide on foreign affairs, Udovenko said that
Ukrainian-Russian relations have entered a new stage and his
country was ready to increase contacts with Russia at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko also discussed the thorny Black Sea Fleet with
Ryurikov, but he admitted that they achieved little progress on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet remains a sticking point in relations
between the two countries since the 1991 collapse of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have already reached a preliminary agreement
on dividing equipment of the fleet, but remained at odds over the
status of the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, where Russia housed
its share of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the issue were further complicated last month
by a new Ukrainian constitution which bars foreign military bases
from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said a complete end to the dispute would pave the way
for a smooth development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko arrived here Wednesday for a three-day working
visit. Later today he also held talks with the head of the Russian
Security Council Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Accuses U.S. of Prejudice over Chechen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry today
accused the U.S. Congress of holding a preconception about the
conflict in Russia's rebel Chechen Republic.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman told a news conference that a
supplementary draft law approved recently by the U.S. Congress on
foreign aid in 1997 "showed no regard for truth in blaming the
Russian federal government for the failure of a settlement in
Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated Russia's stance for a political
settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The bill is at least strange," he said, adding that it
obviously reflected the prejudice of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian leaders stuck to the policy of political
settlement though some serious problems had emerged in the process
for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's stance on the eastward expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the spokesman said no change had
been made.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM's Belarus Tour Focuses on Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati concluded his visit to Belarus today after exploring with
his hosts prospects for furthering bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Minsk, the Iranian foreign
minister met with Belarus President Alexandr Grigoryevich
Lukashenko and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikhail
Nikolayevich Chigiry.
</P>
<P>
Although officials also talked about political cooperation,
according to reports reaching here, topics at a press briefing at
the end of the tour are largely on trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Calling the visit "positive and meaningful," Mikhail
Afanasiyevich Marinich, Belarus minister of foreign economic
cooperation, said his country wants to offer industrial products
in exchange for Iranian oil, and then trade the oil with Central
Asian republics for raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' offers include tractor, which the country expects to
see an increase in export to Iran. And Iran in return has
expressed interest in co-product the agricultural machinery,
Marinich said.
</P>
<P>
Synthetic fibers and products for dual military and civilian
uses are on the Iranian list for increased import from Belarus, he
added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> O'Brien Wins Decathlon Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Dan O'Brien of the United States
claimed the men's decathlon gold medal here today in the Olympic
athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
The American, three times world champion and world record
holder, collected a total of 8,824 points, 67 points shy of his
own world recond.
</P>
<P>
Frank Busemann of Germany wound up second at 8,706 and Tomas
Dvorak of the Czech Republic finished third at 8,664.
</P>
<P>
In the two-day-multievent, O'Brien, who failed to take part in
the previous Olympics due to a no-height failure in the pole
vault, launched his bid to beat the world record well on the
course.
</P>
<P>
He led the first day competition with 4,592 points, while
Eduard Hamalainen of Belarus was more than 150 points behind.
</P>
<P>
After nine events, O'Brien collected 8,180 points, in front of
Frank Busemann of Germany, 7,971, and Steve Fritz of the United
States, 7,953.
</P>
<P>
But In the 1,500m, the last event of the gruelling battle, the
American's effort fell just short when the world champion finished
sixth in the last group. The slow time brought him only 644
points.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak soared to third after the final event to deny Fritz in
front of a packed crowd.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Warns Taxi Drivers Not to Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nepali official has
warned taxi operators not to raise fares before consensus is
reached between the government and the trade.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary of the Works and Transport Ministry Barun
Prasad Shrestha Thursday told the official news agency RSS that
the government had already expressed its willingness to discuss
demands of the taxi operators.
</P>
<P>
However, the unilateral decision of a taxi companies' group to
increase taxi fares by 25 percent was against the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the government is determined to take
 action against taxi operators if they implement the fare hike
scheduled for today.

<HEADLINE> French Sprinter Perec Wins Second Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- French sprinter Marie-Jose Perec
glided to the finish line to pick up her second gold medal in
the women's 200 meters here today at the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
With the win, she became only the second woman to win Olympic
gold medals at both the 400 meter and 200 meter races at one
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Perec clocked 22.12 seconds to win the race, beating world
champion Merlene Ottey of Jamaica by 0.12 seconds. Ottey, who also
made Olympic history today by becoming the first runner to reach
the final of the same event in five Olympic Games, received the
silver.
</P>
<P>
Mary Onyali of Nigeria finished third in 22.38 seconds and
walked away with the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"I am still shivering, the dream has come true," said Perec
after the race. "To me it was quite clear to do it now or never, I
was ready to die on the track today."
</P>
<P>
Ottey, a bronze medalist in 200 meters at the Barcelona Games,
has won a total of 30 medals in major international championships
in past 22 years since her first international competition in
1974.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say thank you to the people of Jamaica, that's it,
what else can I say," said the 36-year-old veteran sprinter. "I
felt really tired but Perec was the one to beat today and she is
very good."
</P>
<P>
Ottey went to her first Olympics in 1980 in Moscow and brought
home the bronze medal in 200 meter race. She went to the Los
Angeles Games in 1984 and won the bronze in the event again. At
the Seoul Games, she dropped to the fourth place. But in
Barcelona, she captured the bronze for the third time. Today it
was her first time to win a silver in the event.
</P>
<P>
Onyali said she had been competing in every kind of meet since
1988, but never got anything.
</P>
<P>
"I am so excited I didn't care what sort of medal I got, one,
two, or three, I just wanted the medal so badly," Onyali said. "It
is the dream that came true, I'm so happy."

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse Index Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai bourse index rose 34.56
points on Thursday at the news that local brokers will establish a
fund to shore up the ailing bourse.
</P>
<P>
The rebound followed a decline that started early this year
with a combined loss of almost 20 percent, mostly through the sale
of foreign-held shares.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Securities Companies agreed at a meeting on
Thursday that a 20 billion baht (800 million US dollars) fund
would be set up to restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The decision spurred a strong recovery in the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET), forcing its index to climb 3.25 percent to
1,098.60 points, with an improved trading turnover of 6.58 billion
baht (263.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund, details of which are yet to be worked out, would be
mobilized from all 50 brokerage firms which are members of the
SET.
</P>
<P>
The 20 billion baht fund would have nothing to do with the 5
billion baht (200 million dollars) left from another fund
established during the Mexican peso crisis early last year.
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, foreign brokers told Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda at a meeting that they sold their portfolios on the
Thai bourse because returns were better on other regional bourses.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Shatters World Record in Men's 200m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson
shattered his own world record in the men's 200 meter race here
Thursday to capture the gold medal, becoming the first man in
history to win both 200 meters and 400 meters at one Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. I'm elated," Johnson said. "At the
start I said to myself, 'I won the 400, but this is the gold I
want. This is the one I didn't get in Barcelona.'"
</P>
<P>
Johnson clocked 19.32 seconds as he stormed to the finish line,
trimming 0.34 seconds off his previous world record of 19.66
seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was faster than 19.66, but I didn't know how fast.
19.32 is unbelievable," he said. "I can't even describe it. But I
was under a lot of pressure, and this is how I perform under
pressure."
</P>
<P>
Frank Fredericks of Namibia finished second in 19.68 seconds to
take the silver and Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago snatched the
bronze in 19.80 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"Before the race I was almost sure that the world record was
going to fall," said Fredericks. "I'm happy that I was helping
Michael to achieve it."
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, 28, won both silver medal in men's 100 meters and
200 meters at the Barcelona Games. He also improved his national
record in 100 meters to 9.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I gave all I had today. Anyway a medal in the Olympics is
always a medal forever, so I am happy with my silver," Fredericks
said.
</P>
<P>
Boldon, 22, was the bronze medalist in 100 meters at the 1995
World Championships, after doubling 1992 World Junior Champion in
100 meters and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
"If someone had said earlier that Michael Johnson is going to
run 19.32 in this race, I wouldn't have shown up," Boldon said.

<HEADLINE> Flood Season Starts In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The annual period of floods has
started in the Chinese capital, with recent daily precipitation
51 mm more than the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The local flood-relief headquarters says there may be flooding
in early August, as showers are predicted for that period.
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that some sub-standard buildings in the
downtown area should to be repaired to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicts that after two days of heavy showers,
the subtropical high-pressure will move westward and temperature
will range between 24 and 31 degrees.
</P>
<P>
However, the damp, hot weather in the city, something not seen
in many years, will last until the middle of the month and local
residents are urged to be prepared against problems caused by heat
and humidity.
</P>
<P>
Some local hospitals are seeing an increasing number of
patients suffering from heat stroke, and intestinal and stomach
problems. Older people are especially vulnerable to cardiac or
circulatory problems, doctors say, calling on residents to pay
more attention to food.
</P>
<P>
The city was hit Tuesday evening by a heavy rainstorm that
deposited over 200 mm of precipitation and caused traffic jams on
some roads and streets.
</P>
<P>
Although many local people have complained about the oppressive
weather recently, with the humidity hitting a record 98-99
percent, the city is said to be enjoying the pleasantly cool
summer weather of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, the highest temperature here reached only
36 degrees centigrade, two degrees lower than the hottest day in
1992, and six degrees lower than the record hottest day in
1942.

<HEADLINE> Germany Wins Contract for Subway Line 2 in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, Augest 1 (Xinhua) -- A German consortium has won a 650
million mark (about 441 million U.S. dollars) contract for the
construction of subway Line 2 in Shanghai, China, which was
scheduled to begin operation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The contract, according to a press release issued today by
Siemens Transportation Systems VT, was signed during ceremonies by
the Shanghai Metro Corporation and the German Shanghai Metro Group
(GSMG) on July 31 in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, ABB-Daimler-Benz Transportation (Germany) GmbH
and the Transportation Systems Group of Siemens AG, has previously
delivered vehicle and rail systems for Shanghai's subway Line 1,
which has been in operation since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the consortium is ABB-Daimler-Benz Transportation
(Germany) GmbH (ADtranz). The division within the consortium is
50 percent each.
</P>
<P>
The new order encompasses the delivery of 35 six-car trains,
the rail electrical supply and overhead contact lines, the
telecommunication systems and telecontrol systems. The
construction and delivery will take about 5 years.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Metro Line 2 runs in East-West direction and is
one of the most important lines of the entire planned subway
system in the city of Shanghai. It thus adds to the first line,
which was built from 1989 to 1995 in North-South direction.
</P>
<P>
The second line will be about 26.5 kilometers long and will
lead from the city's Hong Qiao Airport underneath several
residential areas, the public park, and Huangpu River to Pudong
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Line 2 will be built in two phases. The first phase is about
13.6 kilometers long with a total of 10 stations. It will start
service in late 2001.

MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
accept only minor changes in the peace pact with the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), chief negotiator of the government panel
Manuel Yan said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yan make the statement before the Senate which began its open
inquiry about the establishment of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) to explain certain
issues arising from the deal.
</P>
<P>
Yan's statement indicated a softening of the rigid position of
the government against any alteration in the interim peace pact
the two sides reached in Davao city last month.
</P>
<P>
But it prompted Senate minority leader Edgardo Angara to charge
that the government is "undemocratic" and "unwilling to bend to
the sentiments of the people."
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to set up the SPCPD raised widespread
opposition from Christians in Mindanao and 20,000 of them staged
protests on July 31 when President Fidel Ramos visited this region
to drum up support.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari has also said he was OK with
amendments to the agreement after filing his candidacy for the

<HEADLINE> Opium Cultivation in Northern Thailand Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Narcotics
Control Board has predicted a drastic increase in illegal opium
cultivation in northern Thailand as a result of the rising price
of heroin in the world market.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey revealed that opium-growing areas in Lampang
province had increased by 155 rai (24.8 hectares) from mid-1995 to
a total of 242 rai (38.7 hectares) in mid-1996, Wattana
Chompalapol, policy and planning analysis chief of the Northern
Narcotics Suppression Center, was quoted today by the Bangkok Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said opium growing was rampant in Lampang province,
especially in Chae Hom, Ngao, and Wang Nua districts.
</P>
<P>
Opium cultivation by hill tribes tends to increase as heroin
prices rise and financiers encourage the business. Also, drug
warlord Khun Sa's surrender to the Myanmar authorities has caused
a shortage of heroin in the world market, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Absorb 7,500 MNLF Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) have come to terms on the
integration of 7,500 MNLF members into the military and police
services as part of a final peace accord in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres announced on Thursday that
5,500 MNLF rebels will be enlisted as regular members of the armed
forces, another 1,500 will be taken in by Philippine national
police, and 500 others will join engineering brigades and
construction units of both the military and police services.
</P>
<P>
The rebels will be allowed to bring in their firearms which
will be made part of the government armory, Torres said. Other
MNLF fighters who will not be integrated will be asked to register
their weapons and granted livelihood assistance in exchange for
their guns.
</P>
<P>
The integration of how many MNLF fighters into the military and
police services is one of the key issues unsettled by both sides
in Davao city last month. It was considered a main block to the
final peace pact that was expected to reach in Jakarta this month.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the integration would start as soon as the
government and the MNLF sign the final peace agreement ending 24
years of civil strife in the south.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Marie-Jose Perec of France became
the first athlete at the Games to win two gold medals after she
finished first in the women's 200 meters here this evening at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who won the 400m gold earlier at the Games,
clocked 22.12 seconds ahead of Merlene Ottey of Jamaica and Mary
Onyali of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, 36, who won the silver in the 100 meters last week,
failed to add a gold to her credit, beaten at the finish in 22.24.
Onyali's time was 22.38.
</P>
<P>
Perec, who ranked first in the event and was mainly a 400-meter
runner, is the first woman here to win two golds and the second
woman in history to complete the 200m and 400m double.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was able to do the double if I could run my
personal best in the final. I was the fastest in the world this
season before the race, so I thought it was possible to get
another gold," said the winner at the press conference after her
victory.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- First seed Andre Agassi of the
United States will meet Spain's Sergi Brugera in the final of the
men's tennis singles event at the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Agassi came through 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 over India's Leander Paes
while Bruguera, who hasn't gone further than the quarter-finals of
any tournament this year, defeated Meligeni Meligeni of Brazil 7-6
(11-9), 6-2 in Thursday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Paes was left to rue the two set points he spurned in the
opener which he could have swung the semi-final at the Stone
Mountain tennis center.
</P>
<P>
After a false start, Paes broke Agassi for 4-4 when the
American sprayed a wide return. The Indian number one held serve
for 5-4 and 6-5, and then led 40-15 against Agassi's service.
</P>
<P>
The Indian looked destined for a shock breakthrough, but he did
not take good chances at the time and lost the first set at 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Agassi admitted afterwards:"I think it got pretty tight there
in the first set, it could have gone either way."
</P>
<P>

Marc-Kevin Goellner of Germany defeated Dutch pair Paul Haarhuis
and Jacco Eltingh 6-5, 7-5 to win the men's doubles brone medal

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Top favorite the United States
outscored China 2-1 to win the women's soccer Olympic gold medal
in Athens, Georgia Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
With upperhands in speed, the American footers played their
aggressive game while the Chinese women were caught off-guarded
time and again at the Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
In the 17th minute, Shannon MacMillan rushed ahead to put in a
rebound off the left post after Kristine Lilly centered the pass
into the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong was in no way to block as she still
failed to stand up after balming off the first straight kick.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Chinese Sun Wen beat American goalkeeper Briana Scurry 14
minutes later by lobbing in the equaliser which defender Brandi
Chastain failed to hook out from the baseline.
</P>
<P>
With 25 minutes into the second half, an off-side pass was
ignored by the side referee and Joy Fawcett outraced a Chinese
defender and passed the center from the left wing before Tiffeny
Milbrett tapped in the winner.

The United States won the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women's World

something to cherish as they only lost to the host on a goal with
off-side suspicion.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Enjoy 8.2 Percent Economic Growth in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The seven members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to
enjoy an 8.2 percent economic growth in 1996 after having an
average annual growth of 7 to 9 percent during the 1985-1995
period, a noted economist said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN economies are expected to experience continued dynamic
growth and structural change -- increasingly sophisticated
manufactured goods and services -- in the next decade as was the
case in the last decade," Mari Pangestu told an international
business seminar on the economic outlook of Southeast Asia and
China.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are to book a relatively high
growth performance as expected, she said at the seminar which was
organized by the Jakarta Post in cooperation with the Asia Pacific
Economics Group and Qantas of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines expected a strong growth in 1996 due to its
economic reforms and structural change while Singapore will
experience some slowdown as it gears up for an advanced economy
status.
</P>
<P>
As to Vietnam, Pangestu said that its membership in ASEAN will
reinforce its market-oriented strategy.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, will see continued reforms
and structural change underpinning economic growth in the future,
added Pangestu.

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- World champion Derrick Adkins of
the United States captured the gold medal in the men's 400 meter
hurdles here today at the 26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Adkins, who won the 1995 World Championships in men's 400 meter

</P>
<P>
Samuel Matete of Zambia finished second in 47.78 seconds to

run a clean race."
</P>

Adkins said he did not go out "super hard" in the race, but he
was happy that he was able to "pull it off."

better for him to run in lane two to six. "But for this you need a
better performance in semis," he said.

"I know that my score against Derrik in the last five years was
22:15 in his favor, but I am anyway very satisfied with the
medal," Matete said.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson of the United
States shocked the world with an unbelievable world record time
and won his second gold in the men's 200 meters here this evening
at the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant sprinter hit the tape in 19.32 seconds,
shattering his own world record of 19.66 and materialised his
dream of becoming the first man in Olympic history to win the 200m
and 400m.
</P>
<P>
Frank Fredericks of Namibia was second in 19.68, ahead of Ato
Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, 19.80.
</P>
<P>
Before the final, Johnson saved his strength in the semifinal
with a slow run. The 28-year-old looked back three times while he
eased down the speed before clocking 20.27.
</P>
<P>
His nemesis Frank Fredericks of Namibia, who ran the second
fastest race in 19.82 last month, led the semi-finalists with a
19.98 clocking.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, perhaps the brightest star at the Olympics, lived up
to his reputation in the final, left the blocks like a rocket and
caught up Fredericks in the first 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
He was a clear leader when he ran off the curve and maintained
his sizzling speed to the finish.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to express my feeling after doing the double
and beat the record. I got a good reaction and ran pretty fast in
the first half. It is an incredible time even to myself. I will
run the relay tomorrow," said the talented American after the
race.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Advance to Olympic Basketball Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Reigning European champion
Yugoslavia gained the final berth in the Olympic men's basketball
event here on Thursday, beating Lithuania 66-58 in a rematch of
last year's European final.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will meet the American team in the final.
</P>
<P>
Predrag Danilovic, who played in Aemrican professional team,
scored 19 points for the Yugoslavs, including the game's final six
on four free throws and a layup, while Aleksander Djordjevic added
another 16.
</P>
<P>
The victory was especially sweet as the Yugoslavs had been kept
from the 1992 Olympics and 1994 World Championships by United
Nations sanctions prompted by the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, which won the bronze medal at the Barcelona Games,
will play for bronze again on Saturday. Rimas Kurtinaitis scored
22 points to lead Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
NBA center Arvydas Sabonis had 14 points and 13 rebounds, but
made a critical turnover and foul in the final seconds to hurt
Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Djordjevic scored eight points in a 19-6 run over five minutes
and 30 seconds that left Yugoslavia ahead 28-24 with seven minutes
remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia kept that margin with a 35-31 half-time lead and the
game stayed within a four-point spread for either club most of the
second half.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Shatters World Record to Win 200m Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson of the United
States shocked the world with an incredible world record time and
won his second gold in the men's 200 meters here this evening at
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant sprinter hit the tape in 19.32 seconds,
shattering his own previous world record of 19.66 and materialised
his dream of becoming the first man in Olympic history to win the
200m and 400m.
</P>
<P>
Frank Fredericks of Namibia was second in 19.68, ahead of Ato
Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, 19.80.
</P>
<P>
Before the final, Johnson saved his strength in the semifinal
with a slow run. The 28-year-old looked back three times while
easing down his speed before clocking 20.27.
</P>
<P>
His nemesis Fredericks, who ran the second fastest race in
19.82 last month, led the semi-finalists with a 19.98 clocking.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, perhaps the brightest star at the Olympics, lived up
to his reputation in the final, left the blocks like a rocket and
caught up Fredericks and Boldon in the first 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
He was a clear leader when he ran off the curve and maintained
his sizzling speed to shot the biggest triumph.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to express my feeling after doing the double
and beat the record. I got a good reaction and ran pretty fast in
the first half. It is an incredible time even to myself. I will
run the relay tomorrow," said the talented American after the
race.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to win the two finals. Frank and Boldon were
two tough guys, I saved strength in the semis to deal with them,"
added the winner.
</P>
<P>
"I was not nervous before the final. I just concentrated on my
race. Nobody could give me anything, I know, I had to do it
myself," Johnson said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks said: "It is my best time in the best race in
history. I'm satisfied with my result and the silver. Michael
deserved his victory. He is the fastest human on Earth."
</P>
<P>
Boldon also claimed: "When I turned off the curve, I saw
Michael was in front. I thought this guy made it. I am happy with
my time and place."

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian women celebrated
their Olympic gold medal in the hockey tournament by defeating
South Korea 3-1 here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Played at Morris Brown college, the Australians, with their
first hockey team dated back to 1914, dominated the court through
swift moves and lighting strokes.
</P>
<P>
Alyson Annan put Australia ahead in the 17th minute by slamming
home a penalty corner, beating goalkeeper You Jae-Sook aghast.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean Cho Eun-Jung struck in the equaliser also
through a penalty corner with three minutes remained in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
Minutes into the second half, Annan netted a penalty stroke,
her eighth goal in the tournament, to put Australia ahead anew at
2-1.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes before the end of the battle, Australia, Olympic
champions in 1988, scored its third goal after Korean goalkeeper
gratefully stepped in a quick stroke from Annan.
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal was early taken by the Netherlands who won
the penalty strokes 4-3 against Germany.

<HEADLINE> PCC Official Urges Antidote Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A visiting official of the
Cuban Communist Party (PCC) said here today that Latin American
congresses should create "antidote" laws to counteract the
U.S. Helms-Burton legislation.
</P>
<P>
Jose Ramon Balaguer, PCC international relations chief, was
quoted by a press communique as saying that the Helms-Burton law
was aimed at internationalizing the U.S. trade embargo against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton promulgated on March 12 the law
that claims to reinforce the economic embargo against Cuba and
threatens those countries that might invest in the island.
</P>
<P>
Balaguer said in the communique by the Latin American Political
Parties Permanent Conference (Coppal) that the law cannot destroy
the Cuban revolution, and that the ongoing reforms in his country
seek to defend and develop social justice and national
independence.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Helms-Burton law not only affects the
economies of the involved nations, but also has a high dose of
encroachment into the sovereignty of those nations.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has suffered embargoes and pressures from the United
States for more than 35 years, and this new harassment will not
have much repercussions on the Caribbean island, said the PCC
official.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Olympics Games debutee Justin
Huish from the United States won a surprising victory in the men's
individual archery event by beating Sweden's Magnus Petersson in
the final at the Olympic Games here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Aerican, 21, won the gold medal match 112-107 over the
Swede who is also competing in his first Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South Korea's Oh Kyo-Moon outpointed Belgium's Paul
Vermeiren 115-110 to take the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
Huish entered the final by beating Vermeiren 112-103 in
the semi-finals while Pertersson knocked out Oh 112-109 in the
other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
The American, a technician at the Northern Arc Communications
and as a member of the U.S. national team for three years, scored
four 10s and nine 9s. His best performance before coming to the
Games were a bronze medal at the Americas Championships and the
Atlanta Grand Prix, both held earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Petersson, also 21, failed to repeat his form in the
semi-finals. The Swede made three 10s and five 9s, but lost dearly
on the four 8s.
</P>
<P>
The Swede broke the world record in the 25 meters distance in
1993 and the 18m distance in 1995. He finished fourth at the 1995
world championships in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the winner was decided between two Olympic
debutees must have puzzled many of the participants.

favorites to vie for the Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Finished atop in Group B, Norway lost its semifinal match
against the United States 1-2, runners-up in Group A wherein China
was the leader with two wins against one draw.
</P>
<P>
In a match for the bronze medal, Norway dominated the pitch
with their brillant skills and enjoyed upperhands both in corner
kicks and in goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
For Brazil, the fourth place finish still sounded reasonable as
it secured its Olympic outing by virtue of the fact that the
eighth-best team England does not compete as a separate nation in
the Games.
</P>
<P>
While their men compatriots have brought home four times the
coveted World Cup trophy, the Brazilian women footers were gaining
ground only in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, they triumphed twice in South America in 1991 and
1995, and was the only nation from the continent to compete in the
first two FIFA Women's World Championship tournaments, finishing
ninth place each time.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal match is to be played late this evening between
China and the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Visits Ethnically Split Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 1 (Xinhua) - U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Europe John Kornblum on Thursday paid a short visit to Mostar, to
press Bosnian Croats into ending their boycott of the newly-elected
city council.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum held separate talks with EU Administrator in Mostar Sir
Martin Garrod and Mijo Brajkovic, mayor of the Croat-held part of
Mostar and Safet Orucevic, mayor of Muslim-held part of the city.
</P>
<P>
ON June 30, elections were held for a unified city council but the
Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which lost to a Muslim coalition, has
refused to recognize the results because of alleged election
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted Kornblum as saying that the election results
should be the basis for forming municipal authorities in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum later flew back to Washington to join talks between U.S.
president Bill Clinton and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on whom
the United States pins the hope to end the Mostar crisis.
</P>
<P>
According local press reports, Brajkovic proposed a solution to the
political stalemate in Mostar in which both Muslim and Croats sides
will each hold only 16 seats of the city council, with the remaining
five vacant until the ruling by a court of the Muslim-Croat federation
on HDZ complaints.
</P>
<P>
Under the election rules, Muslims and Croats are given 16 seats
each, but the election victories of the Muslim coalition also enable
its representatives to take over the five seats reserved for other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Brajkovic also hinted Croats' support for Garrod, a Briton who
speaks Serb-Croat language, to be the temporary mayor of Mostar.

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands defeated
Britain 4-3 in the penalty strokes to take the bronze medal in
the Olympic women's hockey tournament here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
After both sides failed to score a single point in the
60-minute regulation, the penalty strokes were introduced with
five players of either side for the shoot-outs.
</P>
<P>
After tied 1-1, British goalkeeper Joanne Thompson blocked the
second stroke from the Dutch side, shedding light for a hopeful
third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
However, Stelle de Heij revenged for a tit-for-tat by palming
off the second stroke from her British stroker Karen Brown to keep
the Netherlands alive 1-1 after two strokes.
</P>
<P>
Deadlocked 2-2 and 3-3, Thompson was slow in response to the
fifth stroke from the Netherlands, while de Heij repeated her feat
by blocking off the last stroke from Kathryn Johnson for their
final victory of 4-3.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Cannot Extradite Citizens to Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Justice Minister
Marko Arsovic said today the Serb authority could not extradite
its citizens to U.N. war tribunal without amending the Serb
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a news conference in Belgrade following
a four-day visit to the Hague-based tribunal, heading a Serb
delegation, which held several rounds of talks with tribunal's
officials.
</P>
<P>
Serb Deputy Justice Minister Goran Neskovic, a member of the
delegation, told reporters at the same press conference that
Radovan Karadzic, the former Serb president who resigned two weeks
ago, and Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, both have been
indicted as war criminals by the war tribunal, could not be
extradited to the tribunal since there was no legal basis for
their extradition.
</P>
<P>
International community has demanded that all the indicted war
criminals must be arrested and tried by the international
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Neskovic said the indictment against Karadzic and Mladic was
unfounded and added that extradition could be carried out only on
the basis of a law and that such a law could be adopted only by
the assembly of the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina which would be
formed after the September 14 elections.
</P>
<P>
Neskovic said he doubted that the union would pass such a bill
because Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic would probably be
indicted for war crimes under the law.
</P>
<P>
Legal proceedings had been initiated in Serb city Banja Luka
against Izetbegovic, he said, and an indictment will be issued
against Izetbegovic after an investigation was finalized before
elections,.
</P>
<P>
Neskovic said that tribunal officials would visit Banja Luka
this month to examine material evidence and meet witnesses who
will testify on crimes committed by the Muslim army against the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade lawyer Igor Pantelic, who was a member of the Serb
delegation, said that preparations were being made for proceedings
against one Croat and three Muslims for war crimes committed in
the camp of Celebich in southern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 75 people in the former Yugoslavia have been
indicted as war criminals by the international tribunal, of whom
54 are Serbs, 18 Croats and three Muslims. So far only a few have
been taken under custody by the tribunal as neither of the
conflicting parties in the region were cooperating in this regard.

<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoliang followed Deng
Yaping's singles-doubles glory by beating Wang Tao in five sets in
an all-Chinese men's table tennis singles final at the Olympic
Games here Thursday afternoon.
</P>

</P>
<P>
With Wang known for coming in form slowly, Liu took the first
set with heavy forehand smashes and lightning counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>

loops and backhand flicks.
</P>
<P>

world championships last year, took lead again after Wang choked
in the crucial points in the third set.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb entity Republika
Srpska said today a total of 1,156 Serb soldiers and 808 civilians
are still missing due to the 43-month civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Serb state commission for the exchange of prisoners of war
and missing persons said in Banja Luka, Serb city in northwestern
Bosnia, that most of these people went missing in western parts of
the Republika Srpska territory which were seized in the 1995 by
joint Muslim-Croat forces during their large-scale offensives.

<P>
A total of 695 Serb soldiers have so far been released from
prisons in the Muslim-Croat federation 808 bodies of Serb fighters
have been handed over to the Republika Srpska, Tanjug news agency
reported from Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Although the Dayton agreement deadline for the exchange of pows
expired in January 19, there are still 28 Serb soldiers in Croat
and Muslim prisons, the Serb commission said. The remaining
missing persons are believed to have been killed and buried in
about 40 mass graves in the Muslim-Croat federation.

<HEADLINE> More Powerful Portable PCs to Hit Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The sale of portable computers
will grow twice as fast as those of desktops this year, and could
account for a third of the PC market by the end of the decade,
according to the latest issue of PC Magazine.
</P>
<P>
To meet surging demand, manufacturers are producing a broad
range of machines that have big screens, fast processors, CD-Rom's
and lighter weight.
</P>
<P>
In its August cover story, PC Magazine examines 58 Pentium
class notebooks in four categories: presentation class notebooks,
high-end, low-end and lightweights (under five pounds).
</P>
<P>
IBM ThinkPads took two of the top spots in the rankings, -- the
760ED won for best presentation-class machine and the 560 model
was named top lightweight.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reports that the latest portables provide users
with nearly all the muscle of the most powerful desktops --
although they are still a long way from offering the 200-MHz
Pentium. Widely available now are Pentium/133-MHz machines with
12.1-inch displays, 28.8-Kbps V.34 modems, CD-ROM, 1.3GB hard
drive, 64-bit graphics and SVGA resolution.
</P>
<P>
The market values of the machines range from 2,599 to 7,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since its last evaluation of notebooks in January, PC Magazine
has found a number of developments. Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
-- Displays are bigger and better as over two-thirds of the 58
machines examined have graduated to SVGA (800 by 600 pixels) while
some machines deliver even more: The Toshiba Tecra offers XVGA
(1,024 by 768 pixels) on its 12.1 inch display. Looking to the
future, PC Magazine predicts that displays will be stretched to
13.8 inches in 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- Hard disks are showing a steady increase in capacity.
Currently, 12.7-mm drives can store 810MB of data while 17-mm have
risen to 1.2GB. Looking ahead, PC Magazine predicts that at least
one vendor could offer 5GB of capacity by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
-- Battery power is increasing by about 10 percent a year, with
some growing faster.

<HEADLINE> China Captures Fifth Place in Women's Handball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China defeated Germany 28-26 to
win the fifth place in the women's handball tournament here today
at the 26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players scored the first goal and jumped out to an
early lead of 8-4 in the 15th minute. The Germans fired up and
played more aggressively, but the Chinese kept their advantage,
finishing the first half 16-12.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Germans made several surges at the
Chinese lead, trailing only one goal with 1:50 to go. But China's
top scorer Shi Wei scored the last goal of the match in a panelty
shot with 1:33 to go, securing her team's victory.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wei led the Chinese players with 12 goals and her teammate
Zhai Chao added another 10 to upset the Germans, who finished the
fourth at last Olympics and fifth at the 1995 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with my performance, especially because Germany
is stronger and more experienced," said Shi Wei. "I am so very
happy with how we did today."
</P>
<P>
Germany's top scorer Eike Bram scored seven goals and her
teammate Marlies Waelzer, five, in the classification game that
determined the fifth and sixth places in women's handball at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't need to loose this game. We missed a lot of shooting
situations," said Michaela Erler, captain of the German team. "Our
goal was to get into the semi-finals and we did not accomplish
that."
</P>
<P>
With China winning the fifth place, Germany picked up the sixth
place. In another classification game played earlier today, Angola
beat the United States to win the seventh place, leaving the
winless United States finishing at the bottom of the tournament.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street staged a
broad advance today as long-term rates eased to their lowest level
in two months after new indications of moderate economic growth
calmed inflation worries.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 65.84 to 5,594.75.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly an 11-to-3
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with volume totalling
438.94 million shares as against 402.52 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 5.08 to 347.78, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.06 to 650.01.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose a marked 18.22 to 1,098.81, and
the American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 4.62 to
544.12.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market measures rallied with the bond market after a July
survey of industrial purchasing managers revealed
weaker-than-expected growth in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The news suggested to stock and bond investors that growth
remains at s levels not likely to aggravate inflation and prompt
the Federal Reserve to raise its lending rates to slow the
nation's consumer and corporate business activity.
</P>
<P>
After the report, long-term bond prices shot higher, pushing
the yield on the 30-year Treasury down to 6.83 percent, the lowest
level since late May.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report this morning, the Commerce Department said
the nation's economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate last
quarter, the fastest pace in two years.

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United States
advanced Thursday to the men's singles final by beating Leander
Paes of India 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in the Olympic men's tennis
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The American star will go for the gold Saturday against
Spaniard Sergi Bruguera, who defeated Fernando Meligeni of Brazil
7-6 (11-9), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Paes faces Meligeni for the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the women's final Friday, Lindsay Davenport of the United
States will play Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had more difficulty than expected against Paes, a
wild-card entry ranked No. 127.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Agassi faced double set point serving at 5-6,
15-40 in the opening set, but Paes hit a return long and pushed an
easy volley wide. Agassi hit three baseline winners in the
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Paes erased six break points before floating
a volley long to give Agassi a 5-3 lead. On match point, Paes hit
a forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, a two-time French Open champion, took advantage of 36
unforced errors by Meligeni. The Brazilian reached double set
point with a 6-4 lead in the tiebreaker, but he double-faulted and
hit a backhand long.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera then raced to a 4-0 lead in the second set. When the

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of "Super" Aids Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A super-strain of the Aids virus,
said to be of particular danger to heterosexuals, has spread from
Thailand and America to Britain, a report says today.
</P>
<P>
The subtype E variant of HIV is endemic in Asia, where most
HIV-positive people are heterosexual, leading scientists to
suspect that it may be spread preferentially by heterosexual
contact.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, most cases of HIV to date have been caused by
subtype B, which has predominantly infected homosexual men. The
report in New Scientist warns that researchers at the Public
Health Laboratory Service are unable to assess the full extent of
its spread because of a lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
Since John Clewely, head of molecular biology at the
laboratory, in north London, announced Britain's first case of
subtype E on May 25, scientists there have identified a further 72
cases.
</P>
<P>
The new cases - 60 men and 12 women - are thought to have
caught subtype E from sexual contact in Thailand, or from partners
who had visited Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Evidence supporting heterosexual spread preference includes
research by Max Essex of the Harvard School of Public Health. He
has found that the strain is more adept at infecting cells lining
the vagina and tip of the penis than other subtypes.
</P>
<P>
About 19 percent of the 25,000-plus HIV cases in Britain are
thought to have been contracted through heterosexual contact.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say they need to carry out large subtype tests on a
random sample of HIV positive people to assess the true spread of
subtype E, rather than the present two random sample tests a
month.
</P>
<P>
Dr Clewly is asking the Department of Health and the Medical
Research Council for funds to expand the testing program.

<HEADLINE> Date Change 2000 Task Force Set up in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 will bring chaos for
businesses which depend on computer systems, unless management
takes early action, a press notice by Britain's Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) released here today warned.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Ian Taylor, Science and Technology Minister as saying
"this serious problem can affect any business, large or small,
using computer systems installed a few years ago or adapted from
older systems."
</P>
<P>
Computer programs used to represent the year by two digits
instead of four - so 1996 would be caught as "96". This will all
go dreadfully wrong when we reach the year 2000, it added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a Task Force was set up by the
Confederation of British Industry and the Computing Services and
Software Association, to co-ordinate actions to alert UK
businesses to the threat and to help them cope with it.
</P>
<P>
All businesses with computer systems rely on their systems to
function properly. If the computer system fails, the business may
fail too. Ian Taylor said: "The Task Force will have A vital role
to play in helping companies to avoid such failures."
</P>
<P>
The first objective of the Task Force is to achieve 100 percent
awareness and commitment from main board level executives by end
March 1977, according to the press notice.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal the Task Force will develop a
communication and education program which will include a helpline,
newsletter, a world wide web Internet site, workshops, conferences
and videos.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force is keen to work with other organizations which
are tackling the problem of the century date change. To reach the
target audience of companies across the UK will require effort by
suppliers, user interest groups and business support organizations
and Government.
</P>
<P>
Robin Guenier, Executive Director of the Task Force states
"systems that are not fixed in time will fail. This could well
lead to business failure with serious social consequences."
</P>
<P>
"It is a crucially important matter and it is essentially a
management issue: about resources, time, people and priorities,"
Guenier added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women Having Babies Later in Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Canadian women are having babies
later in life than their mothers did, according to Statistics
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The number of women becoming pregnant in their teens and 20s
fell between 1974 and 1992. But the number of pregnancies among
women in their 30s climbed steadily.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, 8 percent of women became pregnant for the first time
in their 30s. The figure climbed to 26.6 percent in 1992, the
federal fact-gathering agency said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The change shows social and economic considerations are forcing
Canadian women to delay having babies.
</P>
<P>
Women wait until they have finished their educations. Then they
wait until they've established a career, and have some savings.
Then they're debating about lost lifestyle and losing ground in
the workplace while they're away having a baby.
</P>
<P>
By the time women get to the let's-get-a-baby stage, they're
already in their 30s, said Wayne Millar, one of the authors of the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows the number of miscarriages and
stillbirths fell in Canada, from 9 percent of all pregnancies to 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
And the number of abortions in the country climbed. In 1972, 12
percent of all pregnancies ended in abortion. By 1992, the number
rose to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though teenage pregnancies are less common today than in the
mid 1970s, 4.2 percent of all female teenagers still got pregnant
in 1992, which translates into over 39,000 teenage pregnancies in
Canada that year, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> US to Issue New Rules to Cut Pollution by Watercraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW York, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is expected to issue new rules this week that
for the first time would fight pollution from watercraft ranging
from jet skis to yachts, according to a local media report.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which are designed to cut emission of
hydrocarbons by 75 percent, represent the latest attempt by the
Agency to fight other sources of pollution like motorboats. The
emission levels of the automobile have declined 90 percent since
1975, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Marine engines contribute only three percent of total pollution
annually, but they account for a higher percentage in the
summer-time in areas where boating is popular, including the
Middle West and the Northeast, where the contribution can
sometimes reach 10 to 15 percent of the total pollution.
</P>
<P>
The new rules, which will be phased in over 10 years, are
ushering in a new generation of engines, which have remained
unchanged since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The new type cleaner, four-stroke engine will emit less of the
unpleasant smoky blue haze. They are expected to be at least 30
percent more fuel efficient.
</P>
<P>
The rules center on smaller, two-stroke outboard motors which
have a tendency not to burn their fuel fully, resulting in dirty
exhaust. Running such an outboat motor for one hour releases the
same amount of smog producing pollutants as driving a car 800
miles, according to the E.P.A..

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Agricultural Sector Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Total transformation of the
agricultural sector is the most immediate challenge facing
agricultural development in Nigeria, particularly when food
security is concerned, the federal government said today.
</P>
<P>
For greater food security in the country, efforts must be made
to modernize agricultural tools, seeds and seedlings, storage and
processing systems as well as the entire farming system itself,
said Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, who is also
vice chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council.
</P>
<P>
Declaring open a three-day workshop in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, Diya said food production in the country has to be
sustained and improved because of the huge exports of the
country's produce to neighboring west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Food is assuming an important role in international politics,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge food exports, Nigeria is on the threshold of
food sufficiency, said Diya, pointing out that it is noteworthy
that an aggregate agricultural growth rate of 3.2 percent was
recorded last year in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a paper on the position of the country is
expected to come out at the end of the workshop for the summit of
heads of state and government to be convened by the Food and
Agriculture Organization in Rome, Italy from November 13 to 17.

LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said today 40 persons were
arrested here last month by the Special Fraud Unit (SFU) of the
Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (FIIB) with the
help of information provided by U. S. Secret Services (U. S.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: France Seeks New Beginning of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette today announced in Algiers that a series of
inter-ministerial meetings will be held by France and Algeria to
solve some remaining problems existing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The problems include the suspension of use by Algeria's
national carrier Air Algeria of the Orly international airport in
Paris and restrictions on visa issuing to Algerian citizens by
France.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France wants to increase trade with and investments
in Algeria, with France being its largest trade and financial
partner.
</P>
<P>
During the visit which began on Wednesday and ended today, De
Charette also paid a visit to the tombs of seven French Trappist
monks killed by Algerian Islamist extremists two months ago and
buried in a monastery 60 kilometers southwest of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the purpose of the visit by de Charette
to Algiers, the first by a French foreign minister in three years,
is to seek a new beginning of relations between the two
historically closely-tied countries.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, de
Charette handed over a letter from President Jacques Chirac, whose
content was described by French officials as "very cordial".
</P>
<P>
But de Charette ruled out the possibility of a meeting between
the presidents in near future.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said that the visit by de
Charette came at a good moment to relaunch bilateral relations
while fully grasping the problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the two foreign ministers, high-level foreign
ministry officials of the two countries will start meeting
regularly, while the finance ministers of the two countries will
meet "as soon as possible" to sign a new financial protocol.
</P>
<P>
France, which provides a yearly aid of 6 billion francs (1.2
billion U.S. dollars) to Algeria, will support its big, medium and
small enterprises to invest in Algeria, said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France would "improve the conditions of
deliverance" of visas to Algerian, but he also called on Algeria
to understand France's worries on the issue, which include
security for consul agents issuing visas and the influx of
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
France transferred the center for issuing visas for Algerians to
Nante in 1994 for security reasons, but Algeria complained that
the number of visas issued have dropped greatly since.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of the use by Air Algeria of the Orly airport,
de Charette said that the issue will be discussed by experts of
the two countries within the shortest time possible.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria has suspended its service in Paris for one year
after refusing to transfer to the Roissy airport from the Orly
airport. France cited airport congestion and security as reasons
for the transfer, but Algeria called it a discriminatory
measure.
</P>
<P>
De Charette was very cautious about commenting on the internal
situation of Algeria, which has been entangled in violence taking
the lives of some 50,000 people since 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said that the question of violence has enhanced the sense of
responsibility of the Algerian people and Algerian leaders, and
France "does not have the intention to be involved".
</P>
<P>
But he said that to maintain mutual respect does not mean stay
indifferent. "Between us, indifference is not possible," he said.
