EDITORIAL: PARTNER NOTIFICATION FOR HIV 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 9:
</P>
<P>
   A bill before the New York State Senate would notify spouses,
sex partners and needle-sharing partners of HIV-infected people of
their exposure to the virus. Notification is particularly important
as AIDS and HIV become more prevalent among women, minorities and
the young. There are too many cases where women and their babies
have become infected because husbands and boyfriends hid the truth.
The bill, sponsored by the Assembly member Nettie Mayersohn and
Senator Guy Velella, and supported by the New York State
Association of County Health Officials and the New York State
Medical Society, would give spouses and others access to crucial
information so that they can take steps to avoid infection.
</P>
<P>
   Current state law already allows doctors to notify partners or
ask local health authorities to do so. But doctors have neither the
time nor training to perform the task. Under the bill, they would
report cases to the state Health Department, and a public-health
worker would contact the patient for names of individuals who may
have been exposed. There would be no penalty for refusing to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The health worker is not allowed to reveal the identity of the
infected person. The partners would be told only that they have
been exposed to the virus and be given data about the disease. Such
reporting and notification would not apply in current anonymous
testing programs. This approach balances public-health imperatives
and patients' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Many patient advocates oppose the use of names for privacy
reasons, but using code numbers can be unreliable. Twenty-eight
states use name reporting, with no evidence that reporting has
caused a significant decline in testing rates. New Jersey has had
HIV reporting for six years with no breaches of confidentiality.
New York state has required reporting by name of full-fledged AIDS
cases for 15 years, with no loss of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The changing nature of the AIDS epidemic and effective new
treatments make it necessary to rethink the public-health response
to the disease. Partner notification is standard with other
communicable diseases such as syphilis. The people most at risk for
AIDS have a right to information that could prolong their lives and
prevent them from unknowingly spreading HIV to others.

 0609 &HT;    Braves score 6 in bottom of 9th to beat Red Sox
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even Leo Mazzone, a man never at a loss for words,
couldn't explain this one. The Braves pitching coach, with a
toothbrush jammed between his teeth, just shrugged and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a ninth inning Monday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has written a book this decade on comebacks,
there have been few better than this one, the Braves scoring six
runs in the final frame to knock out the Boston Red Sox 7-6 before
44,018.
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves needed just one out to do their damage, most of
it coming against who has been the hottest reliever in baseball and
against a team that has been one of the American League's best. The
winning run came across when Andruw Jones drove a ball into left to
score Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And who said interleague play wasn't going to be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal,'' said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones.
``This has to be our No. 1 comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a giddy general manager John Schuerholz, ``That's
incredible, it's really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   It's was such a great comeback that even the Elias Sports Bureau
said they need a day to research it to find out whether it is the
biggest deficit the Braves have ever overcome in the ninth to win a
game.
</P>
<P>
   But this game was lost, the Braves down 6-1 going into the ninth
as it appeared Tom Glavine would lose for the first time in a month
and Red Sox starter Derek Lowe would win his first game of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But as Braves manager Bobby Cox pointed out, ``Everything that
didn't fall in all night seemed to fall in in one inning.``
</P>
<P>
   The ninth started with Tom Gordon walking to the mound. He has a
major-league-leading 19 saves, had allowed just four runs all
season. But he made a big mistake when he opened the inning by
walking pinch hitter Ozzie Guillen and Walt Weiss. Keith Lockhart
then singled in the first run, Chipper Jones following with another
RBI hit. Gordon was lifted for John Wasdin and Andres Galarraga
launched a ball to left-center to score two on a double. Still, no
outs and up came Ryan Klesko, who tied the game on a hit to left,
his second RBI-single of the night to the opposite field. Then Javy
Lopez moved Williams, who had come in to run for Klesko, to second
on a bunt. Michael Tucker was intentionally walked and on came
Andruw Jones for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't going to let Michael Tucker beat them,'' said the
center fielder. ``We never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other clubhouse was numb, the Braves stinging a
team that has so many Atlanta and Georgia Tech connections.
</P>
<P>
   Said Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, ``It's a nine-inning game.
They're good.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cox, ``How do you figure out this game sometimes?''

COSMETICS EXECUTIVES PLEDGE $1 MILLION TO A BRONX HIGH SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The competition among New York City's elite public
high schools has always been fierce, especially when academic
bragging rights have been on the line. But lately, the jousting has
moved from the classroom into the fund-raising arena.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months after alumni pledged to create a $10
million endowment for Brooklyn Technical High School, Leonard and
Ronald Lauder said Monday that they would donate as much as $1
million to a campaign seeking to raise $10 million on behalf of
their alma mater, the Bronx High School of Science. Leonard Lauder,
chairman and chief executive of Estee Lauder Cos., the cosmetics
concern, is a 1950 graduate of the school; his brother Ronald,
chairman of Estee Lauder International and a former U.S. ambassador
to Austria, graduated in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other public school in the United States, Walnut Hills
High School in Cincinnati, is believed to have set a more ambitious
target _ $12 million for a new science center.
</P>
<P>
   At Bronx Science, alumni leaders said, the investment income
from the endowment _ potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars a
year _ would be used to upgrade computer equipment and
laboratories, provide supplemental course materials and renovate
antiquated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the endowment fund, Milton Kopelman, a
former principal of Bronx Science, said the group also hoped to use
the money to hire teachers to reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   That could set up a showdown with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Crew spurned the efforts of parents at a Greenwich
Village elementary school to raise $46,000 to hire an additional
fourth-grade teacher so that all fourth-grade classes would be
smaller. While Crew has said that he has no quarrel with parents or
outsiders spending money on fringe items _ like computers or
teacher training _ he said that class size must be determined by
the school system's budget.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Crew, Chiara Coletti, quoted the chancellor as
saying he was ``touched and deeply grateful'' to the Lauders. Asked
if she expected the class-size reduction issue to be a source of
friction, Ms. Coletti said that the chancellor was not familiar
with the details of the gift but had ``complete faith'' that the
alumni ``will choose to use the endowment in the most equitable and
creative way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 60-year-old high school in the northwest Bronx _ which,
like its rivals Brooklyn Tech and Stuyvesant High School, admits
students using a stiff entrance examination _ word of the Lauders'
donation has already lit a fire under other alumni: Since a
kick-off event for the endowment on May 28, Kopelman said, other
graduates have contributed $400,000 to match the Lauders' pledge.
(The endowment will receive the full $1 million from the Lauders,
Kopelman said, once $1 million in matching donations have been
pledged.)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Leonard Lauder said he hoped the money would
influence others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you raise the bar of excellence,'' he said, ``it
brings everyone else along with it. If it weren't for the Bronx
Sciences, the Brooklyn Techs, the Stuyvesants and the Hunters over
the years, the New York City school system and indeed the entire
New York State Regents system wouldn't have the high standards they
have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Lauder estimated that his family and its companies had
probably contributed upwards of $1 million, ``quietly,'' to the
system as a whole over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when countless other city public schools are
suffering from decades of fiscal neglect, the Lauders' largesse, as
well as the fund-raising efforts at Brooklyn Tech and elsewhere,
raise lingering questions about equity throughout a school system
of 1,100 schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most schools don't have a monied alumni and don't have monied
parents,'' said Noreen Connell, the executive director of the
Educational Priorities Panel, a coalition of 25 civic organizations
that monitors city school spending.
</P>
<P>
   Such gifts, Ms. Connell added, also continue to blur the lines
between public and private education, tempting school systems to
shift resources away from the most richly endowed schools,
confident that the private sector will fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't begrudge them trying to help out plugging holes in the
city budget,'' she said, noting that just five years ago Bronx
Science was so starved for money that its students were playing
violins without backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sad thing is,'' Ms. Connell added, ``that the more
parents and alumni fill in the gaps, the more the city assumes the
funding is there and the city doesn't have to provide the money.''

GUILTY PLEA IN N.J. DRUG RING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The leader of what had seemed to be a
civic-minded group of entrepreneurs known as the Zoo Crew pleaded
guilty Monday to a federal drug- trafficking conspiracy charge,
admitting that his clothing boutique, florist shop, carry-out
restaurant and auto supply store were actually fronts for an
elaborate drug distribution ring.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, Terrance Dent, 30, of Edison, N.J., pleaded guilty
in U.S. District Court to possessing and conspiring to distribute
more than 150 kilograms of cocaine. Under federal sentencing
guidelines, he faces a minimum of 10 years in prison, a maximum of
life imprisonment and a fine of $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two men identified as Dent's top lieutenants and a dozen other
co-conspirators have also pleaded guilty to related drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veneer was stripped away further from the Zoo Crew today
when its leader, a drug dealer who spent months on the run as a
fugitive from justice, admitted his role in cocaine and heroin
trafficking,'' Faith Hochberg, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   To many in the poor neighborhoods of Newark, the members of the
Zoo Crew appeared to be industrious, generous and appealing,
bringing new businesses to depressed areas, leading protests
against police brutality and donating money to provide basketball
clinics for children. The group's headquarters on Clinton Avenue
was a popular clothing boutique, Zoo Sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators like John Coleman, the special agent in charge
of the New Jersey office of the Drug Enforcement Agency, described
the Zoo Crew as ``almost a drug supermarket operation,'' in which
narcotics were brought wholesale from New York and supplied rapidly
to street dealers through a network of drivers. Investigators said
the crew was responsible for millions of dollars in cocaine and
heroin sales in New Jersey, North Carolina and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other fronts for the drug operation included a florist shop, Zoo
Flowers; a take-out restaurant called Boney's Place and an auto
supply store called Get Wise.
</P>
<P>
   Dent also admitted to conducting a number of telephone
conversations as part of the drug distribution operation, including
conversations with his brother, Laquan Dent, who, together with
another suspect, Jamal Howard, is scheduled to be tried on related
drug charges in September.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Terrance Dent, his lieutenants and the 12 other
co-defendants who have pleaded in the Zoo Crew conspiracy, five
other suspects have pleaded guilty as drug dealers who worked for
the Zoo Crew and a sixth defendant was convicted of a heroin
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the alleged members of the Zoo Crew were arrested and
indicted last August. But Dent went into hiding and remained a
fugitive for five months until his arrest in March in the Bronx.

STUDY FINDS AT-HOME PARENTS LIVE LONGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new longevity study might make sense to anyone
with an obnoxious boss but surprise the parent of a typically
rambunctious 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of apes, monkeys and humans, the research shows
that a parent who assumes primary responsibility in child rearing
will tend to outlive his or her spouse, California Institute of
Technology researchers announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But a word of caution for humans: It probably doesn't matter
whether a wife goes to work and the husband stays home with the
kids. The man pretty much is doomed by genetics, the study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural selection will evolve mechanisms that protect the
caretaking sex relative to the other sex,'' said John Allman, a
Caltech biology professor who is lead author of the study,
published in this month's Proceedings of the National Academy of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Natural selection has ensured a long life for the primary
caregiver simply to ensure the infant's survival, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 10 primate species, the research shows that the
infant's primary caregiver lives ``significantly'' longer than the
male. This is true in some species when the male is the caregiver,
as evidenced by South America's titi monkeys. Male titis outlive
their mates by 20 percent, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Among humans, women's lives are 8 percent to 10 percent longer
than men's, according to Allman. His human research was based on
Swedish census data, which goes back as far as the 18th century, he
said. He noted that women outlived men even in 1780, when
childbirth was a leading cause of death among females.
</P>
<P>
   While genetics involved in the child-rearing theory seem the
single most logical explanation, other factors may also play a
role, Allman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Risk-taking in males and estrogen in females are probably
factors, and there may even be a beneficial hormonal or chemical
change that occurs through extending care to another,'' Allman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stay-at-home parents also insist the lack of stress has to count
for something in the life span department. Given the realities of
9-to-5 employment, stay-at-home parents say, it's nice to know the
only childish behavior you have to deal with is your children's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jokingly tell people I plan to live to be 100 years old,''
said Casey Spencer, 46, of nearby Glendale, who runs Dad-to-Dad of
Los Angeles, a group of stay-at-home fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Spencer quit his job as a professional
photographer to take care of his 3-year-old daughter full-time. His
wife is a theme park executive. ``My wife is the high-stress one,''
he said. ``She puts in more hours, she probably has higher blood
pressure. I fear that I will outlive her.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that raising a child full-time doesn't have life-shortening
annoyances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised they don't live shorter (than their spouses),''
said Barry Reszel of Libertyville, Ill., who edits the At-Home Dad
Handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Reszel was kidding. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I don't stay at home,'' said Bernice Stewart, a
46-year-old Woodland Hills secretary who puts her 6-year-old girl
in child care. ``If I did I'd probably drop dead in five years.''

PHONE MERGER SHOULD INCLUDE RATE CUT, CONNECTICUT OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ The merger between Connecticut's primary
telephone company and a Texas-based telecommunications giant should
not be approved unless it includes a substantial rate reduction,
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.4 billion deal that would allow SBC Communications of San
Antonio to acquire Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. of
New Haven was announced in January, but hearings by the state
Department of Public Utility Control on whether to allow the deal
to go forward started Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale is completed, it would introduce a new player into
the state's efforts to deregulate the local telephone market, which
has been an SNET monopoly for at least 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been said that this is a good deal, but the question
is, a good deal for whom?'' Blumenthal said Monday morning, adding
later that he did not oppose the merger, but simply wanted
consumers to get their fair share.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two companies have said the deal would improve each
company's financial prospects, they have declined to include any
rate reduction for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal estimated that SBC would gain $220 million in savings
and added revenues from the merger, and that half of that should go
back to consumers in rate reductions that would reduce a typical
monthly bill by about $4.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Whitacre Jr., SBC's chief executive, told The New
Haven Register last week that such a rate reduction would be a
``financial disaster'' for his company. ``We would not do the deal
under those terms,'' Whitacre said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Monday, executives from SBC and SNET said that
SNET was already losing money on its local telephone service and
that Blumenthal's figures were wrong. A rate cut, they added, would
discourage new companies from entering the deregulated local
telephone market.
</P>
<P>
   And the companies' officials also charged that state law did not
permit the Department of Public Utility Control to order a rate
reduction as part of a merger approval. The department will make a
ruling later this year, and federal regulators are also reviewing
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when SBC acquired Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco
last year, it agreed to refund $214 million to consumers, in return
for approval of the merger by California regulators. Selim Bingol,
a SBC spokesman, said that Connecticut's rules do not allow state
regulators to make the same deal, a point Blumenthal disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that SBC's position may come from its desire to
limit the cost of another business deal _ the $62-billion purchase
of the Midwestern phone company, Ameritech. That deal must still be
approved by Illinois regulators, who may be influenced by how
Connecticut addresses the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can easily become a situation where a certain political
dynamic takes over,'' said Eli Noam, director of Columbia
University's Institute for Tele-Information. ``If Connecticut rolls
back rates, other state regulators will be asked, `How come you
didn't do the same?' You create a dynamic where it is hard for any
commission to do less.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC, one of the eight ``Baby Bells'' created by the breakup of
AT&AMP;T, has about 34 million customers in California, Texas, Nevada
and other states, but no customer base for local telephone service
in the Northeast. SNET has about 2.2 million customers in
Connecticut.

CANDIOTTI RETURNS AS VISITOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After six seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers,
knuckleballer Tom Candiotti returned to Dodger Stadium for the
first time Monday as a member of the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti, 4-7 with a 5.20 ERA for the last-place A's, was
warmly greeted by executive vice president Fred Claire, who had
offered Candiotti a spot in the Dodgers bullpen for this season but
couldn't guarantee a place in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lots of fun here, playing every night in front of
150,000 people,'' Candiotti said. ``But I like where I am. When I
got here (1992), Darryl Strawberry and Eric Davis had bad years and
we finished last. But Eric Karros got his start that year and then
it was (Mike) Piazza, (Raul) Mondesi and all the Rookies of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're getting started in Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti said National League fans might not know much about
right fielder Ben Grieve, shortstop Miguel Tejada or injured center
fielder Jason McDonald, but they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't household names,'' Candiotti said. ``But they come
to play every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti, 40, wishes he could say the same. He left Sunday's
start against Arizona after one inning because of back spasms.
Candiotti underwent treatment Monday and said he expects to make
his next start.
</P>
<P>
   __ McMichael arrives: Reliever Greg McMichael, part of last
Thursday's Hideo Nomo trade with the Mets, joined the club Monday.
The day of the trade, McMichael returned to his home in Atlanta,
where wife Jennifer went into premature labor. She was not due
until August. Doctors corrected the situation.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for McMichael on the roster, the Dodgers optioned
reliever Eric Weaver to Triple-A Albuquerque. Weaver pitched four
innings and allowed one run in two appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki, the other member of the Mets to join the Dodgers,
reported Friday and started Saturday's game. Despite a poor showing
against Seattle, Mlicki is expected to start Friday's series opener
against Colorado at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   __ Luke claimed: First baseman/outfielder Matt Luke was claimed
off waivers by the Cleveland Indians. Luke, who didn't look to get
much playing time after the Dodgers acquired Jim Eisenreich, was
designated for assignment May 29. The Dodgers had seven days to
trade Luke, who batted .286 with three homers and 11 RBI in 33
games. When that didn't happen, he was placed on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Third baseman Bobby Bonilla returned to the
lineup after missing two games with the flu. He struck out swinging
his first two at-bats.... Scott Spiezio's first-inning single
extended his hitting streak to 17 games, two short of the American
League-season high set by Detroit's Damion Easley.

COLUMN: A CITY IN SEARCH OF AN ANTHEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's start by spreading the news, which is not
really that new.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Frank Sinatra died last month, the City Council
speaker, Peter Vallone, introduced a bill to make the singer's
version of ``New York, New York'' the city's official song. Mayor
Edward Koch did the same thing in a 1985 proclamation, but Council
action would give this anthem the weight of law.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been stranded on a remote island for two decades,
we're talking about the 1977 composition by John Kander and Fred
Ebb, the one that an aging Sinatra croaked into a signature song
heard everywhere from night clubs to ballparks. Steve Ross, the
cabaret singer, who has dozens of New York songs in his repertoire,
calls the opening notes _ da da da-de-dum _ ``probably the most
famous vamp of any popular song in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The music primes the pump,'' he said at a cafe on the Upper
West Side. ``It sets up this little buzz that all foreigners say
happens when they hit the airport here.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though Ross considered it a splendid number _ king of
the hill, top of the heap, if you will _ he also entertained a
question about whether this city could do better for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the lyrics. The fellow in the song isn't even a New
Yorker. He is an out-of-towner whose ``little town blues are
melting away'' only because he is about to go to New York ``and
make a brand new start of it.'' His focus is on wanting to ``wake
up in a city that doesn't sleep,'' to find he's king of the hill
and all that. ``If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bully for him. But why should New York's anthem be about the
ambitions of a self-absorbed arriviste? Shouldn't it be about the
wonders of the city itself, maybe with lyrics that reflect New York
sophistication and not just ``We're No. 1'' chest-thumping?
</P>
<P>
   A strong candidate, Ross agreed, would be ``N.Y.C.,'' from the
musical ``Annie.'' Besides having a great title, worthy of a
column, this paean to the city has a topical fillip, given recent
mayoral battles:
</P>
<P>
   ``N.Y.C., what is it about you? You're big, you're loud, you're
tough. N.Y.C., I go years without you, then I can't get enough.
Enough of cabdrivers answering back in language far from pure.
Enough of frankfurters answering back.'' And so on, down to the
fade-out: ``You snap, you fizz, the best there is is you, is
N.Y.C.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't bad,'' Ross said. Ditto for a clever number that he
favors: Cole Porter's ``I Happen to Like New York,'' which moves to
the finger-snap pace of a New York self-confident enough to
acknowledge its own imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to like New York,'' it begins. ``I happen to like
this town. I like the city air. I like to drink of it. The more I
know New York, the more I think of it. I like the sight and the
sound and even the stink of it.'' Definitely, a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Other New York songs are marvelous, though perhaps problematic
as anthems. ``Autumn in New York'' speaks lovingly of ``glittering
crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel.'' But an
underlying melancholy makes it unsuitable, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious candidate is ``New York, New York (It's a
Helluva Town),'' where the Bronx is up and the Battery's down.
``But it's too jazzy,'' the singer said. ``It's not simple and
straightforward enough for a good anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, he finds Billy Joel's ``New York State of Mind''
too discursive. The venerable ``Sidewalks of New York'' is dated.
Rodgers and Hart's ``Give It Back to the Indians'' is witty but
negative. And an array of tunes lose out because of their narrow
geographical focus, including songs you may love the melody of:
``42nd Street,'' ``Manhattan,'' ``Take the A Train,'' ``Lullaby of
Broadway'' and ``The 59th Street Bridge Song.''
</P>
<P>
   When you get down to it, Ross said, the Kander and Ebb number
may be about as good it gets. By now, it is known by everyone,
everywhere. ``If all else fails and I'm losing an audience,'' he
said, ``if I start that song, I can get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It may not say the ultimate thing that needs to be
said about New York. But people do seem to view New York as a
testing ground, and you have that in those powerful last words: `If
I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only other strong candidate happened to come from
outside the cafe where he was sitting. There it was, the true New
York anthem, ever present: a car alarm.

ABL NEEDS TV CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although it might appear the WNBA has all the
advantages to becoming the only women's professional basketball
league, the ABL isn't willing to give up. It was started by a group
of investors and runs its affairs its way and is confident its
demise is not in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the ABL has an edge in talent, although even ABL
officials admit the WNBA landed the majority of the top college
players who graduated in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL, however, pays better. Which means its players don't
have as much of a need to play overseas to complement their
incomes, as many WNBA players do. Also, the ABL boasts about its
winter schedule _ it plays basketball when basketball should be
played. The WNBA operates during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, girls were given access to the high school gym
only when the boys weren't using it, a situation some might compare
to the NBA-WNBA setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see women settle for playing in the summer,''
Long Beach Stingrays center/forward Cass Aure said. ``We fought for
equal opportunity. I don't think we should sell out. I'm not saying
the WNBA sold out. But if it comes down to one league, I don't want
to see it played in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going backward. We've come too far.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is how far will they go?
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges the ABL faces in its attempt to survive is
hanging onto its stars and landing a serious TV package. The league
already lost 1996-97 Most Valuable Player Nikki McCray, who jumped
to the WNBA. And star Dawn Staley of the Philadelphia Rage is
considering a move when her contract expires in August, which could
be damaging to a league that can't absorb too many punches.
</P>
<P>
   Will others follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   A lot could depend on television. Gary Cavalli, the ABL's
co-founder, admits that bringing his product to more people is the
top priority. Last season, 24 games were broadcast on Fox Sports
Net, 13 games on BET. Many were delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli is looking for a deal or deals to widen dramatically the
league's audience, possibly with coverage on both free and cable TV
like the WNBA, which is on NBC, ESPN and Lifetime. He said he's
negotiating with ``five different networks'' but wouldn't reveal
them. He said he expects to make an announcement by next month.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the talks could determine the fate of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder about some of the ABL sponsors, how long they'll
stick with it once their contracts expire,'' said Sharon Barbano,
president of the Women's Sports Marketing Group. ``... That's why,
unless (the ABL) gets a major TV package, I don't think they can
survive. The sponsors aren't going to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The response of ABL officials?
</P>
<P>
   If they'd listen to doubters from the beginning, they said, they
wouldn't be making plans for third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same people who believe only one league can
survive are the same people who didn't believe women's basketball
could take off in the first place,'' said Bill McGillis, general
manager of the Stingrays.

NIGERIAN DICTATOR DIES; SUCCESSOR QUICKLY NAMED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs updating, re-editing throughout) (Also see BC-NIGERIA-ASSESS-NYT, BC-ABACHA-OBIT-NYT,
BC-NIGERIA-OPPOSITION-NYT)

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, the dictator of Nigeria, whose ruthless
suppression of opponents, human rights and democracy led to
condemnation around the world and seething discontent at home, died
early on Monday. His defense chief of staff was quickly sworn in to
lead Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the death were sketchy, but American officials said
they had no evidence of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha had not left a clear successor, but Nigeria's top
military leaders convened and selected Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
apparently averting a protracted power struggle for leadership in
the oil-rich nation of 115 million, a country wracked by decades of
harsh, corrupt military governments and the effects of Western
sanctions imposed in a futile effort to hasten democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The swift selection of another military leader came in the face
of appeals by exiled Nigerians and world leaders in Washington,
London, Paris and other capitals, who said the general's death
heralded an opportunity for Nigeria to release hundreds of
political prisoners, cancel executions set by kangaroo courts and
restore civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha's death is not going to bring my father back,'' said
Ken Wiwa, the son of the playwright and environmental activist Ken
Saro-Wiwa, who, with eight other opponents of the general, was
publicly hanged for ``treason'' in 1995 while a worldwide
outpouring of appeals for mercy was icily ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright who won the 1986 Nobel
Prize for Literature, fled to exile in Paris in 1994 and was
recently charged in absentia with treason, said from Jerusalem that
the general's death was an ``incredible opportunity'' for Nigeria
to resurrect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House offered no comment, but the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, offered sympathy to Abacha's
family, reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to promoting democracy in
Nigeria, and urged a ``peaceful transition to civilian, democratic
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of rumors and confusion in which heavily armed
soldiers sealed off the general's compound in the capital, Abuja,
Abubakar announced in a brief communique that the 54-year-old
Nigerian leader, who had seized power in 1993, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in of Abubakar took place about 4 a.m. on Tuesday
Nigerian time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to all Nigerians to put all hands on deck to move our
nation forward,'' he said in a statement issued shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The communique did not specify the cause of death, but news
reports quoted family friends and Western diplomats as saying
Abacha had suffered a heart attack. Reports that his health was
failing circulated after he canceled a trip to Lagos, Nigeria's
principal city and former capital, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his first official acts, Abubakar declared seven days
of mourning for Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   But word of the death drew no outpouring of sorrow in Nigeria,
where the general had tamed political parties, trade unions and the
press, and had an enemies' list that read like a Who's Who of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is capable of wonderful things,'' an opposition political
figure in Lagos said from behind a screen of anonymity. ``Perhaps
Nigerians will be free at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, 55, was born in the northern Nigerian town of Minna
and later attended the Kaduna Technical Institute in 1963 before
enlisting in the air force.
</P>
<P>
   A career serviceman, he transferred to the army in 1975 and
received military training in the United States. In 1981 he served
with Nigerian troops assigned to a U.N. peacekeeping force in
Lebanon. He was appointed chief of the defense staff in 1993..
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar has not played a prominent political role, the BBC
reported. It said that although he is the highest officer
overseeing the army, navy and air force, he does not directly
command any large body of troops.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Kano, the northern city where Abacha was born in
1943, said thousands of people had lined the streets, awaiting the
arrival of the general's body and an escort of senior government
and military officials who were to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   There was a political vacuum on Monday in the absence of Abacha
_ who wielded absolute power for five and a half years and was so
haunted by the specter of a coup that he surrounded himself with a
2,000-member personal security force, rarely appeared in public and
jailed or executed many leading Nigerians who could form a credible
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The general's former second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Donaldson
Oladipo Diya, who had been seen as a possible successor, was
sentenced to death by a military tribunal in April for allegedly
plotting a coup. His fate is still in the hands of the military
junta.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria's leaders gathered in Abuja in a body called the
Provisional Ruling Council, the prospects appeared at first to be
for a behind-the-scenes struggle during the next few days to see
who would lead the government. Political experts said the likely
contenders to succeed the general included Abubakar; Lt. Gen.
Jeremiah Useni, Nigeria's senior officer, and Maj. Gen. Ishiaya
Bamaiyi, the army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, after his selection, was promoted from major general
to full general and was sworn in by Nigeria's chief justice,
Mohammed Uwais.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 45 Nigerian groups that had clandestinely opposed
Abacha called on Monday for the installation of a civilian
government headed by Moshood K.O. Abiola, who was imprisoned by
Abacha after his annulled election as president in 1993 in what was
widely seen as the country's most democratic vote since it gained
independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is a country of 250 tribal groups. The Hausa and Fulani in
the north, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Ibo in the southeast
make up 65 percent of the population. The 1960s were marked by a
struggle for political dominance among the main ethnic groups, and
a devastating civil war almost broke the country apart in the late
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s oil exports helped Nigeria recover
economically, and in the early 1980s, with a civilian government in
Lagos, Nigeria became known as a model of African democracy and
prosperity. Nigerian arts were the envy of the continent. Its press
was one of the freest anywhere. Nigerian diplomacy challenged the
United States and Britain over issues like apartheid. The nation's
currency was worth twice as much as the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy in Nigeria died in 1983, and Abacha, a career
soldier who became an infantryman at 18 and attended military
colleges in England, the United States and Nigeria, had a role in
three coups.
</P>
<P>
   The generals ousted Nigeria's last civilian government in 1983.
Hopes for a return to democracy were high in June 1993, when
Abiola, a millionaire businessman, won an election with pledges to
return Nigeria to civilian rule. But the government annulled the
vote, and three months later Abacha overthrew President Ibrahim
Babangida.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, frustrated over the victory that was stolen from him,
declared himself president in defiance of Abacha and was jailed on
treason charges. Abacha promised democratic reforms and an election
in 1996 to bring back civilian government, but the promises proved
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing that he was stretching his rule to 1998, Abacha
began a virtual reign of terror. He cracked down on all opposition,
subdued unions, took control of the press, jailed hundreds of
people and began a series of trials that sent opponents to prison
or the gallows.

GAILEY'S GOAL IN 1998: NO VANILLA IN COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Chan Gailey came seemingly from nowhere, an offensive
coordinator from the Pittsburgh Steelers who had quietly but
efficiently done his job. A man of strong character and stout
religious background who in his football travels had never left a
place where his return would not be welcomed. An offensive guru, an
imaginative, cutting-edge offensive mind, a 46-year-old Georgian
who in his football travels had been a special teams coach, a
defensive coordinator, an offensive coordinator and a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   And now Gailey has been told to take this job and shove this
team, this franchise, back where it believes it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey got the Dallas head coaching job that appeared to be
Terry Donahue's, the former UCLA coach, the job that Sherman Lewis
from Green Bay seemed suited for, the job that several others
appeared in line for miles before him. The task of taking the
Dallas Cowboys star and polishing it and making it shine once
again.
</P>
<P>
   He is head coach of a team that is removed from its startling
success in this decade: Three Super Bowl championships, five
consecutive National Conference East division titles and a six-year
playoff run. All of that came to a draining, spinning, reeling halt
last season when the Cowboys finished 6-10, lost its last five
games, missed the playoffs and, in many circles, became the brunt
of cruel jokes throughout the league and beyond for its mishaps in
character off the field as much as for its demise on it.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, the Cowboy owner, met Gailey last February at the
scouting combine in Indianapolis on a Sunday afternoon and by
Thursday afternoon they were talking money and contracts and how to
fix what was broken in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him,'' Jones said, ``I sat up straight. By
the time I finished talking with him, I was on the edge of my
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey fit. He could redesign the Cowboys predictable offense.
He could work with quarterback Troy Aikman. He had head coaching
experience. And he could, in his prescience alone, offer a sort of
moral character and fiber from the top that the Dallas players,
especially the young ones, certainly needed.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the cowboys conducted minicamp here last week, Gailey
started the makeover firsthand with the entire week.
</P>
<P>
   ``From afar, I saw a team that looked like it was having
problems,'' Gailey said of the Cowboys, now his Cowboys. ``And that
is as far as I went with it because I was having enough problems of
my own getting the Pittsburgh offense where we wanted it to be
instead of spending time judging someone else. When someone is at
the top, you want to bring them down, knock them down to your
level. That is the nature of pro football and the nature of some
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey grew up in Americus, Ga., the hometown of Dan Reeves, the
former Cowboy player and assistant coach who is now coach and
general manager of the Atlanta Falcons. It was Reeves who gave
Gailey his start as a pro coach when he hired him to tutor special
teams for the Denver Broncos in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys were bigger than life to me as a kid,'' Gailey
said. ``A team involved in so many championships. A team that had
Dan, who was one of our own. You can't perceive on the outside just
how strong the history is here, how much pride they have and how
much responsibility goes with being a Dallas Cowboy. And it's not
just a local thing. This is a worldwide entity.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is one that Gailey must fix to survive as boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the person that I am,'' Gailey said. ``Naive?
If I'm naive, I'm naive. I'm going to do what is right. I'm going
to treat people the way they want to be treated. It used to be that
drawing the line with a player was easy but it gets harder today to
find that line. I'm worried about that guy and his family and his
friends and his grandchildren down the road. My responsibility,
totally? No. But I am partially responsible for all of that being
his head coach. I am responsible, too, for winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh the last two seasons, Gailey led an offense that
finished ranked No. 2 in the NFL in rushing in 1996 in and No. 1 in
'97. Pittsburgh scored 44 touchdowns last year, fourth most in the
league, and its 19 rushing touchdowns was third best.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the Cowboys offense to be dripping with creativity.
Gailey will use the shotgun formation, four and five receiver sets,
the option, reverses, and several gadget plays. He will take a
whirl with an offense that has looked stale.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Williams, the Dallas star offensive tackle, said of Gailey:
``It's going to be a different offense with him. When I look back
at our Super Bowl teams, those were talented clubs that were so
much better than other teams. We kept it simple. We don't have that
kind of talent now. So, we need variety in the offense and he's got
it. Coach is a killing-you-softly kind of guy. He's real soft
rather than being real loud but he's killing you all of the time.
Both ways can work. We've got young guys looking to be led. Certain
people do not lead you in the right direction all of the time. With
him, he is going to lead you the right way and we need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman added: ``The worst is behind us. Chan presents us with a
fresh new start. Usually when you get a new head coach you tend to
be in a rebuilding mode. This football team is not going to be like
that. We expect great things.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Gailey enters in Dallas and his players say all are off on
the right foot. Change can be good, they say. Gailey wants his team
to prepare, to be strong in the running game, to be swift on
defense, with the entire success of this upcoming season, his first
season, depending on the health of the offensive line, he said. He
views himself like a movie director. Here is the script, the parts,
the scene. Now, what must I do to choreograph this show?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not hired to be a robot,'' Gailey said. ``They hired me
to bring something to the table. I'll give it a whirl. Especially
when things look a little stale.'' &QL;

THE INNER GAME OF AN ODDBALL COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE JENKINS 
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Phil Jackson's body enters a room in stages. It could
be an elbow coming through first, or a knee or a shoulder or a
chin, depending on the undulations of the moment. He's from the
Ministry of Silly Walks. The body appears to have been built with
an Erector Set or in some secret laboratory, where they were just
about to start over when someone said, ``Wait, keep this model.
It's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil's a little different upstairs, too.
</P>
<P>
   You can't capsulize the man in a single phrase, because he's had
too many lives: church-goer, rebel, flower child, power forward,
Zen philosopher. Just now he's presiding over the most fascinating
cast of NBA champions since the eclectic Warriors of 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this sums him up, at least for the moment: Dennis
Rodman missed practice Monday, and nobody even blinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a given now that Rodman will bypass important team
functions _ practices, community appearances, even actual games _
to follow his muse. Of course he missed the shoot-around. Of course
he went to Vegas. Of course he was working out on a treadmill in
some Delta Center hallway when Jackson wanted him in the game last
Friday. You bet he goes shopping for wedding gowns and fancies the
company of transvestites. Aren't all the really great rebounders
like that?
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson, you really start to wonder. Make no mistake, he's
steamed over Rodman's assaults on team unity. But Jackson's
patience, and the way it all seems to work out for Chicago in the
end, is nothing short of remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about the rope he gives Rodman, and I'm not sure any
other coach would do that,'' said Jack Ramsay, the astute former
coach and current ESPN analyst. ``I couldn't do it. My thing was
`same rules for everybody.' I can't imagine one of my players not
being on the bench during a game! (laughter) But Phil's strength is
his great touch with his players. Whatever happens with Dennis,
Phil doesn't let it gnaw at his soul. Somehow he sees a bigger
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the Bulls' players see it, too. Their motto
isn't ``Three-Peat'' or any tribute to the wondrous Jordan. It's
``Oh, Well _ That's Just Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, Rodman got every key rebound, passed expertly
within the triangle offense and pulled a head-trip number on Karl
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   There's an angry faction out there, ridiculing Jackson, calling
for Rodman's banishment and claiming that a barbershop quartet
could win the NBA title with Jordan. The fact is, the Bulls need
all of their mysterious little pieces to function. They need Rodman
under the boards. They need Jackson to dismiss every transgression
with a simple fine. And they need the players to get on Jackson's
wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we feel about Dennis missing practice today?
Nothing,'' said Steve Kerr. ``We're used to it. Phil handled it the
right way, leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The same question went to Luc Longley. ``We're all tired of it,
to be honest,'' he said. ``It's just a shame these things should
happen during a championship series. But with Dennis, we know what
we've got. We're not gonna quit on him now. We stick by him.''
</P>
<P>
   And that comes strictly from the fine touch of Jackson, the most
erudite, eccentric, well-rounded and downright interesting NBA
coach in memory.
</P>
<P>
   You think about guys like Rick Adelman, Del Harris, the esteemed
Pat Riley _ hell, almost anyone in this business: All forthright
fellows, but pretty much on the same road for life. Plenty of
coaching, with a side of seminars, followed by two clinics and a
film session. They've all lived a single life, maybe two on the
outside, to Jackson's dozen.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a wilds-of-Montana environment so stifled, his
parents wouldn't let him go to movies, watch TV, listen to rock 'n'
roll, or even read, if it wasn't the Bible or a schoolbook. His
family's life revolved entirely around the church. Young Phil hung
with it for several years, absorbed the best of it all, then
flipped his life's record to the ``B'' side. Over there he found
exotic Eastern religions, sultry ports of call, alternative
lifestyles, the questioning of authority, a hint of weed, and as he
once revealed in a biography, the occasional tab of acid.
</P>
<P>
   And he always played hoops. They laughed at his body, the odd
shoulders and sharp bones and funny angles, but he had a deep and
thorough understanding of the game. In a small but undeniable way,
he was a little like Rodman: thoroughly unconventional, both on the
court and off, but a master of hard work and the game's subtleties.
Old film clips show Jackson playing for the Knicks in the early
'70s, an incomprehensible vision alongside ``Clyde'' Frazier,
``Black Jesus'' Monroe, ``Fall Back, Baby'' Barnett and future U.S.
Senator Bill Bradley. But they loved him on that team. And he loved
the life. He saw it a little differently than anyone else, but he
was born to elbow his way inside, toss that bag of bones skyward
and grab a rebound from Paul Silas.
</P>
<P>
   When they first interviewed him in Chicago, for an assistant's
job, Jackson showed up in a Panama hat with a macaw's feather. He
tried to explain the look to Stan Albeck, then the Bulls' GM, ``but
his eyes glazed over very early in the interview,'' Jackson said.
``I didn't get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Jackson mastered the art of diplomacy. He became a man
comfortable in two distinct worlds. ``He's like lubricating oil,''
his wife, June, once said. ``He keeps everything moving.''
</P>
<P>
   And without Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan simply cannot continue
playing in the NBA. Jordan has bought into it all: the curious body
language, the honey-smooth speaking voice, the Zen-Buddhist
teachings, the utter calm under stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what I've attained,'' said Jordan, ``Phil can still
motivate me, still criticize me, still coach me as he would any
other player on our team. I have a high regard for someone not
caught up in my mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is just speculation now, the tedious and
long-running rumors about Bulls management breaking up the team.
Everyone thinks it's over. They're calling it ``the last dance''
and shooting home videos to save the memories. But when it's all
over, and the Bulls are just another topic for summer afternoons in
the rocking chair, Jordan won't be the only one with a mystique.
Save one of those plaques for Phil Jackson.

BATTERED JAZZ SKIP PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STEELE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The day after the worst beating in the history of the
NBA Finals, the Utah Jazz decided not to practice.
</P>
<P>
   So did Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently reached their conclusions from different
directions. The Bulls gave no explanation for Rodman's absence and
did not indicate how they would discipline him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson told reporters that Rodman had called him and
said he had overslept _ but later in the day, the power forward
showed up at The Palace of Auburn Hills, near Detroit, at a pro
wrestling match. He declined to talk to a reporter at the match,
staying in a luxury box at The Palace and cavorting with, among
others, wrestlers Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, meanwhile, passed on a workout in favor of a film
session at the United Center dedicated to dissecting Sunday's 96-54
Bulls victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a couple of tables back there in the training room,''
said coach Jerry Sloan, ``so guys could lay back and rest for a
while while we watched film, in case somebody gets sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was joking, but the goal of the day was to eject the
residue of Game 3 from their systems. Desperately needing a Game 4
victory to tie the series 2-2 and secure a trip back to Salt Lake
City _ but forced to endure two days of introspection and public
scrutiny until the next game _ the Jazz have a difficult task
ahead. They gave the appearance of a team with a firm grasp of what
they faced and a clear mental outlook. They were still angry but
made a show of not sounding beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll come back and play,'' Sloan said. ``I've always
felt like when we've had disappointing times we've always come back
and played pretty hard ... I think we'll play hard, but the
important thing is, I think you have to play intelligently. I don't
think we did that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Added John Stockton, ``The sun came up, today's another day, and
we just go back to the drawing board and try to start playing well
again ... So that one's behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz do have reason for hope. Seven teams before them had
lost a Finals game by 33 points or more, and three of them went on
to win the series and the title: the Lakers over the 76ers in '82,
the Celtics over the Lakers in '84 and the Lakers over Boston in
1985. Plus, the Bulls crushed the Blazers by 33 in the opener of
the 1992 Finals, only to lose Game 2 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, though, the Jazz cannot count on their opponent
being rattled by another Rodman no-show. The reaction to Rodman's
absence from the morning practice was utter nonchalance. ``We don't
worry about that. The only ones who make a big deal about it are
you guys, the media,'' said the Bulls' Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something happened between the game (Sunday) and this
morning,'' Jackson said, making it clear the absence was not
excused. ``He called at practice about 15 minutes ago and he said
he got up late, his alarm clock didn't work and he didn't think
he'd be here in time for the press.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA fined Rodman $10,000 for not showing up at the mandatory
media session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the wrong time of the season to take the focus away from
what we are trying to accomplish,'' said Chicago's Scottie Pippen.
``But we've always let Dennis have his way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had their way with the Jazz on Sunday, and when they
return to practice Tuesday, the Jazz will concentrate on solving
the Bulls' trapping defense, which completely negated their
precision pick-and-roll offense. The Jazz reacted so slowly to the
Bulls' defense, Sloan said, that they were being beaten to their
appointed spots by their defenders. Throw in the numerous missed
layups (particularly by center Greg Ostertag) and missed open
jumpers (everyone except Karl Malone), and the result is a
record-setting disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, meanwhile, are on guard to avoid complacency and
overconfidence after the Game 3 rout. Michael Jordan said he
remembered the scenario from 1992: ``We've had experience to be in
that situation before. We are very aware of the circumstances, and
I don't think that we are going to come out overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to come out looking at the adjustments
that are made to go into Game 4, and be prepared to apply our
aggressive defense once again and offensively play a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bulls focused their film session on the first eight
minutes of the game, when the Jazz and Malone seemed on the verge
of taking control. ``We stunk the first period,'' Harper said, ``so
we know we didn't play a great ballgame. Whatever adjustments (the
Jazz) are going to make, we're going to have to make, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sloan said the adjustments need to be more than tactical
ones. ``You don't motivate players. They have to motivate
themselves,'' he said of his role as coach. ``I've always had that
philosophy, and I think that's the most overused word in sports.
... That comes from within yourself. That's the bottom line.''

WOODY AND HIS LAUGH ARE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The beak is back.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodpecker is being dusted off the nostaglia shelf and
thrust into TV, theme parks, the Web and retail stores, Universal
Studios announced has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Woody, who appeared in more than 400 shorts produced between
1940 and 1979 by the late Walter Lantz, now sports a more
slicked-back look but retains his trademark _ many might say
annoying _ laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, a division of Seagram Co. and the syndicator for the
cartoons, wants Woody to become an icon _ and cash machine _ much
like Mickey Mouse for Walt Disney Co. and Bugs Bunny for Warner
Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, the Toronto-based beverage company, has committed to
becoming an entertainment giant in recent years through its
controversial purchases of Universal and PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   Universal plans to start airing ``The Woody Woodpecker Show'' on
Fox Kids Network in November with 40 new episodes. It plans to sell
licensed merchandise starting in the fall; release new episodes on
video next spring; launch a Web site this summer; and give Woody a
big presence at theme parks, starting with the Universal Studios
Experience opening next month in Beijing.

BULLS BUILDING CASE FOR ANOTHER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Michael Jordan and his Bulls don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing out the Jazz like that. Making a mockery out of the
hardest-working, most efficient squad in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   All of that Jud Buechler, Randy Brown and Bill Wennington
romping and running up the score in the fourth quarter of the
Bulls' crushing 96-54 victory in Game 3 at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   All with Jordan and Scottie Pippen on the bench, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bulls did to the Jazz Sunday makes you think the Bulls
don't understand: The world was ready for their fall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jordan, Pippen and coach Phil Jackson totally seasoned
us for that. All year, the mainstays in the five-time champion
Bulls have bullhorned a single message: ``We're done. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cite whatever factor you want. There were so many signaling the
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Dennis Rodman Insanity Scenario. The Pippen ``Trade Me''
Impasse. The Jackson ``I Won't Be Back'' Action. The Jordan Bet
Hedging, since if Jackson's not back, forget about the greatest
player in the galaxy doing his caped crusader routine any longer in
the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the soap opera sub-plots is the power struggle by
Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause
seeking to glom control and glory of a franchise that is all thanks
to the uniqueness of Jordan and Co.
</P>
<P>
   But what if this is the time and place for the tune of doom to
change? What if the tone of these Finals was set by the Bulls' Game
2 win in Salt Lake City and then amplified by the Game 3 whipping?
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls are champs again, especially with such ease as a
42-point slaughter like Sunday, maybe there is wiggle room for
another shot at it all. Maybe it won't be impossible to sign up
Jordan, Pippen and Jackson for another tour of championship duty.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf is now apparently putting the onus on Jackson about
whether he will be part of another Bulls' run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil (Jackson) has done a great job for us, and if he changes
his mind and wants to come back, I'll be open to discussing it with
him, absolutely,'' are Reinsdorf's reported latest words on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Jackson is willing to eat his words about not coming
back; or, if there's an NBA season after the impending July 1
lockout; or, if Reinsdorf is willing to fire Krause _ all big
``ifs'' _ the door is open for a Bulls Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the possibility of another Bulls title defense is more
than any of us expected. We have been so thoroughly prepared for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to Sir Air, but psychologically, emotionally,
intestinally we have expected that this would be the dynasty's
faltering last dance.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the NBA Finals, the magnitude of Jordan's persona
outside of the NBA became the main topic of the free world. Forget
the sports pages, much bigger guns were sent to chronicle The
Jordan Effect in two separate publications.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest issue, Fortune Magazine reports that Jordan is
nothing less than a $10 billion man if you account for his total
trickle-down effect.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1 issue of the New Yorker, meanwhile, provided a
masterpiece essay by Harvard sociologist Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,
describing how Jordan has blown to smithereens the standard of
product branding, thus making himself the biggest marketing force
ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Gates provided some of the most compelling quotes
from Jordan, especially in regard to Jordan's disgust with
Reinsdorf and Krause and their unending need to seize the power and
the glory for the Bulls that Jordan created.
</P>
<P>
   After signing his $30-million-plus contract for this season,
Jordan made this damning statement about Reinsdorf:
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook hands, but one comment struck me as we left and I
lost total respect for him when he said it: `At some point in time,
I know I'm going to regret what we just did,''' Jordan was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm saying (to myself) all these years where you knew I
was underpaid and you've been making money and your organization
has moved from a $15 million business when you bought it to $200
million _ all those years have just gone down the drain because you
have for once finally paid me my value. And you regret that! That
hit me so deep inside _ that sense of greed, of disrespect for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such articles and comments seem like compelling evidence that
Jordan the marketing and cultural phenomenon no longer needs to be
the greatest NBA player who ever lived. He won't stand for the
Bulls brass disrespecting him.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the overwhelming Bulls, especially in Games 2
and 3, you get a different sense of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jordan does need to play hoops. He needs to win. It is
his ultimate reward. That's why he was giggling with Pippen during
the fourth quarter when his Bulls were blowing away what everyone
expected to be the Bulls' stiffest competition.
</P>
<P>
   Here's betting that barring a season-long lockout in 1998-99,
Jordan and the Bulls run again. They have grown to love the misery
of their twisted club dynamics. In fact, with such wins as 96-54
over the Jazz, you could say Jordan and his Bulls thrive on their
over-dramatized adversity.

CONFIDENT AMERICAN FACE UPHILL BATTLE TO BE WORLD-BEATERS  
 BY DAN GIESIN 
</HEADLINE>
 _ SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moments before embarking for France and the World Cup last
Thursday, Steve Sampson talked the talk of underdogs everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team,'' the coach said of the U.S. National squad,
``truly believes in themselves and believes that they can beat
Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia. ... The players really feel they will
do something terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the second round would just about fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Cup grouping that does the United States no favors _
in the 1994 tournament, the team had a relatively easy first-round
draw, home-crowd advantage and a ``wild-card'' pass into the round
of 16 _ the Americans face an uphill battle. Even the president of
the U.S. Soccer Federation, Alan Rothenberg, is on record as saying
this team has little chance of repeating the glory of '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the goal is to make the second round,'' Rothenberg was
quoted recently in the Washington Post. ``Realistically, I don't
expect to achieve that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, whose greatest asset perhaps is his unflappability,
said Rothenberg has a point but politely added that maybe his boss
is mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Mr. Rothenberg was stating anything different
than what many people are saying; that Germany and Yugoslavia are
expected to advance out of our group,'' Sampson said. ``But I think
this U.S. team can surprise some people. Our best soccer is yet to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been Sampson's mantra ever since the Americans qualified
for their unprecedented third straight Cup finals in November. He
truly believes that his squad _ comprised of, in roughly equal
parts, experience, youth and talent _ will show the world that
Americans can compete successfully on the international stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone from a team that was conservative and
inexperienced (in '94) to one that imposes its (playing) style on
other teams,'' he said of a team that has gone 9-3-5 since
September and has outscored opponents 23-11 during that stretch.
``It's hard to say how far we'll go in France, but anything's
possible. We have enough talent to get results. ... I'm a firm
believer of this team doing something special. When it is faced
with a tough opponent, this team always steps up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Brazil, which saw Kasey Keller, one of the best goalies
in the world, deny its stars shot after shot in the Americans'
stunning 1-0 upset of the defending world champs in February. Or
how about Austria, a Cup finals qualifier that was taken apart 3-0
by the Americans two months ago in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're definitely a team that every team in the world
knows that even if they play their best game against us, they can
lose,'' midfielder Tab Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand you can talk to Holland and Belgium, two more
Cup qualifiers that easily dissected and exposed the U.S. team four
days apart in Europe in late February. Or how about Macedonia,
which did not qualify for the Cup but nonetheless shut down the
Americans in a scoreless draw three weeks ago in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team at times is so perplexing,'' Sampson said. ``It can
play so very well and at other times play to the level of a poor
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Americans' chances lies in the midfield, and so
far this year the team has performed remarkably well under
Sampson's 3-6-1 configuration, which was installed for the Austria
match for the first time (the team is 2-0-2 with that alignment).
</P>
<P>
   Brian Maisonneuve, a World Cup rookie who is known for his
tenacious defensive play, and Claudio Reyna, the elegant, veteran
playmaker, constitute the ``spine'' of the midfield corps, and much
of the U.S. team's play will be dictated by these two players.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how well the team defends and sets up the attack,
it is not going to go very far if it can't score. And the forwards'
recent inability to put the ball in the back of the net has been a
worrisome problem. Eric Wynalda, who will most likely shoulder the
responsibility of being the lone striker in the 3-6-1, has scored
just one goal in international play this year (10 matches); Brian
McBride, who has shown great potential at times, missed four
excellent scoring chances against Macedonia, and Roy Wegerle is
starting to show fatigue in his 34-year-old legs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sampson is not panicking _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident in these individuals,'' he said. ``We have
created dozens of great opportunities. It's just a matter of being
a little more precise, a little more composed in front of the goal.
I'm not going to concern myself too much with that (inability to
score). I would be more concerned if we weren't creating
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   That, perhaps, best sums up Sampson's philosophy _ play the game
well and things will fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more important for us to play well than to get to
the second round,'' he said. ``We're playing more sophisticatedly,
more intelligently, and we're taking more risks. We've made great
strides. But our greatest failure would be if we lose in bad style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to play better. It's not good enough to me just to
get results (wins or draws); I want to do it in style. ... Against
Germany and Yugoslavia, we must prove we can hold the ball under
pressure and create goal-scoring opportunities. Then we will have
shown we have improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, about to partake in his third World Cup, thinks the
team is just about there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing some of the best soccer that we've ever
played,'' said the player who has scored more international goals
(32) than any other American man. ``We are ranked No. 11in the
world ... and now it's time to respond. This team knows how to
compete at the highest level, and we need to instill confidence in
the (American) public that `We won't let you down.' We're not the
underdog anymore; we're expected to win. We're capable of doing
something very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defender and team captain Thomas Dooley: ``Anything can
happen in soccer. We hope to have a surprise for someone over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to the second round would be pleasant enough.

M'S ADDICTED TO SPRINGER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is midnight on a weekday in Seattle. Do you know
where your All-Star center fielder is?
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's extra innings or nine extra-long innings to be
played, Ken Griffey Jr. insists he's easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in bed watching `The Jerry Springer Show' on Channel 10,''
he says with a smirk. ``I watch it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season chalk full of inconsistency, of bullpen blowups and
endless fielding errors, Jerry Springer remains the lone constant
and a rallying cry for the Mariners. Most players are devoted fans,
treating the bawdy trash-talking, fist-swinging talk show as a
daily, or late-night, ritual.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, watching a mid-afternoon Springer episode is nearly
as important in terms of pregame preparation as taking batting
practice. Mesmerized Seattle players often are joined in front of a
clubhouse television by coaches, trainers and clubhouse personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's on,'' second baseman Joey Cora announces, emerging
from the training room in Kansas City, imploring teammates to
gather around him. ``Wives battle mistresses'' soon flashes on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry,'' third baseman Russ Davis chants
quietly while seated in the club's Kingdome dugout and broached
about the subject. The Springer show that day is centered around a
man who claims to have married his pet horse.
</P>
<P>
   Cora has suggested that the next time the Mariners are in
Chicago, where the show is taped, the players obtain tickets and
become part of the studio audience. Griffey asks why stop there? We
could be disfunctional guests as well as anyone, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of the Mariners' allegiance to the show, Springer
spokeswoman Linda Shafran says the talk-show host is flattered.
Springer is a big sports fan whose favorite team is a Mariner
rival, the New York Yankees. Pictures of Mickey Mantle and Yogi
Berra hang in his office wall. His following cuts a wide swath
through professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Springer has met members of the Houston Rockets, unabashed
viewers. He has learned that the Los Angeles Lakers, most notably
Shaquille O'Neal, share a deep affection for his show. Anaheim
Angels players showed up in The Windy City for a recent taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love hearing the Mariners are huge fans,'' Shafron said.
``Right back at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the show will be on summer hiatus when the
Mariners return to Chicago in mid-August, preventing a studio
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Their television fix will have to do for now. It fills a
definite void in the otherwise mundane existence of today's
millionaire ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' Davis said. ``When there's nothing else on
TV and you can't sleep, it's good entertainment _ people up there
making fools of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Said first baseman David Segui: ``I think most athletes like to
watch it and see people air their dirty laundry. You can give a
good ass-whipping without getting thrown in jail. I'm definitely
fascinated by the bizarre things in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But no more than Cora. The diminutive infielder appears to be
the Mariners' biggest Springer fan. When two people start to tangle
on the screen, he becomes the most animated watcher, leaping from
his seat on the clubhouse couch in excited fashion, gesturing
approvingly at the crass and unusual. He has informed teammates he
would like to be a guest bouncer for Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed about this by an outsider, Cora isn't quite so
forthcoming. With his Vanderbilt University background, it's
possible he has a cerebral image to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' he says of the show. ``I don't watch it.
It's (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, however, has nothing to hide. He isn't afraid to admit
he owns six copies of Springer's ``Too Hot For TV'' video. He
routinely watches the nightly Channel 10 offerings. His wife joins
him. Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's fun,'' Griffey says. ``What else is there to do late
at night?''

WYNALDA HAS THE SKILLS TO MAKE HIS POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN GIESIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world's eye, there are two Eric Wynaldas.
</P>
<P>
   One is the brash, young punk who threw a vicious elbow at Czech
midfielder Lubomir Moravcik in a first-round match in the 1990
World Cup and earned instant notoriety _ and lasting infamy _ as
the first U.S. player to be ejected from a World Cup match.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the skillful veteran whose spectacular,
pressure-filled 28-yard free kick arced above and around the Swiss
defensive wall and into the net to secure a 1-1 draw in the
Americans' Cup-opening game in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Who's it gonna be this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a statement in this World Cup,'' Wynalda said.
``This is the World Cup that I have the experience to handle the
pressure. I have the experience where it counts to make this the
World Cup where I play my best soccer, to help my country the best
I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, that job was to just put the ball in the net _
he has a team-record 32 goals in 100 international matches (to put
that number into perspective, retired Bruce Murray is No. 2 on the
all-time list with 21 goals in 93 games).
</P>
<P>
   But leg and groin injuries over the past year and a half have
limited his effectiveness, and he has scored just once in his past
10 games wearing the U.S. colors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wynalda doesn't mind setting up others to score goals
(``Sometimes the game plays into my hand that I need to be an
assist guy,'' he said), it's out there on the point where he would
love to show the world his skills. And his coach, Steve Sampson,
believes the time is ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Wynalda wants to make a statement in this World Cup,''
Sampson said. ``And I expect him to be prepared, mentally and
physically, to do so in France.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sampson has installed a new on-field look for his team,
switching from the traditional four defenders-four midfielders-two
forwards alignment to a 3-6-1 configuration, and that means only
one player is the go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Wynalda, there are three candidates for the
job _ himself, Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle. If anybody other than
Sampson knows who that man will be next Monday, when the U.S. team
opens World Cup play against Germany, they aren't talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all bring different things to the table,'' Wynalda said.
``Roy can hold the ball well, and he has the legs to open up and
stretch the defense. I'm the same way, but on the wings. Brian's
main attribute is what he does in the air. The starting forward job
is up for grabs, and each of us is working hard to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one more than Wynalda. Regarded sometimes as recalcitrant and
hard to work with (just ask erstwhile Clash coach Laurie Calloway,
whose battles with his forward were well known), Wynalda said
that's baloney, that he is just too intense and focused in his
playing style and attitude toward the game to accept anything less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been labeled as a bad boy, and I don't think that's
necessarily true,'' he said. ``I'm a very competitive player, and
pretty fierce on the field, and that can be misconstrued. If you
play against me, you might say that. But if you meet me off the
field, you wouldn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Which persona Eric Wynalda takes on in France remains to be
seen. But he already has an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said authoritatively, ``what's expected of me.''

BRYNN HARTMAN LAB TESTS DETECT MEDICATION, COCAINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB   AND LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brynn Hartman had cocaine, an antidepressant and
high levels of alcohol in her system when she committed suicide,
after killing ``NewsRadio'' star Phil Hartman, coroner's officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No illegal drugs were found in the 49-year-old actor, who was
shot three times while curled up in bed, according to the Los
Angeles County Coroner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Brynn Hartman's blood-alcohol level was .12 percent, well above
the .08 percent limit at which a driver is legally drunk, officials
said. Trace amounts of cocaine also were found in her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toxicologists tell me that the levels of cocaine are such
that it appears that they were ingested approximately five hours
before the time of death,'' said Chief Coroner Investigator Craig
Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Brynn Hartman killed herself several hours after shooting her
husband. It remains unclear whether she had taken the cocaine
before shooting her husband May 28, with their two young children
in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect Brynn Hartman killed the former ``Saturday
Night Live'' star sometime before 3 a.m. They say the former model
killed herself shortly after 6:20 a.m., when officers arrived at
her house.
</P>
<P>
   The toxicology tests completed Friday show Brynn Hartman's blood
also contained a prescription drug called Zoloft within therapeutic
levels. Zoloft is taken for depression and obsessive-compulsive
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicologists will not know how much cocaine was in her blood
until a full autopsy report is completed in 10 days. Harvey said
the combination of cocaine and alcohol might have intensified the
effects of both drugs, making them 1 1/2 (one-half) times stronger
than if they had been taken separately.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey declined to speculate what effect, if any, Zoloft might
have had when mixed with alcohol or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said there was no evidence of pills or containers for
Zoloft at the couple's home. Coroner's investigators did find
prescription antibiotics in the house. And the toxicology report
showed Phil Hartman had taken an over-the-counter cold medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Anthony Alba said detectives will not investigate the
source of the cocaine found in Brynn Hartman's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really a consideration in this case,'' Alba said,
adding that no illegal drugs were found in the Hartmans' home.
``The point is she was the one who committed the murder and then
killed herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to find the distributor, we would charge that
person,'' Alba added.
</P>
<P>
   Alba was not sure whether police confirmed that Brynn Hartman
had a prescription for the antidepressant. Alba also said he was
not sure whether Brynn Hartman was drunk when she left a
neighborhood restaurant the evening before she shot her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Alba said the case is closed, except for follow-up interviews
with family members to gain a better understanding of the motive in
the killings. ``Basically, it's over. We're not really releasing
all the information. It is closed,'' Alba said.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of the Hartmans had said the couple were
having marital difficulties, stemming from Brynn Hartman's use of
drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Brynn Hartman killed her husband and then left to meet with a
friend, Ron Douglas, who took her gun, returned with her to the
Encino Avenue home and called 911. As police were removing the
children from the house, Brynn Hartman locked herself in the master
bedroom and shot herself.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said four shots were fired in the house _ Phil Hartman
was shot twice in the head and once in the mid-torso, and Brynn
Hartman shot herself once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hartman was found lying in bed in a fetal position on his
left side, ``as if he was snuggled up in the bedding asleep,''
Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that 40-year-old Brynn Hartman was found with a gun in
her hand, facing the ceiling, ``with her upper body supported by
pillows, leaning against the headboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Rosenfield, a family spokesman for the Hartmans, declined
to comment on the results of the toxicology tests. Other family
members could not be reached for comment.

NIGERIAN OPPOSITION LEADERS CALL FOR MILITARY TO STEP ASIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, re-editing throughout)   (sw) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the death of Nigeria's military ruler, Gen.
Sani Abacha, the daughter of Moshood Abiola, the opposition leader
who was imprisoned after being elected president in 1993, called on
Monday for the military to step aside and for her father's
immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era, and I hope, the end of military
rule,'' said Hafsat Abiola, his 23-year-old Harvard-educated
daughter who has worked with other opposition figures to protest
military rule in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abiola, who works for the Special Olympics and lives in
suburban Maryland with 5 of her 18 siblings, said she is concerned
about her father's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abacha wanted to use my father as a hostage, to keep him close
by so that if he was ever attacked he'd attack my Dad,'' she said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she thought her father should take over the reins
of power in Nigeria now that Abacha is dead, she replied, ``I just
want my father released. I am very concerned about his safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Nigerian opposition leaders called for Abiola to be
installed as president of a transitional government in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, the exiled Nigerian playwright, told reporters in
Jerusalem on Monday, ``There's only one choice for Nigeria _ that's
a democratic option. And the structure is there. The
president-elect is waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka added that the general's death presented an opportunity
for the military to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were sick of military dictatorship,'' he said. ``So
it's up to the military to recognize this _ and up to the
international community to say that we're sick and tired of the
degeneration of a potentially great society.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, other countries should increase diplomatic
pressure and economic sanctions on the military government, Soyinka
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1986, fled
Nigeria in 1994. He was charged in absentia with treason last March
in connection with bomb attacks aimed mostly at the military, which
left two people dead and about 60 people wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The view that it was time for the military to step aside was
echoed by the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a human rights activist and
writer who was executed by the Nigerian government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for the opposition and an opportunity
for democracy to be restored to Nigeria, though how that actually
happens is anybody's guess,'' Ken Wiwa told Britain's Channel Four
television news.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One hopes that democracy will have a chance to establish
itself,'' said Wiwa, whose father was hanged in 1995 with eight
others.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was unclear whether Abiola was well enough to
assume power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really not sure how healthy and fit Moshood Abiola
is.'' Wiwa said. ``Reports say he himself is close to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola said that she was not ready to embrace the call of
other opposition leaders like Soyinka for her father to assume the
leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he is not doing very well and have to attend to his
medical needs first,'' she said. She said that he suffered from
high blood pressure, a pinched nerve and had trouble moving his
left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The family has not seen her father in well over a year. When
they saw him in January 1995, ``he had been tussled, beaten around
and looked very disheveled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abiola said that her father was the only person who can
bring democracy to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who can move the country beyond the point
where it is peaceful and democratic is my father,'' Ms. Abiola
said. ``He is the only person chosen by the people to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola has been in jail since mid-1994, after he was charged
with treason by a federal high court in Abuja for declaring himself
president. He was chosen by popular vote in election that was
annulled by the military.
</P>
<P>
   One of his three wives, Kudirat Abiola, Ms. Abiola's mother, was
killed two years ago while working to free her husband from prison,
in what her daughter called a political execution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abiola, who has spent nearly a third of her life in the
United States, said she was ready to go home if she could feel safe
again. ``I want to be able to welcome my father back to our
house,'' she said.

BANK MERGER LIKELY TO BE MOST PAINFUL IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY CATHERINE REAGOR and CRAIG ANDERSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The impact of the proposed $34 billion merger of Wells Fargo and
Norwest banks is likely to be felt the most in Arizona, where the
two banks have the greatest overlap.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and Minneapolis-based Norwest
said Monday they plan to combine operations and form the nation's
seventh-largest bank. It will have almost $191 billion in assets,
more than 90,000 employees, about 20 million customers and 5,777
financial-services outlets worldwide. The companies hope to have
the deal settled by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo is the third-largest bank in Arizona and Norwest is
fourth. After the merger, the new bank could be the second-largest
in the state. It will keep the Wells Fargo name. The overlap
resulting from the merger is likely to lead to branch closures and
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape of Arizona banking is definitely changing. We'll
just have to see how it works out for the consumer,'' said Marilyn
Seymann, president of M One Inc., a Phoenix bank consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Wells Fargo undertook an $11.3 billion takeover
of First Interstate Bank, based in Los Angeles. Wells Fargo is
still digesting that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo closed hundreds of branches and eliminated 7,000
jobs. It also lost customer deposits, bounced good checks and
incorrectly withdrew money from some accounts and deposited it in
others.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hazen, chairman of Wells Fargo, said he expects the merger
with Norwest to go much more smoothly than with First Interstate
because the partners will spend three years integrating their
operations, paying special attention to the computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers usually take a back seat in these megamergers,''
Seymann said. ``The concern is more for the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   One Phoenix Norwest customer, who had heard about the problems
with Wells Fargo's buyout of First Interstate, is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the deal in front of her Norwest branch at 22nd
Street and Camelback Road on Monday, Debbie Mortensen, a 10-year
Norwest customer, said, ``Oh, no. I've heard a lot of bad things
about Wells Fargo.'' She doesn't know if she will remain a customer
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Not all customers were disappointed, though. Braxton Glass, who
has been a Wells Fargo customer since it bought out First
Interstate, initially was apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   But, he was pleasantly surprised with Wells Fargo because of its
Internet banking, which he said has made his life easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (Wells Fargo) is an improvement over First
Interstate,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks have totally different operating styles.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest is known as a community bank with a very local approach
that revolves around traditional branches. It has just begun to
expand into Internet and grocery store banking.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo was an early leader in grocery store and Internet
banking, moving its focus away from traditional branch banking. It
is also known for having a tough corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Campbell, president and chief executive of Norwest's Arizona
Bank, said the company's customer service culture will be part of
the new bank's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Lucier, Wells Fargo's Arizona senior executive, said
the merger will give customers more products and a bigger network
of branches and automated teller machines (ATMs).
</P>
<P>
   The merger may be painful in Arizona. Branches are likely to
close or be sold to competitors and employees are likely to lose
jobs. Wells Fargo and Norwest will have to divest some assets
because both are so large. That means some customer deposits could
be sold to other banks. Regulators will determine in the next few
months how much the banks have to shed.
</P>
<P>
   No details on job losses or branch closings were available
Monday. Wells Fargo has 245 branches and 4,800 employees in
Arizona; Norwest has 85 branches and 2,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although overlap between the two banks is great in Arizona, it
is relatively small nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will be small in terms of staff reductions
compared to others,'' said Richard Kovacevich, chairman and chief
executive of Norwest, who will become chief executive and president
of the new bank. Hazen will remain chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo and Norwest expect to save at least $650 million
annually by their third year of operating together.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wells Fargo will be the No. 1 bank in the West for
financial services and No. 1 in the country for mortgages, Internet
services and agricultural lending. It will be No. 2 in small
business lending nationwide and No. 3 for total ATMs. &QL;

SOCCER AWARENESS BRINGS STATE OF BLISS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in my thrilling life when I blithely would have
ignored the World Cup, dismissing it with a haughty disdain formed
by being weaned in the good U.S. of A. on football, baseball,
basketball and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer?
</P>
<P>
   Please!
</P>
<P>
   I'd give it roughly the same keen attention I would give, say,
to an audio-visual film on suppositories if I somehow found myself
stuck at a pharmaceutical convention.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I detested soccer. It was even worse than that. I
was totally indifferent to it. I never watched it, read about it,
talked about it, or thought about it. To me, it was just this weird
sport in which a bunch of guys ran crazily around a field for
tiresomely long periods, kicking a ball back and forth when they
weren't kicking one another's shins for no discernible reason.
</P>
<P>
   All I ever knew about the sport is that its most famous
personality, Pele, matched Muhammad Ali in retirement
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   But such feelings began to change slightly back in 1994 when I
attended several World Cup games at the Rose Bowl, including the
championship match that wound up a scoreless tie between Italy and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Although I understood only the barest rudiments of soccer which
I guess is still the case since I still don't understand how Brazil
wound up victorious against Italy in that farcical overtime
penalty-kick ritual I was impressed with the fans' passionate
devotion, the players' intense competitiveness and the games'
unrelenting drama.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm sure I would have continued my lifetime habit of
totally ignoring this far less violent version of American football
except for a most lethal incident I wound up marrying a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   And, if this decision weren't stunning enough to those friends
who couldn't envision a long-time bachelor tied down in connubial
bliss, I actually exchanged vows with a Geordie, an appellation
given to those with strange accents even to other Brits who hail
from the Newcastle area in the north of England.
</P>
<P>
   I had not the faintest idea until I started spending a lot of
time in that vicinity that those who lived there were absolute
soccer zealots, crazed souls who cherished the sport with a fierce
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, if you think the good burghers in Indiana are stuck on
basketball, their devotion is laughably mild compared to the
fanatical attachment Geordies have for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The people in that region follow it like a Wall Street broker
does the Dow Jones. I don't care where you go around there
Newcastle, Hartlepool, Middlesborough, Sunderland, etc. they're
rabidly discussing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   And so, your venerable correspondent was forced by marital
obligations to at least have a superficial knowledge of the sport,
if for no other reason than to avoid the social embarrassment at
family gatherings of being an American sportswriter who couldn't
tell you the difference between George Harrison and George Best.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, with a slight twinge of embarrassment, I have a
confession to make I've actually been following the goings-on of
soccer in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, don't get the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not yet an aficionado of the most popular athletic activity
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But I will be intrigued by what unfolds during the next month at
the World Cup proceedings in France because, well, because, well,
because, well, I'm a henpecked husband who feels compelled to give
the impression to my European better half that my sporting
interests extend beyond the boundaries of this country.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea who will emerge victorious at the 105,000-seat
Saint-Denis in Paris in the championship game on July 12, but I
will brazenly predict right now it will be either Brazil, or
Germany, or Italy, or Argentina, or Uruguay,
</P>
<P>
   or England.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are the only countries besides Uruguay that
have been able to win the World Cup since its inception in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, my newfound knowledge of soccer extends even beyond
such trivia!
</P>
<P>
   I know, for instance, that the French organizing committee has
been savagely criticized by the world press for its ticket
apportioning policy, that Brazil is supposed to have a new Pele in
Ronaldo, that Argentina is supposed to have a new Maradona in Ariel
Ortega, that the traditionally dangerous Germany team has too many
guys past 30 to be a serious threat, that the traditionally erratic
England team has too many guys under 30 without enough talent to be
a serious threat, that always-strong Italy has a 23-year-old
superstar goal scorer in Alessandro Del Piero, and that the French
police better be ready for the feared English hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   All I know about the Americans is that they're supposed to be
better I swear I hear such a spiel every four years and that they
probably will lose their opener Monday against Germany and that
they face Iran on June 21 and Yugoslavia on June 25 in the first
round of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   I also know that England figures to breeze in its opener Monday
in Marseilles against Tunisia and that the Brits' best player, Alan
Shearer, lives less than eight miles from where my wife's parents
live, and that I better root for England to ensure continued
household harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever thought that matrimonial imperatives could turn a
soccer-ignorant sportswriter into an observer of the game, albeit
one who still doesn't understand it?

Astros rough up old friend, top Tigers
<TEXT>
<P>
   First-place tie in NL Central retained as Jones victimized for
five ninth-inning runs
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DETROIT _ Earlier this week, Detroit closer Todd Jones called his
bitterness toward the Astros a ``dead'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jones stepped to the mound in the ideal situation
Monday night: bottom of the ninth, one-run game and the chance to
once-and-for-all prove his former employer wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome wasn't exactly what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who began his career in the Houston organization before
being traded to the Tigers in 1996, surrendered five runs in the
ninth inning as the Astros rallied for a 9-5 victory before a crowd
of 11,767 at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who went 2-for-5 with four RBIs, put the finishing
touches on the Astros' third straight victory with a two-run double
in the ninth as the Astros kept pace with the Chicago Cubs atop the
National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Of the former Astros traded in the nine-player swap with Detroit
in 1996, Jones has been the most vocal in expressing his
displeasure with the Houston front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't very good tonight,'' said Jones, who pitched for
the Astros from 1993-96. ``They got me. I'm sure there is a lot of
satisfaction in that clubhouse. Stuff like this defines you. I'll
just go out and do my job if the same situation arises tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind victory was the Astros' third this season
in their last at-bat. And it came against Jones, who had allowed
runs in only four of 22 relief appearances this season and had
converted nine of 10 previous save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   There was little he could do right against the Astros, who
overcame a 5-3 deficit with six runs over the final three innings.
That the decisive rally came off Jones (0-2) was no big deal to the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something extra in this series because so
many guys for the Tigers have been with us and vice versa, yet I
don't think anybody in our locker room is going to say it sure was
nice to beat Todd Jones,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker.
``They're saying it's nice to be even with the Cubs. We're not
thinking about any of that stuff. We're just trying to win games
and stay in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros actually began their comeback in the seventh when
Craig Biggio, who had three hits in the game, scored on a passed
ball to cut the Tigers' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Biggio delivered a one-out single through the
hole at shortstop and stole second before Bill Spiers walked. Derek
Bell pushed across the tying run with a double to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones intentionally walked Jeff Bagwell, and Moises Alou put the
Astros on top 6-5 with a sacrifice fly to center field, scoring
Spiers. Everett, who also hit his third home run of the season in
the fourth inning, cleared the bases with a two-run double and
scored on the play when Detroit catcher Paul Bako's throw to third
sailed into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being up at the plate with the bases loaded,'' said
Everett, so excited that he must have forgotten there were only two
on when he batted in the ninth. ``The pressure is all on the
pitcher. He made a mistake, and I took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros overcame a shaky outing by righthander Sean Bergman,
whose 4-inning stint was his shortest in more than a month. Bergman
allowed four runs and six hits and walked three while struggling to
find his control. He had gone at least six innings in his previous
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting with myself to find location,'' Bergman said.
``Going 4 innings was definitely not what I wanted to do. I wanted
to go out and pitch seven or eight innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros relievers Mike Magnante, Doug Henry and Billy Wagner
combined to hold the Tigers to one run and three hits over the
final 4 innings. Henry (4-2) picked up the victory with 1 innings
of scoreless relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big. After the last three outings I've had, it's nice
to go out and pitch like I needed to,'' Henry said. ``One thing the
bullpen always needs to remember is that in a close game, this team
can erupt for four or five runs at any time. We have to keep it
close and not let the lead get any farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Astros needed a big inning, they got it. Dierker, who
saw his team collect 14 hits for the night, noted the Astros'
patience at the plate against Jones in the ninth, which forced the
righthander to work deep into the count on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are tough,'' Dierker said. ``If you look at the
statistics, the one thing that's sort of a hidden asset is our
selectiveness at the plate. We have a lot of hitters that make
pitchers work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were doing a lot of work of their own early on as
holding a lead became a chore. There were four lead changes during
the first four innings before the Tigers took a 5-3 lead in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 3-2 lead off Detroit rookie righthander Seth
Greisinger in the fourth when Alou singled and Everett sent a line
drive into the left-field stands for his third home run of the
season.

VIEWERS TUNE OUT STANLEY CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JARRE FEES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a presidential election year, it would be fitting that the
Washington Capitals made the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no presidential election. There's only a
presidential scandal. So maybe it's appropriate for Ron Wilson, the
coach of the U.S. Olympic team, which had scandals of its own in
Nagano, to be coaching the team that somehow stumbled into the NHL
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   And just as with the Clinton scandals, a lot of people are
already bored.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's weekend NHL playoff ratings through May 31 clocked in at
1.8, down 14 percent from last year. But last year there was a
reason to watch. Fans saw Detroit and Philadelphia in the final
series. Before that, it was Eric Lindros and the Flyers taking on
Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and the New York Rangers in the Eastern
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   This year it was Washington vs. Buffalo, and ESPN's numbers were
down 23 percent through May 27, from 1.3 to 1.0. And ESPN2's 24 NHL
playoff telecasts averaged a pathetic 0.5 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday May 31, the Detroit-Dallas game on Fox posted national
ratings of 2.2 with a 6 share, meaning just six percent of people
who had their televisions on were watching the hockey playoffs.
This was better than NBC did with the French Open (1.9 rating with
a 5 share) but not as good as what ABC did with the PGA Memorial
Tournament (3.0 with an 8 share).
</P>
<P>
   Those Sunday ratings were for the same time slot: 11 a.m. to 2
p.m. PST. Compared to everything else that weekend, Fox's NHL
number is only slightly better than what CBS got for pro bowling on
May 30 from 2-3 p.m. PST (a 1.8 rating with a 5 share).
</P>
<P>
   Wilson might have unwittingly summed up the ratings problem when
he talked about the Capitals' postseason pairings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to the teams that we played, but we had a draw
that you dream about before the season,'' Wilson said. ``We didn't
have to face Philadelphia, New Jersey or Pittsburgh, the three
teams that really have given the Caps trouble over the years. I
think that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly helped the Capitals, but what's good for the Caps
might have poisoned the playoff ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, Devils and Penguins were the top three seeded teams
in the Eastern Conference. More important for the ratings, Philly
and Pittsburgh lay respective claim to Eric Lindros and Jaromir
Jagr, two good reasons to watch the playoffs. But the fourth-seeded
Capitals faced Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo. And aside from curious
fans who tuned in to see if Buffalo's Dominik Hasek could win this
year's version of hockey's triple crown (an Olympic gold medal, the
Hart trophy for MVP and a Stanley Cup), nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's the accidental playoff team vs. the defending
Stanley Cup champions. There's interest in Detroit, where buildings
and statues are draped in red and white. And there's interest from
die-hard fans nationwide, those of us who can't quit no matter how
bad it gets.
</P>
<P>
   But new fans have flown, shooed away by high ticket prices, a
too-rapid expansion resulting in mediocre teams and the NHL's
decision to broadcast February's Olympic games long after most
would-be fans were asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL is investing in new league-sponsored rinks nationwide to
attract new fans to the game, but that investment won't pay off for
years. Television won't attract new fans; they must first be
introduced to a live game.
</P>
<P>
   In an ESPN interview during intermission at a Caps-Sabres game
last week, new Caps fan President Clinton said, ``No offense to
ESPN, but this is the greatest game live.''
</P>
<P>
   Any hockey fan could've told him that. Is anyone telling the
NHL?
</P>
<P>
   __ Sore loser?: Dallas Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov was
arrested Sunday morning and charged with assaulting his wife,
according to police in Coppell, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov, 27, was charged with aggravated assault and family
violence, a second-degree felony. If convicted, he faces between
two and 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The alleged assault
occurred the day after the Stars were eliminated in the Western
Conference finals by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to Zubov's house after someone called 911 and then
hung up at 3:05 a.m. on Sunday. An initial investigation indicated
Zubov had brandished a kitchen knife during the assault. Police
wouldn't say if Zubov's wife, Irina, was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was the NHL's third-leading scorer among defensemen this
season with 10 goals and 47 assists in 73 games. He had four goals
and five assists in 17 playoff games, behind only Mike Modano in
team scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was released Sunday morning after posting a $5,000 bond.

CEDENO LEADS RANGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Reserve infielder Domingo Cedeno became a casualty of
overexposure during 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to second baseman Mark McLemore and infielder Bill
Ripken and the unacceptable performance of shortstop Benji Gil
forced Cedeno into a role not suited best for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a guy you want to play 140 games,'' Texas Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``Now, he's just one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, succeeding in his role as ``one of the guys,'' can
emerge as ``the'' guy on occasion. That occurred during the
Rangers' 3-1 victory Monday night against the Colorado Rockies at
Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, going 3-for-4, drove in all of the Rangers' runs and hit
what proved to be the game-winning, eighth-inning home run off
Rockies right-hander Pedro Astacio (4-8).
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who turned on a first-pitch fastball from Astacio, sent
it 398 feet and deposited it into the right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mingy was the offensive and defensive star of the game,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno's offensive performance would be all the firepower needed
by right-hander Aaron Sele (9-3), who joined Atlanta's Greg Maddux
as the major leagues' only nine-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who recorded six strikeouts in eight innings, refused to
let the reputation of Coors Field become his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't change the way I pitch,'' said Sele, who allowed only
one run on five singles and four walks. ``You really have to stay
aggressive. You just have to keep the ball down and move it in and
out. I seemed to miss down more than I missed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers closer John Wetteland, who last year failed to protect
two three-run leads at Coors Field, found himself in a little
trouble after allowing a one-out, ninth-inning single to right
fielder Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Todd Helton, the next batter, worked the count
full, but Wetteland retired the rookie on strikes with a 3-2
fastball and induced a game-ending line drive from pinch-hitter
Jeff Reed for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who gave Wetteland an extra run to work with after his
ninth-inning single scored first baseman Will Clark with the
Rangers' final run, can seemingly do no wrong right now.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, making his seventh consecutive start since shortstop
Kevin Elster sustained an injury to his left shoulder eight days
ago on the artificial turf of Tampa Bay's Tropicana Field, is
hitting .407 (11-for-27) with two home runs and eight runs batted
in during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno would be Astacio's primary antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio entered this appearance 4-7 with a 7.26 earned-run
average, but the struggling right-hander experienced his best
performance this season in his previous start Wednesday against the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio did not figure in the decision, but he allowed only two
runs on six hits and one walk and recorded a season-best nine
strikeouts in 72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers witnessed a similar display from Astacio, who
surrendered only one hit _ a double by none other than Sele _
during the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finally tagged Astacio for a run in the fifth inning
to tie the score, but wasted their opportunity for a bigger inning.
Catcher Ivan Rodriguez began the inning with a double to
left-center field and scored on the ensuing bloop single by Cedeno.
Third baseman Fernando Tatis drew a walk, which brought Sele to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies expected the attempted sacrifice bunt and defensed
it with the ``wheel,'' where both the first and third basemen
charge down the lines to field the bunt and the middle infielders
cover first and third base.
</P>
<P>
   Sele bunted the ball to Astacio, who wheeled and delivered an
accurate throw to shortstop Neifi Perez to retire Cedeno at third
base. Astacio then retired center fielder Tom Goodwin on strikes
for his fifth strikeout through five innings, and induced an
inning-ending ground ball from second baseman Luis Alicea.

ARMY IS REDESIGNING DIVISION, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without the Soviet Union to plan a war against, the
Army has redesigned its basic combat division and will announce its
new makeup on Tuesday, a congressional aide said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, speaking on the condition that he not be named, said
the Army had decided on a modest makeover, not a wholesale
retooling as some military experts had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the old troop strength of 18,000, the new division
will have just under 16,000 men, the aide said. The new division
will have fewer tanks and fewer Bradley Fighting Vehicles to carry
troops, but it will have more surveillance equipment and more
intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, which reported on the Army's forthcoming
announcement in Tuesday's issues, quoted an Army colonel as saying,
``In doing this redesign, we conducted probably the most intense
and thorough look that the Army has ever gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Army's position that the retooled division will be a
far better fighting force for the brushfire wars and rogue despots
the United States now has to worry about, some lawmakers are sure
to greet the announcement with skepticism, the congressional aide
said tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army missed an opportunity to transform its force
structure and gain some efficiencies,'' said the aide, who has
followed military affairs for years.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the new Army division should look like, he replied,
``smaller, more mobile, more lethal _ less logistically intense.''
By that last phrase, he said he meant even fewer heavy vehicles
carrying heavy artillery. The Army's redesign of its division,
which is the building block for combat, has been under way for
several years.

ZUBOV CASE TO GO TO DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODAY, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Paperwork for the assault case against Stars defenseman Sergei
Zubov is expected to go to the district attorney Tuesday and a
preliminary hearing could be set, said Wade Goolsby, a supervising
captain for the Coppell, Texas, Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of aggravated
assault-family violence, a second-degree felony, police reports
said. If convicted, Zubov could face two to 20 years in prison and
a $10,000 fine, Goolsby said.
</P>
<P>
   A 911 hangup call prompted police to go to Zubov's Coppell home
at 3:05 a.m. Sunday. An initial investigation indicated that Zubov
had brandished a kitchen knife during an alleged assault involving
his wife, Irina, Goolsby said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov was released Sunday morning after posting a $5,000 bail,
Goolsby said.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be turned over to the Dallas County District
Attorney's office. SURGERIES AWAIT
</P>
<P>
   The Stars expect to have at least four players undergo surgery
in the next two weeks, coach Ken Hitchcock said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Richard Matvichuk is expected to undergo major knee
surgery to replace the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
Matvichuk played the second half of the season without the ligament
and will have it replaced by one from a cadaver. Matvichuk is in
contract negotiations with the Stars and could wait until he has a
contract before he has the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for minor surgery are goalie Ed Belfour, who is
expected to have arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder; goalie Manny
Fernandez, who is expected to undergo minor wrist surgery; and
defenseman Craig Muni, who is expected to have arthroscopic surgery
on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctor Dan Cooper has a speaking engagement in late June,
so surgeries will likely be performed before June 21.

JAZZ FIGHTING TO REGAIN A LITTLE RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 FINALS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A week ago, the Utah Jazz was fighting for an NBA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ in the wake of Sunday's humiliating loss to the Chicago
Bulls _ the Jazz is suddenly fighting for respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun came up and today's another day,'' Jazz point guard
John Stockton said Monday. ``That game's behind us and we're headed
back to the drawing board.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 96-54 loss in Game 3 in which the Jazz set records
for worst margin of defeat and fewest points in a game, there is
not only precedence _ but a trend _ to suggest the Jazz can bounce
back in tomorrow night's Game 4 at the United Center. Consider: The
previous four teams to lose a Finals game by at least 33 points
regrouped to win the next game, including the Portland Trail
Blazers against the Bulls in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pretty sure that they want to redeem themselves,''
Michael Jordan said of the Jazz. ``It was a very embarrassing
moment for them. We expect a great effort from them, so this is no
time to start feeling smug about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling smug, disinterested or hung over, Bulls forward Dennis
Rodman epitomized Chicago's comfort level by choosing not to attend
Monday's practice. The Jazz, meanwhile, used the day to begin the
chore of turning psychological baggage into motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing to lose sleep over,'' Jazz center Greg Ostertag
said. ``We had a bad game and we got our butts kicked. Doesn't mean
the series is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said jokingly: ``We watched the film and
it was very exciting. Like watching cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Bulls smelling blood only two wins from their sixth
title in eight years, the Jazz must find a way to win one of the
next two games and send the series back to Salt Lake City. No team
has ever swept the three middle games of the 2-3-2 format, but
neither has a team rallied from 2-1 down in the past 13 years.
Moreover, no team has ever come back from 3-1 down to win the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about all that stuff,'' Karl Malone said. ``The
way we played, we just need to worry about the way we come out. If
we play the same, we'll get killed again.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, unlike the versatile and interchangeable Bulls, the
Jazz is not quick to make major adjustments. The Jazz base its
chances on Malone, the pick-and-roll and a deep bench. After the
Game 2 loss, for example, Sloan's only move was to insert Ostertag
at center for Greg Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan realizes, however, his team must find a way to combat and
attack Chicago's aggressive defense, which has used Scottie Pippen
as a floating free safety to keep Utah from setting up the
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the defense they're playing,'' Sloan said, ``they've kind
of got us in a trick box.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid going back to Utah in a wooden box, the Jazz will try
using revenge and history to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches didn't like the way Chicago's reserves ran
up the score in Sunday's fourth quarter, shooting _ and making _
four 3-pointers after the lead had swelled to 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they were having fun,'' Malone said. ``But over here on
our side, our coach would have a fit if we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz also has experience in rallying from a lopsided defeat.
The Jazz shot 28 percent and scored a then-playoff record 62 points
in a 21-point loss to the San Antonio Spurs in Game 3 of the
Western Conference semifinals on May 9. The next night, Malone made
his first eight shots and scored 35 points as Utah won by 11 to
take a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only 2-1,'' Malone reminded. ``It was a bad game, but
it's gone. And it only counts as one. I expect us to be ready for
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent NBA Finals history also likes Utah's chances. In '92,
Portland dropped Game 1 by 33, only to recover and win Game 2 by 11
in overtime. The '82 Lakers, '84 Celtics and '85 Lakers all lost
games by at least 33 before rallying to win the next game in the
series.

RODMAN FOLLOWS STERLING EFFORT BY FAILING TO SHOW FOR PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Dennis Rodman turned Karl Malone into a no-show Sunday
night. Monday, Rodman become one himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of shutting down the Utah Jazz's leading scorer
over the final 39 minutes of Chicago's 96-54 victory, Rodman missed
Chicago's practice at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not here,'' Bulls coach Phil Jackson said. ``I think
something happened between the game last night and this morning. He
called at practice and said he got up late, his alarm clock didn't
work or something.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bulls scratch their heads in frustration over the
timing of Rodman's absence, they admit they are by now used to it.
So much so, in fact, that Jackson said Rodman likely wouldn't be
fined or punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think punishment is necessary,'' Jackson said. ``He
just says `Fine, punish me. I don't care.' There's some dysfunction
there, but he's a very functional player.''
</P>
<P>
   Said teammate Scottie Pippen, ``We are used to it. He'll show up
\Rtoday\S with some lame excuse. But we've always let Dennis have
his way.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy, however, is reaching all-time leniency during
the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman _ sporting a hairdo featuring black-and-Rodzilla-green
splotches _ routinely shows up for games an hour before tipoff
despite a mandatory 90-minute reporting time for other players.
During pregame introductions and the first minutes of the game,
Rodman remains in the locker room, staying loose until Jackson nods
for a security guard to summon him into the game. And after Game 1
of the Finals, Rodman jetted to Las Vegas for a night of partying
and gambling with Jackson's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is going to be Dennis,'' Michael Jordan said. ``We just
need him to be ready and focused when the game arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has done that. Guarded by Rodman, Malone went 0-of-4
in the second half of Game 2 and missed three of five shots in the
final 39 minutes of Game 3 after a 6-of-6 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' Jackson said of Rodman. ``He's
really kind of disrupting Karl's flow and that's as key for us as
anything else.'' RUNNING OF THE BULLS
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Malone will get reserve Jud Buechler's name correct after
the Bulls' reserve made two fourth-quarter 3-pointers in Game 3.
Malone has been calling Buechler ``Jed'' the entire series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Buechler said, ``I'm just glad he's trying to
talk about me at all.'' ALL THAT JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   The ironic part of coach Jerry Sloan's lifestyle change in the
wake of wife Bobbye's battle against breast cancer? Instead of
staying out ruining his health by drinking and smoking cigarettes,
Sloan now accompanies his wife out to clog his arteries by eating
nachos and ice cream. JORDAN WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Jordan continues to take a wait-and-see approach toward coming
back next season. He will, however, play in Texas at least one more
time. Jordan and teammate Ron Harper are committed to playing in a
charity game June 22 at Southwest Texas State in San Marcos. The
game, organized by 10-year veteran NFL receiver Eric Martin, also
is scheduled to include Mavericks Michael Finley, Robert Pack and
Erick Strickland. INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   People on the waiting list for Bulls' season tickets: 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone's times to score more than 23 points in nine Finals
games against Chicago: 1.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's turnovers in Game 3: 26, another Finals record. THE
FINALS SCENE
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder performed the national anthem
before Game 3. Movie critic Gene Siskel and controversial talk-show
host Jerry Springer were spotted in court-side seats. ... The
Mavericks will be spared playing in Mexico City next season. That
duty will belong to the Spurs and Clippers. The Mavericks lost to
the Rockets before a sellout of more than 20,000 in Mexico City in
December. ... The Bulls claim Jazz fans threw coins at them as they
left the floor at halftime of Game 2. After their Game 3 implosion,
the Jazz would welcome any sort of change. ... Buzz around Chicago
is not only about the Bulls, but also the rise of 6-foot-10 German
Dirk Nowitzki in the June 24 draft. Nowitzki, only 19, has scouts
salivating with his point-guard skills and power forward body. Most
commonly heard rumor: The Mavericks, owners of the sixth pick, are
touting Saint Louis guard Larry Hughes as a smokescreen in order to
get their hands on Nowitzki. He is considered the best German
prospect since Detlef Schrempf, but isn't he also the only one
since Schrempf? HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``They could suit up Helen Keller and win at this point. They're
that good.'' _ Nets All-Star forward Jayson Williams on the Bulls.

DECISIONS REACHED IN ACCOUNT REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three advertisers have named agencies to handle accounts.
</P>
<P>
   AMF Bowling Inc. in Richmond chose Richards Group in Dallas for
its account, with billings of about $10 million to $15 million. The
account had been handled by Mumford Marketing in Richmond, which
will continue to handle promotional projects. A monthlong review
had been narrowed to Richards and Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis,
a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wyndham Resorts in Dallas, part of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts,
selected Harris Drury Cohen in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as the first
agency to handle its account. Billings were estimated at $10
million. The two-month review had been narrowed to Harris Drury and
three other finalists: Richards Group, which continues to handle
the Wyndham Hotels account; Yesawich, Pepperdine &AMP; Brown in
Orlando, Fla., and the Zimmerman Agency in Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrew Jergens Co. in Cincinnati, a unit of the Kao Corp.,
decided to keep Bozell Worldwide in New York, part of True North
Communications, as the creative agency for Curel moisturizing
lotion. Though billings were not disclosed, trade publications
estimated them at $10 million. Jergens bought Curel last month from
Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which had used Bozell to handle the brand's creative
duties since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at Siegel &AMP; Gale, the corporate identity company
in New York, have agreed to buy the company from Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
PLC for $33.8 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 13 successful years as part of the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
group of companies, now is the right time for Siegel &AMP; Gale to
become independent again,'' said Alan Siegel, chairman and chief
executive at Siegel &AMP; Gale, which has 275 employees and revenue of
$33.6 million from clients like AT&AMP;T, American Express and IBM.
Siegel, 59, will continue in his posts. Scott Lerman, 39, managing
director, becomes president, succeeding Kenneth Morris, 53, who
will leave to become chairman and chief executive at Lightbulb
Press, a publishing company in New York.

DODGERS HAVE TROUBLE PLAYING CATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's unlikely Mark McGwire could have done more
damage to the Los Angeles Dodgers last week than rookie Blake Stein
did Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, part of the big McGwire trade last July between Oakland
and St. Louis, took advantage of a rare Charles Johnson error and
came within two outs of a complete game to beat the Dodgers 7-3 in
front of 27,027, the second smallest Dodger Stadium crowd this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Stein (2-3) strike out 10, allow just five hits and
one walk, he halted any momentum the Dodgers gained by taking two
of three over the weekend in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He out-pitched the Dodgers hottest starter, Ramon Martinez.
Stein humbled the Dodgers in the first of a six-game home stand
against sub-.500 opponents, against which the club was hoping to
get back into the NL West race.
</P>
<P>
   Stein left after Eric Karros hit a two-run homer in the ninth.
But for the Dodgers it was too little too late. They now trail
division-leading San Francisco by 8{ games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing better, this is only one game,'' Martinez said.
``We faced a good pitcher, but we'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Karros' homer, Stein's only mistake was a fifth-inning
home run to another emerging rookie Paul Konerko, who now has eight
RBI in his past three games. Konerko also singled to open the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (7-3) was in search of his sixth consecutive victory,
but he never got on track in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was undone in one out into the game on an error by Johnson,
after former Dodger Mike Blowers hit a perfect double-play
comebacker to the mound with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez fielded it and threw to the plate, but the ball ticked
off the glove of Johnson, who won a Gold Glove last year. It was
his fourth error this season _ after not making any a year ago. Two
runs scored on the play, leading to four runs (three unearned) in
the inning. The Dodgers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I could have gotten out of the first inning,''
Martinez said. ``It was just a little thing, but it turned out to
be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed. As part of the big May 15 Mike Piazza trade,
Johnson's defense behind the plate was a critical ingredient to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it, but when I went to squeeze it, I lost
it,'' Johnson said. ``It was the type of play where I should have
gotten him out of the jam. It could have really changed the outcome
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who walked five and allowed six hits and four earned
runs, was not on his game from the start. Before Johnson's error,
Martinez loaded the bases with two walks and a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   He did the same thing in his previous start last Wednesday
against the Cardinals, but he recovered to allow one run in seven
innings. He also walked five in that game and now has 16 in three
starts since his brilliant 7-1 victory May 23 at Arizona, when he
retired 24 consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cardinals, who were playing without the injured
McGwire, the Dodgers scored seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to worry about the walks,'' Martinez said. ``I
always walk guys. As long as we're winning, walks don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mark Guthrie didn't fare much better, allowing a
three-run homer to Jason Giambi in the seventh to complete
Oakland's scoring.
</P>
<P>
   After Karros opened the second inning with a single, Stein
retired the next 11 Dodgers, seven by strikeouts. Konerko then
homered with two outs in the fifth, but Stein struck out Johnson to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who made his major-league debut May 10 against the
Chicago White Sox, was routed by the Angels 12-2 on May 21 at
Edison Field. But against the Dodgers he was masterful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to be aggressive, throwing fastballs, mixing
in sliders at certain times,'' Stein said. ``I went out there
tonight, tried to stay focused. I was able to concentrate the whole
night.''
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a single to Eric Young with one out in the sixth but
got Jose Vizcaino to fly to left and Gary Sheffield, the Dodgers
hottest hitter, to pop to short.

BULLS BUILDING CASE FOR ANOTHER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Michael Jordan and his Bulls don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing out the Jazz like that. Making a mockery out of the
hardest-working, most efficient squad in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   All of that Jud Buechler, Randy Brown and Bill Wennington
romping and running up the score in the fourth quarter of the
Bulls' crushing 96-54 victory in Game 3 at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   All with Jordan and Scottie Pippen on the bench, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   What the Bulls did to the Jazz Sunday makes you think the Bulls
don't understand: The world was ready for their fall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jordan, Pippen and coach Phil Jackson totally seasoned
us for that. All year, the mainstays in the five-time champion
Bulls have bullhorned a single message: ``We're done. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cite whatever factor you want. There were so many signaling the
end.
</P>
<P>
   The Dennis Rodman Insanity Scenario. The Pippen ``Trade Me''
Impasse. The Jackson ``I Won't Be Back'' Action. The Jordan Bet
Hedging, since if Jackson's not back, forget about the greatest
player in the galaxy doing his caped crusader routine any longer in
the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the soap opera sub-plots is the power struggle by
Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause
seeking to glom control and glory of a franchise that is all thanks
to the uniqueness of Jordan and Co.
</P>
<P>
   But what if this is the time and place for the tune of doom to
change? What if the tone of these Finals was set by the Bulls' Game
2 win in Salt Lake City and then amplified by the Game 3 whipping?
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls are champs again, especially with such ease as a
42-point slaughter like Sunday, maybe there is wiggle room for
another shot at it all. Maybe it won't be impossible to sign up
Jordan, Pippen and Jackson for another tour of championship duty.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf is now apparently putting the onus on Jackson about
whether he will be part of another Bulls' run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil (Jackson) has done a great job for us, and if he changes
his mind and wants to come back, I'll be open to discussing it with
him, absolutely,'' are Reinsdorf's reported latest words on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Jackson is willing to eat his words about not coming
back; or, if there's an NBA season after the impending July 1
lockout; or, if Reinsdorf is willing to fire Krause _ all big
``ifs'' _ the door is open for a Bulls Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, the possibility of another Bulls title defense is more
than any of us expected. We have been so thoroughly prepared for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to Sir Air, but psychologically, emotionally,
intestinally we have expected that this would be the dynasty's
faltering last dance.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the NBA Finals, the magnitude of Jordan's persona
outside of the NBA became the main topic of the free world. Forget
the sports pages, much bigger guns were sent to chronicle The
Jordan Effect in two separate publications.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest issue, Fortune Magazine reports that Jordan is
nothing less than a $10 billion man if you account for his total
trickle-down effect.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1 issue of the New Yorker, meanwhile, provided a
masterpiece essay by Harvard sociologist Henry Louis Gates, Jr.,
describing how Jordan has blown to smithereens the standard of
product branding, thus making himself the biggest marketing force
ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Gates provided some of the most compelling quotes
from Jordan, especially in regard to Jordan's disgust with
Reinsdorf and Krause and their unending need to seize the power and
the glory for the Bulls that Jordan created.
</P>
<P>
   After signing his $30-million-plus contract for this season,
Jordan made this damning statement about Reinsdorf:
</P>
<P>
   ``We shook hands, but one comment struck me as we left and I
lost total respect for him when he said it: `At some point in time,
I know I'm going to regret what we just did,''' Jordan was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm saying (to myself) all these years where you knew I
was underpaid and you've been making money and your organization
has moved from a $15 million business when you bought it to $200
million _ all those years have just gone down the drain because you
have for once finally paid me my value. And you regret that! That
hit me so deep inside _ that sense of greed, of disrespect for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such articles and comments seem like compelling evidence that
Jordan the marketing and cultural phenomenon no longer needs to be
the greatest NBA player who ever lived. He won't stand for the
Bulls brass disrespecting him.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the overwhelming Bulls, especially in Games 2
and 3, you get a different sense of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jordan does need to play hoops. He needs to win. It is
his ultimate reward. That's why he was giggling with Pippen during
the fourth quarter when his Bulls were blowing away what everyone
expected to be the Bulls' stiffest competition.
</P>
<P>
   Here's betting that barring a season-long lockout in 1998-99,
Jordan and the Bulls run again. They have grown to love the misery
of their twisted club dynamics. In fact, with such wins as 96-54
over the Jazz, you could say Jordan and his Bulls thrive on their
over-dramatized adversity.

M'S ADDICTED TO SPRINGER SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is midnight on a weekday in Seattle. Do you know
where your All-Star center fielder is?
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's extra innings or nine extra-long innings to be
played, Ken Griffey Jr. insists he's easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in bed watching `The Jerry Springer Show' on Channel 10,''
he says with a smirk. ``I watch it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season chalk full of inconsistency, of bullpen blowups and
endless fielding errors, Jerry Springer remains the lone constant
and a rallying cry for the Mariners. Most players are devoted fans,
treating the bawdy trash-talking, fist-swinging talk show as a
daily, or late-night, ritual.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, watching a mid-afternoon Springer episode is nearly
as important in terms of pregame preparation as taking batting
practice. Mesmerized Seattle players often are joined in front of a
clubhouse television by coaches, trainers and clubhouse personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's on,'' second baseman Joey Cora announces, emerging
from the training room in Kansas City, imploring teammates to
gather around him. ``Wives battle mistresses'' soon flashes on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry,'' third baseman Russ Davis chants
quietly while seated in the club's Kingdome dugout and broached
about the subject. The Springer show that day is centered around a
man who claims to have married his pet horse.
</P>
<P>
   Cora has suggested that the next time the Mariners are in
Chicago, where the show is taped, the players obtain tickets and
become part of the studio audience. Griffey asks why stop there? We
could be disfunctional guests as well as anyone, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of the Mariners' allegiance to the show, Springer
spokeswoman Linda Shafran says the talk-show host is flattered.
Springer is a big sports fan whose favorite team is a Mariner
rival, the New York Yankees. Pictures of Mickey Mantle and Yogi
Berra hang in his office wall. His following cuts a wide swath
through professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Springer has met members of the Houston Rockets, unabashed
viewers. He has learned that the Los Angeles Lakers, most notably
Shaquille O'Neal, share a deep affection for his show. Anaheim
Angels players showed up in The Windy City for a recent taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love hearing the Mariners are huge fans,'' Shafron said.
``Right back at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the show will be on summer hiatus when the
Mariners return to Chicago in mid-August, preventing a studio
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Their television fix will have to do for now. It fills a
definite void in the otherwise mundane existence of today's
millionaire ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' Davis said. ``When there's nothing else on
TV and you can't sleep, it's good entertainment _ people up there
making fools of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Said first baseman David Segui: ``I think most athletes like to
watch it and see people air their dirty laundry. You can give a
good ass-whipping without getting thrown in jail. I'm definitely
fascinated by the bizarre things in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But no more than Cora. The diminutive infielder appears to be
the Mariners' biggest Springer fan. When two people start to tangle
on the screen, he becomes the most animated watcher, leaping from
his seat on the clubhouse couch in excited fashion, gesturing
approvingly at the crass and unusual. He has informed teammates he
would like to be a guest bouncer for Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed about this by an outsider, Cora isn't quite so
forthcoming. With his Vanderbilt University background, it's
possible he has a cerebral image to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' he says of the show. ``I don't watch it.
It's (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, however, has nothing to hide. He isn't afraid to admit
he owns six copies of Springer's ``Too Hot For TV'' video. He
routinely watches the nightly Channel 10 offerings. His wife joins
him. Jer-ry, Jer-ry, Jer-ry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's fun,'' Griffey says. ``What else is there to do late
at night?''

MARINERS FALL INTO LAST PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a game where inches mattered and breaks meant
even more, the Mariners on Monday night tumbled into a place they
hadn't visited in nearly three years _ the American League West
basement.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a well-pitched game from Randy Johnson, who struck out
at least 10 batters for the 88th time in his career, and Joey
Cora's four hits could save the Mariners. Just-misses and a
controversial call by the first base umpire helped settle the
surging San Francisco Giants' 4-3 victory before 34,166 fans at
3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won their 10th straight. The Mariners have lost seven
of eight and dropped into last place for the first time since July
16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're scuffling and we need all the breaks we can get,''
manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   They could have used a break _ or accurate call _ in the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cora led off the inning with a grounder to Rich Aurilia at deep
shortstop. He clearly beat the throw to first base, but first-base
umpire Sam Holbrook called Cora out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The replays showed it wasn't really that close,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cora jumped up and down, got in the umpire's face, and was
ejected. Piniella rushed onto the field from the dugout, slammed
his cap to the ground, kicked the dirt (he might also have kicked
Holbrook) and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the leadoff guy on base in the ninth, you have a
chance,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Giants reliever Rich Rodriguez used the break to begin a
three-up, three-down ninth to register his first save of the
season, ending it by striking out Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the (expletive) game,'' said Cora, whose ejection was
the second of his career in 1,036 regular-season games. ``He called
me out and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who erased two-thirds of a three-run deficit in
the seventh inning on Alex Rodriguez's one-out, two-run single, put
the tying run on third in the eight inning when Glenallen Hill
doubled and advanced on Russ Davis' infield out. But Edgar
Martinez, pinch-hitting for Johnson, grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never got another chance to bat or pitch, departing with
his fifth loss in 10 decisions despite allowing six hits, walking
three and striking out 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't faced him since '92 and he looked the same to me,''
said Giants first baseman Charlie Hayes. ``He threw me one fastball
and I grounded out. He threw me nothing but sliders after that and
they were all good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (Mariners) don't want him, we'll take him and I don't
care if he can't hit,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   The only shaky inning Johnson pitched was decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired the first six batters he faced, striking out
two, but Rich Aurilia's fifth homer of the season ignited a
three-run Giants rally that was given a boost when Davis made
another error.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has a team-leading 15 errors, couldn't handle Brian
Johnson's hot grounder immediately after Aurilia's homer. Two outs
later, Bill Mueller singled, Barry Bonds walked and Jeff Kent
slapped a two-run double to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, shading Kent to right, attempted a diving catch, but
the ball ticked off his glove and rolled toward right fielder Rob
Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior made a helluva effort,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco tacked on another run in the fifth inning, taking
advantage of another ball that had just enough room to elude a
Mariner glove.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Mariner Alex Diaz singled, Mueller walked and Bonds hit a
run-scoring single between first baseman Jeff Huson and Cora.
</P>
<P>
   The seeing-eye single drove in Diaz for the eventual deciding
run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired the next three batters to escape further damage,
but it would prove to be too big of a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle opened the 10-game road trip with two of its best
hitters in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui missed his second straight start because of badly
bruised right foot and Martinez didn't start for two reasons: the
designated hitter rule isn't used in National League ballparks and
Martinez hasn't played in the field for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella figured Martinez might be a defensive liability,
especially when Johnson attempted pickoff throws, so he started
Huson at first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored first, grabbing a 1-0 lead in the second
inning when Ducey led off with a double past Hayes and Davis
delivered a one-out double to left.
</P>
<P>
   After Johnson struck out, Cora hit the second of his four
consecutive singles. But a dandy defensive play by Kent saved a
run. Kent, running to his right, dove and smothered the ball before
it could scoot into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had to stop at third and went no further.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Darwin escaped the inning by retiring Huson on a fly to
Bonds in left field. The Mariners would put runners on third base
in the third and second base in the fifth, and third again in the
eighth but failed to get any of them home.

GIANTS MASTER BIG UNIT 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Nothing was cheap about the nine-game winning
streak the Giants brought into interleague play Monday night,
except the salaries of most of the pitchers they beat. Willie
Blair, Omar Daal, Jeff Suppan, Eddie Priest, Scott Winchester,
Brett Tomko, Kent Bottenfield, Sean Lowe and Kent Mercker are fine
athletes all, but they are not Randy Johnson.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Randy Johnson is Randy Johnson, and Monday night the Giants
beat him as well. Anyone who still thought this run of victories
was a product of weak competition, even after the sweep in St.
Louis, must think again.
</P>
<P>
   The streak is 10 after a 4-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners,
who dropped into the AL West cellar. A vocal crowd of 34,166
witnessed the Giants triumph for the 16th time in their past 19
games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Johnson (5-5, 5.34 ERA) is not the pitcher he once was.
Giants manager Dusty Baker begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like Randy Johnson to me,'' Baker said. ``He made
pitches when he needed to make them. That was a big two-out,
bases-loaded double by Jeff Kent. If he hadn't hit that, we might
still be playing. Randy Johnson looked fine to me. I'm sure a lot
of people would take Randy Johnson old, new, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent's double on an 0-2 pitch in the third inning capped a
three-run rally off Johnson, who struck out 10 in seven innings.
That gave the Giants a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Given how hard Johnson throws, Kent must be saluted for his
ability to stay aggressive with two strikes and drive that pitch
into right-center. Ken Griffey Jr. dived for the ball, but it
deflected off his glove. It is common to swing defensively on an
0-2 pitch. Kent laughed when asked why he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got quite a few strikeouts. I don't think I'm very
defensive,'' he said. ``I swing the bat. When you've got a guy
throwing 95 mph, it's hard to be defensive. You've got to be
aggressive. If you become defensive as a hitter against Randy
Johnson, you'll lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lost in part because Mariners third baseman Russ Davis
committed his team-leading 15th error, on a bouncer by Brian
Johnson after Rich Aurilia tied the game 1-1 with a homer leading
off the third.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Bill Mueller singled, Barry Bonds walked to load
the bases, and Kent hit his double. Bonds singled home another run
in the fifth inning, and the Giants withstood a two-run single by
Alex Rodriguez in the seventh off Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Rodriguez earned his first save, getting Griffey (0-for-5)
to whiff at a low, outside slider to end the game. The winner was
Danny Darwin (6-3), the Middle-Aged Unit, who more than held his
own against the Big Unit for 61/3 innings with his typical
underpowering stuff that leaves hitters mumbling, ``How'd he do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Darwin retired Griffey twice on popups, once on a long fly to
right and once on a grounder to second. The latter came with the
Giants leading 4-1, two Mariners on and nobody out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Baker then summoned Reed, and Darwin got a huge ovation as he
strode to the dugout before Alex Rodriguez hit his two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big swingers, a great fastball-hitting team,'' said
Rich Rodriguez, who got the save opportunity because Baker insisted
on resting an overworked Robb Nen. ``We talked in the meeting
before the game about keeping them off-balance, mixing up location.
It's one thing to say it, it's another to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the left-hander retired Griffey to end the game, the fans
got to see quite an explosion of anger from the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Joey Cora led off the ninth with a grounder deep
into the hole at short. Aurilia's throw seemed very late, and Cora
thought he had his fifth hit. When vacation-replacement umpire Sam
Holbrook called Cora out, the diminutive Mariner went bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook ejected Cora, who had to be restrained, and the ump
quickly thumbed a charging Mariners manager Lou Piniella as well.
But that was as explosive as Seattle got.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who came to see Griffey hit homers should have been there
for batting practice, when he popped three into the upper deck.
Randy Johnson hit a homer in batting practice, too, drawing cheers
from the crowd, but his three at-bats in the game were different
matter. He threw his bat into the dirt chasing strike three in the
third inning, managed a grounder to second in the fourth and forgot
to run when he hit a comebacker to Darwin in the sixth.

STEIN BESTS MARTINEZ, TAMES L.A. 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until recently, towering right-hander Blake Stein
seemed all too likely to end up as part of one of the great
thwap-to-the-head baseball trivia questions of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you name  &LR; one  &LR; of the three pitchers sent to Oakland in
the 1997 Mark McGwire trade with the Cardinals?''
</P>
<P>
   The way Stein pitched Monday night in the A's 7-3 win, the
Dodgers aren't going to forget his name any time soon. Stein, 24,
struck out a career-high 10, missed a complete game by two outs,
and thoroughly outclassed no less a pitcher than Ramon Martinez,
ending Martinez's five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give credit to that guy Stein,'' Martinez (7-3)
said. ``He pitched a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros nailed a fastball that Stein (2-3) left where he
shouldn't have in the ninth for a two-run homer. That forced
manager Art Howe to send in Billy Taylor for the last two outs. And
Paul Konerko hit a solo shot in the fifth, too. But none of that
mattered. The A's won for the fourth time in five games and hopped
past the Mariners to claim sole possession of third place in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was in command once Charles Johnson, considered the best
defensive catcher in the National League, muffed a potential double
play at the plate in the first inning. Johnson let Martinez's throw
on Mike Blowers' comebacker get past him, two runs scored on the
play, and the A's were off and running to a four-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have had it,'' Johnson said. ``I thought I had it,
but when I went to squeeze it I lost it. It was the type of play
where I should have got Ramon out of the jam. It really could have
changed the outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's (27-34) keep saying they're going to stop letting
themselves down and put a hot streak together, and after a game
like this, it's easy to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi blasted a three-run homer in the seventh to put the
A's in potential-rout mode. Miguel Tejada banged out two hits and
roamed the infield like a 21-year-old who knows he's in charge. Ben
Grieve cranked two doubles and a single. And old-reliable Matt
Stairs missed a sign in the seventh and laid down his first
sacrifice bunt in an A's uniform to put runners at second and
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was kind of confused, the way he kept looking down
to third base,'' Howe said. ``He got them over, so I wasn't too
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein had a lead before he ever took the mound, looking a lot
taller than 6-foot-7, and he was smarter than your average rookie
in doing something with it. He worked a one-two-three first, helped
by Blowers' excellent play on Gary Sheffield's scorcher down the
line; struck out Raul Mondesi and Bobby Bonilla back-to-back in the
second; and struck out the side in the third, finishing off the
trick by getting leadoff man Eric Young with a nasty breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something kicked in,'' Howe said. ``He had extra hop on his
fastball. It's got to give you a boost, knowing you're throwing the
ball by some of the best hitters in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla probably summed up the mood of the night best in the
fifth after he struck out for the second time. Stein floated a
breaking ball past him for his seventh strikeout, and Bonilla
didn't even uncork himself from his all-out swing before he stared
out at the mound with a ``Who IS this guy?'' look.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really took it to us,'' Young said. ``Even if we had a
scouting report, he was coming at us with two pitches, a fastball
and a slider. He did a good job moving them in and out.''

BAPTIST EFFORT TO CONVERT JEWS IN FULL SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON LATTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ His job is to turn American Jews into
evangelical Christians, but James Sibley says the Jewish community
should not fear his controversial calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Jews are becoming Christians by the thousands,''
says Sibley, hired by the Southern Baptists as their national
consultant on Jewish evangelism. ``They are becoming nothing by the
thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley says secularism, not Christianity, is the main threat to
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the Southern Baptist move has enraged American
Jewish leaders, who call it an insult and major setback for
interfaith relations. Abraham Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League, says the church's 2-year-old effort to
convert Jews reminds him of the Holocaust and calls it ``an affront
to the memory of those who were murdered by intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Baptists are holding their national convention in
Salt Lake City, where thousands of voting ``messengers'' have
gathered to set policy for this increasingly fundamentalist
Christian church. Their three-day assembly begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, an advance team of Baptist missionaries _
including Sibley _ knocked on doors, held revival meetings and
flooded the Utah media with a $600,000 advertising campaign to
evangelize the Mormon majority around the Great Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, at a similar church gathering in New Orleans, it
was the Jews who got the Baptists unwanted evangelical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, a Dallas native who says the Lord called him to
evangelize the Israelites, was author of a resolution calling on
the 16 million-member church to ``direct our energies and resources
toward the proclamation of the Gospel to the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also hired to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons are not viewed by us as the enemy. Neither are Jews,''
Sibley said. ``This is not some kind of anti-Semitism. We believe
Jesus is the Messiah and the only way of salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, said the Baptist effort to convert Jews has been a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not produced the surge of new converts that the
Southern Baptists hoped for,'' Harris said in a telephone
interview. ``It is especially unfortunate that to affirm their own
beliefs they have to deny the beliefs of others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is a nonproselytizing religion,'' he added. ``But they
see Jews as fair game and the ultimate prize.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 50 years since the Holocaust, mainline Christian churches
have stopped talking about converting Jews, although aggressive
evangelical groups like the San Francisco organization ``Jews for
Jesus'' have continued the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Many mainline theologians now speak of ``dual-covenant
theology,'' the idea that both Christians and Jews have an equal
and valid pact with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slick idea, but based on human reason rather than the
word of God,'' replied Sibley. ``Jesus is the only way of
salvation, for all men, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley sat in the lobby of the Little America Hotel in Salt
Lake, where small groups of Baptist missionaries gathered to plot
out their Utah crusade.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken man with a Southern accent, small mustache and
receding hairline, Sibley has wanted to convert Jews since he was
14 years old and read the Book of Ezekiel, Chapter 2, Verse 3.
``Mortal, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of
rebels who have rebelled against me,'' that passage reads. ``They
and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this very
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley moved to Israel and spent 14 years there, raising his two
children in the Jewish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 Southern Baptist meeting in New Orleans, Sibley
spent four years trying to get church leaders to consider his plan
for Jewish evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are addressing something that has been neglected for a long
time,'' he said. ``There had never been a course in our seminaries
on Jewish evangelism, although we had courses on Muslim evangelism
and Eastern religions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new job with the Southern Baptist's North American
Mission Board, Sibley is organizing intensive seminary courses and
visiting Southern Baptist congregations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   His main goal is to teach other Southern Baptists ``how to share
the Gospel in a way the Jewish people can hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's boss, Phil Roberts, director of interfaith witness
evangelism for the Georgia mission board, said the program is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have growing numbers of messianic congregations _ Jewish
churches that meet on Saturday and follow Jewish tradition, study
Hebrew, maintain ties with the Jewish tradition, yet confess that
Jesus is the Messiah,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the American Jewish Committee leader, called the idea of
modern-day Jewish Christians ``tragically flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One either accepts Jesus and is a Christian,'' he said, ``or
chooses not to recognize Jesus as the Messiah and is not a
Christian.''

INTERNETTERS PUT A TWIST IN WEDDING TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June, many young couples turn their attentions to weddings _
the invitations, the decorations, the band, the food, the
bridesmaids, the bar, the federal agents, the cake....
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents? Well, not genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents are part of one creative couple's plan. They have
designed a wedding on an X Files theme, after the hit TV series and
coming movie about strange space aliens and even stranger law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cerulean blue bridesmaids' dresses, the groom's men in
trenchcoats, masking tape X's on the chapel windows,'' a dreamer
posted in the Usenet newsgroup alt.wedding. It's an Internet site
where people post questions and advice about weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Not marriages. Weddings. They trade chat about marriages over in
soc.couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implants in the back of the neck of every member of the
wedding party,'' another contributor chimed in, picking up the
thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridesmaids carry badges instead of bouquets and walk down the
aisle chanting `FBI.' Put the bridesmaids in scrubs and a white lab
coat, hair in a ponytail, tortoiseshell glasses. No bed in the
honeymoon suite, just a couch. The bride's dance with Dad is
`Beyond the Sea.' As favors, give little metal cylinders that have
nasty pointy things spring out when a button is pushed. And of
course the bride walks down the aisle to the haunting, whistled X
Files theme!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe invitations that look like a subpoena?
</P>
<P>
   Where this wedding is to take place isn't clear. Contributors to
Usenet groups can be anywhere in the world. Probably not a major
place of worship of any mainstream sect. Well, maybe California.
</P>
<P>
   Other typical wedding-interest postings:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm looking for some amusement park or county fair type
touches for our reception. We were thinking about cotton candy and
caramel apples for snacks or favors. Any ideas what to put on the
tables?'' Sure, someone replied. Shop hobby shops for model
railroad stuff, like Ferris wheels.
</P>
<P>
   And have a small rubber duck at each place setting, another
contributor suggested, and the one with a star on the bottom takes
the centerpiece home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it a good idea in these modern times for the bride and
groom to live together for a while before the wedding? The question
gets asked two or three times a year in alt.wedding, and always
starts a weeks-long argument.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent posting from a bride offered new insight. Yes, she
said, and no only that, they should buy a house first. ``Now, that
was a stress inducing event that tops planning any wedding!'' she
said. ``Not only do you have to test how compatible you are, but
you have to test making compromises for the good of the
relationship, and stick to a rigorous savings plan as a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another good test is having to move together. We've moved
together three times. Trying to reach an equitable compromise on
getting rid of whose stuff can start some interesting conversations
as a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   _ How about a gift to give (ital) to (unital) one's parents at
the wedding? One idea is to create a videotape from favorite family
photos. Many photo shops can do it, even adding a touching sound
track.
</P>
<P>
   Alt.wedding postings explore the ways caterers operate, what to
demand from a band or disk jockey, the best man's speech, how to
handle split-family situations, what to do about heavy drinkers _
all the mundane stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Where it becomes most fun is in brainstorming. An X Files
wedding? Some couples would find that a difficult memory to carry
all their lives. But hashing out a wedding theme can cement a
relationship even better than moving a piano into the couple's
third apartment, and with a computer it's much more fun.

<P>
   Economically, politically and strategically, the United States
and Korea enjoy a very special relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The United States liberated Korea from Japanese imperialism and
defended it from North Korean Communist aggression. U.S. assistance
played a central role in rebuilding our economy from the ruins of
the Korean War. U.S. help has also been crucial in overcoming the
economic crisis that began late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Republic of Korea has also done its best as
friend of the United States. Economically, it has not hesitated to
help the United States in its times of need.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s when the United States was suffering enormous trade
deficits, Korea dispatched several purchase missions to the United
States and bought billions of dollars' worth of American goods. In
1996, Korea imported American goods actively, to the extent that it
incurred a deficit of $11.6 billion with the United States out of a
total trade deficit of $20.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several Korean companies have invested more than $1
billion each in the United States. Currently, Korean Air plans to
purchase $2 billion worth of aircraft, despite our foreign exchange
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Korea is neither a superpower nor a rich country. However, Korea
has worked more closely with the United States than virtually any
nation in the world in many areas, including political, military
and economic issues. This is, of course, in our own national
interests; likewise, a friendly relationship with the Republic of
Korea is in America's national interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Korea is suffering economic difficulties, I hope
America will continue to actively provide us with assistance and
investment. Not if only is Northeast Asia very important to the
national interests of the United States, but it also needs the
United States to maintain peace and stability and promote
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the continued presence of the U.S. troops
currently stationed in Northeast Asia is absolutely necessary, just
as U.S. troops are necessary for stability and peace in Europe,
even in these post-Cold War years.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Northeast Asian peace and prosperity at this
particular stage is settlement of peace on the Korean Peninsula.
Unfortunately, the Korean Peninsula, the last hot spot of the Cold
War era, still faces the potential threat of armed conflict. In
order to deter any provocation and nurture enduring peace, a solid
military alliance between Korea and the United States should be
maintained and further reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   Close cooperation between our two countries for peace is more
important now than ever before for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, broader understanding and cooperation are needed
between the Republic and the United States in the project of
building light-water nuclear reactors in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we should be careful not to isolate North Korea from
the international community. In principle, I do not oppose U.S.
efforts to expand the scope of its relations with North Korea. But
I believe we need to exercise caution so as to avoid the
possibility of North Korea perceiving a gap in the positions
between the Republic and the United States and using it to its
advantage. Only if close coordination is maintained between our two
countries, will smooth dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, issues involving economic and other forms of
interaction between the South and the North should be initiated and
duly observed by the two parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot emphasize enough the need to embrace North Korea as a
member of the international community while maintaining a solid
security agreement between the Republic and the United States. The
three fundamental principles of my administration's policies toward
North Korea remain:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, we will not tolerate any military threat or armed
provocation. This principle is based on my belief that any
provocative action is certain to have extremely serious
consequences for both the South and the North, and would threaten
the stability and security of Northeast Asia at large.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we will not seek to undermine North Korea _ or unify
the divided land by absorbing it. We all know the political,
economic and psychological difficulties that both West and East
Germans suffered after West Germany absorbed the East. One cannot
even imagine what kind of difficulties might be experienced, if we
tried to undermine North Korea and annex it. I declare, once and
for all, we have no intention of absorbing North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we will pursue genuine interaction and reconciliation
with the North. Our economic interaction and cooperation will be
based on the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and
Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North adopted
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with this new guideline, the new Korean government
is now pursuing a policy of separating politics from private
business activities. We will also encourage exchanges of people and
promote cooperation in cultural, social and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, the founder of Hyundai Corp. is planning to
make a road journey back to North Korea very soon. He will be
taking 500 cows with him all the way to his birth place, and will
donate the animals to the people there. Koreans have had a special
attachment to cows since ancient times. The giver and receivers of
the cows are sure to share feelings of genuine love that have been
suppressed for the past 50 years of separation. This trip will be a
good start toward reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the exchanges and cooperative efforts between the South
and the North, my government directives are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, we will continue to provide emergency humanitarian
assistance _ whether by the government or private resources _ with
no strings attached. We have already donated 50,000 tons of food
through the Red Cross, and recently announced provision of another
50,000 tons through the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we will promote economic exchanges and cooperation
between the South and the North. To facilitate such exchanges, my
government has recently lifted some restrictions on business trips
to North Korea and abolished ceilings on investment in the North.
It is clear that both sides will benefit if capital and technology
from the South are combined with labor in the North.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, our non-emergency governmental aid will be provided
under the principle of reciprocity. In April, we did not commit
fertilizer provisions requested by North Korea because they
declined our humanitarian request to arrange reunions of family
members who have been separated for half a century. We are ready to
provide fertilizer to the North Koreans as soon as we receive a
positive response on our proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Korea is unique in that it has never in its history waged a war
against any nation in the West and has never been colonized by a
Western country.
</P>
<P>
   I understand my administration's position is firmly supported by
the United States, Japan, China, and Russia, as well as the Korean
people. All of this is positive in support of our efforts to secure
peace on the Korean Peninsula.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The recent nuclear tests in the South Asian subcontinent have
shaken the international community. Their consequences are much
more than just the start of a regional nuclear-arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are already saying that nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament is now a lost cause. That may turn out to be true,
but only if the policy makers of major powers confine themselves to
short-term reaction, without drawing appropriate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the suggestions being made in the wake of the tests
could lead to exactly the wrong conclusions. Some see them as a
pretext for refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and even abandoning negotiations on reducing and eliminating
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that by their recent actions India
and Pakistan have not strengthened their security. To the contrary,
by launching the mechanism of mutual threats they have added a
strong element of unpredictability to the already difficult
security equation in the subcontinent. Any perceived gain in status
or ``clout'' too is a delusion. The euphoria will pass, but the
angry global reaction will continue to cause both countries serious
problems, not only international but domestic as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one must recognize the validity of much of the
criticism directed at the five nuclear powers, particularly the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has long been obvious that the Non-Proliferation
Treaty is bound to be shaky unless there is real movement toward
nuclear disarmament. Yet, of late both the United States and Russia
have been making it increasingly clear that they intend to rely for
their defense on nuclear weapons, advanced delivery systems and
anti-ballistic missiles. As was to be expected, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to lock in the
status quo or to increase the treaty's credibility and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face the truth today: That status quo has now been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions offer no solution. Indeed, as we have seen,
they can cause resentment and bitterness and make the situation
even more difficult. Nevertheless, the international community
cannot afford to ignore the contempt with which it has been treated
by New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is to seek constructive courses of
action, primarily within the United Nations. Only a serious,
no-nonsense dialogue can persuade India and Pakistan that they must
cease the nuclear escalation and adhere to non-proliferation and
comprehensive test ban treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the other nuclear powers too must do a lot. It can no longer
be business as usual. They must act concretely to prove that they
are serious about nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   I would also urge greater attention to the problem of nuclear
delivery systems. The United States and Russia are observing the
treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range missiles that
President Reagan and I signed in 1987. Negotiations should now
begin on enlarging this treaty to include other countries, since
missiles with a range of about 300 miles to 3,500 miles are
particularly dangerous on a regional level.
</P>
<P>
   I want to recall what happened in 1991, when the United States
and the Soviet Union agreed, on the basis of an informal
arrangement, to drastically reduce their arsenals of tactical
nuclear weapons. Similar steps today, taken unilaterally, without
engaging in protracted negotiations, would go a long way toward
normalizing the situation and persuading people that world leaders
are capable of acting to assure their security.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I have to put the actions of India and Pakistan within
the overall context of the world's post-Cold War evolution. It has
been adversely affected by the mistaken conclusion that one side
won the Cold War and thus secured for itself the right to
unconstrained leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the intentions were, things went wrong. Over the past
years, all kinds of things have been tried _ but little or nothing
was ever done to strengthen the United Nations, or to coordinate on
a regular and systematic basis the nuclear policies of the existing
powers and seriously consult with the threshold states.
</P>
<P>
   It should now be clear that in this as in other matters, one
power center is simply not capable of being the sole decision-maker
and regulator. This is a lesson to be learned if we are to have
fewer unpleasant surprises in the future.

<P>
   The recent nuclear tests in the South Asian subcontinent have
shaken the international community. Their consequences are much
more than just the start of a regional nuclear-arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are already saying that nuclear non-proliferation
and disarmament is now a lost cause. That may turn out to be true,
but only if the policy makers of major powers confine themselves to
short-term reaction, without drawing appropriate conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the suggestions being made in the wake of the tests
could lead to exactly the wrong conclusions. Some see them as a
pretext for refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
and even abandoning negotiations on reducing and eliminating
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in my mind that by their recent actions India
and Pakistan have not strengthened their security. To the contrary,
by launching the mechanism of mutual threats they have added a
strong element of unpredictability to the already difficult
security equation in the subcontinent. Any perceived gain in status
or ``clout'' too is a delusion. The euphoria will pass, but the
angry global reaction will continue to cause both countries serious
problems, not only international but domestic as well.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one must recognize the validity of much of the
criticism directed at the five nuclear powers, particularly the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it has long been obvious that the Non-Proliferation
Treaty is bound to be shaky unless there is real movement toward
nuclear disarmament. Yet, of late both the United States and Russia
have been making it increasingly clear that they intend to rely for
their defense on nuclear weapons, advanced delivery systems and
anti-ballistic missiles. As was to be expected, the indefinite
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty failed to lock in the
status quo or to increase the treaty's credibility and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   We have to face the truth today: That status quo has now been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions offer no solution. Indeed, as we have seen,
they can cause resentment and bitterness and make the situation
even more difficult. Nevertheless, the international community
cannot afford to ignore the contempt with which it has been treated
by New Delhi and Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   More important, however, is to seek constructive courses of
action, primarily within the United Nations. Only a serious,
no-nonsense dialogue can persuade India and Pakistan that they must
cease the nuclear escalation and adhere to non-proliferation and
comprehensive test ban treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the other nuclear powers too must do a lot. It can no longer
be business as usual. They must act concretely to prove that they
are serious about nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   I would also urge greater attention to the problem of nuclear
delivery systems. The United States and Russia are observing the
treaty banning intermediate and shorter-range missiles that
President Reagan and I signed in 1987. Negotiations should now
begin on enlarging this treaty to include other countries, since

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed, the paratroop officer widely
credited with ending the war in Chechnya, took office June 5 as
governor of the vast, mineral-rich Krasnoyarsk region in southern
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad news for Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who
finds himself in a country which does not actually belong to or
obey him any more.
</P>
<P>
   For by winning the race for governor last month, Lebed, 48, also
wins himself a place in Russia's presidential elections in the year
2000. He gains a high-profile seat on the Federation Council, the
upper house of Russia's Parliament. And Lebed holds a popular moral
authority _ indeed an immunity which Yeltsin himself used to enjoy
from any real or imagined accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as was once true of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin now seems
to be more comfortable abroad than in his homeland. Russia does not
like Yeltsin any more. In Lebed, it has a new magician or, perhaps,
a new trouble on its hands. But the fear of possible trouble is
outweighed by what is almost sacred for Russia _ a hope, a new
fairy tale. For with the Krasnoyarsk victory, millions in Russia
are prepared to believe in a new fairy tale, in a new ``father of
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, of course, this military man, as commander of the
14th army division, used his power and influence to finally put a
stop to the bloodshed that claimed so many young Russian lives in
the Chechen province. For that, he earned not the congratulations,
but the enmity of Yeltsin, who saw in it the ambition of a rival to
lead the nation. In a highly public ceremony, Yeltsin sacked Lebed
from his position as Russia's top national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Yeltsin is still able to make a number of the
unpredictable moves characteristic of him. After all, this
president enjoys rights under a Constitution tailored to suit him
and he may once again choose to shake the world _ which has not yet
forgotten the escapade in which he fired the entire Russian
cabinet. But he won't accomplish anything of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, unless Lebed fails to learn anything from the mistakes
made by his former and present rivals, he is likely to enter the
Kremlin no matter what barricades are thrown up in his path.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes are rather obvious; the general must have memorized
them by now. Lebed will not try to play the role of a rowdy
politician like the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky. He will not get
himself televised after midnight in saunas of ill repute. He will
not hasten to write books and keep the profits.
</P>
<P>
   By now, having secured for himself a serious chance to win the
presidency, Lebed is not going to make frequent trips abroad,
ingratiatingly holding ``friend Helmut Kohl'' by the waist or
jesting too personally with Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed has already established that his first love is Russia.
With some talent, he has recruited to his support all those
``insulted and humiliated'' patriots, from Kaliningrad to Nakhodka,
who are disillusioned with and rejected by the Yeltsin regime. This
growing number of Russia's dejected will vote for Lebed in 2000, or
more accurately against any candidate nominated by the government
or, even worse, backed by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has befallen Russia _ the collapsed economy, the
social decline, the unpaid salaries, the disappearance of public
services _ Yeltsin will not be helped out in the next elections by
the tricks that have worked in prior races: not the Moscow bankers'
money, nor the intellectual horror of the Moscow elite.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpless one in this tussle will be Yeltsin. Even now,
those surrounding Yeltsin, in their minds, have already fled. As
for the power structures and the military that Yeltsin has in fact
been leaning on since 1993, while trying to appear loyal to him,
they will try to coordinate their every move with every move Lebed
makes. The generals may wear the stars that Yeltsin pinned on them,
but they will serve him looking over their shoulder at the other
man.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also danger. The measure of confidence the newly
elected Krasnoyarsk governor is going to get if he wins the Russian
presidential elections will make people accept not just his
presidency, but also his dictatorship. Lebed will be saying that
his rule is a special brand of leadership _ a monarchy of the law,
conscience and order. Who will argue against it in Russia's current
poverty-stricken state?
</P>
<P>
   As for fascism, no one has proven yet that Russia is afraid of
dictatorial rule. Yeltsin has already laid a foundation of
tolerance toward limited fascism and, in many cases, the State Duma
has openly sabotaged the passing of antifascist legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Now about money.
</P>
<P>
   They say that despite an $80,000 limit on spending set by
Krasnoyarsk's regional law, Lebed's victory cost a fantastic sum,
and that should the ``oligarchs'' who in the past found it in their
interests to support Yeltsin erect a strong political obstacle for
Lebed, the general would not be able to scrape up the rubles to pay
his fare to Moscow. But it is also reasonable to note that a change
of heart could see them voluntarily contributing to the ``Lebed of
Krasnoyarsk,'' so that he might become the ``Lebed of Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Lebed gains in popularity and scores further victories,
one of the chapters in future Russian history is likely to be
called ``oligarchs in the general's servants' room.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Lebed seems to be sure to win, unless something
extraordinary intervenes.

 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Wole Soyinka, the first African to win the Nobel Prize for
Literature, has been critical of Nigeria's home-grown dictators for
decades.
 &HT;    Arrested in 1965, Soyinka spent more than two years in prison,
largely in solitary confinement. He had tried to broker a
cease-fire deal between Nigeria's federal government and Biafran
rebels who wanted to secede from the country. His vitriolic memoir,
``The Man Died,'' was written between the lines of books smuggled
to him in prison.
 &HT;    Released in 1969, he entered a period of voluntary exile. He
lectured at universities, wrote, directed and produced plays in
Europe and West Africa, and founded the leading culture and
criticism magazine, Transition, in Ghana.
 &HT;    Soyinka returned to Nigeria in 1975, but left again temporarily,
in 1983, when he learned there was a price on his head.
 &HT;    Incarnations of his Guerrilla Theatre Unit, a production company
founded in 1978, have been performing for years to mass audiences
in Nigeria. Many skits have sharply rebuked Nigeria's military
regimes and policies and have been performed not only in
auditoriums but, provocatively, in front of government buildings or
in public squares and marketplaces where authorities have cracked
down.
 &HT;    In 1986 Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Swedish
Academy cited his ``prolific store of words ... in witty dialogue,
in satire and grotesquery, in quiet poetry and in essays of
sparkling vitality.''
 &HT;    Soyinka has implored African writers to become the conscience of
their nation or be forced to withdraw ``to the position of
chronicler and postmortem surgeon.''
 &HT;    In 1996 Soyinka published ``The Open Sore of a Continent,''
which accuses the Nigerian military regime of having robbed the
people of their nationhood by annulling the presidential election
of June 12, 1993. On that day 14 million Nigerians had crossed
regional, class, religious and ethnic lines to freely elect as
president a civilian Muslim, Moshood K.O. Abiola. A year later,
Abiola was imprisoned on charges of treason after he declared
himself the rightful president of Nigeria.
 &HT;    The military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha seized power and would
become Nigeria's nemesis. Among Abacha's human-rights abuses, cited
by international watchdog groups, the most infamous was the hanging
of writer and political activist Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995, along with
eight other pro-democracy activists.
 &HT;    Other perversions of justice have included political detention,
extrajudicial executions, restrictions of freedom of expression and
association, meddling in the judicial process and torture.
 &HT;    Soyinka himself was charged with treason by the military regime
_ a capital offense. In exile since 1994, Soyinka has been
lecturing and writing in America and Europe _ most recently in
Rhode Island, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., Atlanta
and Champaign, Ill.
 &HT;    
 -0- 
 &HT;    ZIA JAFFREY: Where were you when you received the news that the
Abacha regime had charged you with treason?
 &HT;    WOLE SOYINKA: I was lecturing in the United States. Somebody
tracked me down and asked about my recent ``promotion'' from being
a mere ``terrorist'' to being a ``treasonable felon.'' We knew it
was coming; we knew it was building up. They aim to eliminate the
opposition. This is just one more step in that direction. So it
didn't make any impact on me. It simply meant that I had to turn up
my security one notch.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I read in a London newspaper that you said there was an
Abacha death squad?
 &HT;    A: Yes. The death squad does exist. We know where they're
trained. We know where they're located, exactly in Abuja; we know
their modus operandi. So we're even able to know when some of them
are dispatched out of the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Because you've infiltrated?
 &HT;    A: Let's just say that the opposition has a reasonable network _
obviously, it's not comprehensive _ but we have efficient
intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: And the intelligence tells you that you're on the hit list?
 &HT;    A: Absolutely.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In ``The Open Sore of a Continent,'' you suggested that the
next move for Nigeria's people would be civil disobedience.
 &HT;    A: Yes. Even while I was in Nigeria I was organizing a peaceful
march on Aso Rock (the seat of government) from every corner of the
country. ... I gave a press conference detailing the plans and
applying for torches, rations, blankets, halls, and schools along
the way where people would rest.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: For when was this planned?
 &HT;    A: Just about three months before I left. But I was summoned by
the SSS (State Security Services).
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What did they say?
 &HT;    A: Well, it was very polite, very courteous. The officer
apologized for not coming to my house to have the chat. He asked
how on earth did I think I could mount such an (opposition). ... I
said, ``... the people working with me are disciplined, and they
understand what's at stake. ...''
 &HT;    I think this frightened the regime very much. At the end, after
we'd gone through the whole thing he said, ``OK, thank you,
professor. Now I have a responsibility to tell you the decision of
the regime ... it considers itself bound to stop (your dissent) by
every means.'' ... Then arrests began. People were pulled in for
interrogation. Finally I had to accept the decision of the group
that I must leave.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Leave the group, or the country?
 &HT;    A: Leave the country.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Do you still have family in Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: I had to go back and get them out. As hostage-taking became a
cardinal policy of the government, the assassinations of relations
and colleagues of dissidents who are out of reach began to become
the norm. I had to get three adult members of my family out. The
surveillance had become crippling, really suffocating.
 &HT;    This regime just does not believe in innocence. ... In prison
(they incarcerate) children. ... The ages of the children-hostages
vary from four to 12 in Nigeria. They are kept in police cells.
It's something we have never experienced before. Never. Never.
They've always left civilians alone.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Tell me about the attack in which the government fired on
secondary-school students.
 &HT;    A: Many people don't know ... Not many people believe that
Abacha would fire on students. But we know this.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What were they protesting?
 &HT;    A: A 500 percent hike in school fees.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: In which city?
 &HT;    A: Benin. In Edo. I think on the first day of action close to 20
were killed, and others died later. We were monitoring the death
toll. It just kept increasing. The last figure I received was 37.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Ken Saro-Wiwa was a friend of yours?
 &HT;    A: We weren't close or anything of the sort. His orbit was quite
different from mine, but I absolutely supported his cause.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Why has Shell oil, even now, not cleared out of Nigeria?
 &HT;    A: Because they're confident of the protection of Nigeria's
regime. They signed a multibillion-dollar contract for a
liquefied-gas project. It was done secretly, but it came out, and
that is when I knew the company had cast its lot, irrevocably, on
the side of power. Everybody was calling for sanctions on Nigeria
and withdrawing business from the country and so on _ for Shell to
have signed that contract, nevertheless, shows that its commercial
interests preceded its humanism.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Where is home for you, at this point?
 &HT;    A: In my head, that's where home is _ in my head.

 &HT;    Profile of Bishop tells story of devotion to Christ, Florida
diocese
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jim Symons takes a long draw off a
Winston, stubs it out in an already full ashtray and thinks for a
moment. He's sitting at the kitchen table in Largo, just north of
St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Elaine, gets up off the couch, checks their simmering
beef and noodle dinner on the stove and disappears around a corner
in their small living room.
</P>
<P>
   The evening news is on the TV, but the sound is down because a
visitor has stopped by to ask questions about Symons' brother.
</P>
<P>
   `If . . . if . . .'' he says, grappling for words a few seconds
later. Smoke gushes from his mouth and lingers around his head. He
tries again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my life to live over . . . I'd want the same
brother,'' he says in a soft tone, his voice draped with sadness,
confusion and pride.
</P>
<P>
   He says this almost to himself, as if speaking the words will
answer all his questions and heal the unexpected rupture in his
family's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a week for him. On Wednesday, he picked up the
newspaper to read that his brother, Joseph Keith Symons, had
resigned after eight years as the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of
Palm Beach, Fla. and admitted to ``inappropriate sexual behavior
with minors'' early in his priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The public admission came five weeks after a middle-aged man
told church officials that Symons molested him as a boy. Last
weekend, Symons revealed to the Most Rev. Robert Lynch, bishop of
the Diocese of St. Petersburg, the names of four more victims.
</P>
<P>
   Symons was sent to an undisclosed location for treatment. Lynch
is now the temporary administrator of the five-county diocese while
the Vatican decides on a replacement. The names of the victims and
the precise time period during which the abuse occurred has not
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the soft-spoken 65-year-old Symons _ friends,
family and clergy _ spent the rest of the week reconciling the man
they loved and trusted and knew as a gentle comforter with this new
image of a humbled, distraught, troubled soul who was forced to
confess to horrific flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For them, he is a man with an almost pathological devotion to
work.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who remembers birthdays and anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who cares for the sick and needy with a passion and
devotion second only to what he felt for his beloved mother.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man who prays almost as much as he breathes.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man who not only gives inspirational books to friends but
also takes the time to mark pages he thinks will boost their
spiritual deficits.
</P>
<P>
   He is a living history of Florida catholicism, someone who
helped shepherd the explosive growth from 80,000 faithful in 1945
to more than 2.5 million today.
</P>
<P>
   But, now, he's also the highest ranking Catholic in U.S. history
to leave his job for molesting a child.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Keith Symons knew he wanted to devote his life to
Christ.While his older brother Clayton and younger brother Jim
played baseball and games with the neighbors' kids outside his
family's home in Champion, Mich., Keith often stayed indoors to
read or study.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Harold, a Methodist with English heritage, worked
long hours in the ore mines outside of Champion. ``I don't ever
remember him complaining about the long hours, though,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was up their devout Roman Catholic mother, Ella, a woman
of French and English descent, to raise the three boys. When she
went to novena prayer vigils or Mass at the Catholic church at the
top of the hill in Champion, Keith tagged along.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the family moved to Detroit, where his
father worked building tanks. In 1945, they visited a cousin in
Miami and decided to make a new home there.
</P>
<P>
   Keith graduated from Sts. Peter and Paul High School in Miami in
1949. At age 17, he studied for the priesthood, first at St. Thomas
Seminary in Bloomfield, Conn., and then at St. Mary Seminary in
Baltimore, where he became one of the youngest to study there. He
earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Mary's in 1954, followed
by a Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age, the seminary required him to study for an
extra year to make sure he was committed to his religious calling.
He was ordained to the priesthood in Miami in 1958 and became the
assistant chancellor to the bishop of St. Augustine, which was the
only diocese in the state at that time. Today, there are seven
dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, it often meant driving hundreds of miles each
weekend, traversing rickety bridges, dodging wayward cows and
enduring dusty, bumpy back roads to celebrate Mass at parishes
throughout the state that had no priests. Of the few things he
brags about himself, one of them is that he can go anywhere in
Florida without a road map.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as I can remember, he always wanted to become a
priest,'' Jim recalled. ``Even to this day, he constantly reads the
Bible. I joke that his knees must be two inches thick, because he's
down praying constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons was first assigned for a short stint as assistant pastor
at St. Monika's in Palatka, Fla. The demand for priests at that
time is evident in his duties; by the end of 1959, he served at
least six additional parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crazy about Florida,'' his brother Jim said. ``Loved
the weather, loved the people, everything. Just fell in love with
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a four-year span he spent serving parishes in
Leesburg, Fla. and Bushnell, Fla. in the early 1960s, Symons spent
most of his time from 1960 to 1971 in the Tampa Bay, Fla. area.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1971, he was tapped to work as vicar general and
chancellor for Bishop Charles B. McLaughlin in the burgeoning
Diocese of St. Petersburg. The job included running the
administrative offices, or chancery, as well as serving as
McLaughlin's right hand man at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous by nature _ a person who rarely had a stray thread on
his clothing, much less a paper out of line on his desk _ Symons
seemed born to do the job. He and McLaughlin, though, made an
unlikely team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called Bishop McLaughlin `Hurricane Charlie,' '' joked
Bishop Emeritus W. Thomas Larkin, who was picked by the Vatican as
McLaughlin's successor after he died in office in late 1978. ``He
was a man who who never hid his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, a pilot from the Bronx who often flew to events
around the diocese, was a commanding presence, forceful in voice
and demeanor, someone always on the go. Symons was undemonstrative
and low volume, choosing to speak with loyalty and compassionate
deeds as much as with words.
</P>
<P>
   Those deeds included efforts to improve the diocese's outreach
to the sick and the elderly. It was Symons who suggested in 1967
that Mass be broadcast weekly so shut-ins could continue to feel a
connection with the liturgy and their faith. In 1974, he followed
that with a televised Mass for the deaf, both broadcast on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great people person,'' Larkin said. Symons continued to
serve as chancellor for Larkin until being named auxiliary bishop
in March 1981. The enhanced role carried the bishop's title, but he
still was subordinate to Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a micromanager and worked all the time,'' Larkin said.
``He was just going, going, going all the time. He didn't have
hobbies or play golf. I couldn't even get him to take a vacation or
days off. I knew that I could leave the chancery and go out about
the diocese and he would take care of everything. He never left
anything half done.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Symons' duties was to coordinate the details of Masses
and ceremonies conducted by McLaughlin and Larkin. William Tapp, a
longtime musical director at the Cathedral of St. Jude in St.
Petersburg, dealt with Symons frequently since the bishops use the
cathedral to celebrate the holiest of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny you called,'' Tapp said, his voice laced with
sadness. ``About five minutes ago I picked up a prayer book he had
given me. In it he made notes about certain feast days and what
each day represents _ not just which saint went with which day.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons' knowledge about the nuances of each Mass was
comprehensive, Tapp said. He knew what piece of music was supposed
to play at a certain moment. He knew where each altar boy was to be
placed during the service and what the role of each would be.
</P>
<P>
   During Holy Week, when the grueling pace of services and the
pressure to honor the solemnity of each Mass and vigil leading to
Easter can frazzle nerves, Symons was a portrait of calm, Tapp
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt well prepared with him there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Corsetti, hired by Symons in 1976 to be an assistant in the
diocese's finance department, remembers a similar level of
organization he witnessed during his job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, he was impeccable,'' said Corsetti, who today is
assistant director of finance. ``His desk was impeccable. Not a
thing out of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons always had time to speak to co-workers, he said, and
regularly celebrated Mass in the chancery for staff members.
</P>
<P>
   At one point when Corsetti and his wife, Denise, were struggling
to cope with their inability to conceive a child, Symons paid extra
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would send cards and prayers, and he'd drop by the house
when he had the time to visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of Symons' attention to detail and his depth of
loyalty to the bishop, Corsetti recalled the time after
McLaughlin's death when the diocese was waiting for a letter
telling them who the next bishop would be.
</P>
<P>
   Symons realized that the mail had been delivered on Saturday, so
he went to the office to scan it for the papal seal. Only there was
no mail bag. The cleaning service had pitched it into the trash.
Symons went out behind the chancery with Corsetti to rummage
through the dumpster, but a crew had already hauled the garbage
away.
</P>
<P>
   So the two tracked down the garbage hauler and learned the truck
was on its way to the landfill. Both fetched pitchforks and beat
the truck to the dump. Once there, they combed through the heaps of
stinking garbage and found the mail bag. They opened it up. No
letter. A few days later, the letter naming Larkin arrived in the
normal mail.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' work in the chancery, both as an assistant and as
bishop, only enhanced the love and pride felt by his mother. Ella
Symons lived close to him in a duplex she owned near his church,
St. Catherine of Siena, in Largo, Fla., where he was in residence
while serving Bishops McLaughlin and Larkin. (Symons' father died
in 1968.)
</P>
<P>
   She would visit him occasionally at the chancery in St.
Petersburg, and he would proudly show her off to staff members.
</P>
<P>
   One time, she called him from her Catholic nursing home in
northeast St. Petersburg. Figuring something must be wrong, Symons
rushed to take her call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ducks,'' she said, ``the ducks in the pond here have had
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son shared a dry, understated wit as well. A short
time before Ella Symons died in 1982, she asked her son if he would
conduct her funeral. He told her he wasn't sure that would be
possible but that he'd check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you can't do it, who the heck would?'' Jim Symons
remembers her joking. Not long after, she passed away due to heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after the funeral, I told him it was a shame,
especially for him. I lost a mother, but he lost a friend and a
mother,'' Jim said. ``They were so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Without prompting, the youngest brother mutters, ``Thank
goodness my mother's not around to see all this.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for his efficiency, loyalty and dedication, Symons
was named auxiliary bishop in St. Petersburg in 1981. Two years
later he was chosen bishop of the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   During his seven years there, he was known for his tireless
travel to parishes and schools throughout the Panhandle. It's a
diocese with two cathedrals, one in Pensacola, the other across the
street from Florida State University's campus in Tallahassee. Such
a division kept him on the road almost non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   Symons was ``a nice guy'' but ``not a convivial guy. He did not
have the greatest personality in the world,'' but he was good to
work for, said Thomas Horkan, who as the former executive director
of the Florida Catholic Conference worked under Symons and other
Florida bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very direct. You could talk to him and get an answer,''
Horkan said. And, he said, when new issues would arise, Symons was
a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' successor in the Panhandle, Bishop John H. Ricard,
issued a statement last week praising Symons' hard work there and
urging prayer for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to assist anyone who has been hurt by Bishop
Symons,'' Ricard's statement continues. ``If they would please
contact me, I wish to assure them that any contact made to the
diocese will be held confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1990, Symons was transferred to the Diocese of Palm
Beach, overseeing churches and schools in Palm Beach, Martin, St.
Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties in Florida. The job
brought a $5.4 million annual budget to administer, 1,000 clergy,
teachers and other workers to manage, and 51 parishes to direct, as
well as schools, missions, outreach centers and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   His first five years on the job, the diocese spent $75 million
on renovation and construction. And Symons, micromanager that he
is, claims to have signed every document.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just afraid all his good work and accomplishments will be
forgotten because of this,'' Larkin said. ``What he did in Palm
Beach was a testament to his dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have spoken to Symons since he was sent away for treatment
last week, and neither the Palm Beach nor St. Petersburg dioceses
have disclosed his location.
</P>
<P>
   Even his brothers don't know where he is. Jim Symons, who spoke
frequently with Symons by phone and last saw him a few weeks ago at
the celebration of his 40th anniversary of entering the priesthood,
said he hasn't talked with him since the news broke Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has his brother Clayton, who lives in Michigan, nor has
any of the eight nephews and nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' old boss, Bishop Larkin, said he called Symons before he
left the Palm Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was devastated about all this. He said that this all
happened 35 years ago and that he's tried to be a good priest since
then. He wasn't crying, but he was really shaken up about it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no reconciling J. Keith Symons the bishop,
brother and son with J. Keith Symons the shamed abuser.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's easier to try to accept that two men wore his
clerical collar: one a healer, the other a flawed soul haunted by
the commission of acts unacceptable under any condition, much less
when performed by a man of God.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Lynch as well as the heads of dioceses where Symons
served have asked that anyone who was abused come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday's resignation _ prompted by one man's allegations
five weeks ago _ two more men have told church officials they too
were molested by Symons, bringing the number to three, according to
Father Michael Edwards, the Diocese of Palm Beach spokesman, the
Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported last week. Edwards did not
return repeated phone calls Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five men Symons acknowledged molesting have been
identified, and it is not known how or when the two latest victims
approached church officials.
</P>
<P>
   Symons has asked for prayers and forgiveness from the faithful
and from his victims. Friends and family say all they can do is
pray.
</P>
<P>
   But from the tone of comments by those who know Symons well, it
is difficult to imagine there will be answers to all the questions
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Lynch, after being assured by Symons that the activities
ceased 25 years ago: ``I want to believe that, but I don't know for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, when asked if he had known about the abuses: ``I had no
idea. Lord no. If I had, I would have had to limit him in some
capacity. You'd have to after something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Corsetti, when asked if anyone could have foreseen this: ``I
would rank him in the top three priests that I've ever known. If
someone gave me 50 guesses to figure out who some bad news was
going to be about that day, I would have figured it was him in 50
guesses.''
</P>
<P>
   William Tapp, while recalling the meticulousness of his family's
dear friend: ``He was always under control . . . well . . . I
thought he was under control.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Jim Symons, who keeps his brother's first official
portrait as bishop high on a living room wall alongside a painting
of their mother: ``If he's asked God for forgiveness, he knows in
his heart he'll be forgiven.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured

best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A

   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.

 &HT;    Georgian plots course for aviation policy
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Hunnicutt had an uncommon interest in politics
and international affairs while growing up in the West Georgia city
of LaGrange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a civics teacher, Louise Evans, and some others who
really kind of opened my eyes to a broader world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That early interest led Hunnicutt to a globe-trotting career
that now finds him as the top U.S. official on aviation policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt's title is assistant U.S. transportation secretary for
aviation and international affairs. His job is to negotiate complex
bilateral treaties between the United States and foreign
governments. These pacts dictate where the world's airlines can
fly, and they influence consumer travel options and economic
development on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   He also plays a key -- and potentially controversial -- role in
formulating the government's stance on domestic competition and the
burgeoning issue of airline alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt, a University of Georgia law school graduate, was back
in his home state last week to mark a treaty success. He joined his
boss, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, at a kickoff ceremony
for Delta Air Lines' new nonstop flights between Atlanta and Tokyo.
The flights are a product of a revised U.S.-Japan air pact hammered
out last winter after years of inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt, 47, oversees a staff of negotiators but personally
handles some talks, such as those that led to the U.S.-Japan deal.
Treaty negotiation demands the tact of a diplomat, the toughness of
a trial lawyer and the savvy of a business executive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of skills, and in some cases those of a poker
player,'' said Hunnicutt, whose drawl betrays his Georgia roots.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt got the job in 1996. Air treaty revisions that open
new routes have been a DOT priority under the Clinton
administration. Hunnicutt points to 31 ``open skies'' pacts between
the United States and foreign countries, compared with one before
the effort began, as evidence of the push to remove protectionist
barriers to air service.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the airline industry say that number is misleading,
since most of the open skies pacts involve small countries that
were essentially open anyway. Of more importance, they say, are a
few liberalized treaties, such as the one with Japan, which stop
short of open skies but allow new service in key markets. A similar
treaty revision with France is behind Air France's plans to start
Atlanta-Paris flights June 19.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the United States has yet to land the biggest
prize, a new deal that would open more routes to Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interests in these treaties are so diverse and the stakes
so valuable that it takes a lot of work to get the stars aligned so
that governments will move,'' said Hunnicutt.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt's office recently proposed new rules for domestic
competition. They are aimed at preventing airlines from driving
discount carriers out of business by selling too many seats below
cost on competing routes, a practice known as predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it occurred? Yes,'' said Hunnicutt. But the DOT has never
taken formal action against an airline, and Hunnicutt said the
rules would give it the tools to identify and punish such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Critics at major airlines complain the rules amount to
``re-regulation'' that will distort the marketplace and hurt
consumers by restricting the ability of big carriers to match
discounters' fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a straw man,'' said Hunnicutt. ``The point of these
rules is to apply the competitive principles that were always
intended under deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt also will play a key role in DOT decisions on three
pending alliances among the six biggest U.S. carriers:
Northwest-Continental, United-Delta and American-US Airways. The
airlines claim the deals will enable them to broaden their route
offerings by selling seats on each others' flights. Critics say
they diminish competition.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT could block any of the deals if it deems them
anti-competitive. ``These deals vary in scope and the way they work
and we'll look at each one,'' said Hunnicutt. ``We're not going to
rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt got his first dose of politics while at LaGrange High
School, when he went to Washington as a page for his congressman.
He later got a bachelor's degree from American University, then
returned to Georgia to get his law degree.
</P>
<P>
   At UGA Hunnicutt had another academic mentor, former Secretary
of State Dean Rusk, who ran the international law program. ``He was
a major influence,'' Hunnicutt said of Rusk, who also hailed from
rural Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt studied at the Hague Academy of International Law in
Brussels, Belgium, working part-time for the state of Georgia as a
trade representative. He then worked for President Jimmy Carter's
transition team, the Commerce Department and the International
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnicutt then worked at a Washington law firm and in 1995 spent
a year in Ukraine, helping the fledgling country establish its
government, before joining the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   As Delta's Tokyo nonstop prepared to leave Hartsfield last week,
Hunnicutt said it was doubly satisfying to see the fruits of his
labors being realized in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, you're always pleased to see your native region
benefit,'' he said, ``but professionally you have to hold the
national interest paramount.''

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Free, shareware programs can enhance Net experience
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is truly a wonderful and mysterious
place. Besides offering information on how to do anything from bake
a cake to get rid of fleas, it's also the world's biggest source of
both free and inexpensive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few hours, you can get dozens of programs that will
help you use the Internet more efficiently. Even if your current
Internet provider included free Web browsing, e-mail and newsgroup
software, there are still plenty of programs that will save you
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with Net.Medic. It gives an accurate reading of your
connection speed. Most folks don't understand that modems
constantly adjust in speed, based on line conditions. So, just
because you logged on at, say, 26k bps, that doesn't mean you'll be
operating at that speed later.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a free demonstration version of this software at
http://www.vitalsigns.com
</P>
<P>
   /product/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Are you still using the e-mail program built into your Web
browser? If you are, you can make sending and receiving e-mail
(especially when files are attached to the e-mail you get) easier
by using Eudora Lite, a free version of Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Just set your browser for http://eudora.qualcomm.com
</P>
<P>
   /freeware/. You'll find versions of this program for both
Windows and Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   Virus protection is increasingly important. But there's no real
need to buy a commercial anti-virus program. There are excellent
anti-virus programs available free or as shareware (where you
download the program and use it free and only pay if you find it
useful). Payment is on the honor system, and the fee is usually
much less than you'd pay for a program that you'd buy in a store.
</P>
<P>
   You can read about several of these programs -- in a list that
includes both shareware and free programs -- at http://tucows
</P>
<P>
   .pcihost.com/virus95.html.
</P>
<P>
   The next program is one most Internet providers hate. You'll
have to let your conscience be your guide here, so I'll tell you
how the program works and you decide if you'd like to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers automatically disconnect you after a
certain number of minutes if you aren't sending e-mail, browsing
the Web or downloading programs. The trouble with that is some
providers also disconnect you when you're actually using the Net
but just not sending or receiving information.
</P>
<P>
   There's software around that fools computers and the provider
into thinking you're actively using the computer. That way, you
don't get disconnected. You can get one of these programs at
http://tucows.pcihost.com
</P>
<P>
   /discon95.html.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with writing a column like this is knowing
what programs you need and use. Some folks could profit by a better
newsgroup reader; others need to find a new browser or a File
Transfer Protocol program that does a better job of downloading
than when you use a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are sites that offer entire menus of downloads --
almost every program you can imagine for using the Internet. One of
these sites is called Stroud's Consummate Winsock Applications and
can be found at http://cws.internet.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never download a single program there, you'll learn
a lot about the Internet and the possibilities that it offers by
simply browsing the descriptions of what is available. You may find
just the thing to solve a problem you have.

 &HT;    Mop it up with a lyric poem paper towel
 &HT;    By Cynthia Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe it's a birthday thing. A psychic rumbling from
the grave to keep us from forgetting the wise words of Johann
Wolfgang Van Goethe.
</P>
<P>
   Next year is, after all, the 250th birthday of the lyric poet,
Germany's own Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain why Georgia-Pacific finds itself awash in
free publicity for a design on its Sparkle paper towels that
features a boiled-down phrase from Goethe's ``Wilhelm Meister's
Travels'': ``Nothing is worth more than this day.''
</P>
<P>
   The coast-to-coast coverage -- more than two dozen stories in as
many newspapers -- started in mid-April, with a story in The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a great country or what?'' Linton Weeks mused in the
resulting Style section-front article. ``Only in America -- where
you can get 8 percent of the daily iron you need from a 5 1/4-ounce
box of Oreos -- will you find a thought from one of the massive
minds of Western civ on a tossable towel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the towels have soaked up a lot of time for Jill
Mattos and Ken Haldin, the two Georgia-Pacific execs Weeks quoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having more fallout from this story than I've ever had,''
said Haldin, the company's PR chief. ``It just keeps on
snowballing, or, er,'' he adds with a grin, ``unrolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Mattos, the brand's marketing manager, with a laugh: ``I
hate to say I'm too busy to take these calls and talk to my
consumers, but I'm too busy to take these calls and talk to my
consumers!''
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, she can't tell either consumers or reporters much
of what they really want to know. Seems the Goethe towels aren't
tracked separately with their own bar code. The Goethe rolls are
lumped in with nine other patterns in something called the
``Designer Case Pack.'' And even then, she can't be sure Goethe
made it into the box; it depends on what the mill was running that
day.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, good luck finding it.
</P>
<P>
   The above also means she can't track how well the Goethe design
is selling -- though she will hear from grocers if they're backing
up on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   So how about who came up with the idea? Does she know if it was
some frustrated German lit major, whose life was changed by reading
``Faust,'' Goethe's famous poem about the title character's pact to
sell his soul to the devil?
</P>
<P>
   The best she can do is this: It was somebody at one of four
design firms she tapped two years to come up with new patterns. Out
of the hundreds submitted, 80 were picked to test on consumers in
Tampa and Baltimore, with 10 emerging as ``the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in New Haven, Conn., Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
Library is absorbed with the towels as well. It is home to the
world's third-largest collection of Goethe's work -- the largest
outside of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Christa Sammons curates the German literature collection, which
includes the largest Goethe collection outside of Washington. After
hearing about The Washington Post story, she got Haldin to send her
three rolls.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be for the library's bathroom, she says, but for the
``special collection'' of what literary scholars call ``reception
history.'' Or more plainly, stuff -- any stuff -- with Goethe on
it.
</P>
<P>
   The towels, Sammons thinks, are the first U.S. stuff with bona
fide, attributed Goethe on it since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war made anything German politically incorrect,
Sammons said, most Americans not only knew his works but how to
pronounce his name correctly. (It's Gher-tuh)
</P>
<P>
   But since then, he hasn't exactly been a pop culture icon.
</P>
<P>
   Hence her excitement. And, since seeing the towels herself, her
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sammons is where the buck stops when anybody in the
United States wants to know if it was Goethe who said thus and so
and where he said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the story, I thought `Oh my God! Every towel has a
different one and people will be calling me night and day to find
out where he said it,''' she said. ``Thank heavens there's only
one, and I found it already!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, under the right conditions, Sammons would love to see
Goethe maxims spilled all over a roll of Sparkle towels -- a
special Goethe's birthday edition, a 250-sheet roll, each with a
different Goethe saying, one for every year since he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only that, but he could have Kafka towels, Rilke towels.
I'll be his consultant! He can pay me to pick out the phrases!''
she suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they better get the presses going at the paper towel
factory because next year's gonna be a big year!''

 &HT;    Just for Fun: Printer accepts images from digital camera
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canon's Digital Printer CD-200, which ships next
month, claims to be the industry's first color printer to accept
and print images directly from a digital camera's Compact Flash
card.
</P>
<P>
   Designed primarily for use with Canon digitals, this printer is
compatible with most digital cameras that use the CF card and that
use JPEG compression.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a virtual ``digital darkroom,'' the CD-200 produces
4-by-6-inch glossy photo prints, without the need for a PC. Each
print costs less than $1 per copy and is delivered in about a
minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Compatible with PCs and Macs, the printer allows users to print
still images from TV programs, camcorders and other video sources.
It also allows images to be displayed on a TV monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-200 has an estimated retail price of $699 and can be seen
at the company's Web site: http://www.ccsi.canon.com.
</P>
<P>
   More than a printer
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp UX-2200CM is a six-in-one color inkjet machine. The
company claims it's the world's first multifunctional device to
have infrared direct print and data transfer capability. That's a
fancy way of saying you can hook it up to your computer wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for the small office/home office market, this
multifunction machine features a plain-paper fax, color printer,
scanner, copier, PC fax and phone in an affordable, compact unit.
</P>
<P>
   The printer produces documents in up to 600 dots per inch, at a
rate of up to three pages per minute. Like other multifunctions,
the real advantages are price and space consumption. The device
sells for a fraction of the cost of buying each unit individually
and takes up a fraction of the space of separate units.
</P>
<P>
   Build your dream home
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vila, America's favorite do-it-yourselfer, has teamed up
with Mindscape and the Learning Company to create a software tool
that will help users conceptualize, plan and build the home of
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Though designed primarily for new-home builders, the two-CD Bob
Vila's Home Design also offers hundreds of tips for remodeling and
adding to existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   This comprehensive program contains a suite of 2-D/3-D drafting
and drawing tools, an encyclopedia of more than 1,000 home plans,
animated tours, and video and audio tips from Vila. There are also
links to an ``Ask Bob'' Web site, where Vila or his staff will
answer e-mail questions on personal home design projects.
</P>
<P>
   With a library of blueprints, design symbols for interiors and
exteriors, and a roof editor for dormers, chimneys and skylights,
this program, which retails for $40, will help users plan in 2-D
and view in 3-D almost any home up to 30 stories.

<P>
   The Cosmic Shower is the '90s version of the Lava Lamp, only
better. Created for the Sharper Image by electronic artist Joseph
F. Lozowski, the Cosmic Shower is an interactive light sculpture
that responds to your voice, music or other room sounds.

   Mini reviews of current movies
</P>
<P>
   By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Lost in Space . . . Grade C+.
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Rising R
</P>
<P>
   A gray, tired and joyless Bruce Willis vehicle that makes ``The
Jackal'' look like a classic. This one casts Willis as Art, an
undercover FBI agent who has to protect a 9-year-old named Simon
(Miko Hughes) from killers. Simon is an autistic boy who
accidentally cracks a security code devised by the shadowy,
all-powerful National Security Agency. Alec Baldwin, in his
too-familiar sinister mode, plays an NSA honcho who orders the kid
rubbed out. Rated R for violence. 1 hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade:
D+
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Chan is back and better than ever in this
action-intensive delight about a TV chef (Chan) accidentally caught
between rival gangs looking for an incriminating tape. The star is
Buster Keaton, Baryshnikov and Bruce Lee, all rolled into one. He's
the real thing and the things he does will leave you reeling. Go
see for yourself. Rated PG-13 for violence and one curse word. 1
hour, 27 minutes. (ER) Grade:A-
</P>
<P>
   The Object of My Affection R
</P>
<P>
   Based on Stephen McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is
fashioned as sort of a modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic
mismatches. Nina (Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy
lover (John Pankow). She begins to think her new roommate George
(Paul Rudd) would make a better father _ he's polite, single, smart
and a babe. He's also gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp
performances, the movie can't quite overcome a central problem.
George and Nina are such bland, nice nudniks, it's hard to invest
in their story. Rated R for strong language and some sexuality. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of woman, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Post Coitum NR
</P>
<P>
   Doomed passion is charted unsparingly in this French film from
Brigitte Rouan. A chic forty-ish woman (Rouan) risks her family and
her career for a heedless affair with a younger man. A raw,
revealing tragicomedy that offers truths as inescapable as stretch
marks. Not Rated but there are steamy sex scenes. In French with
subtitles. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Primary Colors R
</P>
<P>
   Color it a knock-out. Mike Nichols, who gave a generation a
code-word (``plastics'') now delivers its elegy with this savvy
film about a presidential hopeful and his wife who resemble certain
White House inhabitants. The movie moves from satire to something
far deeper almost effortlessly. The terrific cast is headed by John
Travolta (all gut and twinkle), Emma Thompson, and Kathy Bates. As
Pogo once said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Rated R for
language and adult situations. 2 hours, 14 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . . . Grade B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick's is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   I Think I Do NR
</P>
<P>
   I think you'd rather not. A failed attempt to give a clever gay
twist to a combo of screwball farce and ``Big Chill'' reunion
movie, the film is a charmless comedy in which old college pals
re-convene at a wedding and work out old crushes...and new. Stars
Alexis Arquette. Not rated but there's vulgar language and sexual
situations (especially gay couplings). 1 hour, 32 minutes. (ER)
Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+

   UNDATED: Quest for Camelot . . . Grade B+.
</P>
<P>
   Scream 2 R
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream _ in both the scary and the funny sense. Writer
Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that made
``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, takes scary sequels as their
target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our beleaguered
heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's
actually Decatur's Agnes Scott), where a masked killer is prowling
around with a butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the
bracing experience of the first film. But it gets as close as you
could hope for. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Senseless R
</P>
<P>
   Score one for truth in advertising. In this sloppy, crude and
yes, senseless, comedy, Marlon Wayans plays a struggling college
student who enrolls in an experimental drug program to score some
quick cash. The drugs give him supersensory powers, but an overdose
has the opposite result. The movie's offensiveness _ it frequently
stoops to bathroom humor _ would be tolerable were it made with
flair. But director Penelope Spheeris, who brought a dash of
panache to ``Wayne's World,'' is in hack-for-hire mode here. 1
hour, 37 minutes. (DH) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Marti

 &HT;    Mac News: Bargain program handles personal information well
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A program called Consultant is the best new personal
information manager to hit the Mac market in years -- and it's a
heck of a good deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   For about $50, you get a calendar and electronic card file
largely the equal of programs costing twice as much. And, in some
cases, it's easier to use and more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   What's the catch? You can only buy Consultant over the telephone
or the Internet, which eliminates the cost of expensive packaging,
shipping and marketing. That's why the program is so inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant is representative of a larger trend in software. The
Internet is becoming the distributor of choice for software
developers, who are increasingly trying to entice customers to buy
online rather than in stores.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac developers, this trend is particularly important. Most
stores carry little if any Mac software. Not surprisingly, sales of
Mac software are continuing to fall, and developers are struggling.
They are desperate for ways to cut costs, and the Internet is one
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Consultant is distributed, it would be a good
piece of software. It's sharply rendered and attractive. The
program is also responsive and offers some novel twists on features
common in other personal information managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant, though, does have its weaknesses. For one, the
program won't let you save searches and sorted information. That
means there's no way to save a list of frequently consulted
contacts. This is a standard feature in most personal information
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also has no printed manual. Like a growing number of
programs, it has eliminated a manual to save costs. But Consultant,
unlike many other programs, does have excellent help within the
program. There's even more help available on its Web site and in an
electronic manual, which you can download.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Consultant works like most personal information
managers. It has a calendar with multiple views, a to-do list, an
address book and a memo writer.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you link contacts, notes and documents outside the
program to a to-do or appointment -- all standard stuff today. What
makes Consultant special is some novel twists on these common
features. Take its translate button.
</P>
<P>
   Click the button, type ``meet Bob for lunch at noon Friday'' and
Consultant will turn it into an appointment on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also offers strong word processing features. You can
keep a daily journal and write memos and notes. Memos can be
formatted like text in any word processor, changing fonts, rulers,
etc. You can also save templates for things such as faxes and
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant is published by Chronos L.C. You'll find the program
on the company's first-rate Web site, at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .chronosnet.com. Chronos will let you download a trial copy of
its program. Or you can order Consultant on CD by calling
801-957-1774.

 &HT;    Teenie-Beanies instill the great-American value of . . .
consuming?
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``They're absolutely free,'' the fifth-grader
tells his friend. ``Every kid at school has them.''
</P>
<P>
   He displays his Coca-Cola card, the proud trophy acquired after
calling an 800 number and waiting patiently on hold for a
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Teenie-Beanie Babies have invaded McDonald's
restaurants all over America. ``People called into Traffic Reports
that the McDonald's stations were all backed up,'' said Brian
Bruchey, an assistant program director for WMMX radio. The
Associated Press reported some Happy Meal purchasers throwing away
their food.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is news, exactly, so why was I feeling so
uncomfortable? With all these kids clutching pseudo-credit cards,
and parents scavenging Beanie Babies, I couldn't help worrying what
we're teaching our kids. We don't always succeed in instilling the
three R's, but every child in America is getting an excellent
education in how to be a consumer.
</P>
<P>
   In my basement, and in the basement of nearly every parent I
know, lie buckets of once-coveted, rarely touched McDonald's toys.
It would take a stout-hearted parent indeed to resist the
persistent pleas of kids who can say ``McDonald's'' before they can
pronounce their own names.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, Amy, is an unusually sensible parent, but even she
fell into the trap. The family is moving to Hawaii, and Amy
conducted a toy purge recently with her 7-year-old son. She found a
bin stuffed with about 60 Happy Meal toys, from Toy Story to
Anastasia. ``I can't think of any of those toys that survived the
cut,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for the moment, what these billions of discarded toys
might be doing to the environment. Think about a less tangible
erosion: the reflex for mindless consuming we're creating in our
kids. Can't you just see them when they're adults, and dining at
The Pine Club or Lller-blading and popcorn-popping. The tease goes
like this: ``Mass consumption. Instant gratification. Ahhh, summer
is here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Teenie-Beanie Babies are touted as collectors' items, and
books such as Beanie Mania and magazines such as Beanie World
compare current and projected market values. (They're counting on
us to forget that Cabbage Patch dolls, now readily available at
garage sales everywhere, were once touted as collectors' items,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   But suppose someday the Beanie Babies turn out to be a wise
financial investment. Are they worth the price? How much do we
ultimately pay if we encourage our kids to get in the habit of
consuming?
</P>
<P>
   Think of that fifth-grader telling his buddy, ``They're
absolutely free.''
</P>
<P>
   There's dad standing nearby, stifling his impulse to laugh,
stifling an even stronger impulse to say, ``Take it from me, kid.
There's nothing in life that's absolutely free.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    SIDEBAR: Early detection of skin cancer saves lives.
 &HT;    Staff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five-year survival rate is 95 percent for malignant melanoma
that is removed before it spreads, the American Cancer Society
said. And for less serious basal cell and squamous cell skin
cancers, ``cure is highly likely if detected and treated early.''
</P>
<P>
   People should beware of any change in skin growths, especially a
change in size or color of a mole or other darkly pigmented spot.
</P>
<P>
   Basal and squamous cell cancers often appear as either a pale,
waxlike, pearly nodule or a red, scaly, sharply outlined patch.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer society recommends this ``ABCD'' list to remember the
warning signs of melanoma:
</P>
<P>
   E A is for asymmetry, where one half of a mole does not match
the other half.
</P>
<P>
   E B is for border irregularity, where edges are ragged, notched
or blurred.
</P>
<P>
   E C is for color, where pigmentation is not consistent or is
intensely black.
</P>
<P>
   E D is for diameter greater than 6 millimeters, roughly a
quarter of an inch.

<P>
   He found out his cancer was back on the day after he found out
his wife was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Fairburn's malignant melanoma had branched out from the
original mole on his right shoulder to the lymph nodes under his
arm. The lymph nodes were cut out quickly, but there still was a 70
percent chance the cancer would pop up somewhere else by two years.
Fairburn, then 30, had less than a 50 percent chance of turning 35.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Fairburn and his wife were in their Union home
learning about the country's major cancer hospitals, from southern
California to North Carolina. ``Everything was such a mess. You're
like, 'What's going on? What is there?' ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, said Dr. Rob Finley, there was this experimental vaccine
he was researching right in Dayton, at Franciscan Medical Center.
It was just a small trial, with only enough money for five
patients. Experiments don't always work out either, so Finley
couldn't promise that Fairburn would live longer or even better if
he used this vaccine instead of conventional treatments. But he had
room for one more patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the right place at the right time,'' Fairburn said
recently, three years later. ``If we'd have had to go out of state,
we'd have probably gone bankrupt. I don't know if we even could
have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Things change quickly
</P>
<P>
   The search for a melanoma vaccine is a microscopic detective
story that shows how fast things change in the treatment of this
deadliest form of skin cancer. The vaccine Fairburn used still
isn't available to the general public, and Finley's research team
already has moved two generations ahead in the laboratory.
Meanwhile, evidence mounts that vaccines could be not only more
effective, but cheaper and with fewer toxic side effects than other
treatments for malignant melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind all vaccines is to stimulate the immune
system, which ordi purpose of this vaccine, said Currier, is ``to
make the cancer cells stand out'' as intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do that by combining melanoma cells with substances
they know the immune system will recognize. When those altered
melanoma cells are injected back into the body, they hope the
immune system knows to go after all those other melanoma cells that
have assembled in the body, much the way a hunting dog knows what
to chase after it has sniffed the right scent.
</P>
<P>
   The question that researchers are racing to answer is: What's
the best way to alter those melanoma cells?
</P>
<P>
   Franciscan is among several research sites exploring vaccines
against malignant melanoma, the fastest-growing cancer in the
United States after doubling its rate among whites from 1973 to
1991. The journal Nature Medicine reported in March on vaccines
tested in New York and Germany that shrank tumors in nearly half of
melanoma patients.
</P>
<P>
   By next fall, the Franciscan team expects to be ``one of few
places in the country, and the fiherapy late last month, naming it
for the former Dayton Foundation president and the first patient to
use their vaccine. Now, as they continue with other vaccine
research, they're awaiting the anticipated two to six months for
approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was treating Cash's melanoma in 1994 when Cash brought
him an article about melanoma vaccine research in Philadelphia.
Within months, Finley and his collaborating scientist, Dr. Emilio
Barbera-Guillem, were investigating similar vaccines in Dayton.
``Unfortunately,'' said Finley, ``it was too late for Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairburn arrived in April 1995, three months after Cash's first
vaccine and 10 months after the mole on his shoulder had been
removed. He had noticed the mole about six months before he had his
doctor check it. ``I ignored it,'' he said, ``and paid the price.''
Now the cancer had traveled, or metastasized.
</P>
<P>
   To explain how Fairburn's vaccine worked, Finley talked about
poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   Some people can roll around in poison ivy without any
consequences. Others will be itching for days if they just brush
against it. The difference is that people who get bad reactions
have a chemical in their skin that binds with a chemical in the
poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That chemical (in the plant) is a hapten,'' Finley said.
``It's a small molecule that causes the body's immune system to
react more.''
</P>
<P>
   If haptens stimulate the immune system, and melanoma cells
thrive because they escape the immune system's notice, then it made
sense to find out if the immune system would attack cancer cells
that were bonded with haptens.
</P>
<P>
   Came at good time
</P>
<P>
   Fairburn walked into Finley's office just in time to help test
that premise. The vaccine consisted of a patient's own irradiated
cancer cells blended with a common hapten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started this vaccine, the only thing I wanted was to
see my son born,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There would be some torture involved. The scars from 24 vaccine
injections still make his left arm look and feel ``like craters on
the moon,'' he said. And even before the injections began, he
underwent about a month of painful injections of substances to
stimulate his immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it felt like a hot poker went right up to my brain,''
Fairburn said. That was a good sign, actually. The worse Fairburn
hurt, the more aggressively his immune system was reacting. When
doctors started the vaccine regimen of three injections a month for
eight months, ``they said my body reacted pretty well to that,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancer was gone, and it stayed gone. ``But you're never out
of the woods,'' Fairburn said. Cash died Nov. 25, 1995, the same
day Fairburn's son, Tyler, was born and before his last injections.
Two others from the trial group also died, one of unrelated causes.
He wondered: If the vaccine didn't save them, could it save him?
</P>
<P>
   ``But my faith pulled me through,'' he said. That, and his wife
of nine years, Debbie. ``To watch another person go through this
has got to be very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The worst times were the weeks before his battery of tests every
spring and fall. ``You get the anxiety, the what-ifs,'' Fairburn
said. ``I get very short with people then. I'm better off left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't want to hear 'We're sorry.' But that day could
come. You've just got to accept that. You're not in control. You've
got to accept that every day you have free of cancer is a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarming signs
</P>
<P>
   At a regular three-month checkup in April 1997 Finley noticed
the lymph nodes in Fairburn's groin were bigger than they should
be. They weren't necessarily cancerous, but Fairburn remembered how
Cash's cancer had traveled down his right side to his right hip.
Now these enlarged lymph nodes were on Fairburn's right side, the
same side where his cancer had already appeared twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on the bubble waiting,'' Fairburn said _ first for the
CT and MRI scans, then for the surgery to remove the lymph nodes,
then for the biopsy reports. He spent some nights tossing and
turning, some days sweating and snapping at people. ``You just hold
on,'' he said, ``and hope for the best.''

 &HT;    Lewinsky exercises her libido
 &HT;    BY Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a photographic coup, Vanity Fair ($3.50) features Nancy and
Ronald Reagan in the first portrait of the former president and
first lady in six years. But the more interesting pictures are the
ones of Monica Lewinsky at Malibu, Calif. The six-page layout by
celebrity photographer Herb Ritts was one of William Ginsburg's
last publicity stunts before being replaced as Lewinsky's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95), which ran one of Ritts' photos of the former White
House intern posing a la Sally Rand behind a raft of pink feathers,
reports that Lewinsky's new legal team, Jacob Stein and Plato
Cacheris, will not court the media as frenetically as Ginsburg did.
Ginsburg says he agreed to the Vanity Fair shoot because special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr had ``imprisoned'' Lewinsky's libido.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Ritts was able to rectify this. In the photos,
Lewinsky does not look or act like a young woman facing an
indictment. She frolics on a grassy dune in blue jeans and a red
and white checked shirt, poses in a sophisticated black dress and
then hides seductively behind pink plumage.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES: In a fascinating cover story, U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) reveals that infants learn to tune in
to their native language by the time they are 10 months old. Two
recent studies show that the size of toddlers' vocabularies depends
on how much their mothers talk to them. At 20 months, children of
talkative mothers had 131 more words in their vocabularies than
children whose mothers were less loquacious. By age 2, the gap had
more than doubled to 295 words.
</P>
<P>
   JOGGING OUR MEMORIES: Do you find yourself forgetting your car
keys more often? Don't worry. Newsweek's ($2.95) cover story on
memory says forgetfulness is America's latest health obsession.
Aging baby boomers are ingesting everything from Ginkgo bilboa to
estrogen to boost their brain power.
</P>
<P>
   THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION: Skip New York's ($2.95) cover story on
the best doctors in New York City (good information, but only if
you're planning on getting sick in the Big Apple), but be sure to
read Garrison Keillor's witty essay on choosing the perfect M.D.
His advice: Never choose a doctor who uses his first initial or a
cardiologist who leaves religious tracts around the waiting room.
``I eliminate doctors whose first name is the same as any of the
dumbest people I went to high school with. ... And I avoid doctors
in solo practice at an address whose house number ends with a
fraction.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE SHAVE: Reading about shaving usually is as fascinating as
watching someone shave, but James Surowiecki's article on ``The
Billion-Dollar Blade'' in The New Yorker ($3) is an exception.
Surowiecki goes into the Gillette laboratories to describe the
development of the Mach 3, a triple-blade razor with an edge twice
as hard as steel. Gilette, which spent $50 million in a seven-year
research project, predicts the blade will revolutionize shaving.
</P>
<P>
   THE KING OF ROCK? Dave Matthews looks like Forrest Gump and his
band features a violin. So how did he become one of rock's hottest
stars? Spin ($2.99) profiles the unlikely superstar, whose group
sold out the 78,000-capacity Giants Stadium in 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   X MARKS THE SPOT: In case you want to see the movie ``The
X-Files: Fight the Future,'' and you've never watched the
television series, Entertainment Weekly ($2.50) offers a beginner's
guide to the conspiracies, the agents and the cigarette smoking
man.
</P>
<P>
   GONE FISHING: You'll never look at a deviled crab the same way
after reading Michael Finkel's man-against-nature adventure saga in
P.O.V. ($2.95). Crab fishing is the deadliest job in America, says
Finkel, who ventured into the Bering Sea in January. ``Each winter,
a snow-crabber faces about a 1 percent chance of not returning
home. That's 75 times the death rate for firefighters; 110 times
the death rate for members of the armed forces.''

 &HT;    Dry spring has helped Central Texas in battle with some bugs.
 &HT;    By Julie J. Everitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ An unseasonably dry spring has squelched what
could have been a horrendous year for bugs, giving residents a
break from the normal battles fought with tiny critters in Central
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rainfall, however, could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had many calls about anything,'' said Doug Andrews,
McLennan County extension agent. ``The biggest problems we have
seen of late has been the grasshopper population.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the insect population is down this year, particularly
mosquitoes, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   But grasshoppers, he said, thrive in dry weather conditions,
feeding off grass and anything else green.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very destructive,'' Andrews said. ``A swarm ... can
destroy a lot of tonnage of forage(NO)cq(RO).''
</P>
<P>
   The latest moisture dousing parched Central Texas in the past
few days, however, could mean the demise of much of the grasshopper
population, he said. But it does bode well for other insects
needing wet conditions to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said rain stimulates the growth of a fungus that
destroys grasshopper eggs, limiting reproduction of the insect.
</P>
<P>
   But rain, on the other hand, also causes many other types of
bugs to thrive, meaning more mosquitoes and fleas may be on the
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local veterinarians are already reporting massive flea problems
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible, terrible,'' said Lisa Holub, a veterinary technician
at the Heart of Texas Veterinary Hospital. ``This is one of the
worst (flea) situations we've had so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Anderson of the Anderson Veterinary Hospital agreed.
``As a matter of fact, we had a couple of dogs brought in today
that were (bleeding) because the fleas were so bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The warm winter failed to kill much of the flea population,
Holub said, already creating unsavory conditions for pet owners.
And the latest addition of moisture to the area certainly won't
help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get the moisture and the warmth, they just go
berserk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping fleas under control takes work, veterinarians say.
</P>
<P>
   They advise using a preventive medicine, such Frontline spray or
Advantage topical solution to treat fleas directly on the pets. In
addition, homes should be fogged or bombed with a treatment
containing a growth regulator to kill adult fleas and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the yard should be sprayed for fleas, not just once but
as many times as it takes to eliminate any flea problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you can do,'' said Holub, reminding pet owners to
keep pets on preventive heartworm medication to eliminate the risk
of heartworm transmitted by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Rain or shine, however, roaches seem to be the only bug that
thrives regardless.
</P>
<P>
   If there isn't much moisture outside, roaches will move indoors,
Andrews said. If there isn't much food outside, they again will
move indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you or I need to live, they need it, too,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   But eliminating the accessibility of the roaches' needs _ such
as keeping food covered _ may force them to move somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will move and be in areas where their needs are met,''
Andrews said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: School's about finished and so am I
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ ``Three more days,'' I chant under my breath
as I head down the hall. It's my end-of-the-school-year mantra.
</P>
<P>
   As I round the corner, I glance at the clock. It's 7:30. Good.
I'm early. But not quite early enough. Patty is already there, a
shoulder to my door and obviously trying to decide whether to
giggle or bawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoe's on the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' she begins to wail, ``REALLY!'' I look down and sure
enough, she's wearing two white socks and one Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me how your shoe got on the roof?'' I really
don't want to know but I have to ask before I call out the
custodian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben did it,'' she rasps in between sobs. ``My mom's going to
kill me.'' I assure her we'll get her shoe back before the buses
run this afternoon, but in the meantime, I need some facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd Ben get your shoe off?'' I envision arm-wrestling or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw it at him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You took off your shoe and threw it at Ben?'' I give her my
wickedest one-eyebrow-raised look, she sobs and nods. I ask why.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me a name.'' She waits and then asks: ``Wanna
hear?''
</P>
<P>
   I say I don't but that doesn't fit her plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Toad breath'! That's what he called me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty,'' I remind her, ``name-calling is seldom based on fact,
but rather on an inadequate vocabulary.'' I'm not helping. She
wails on while I head for the office to report a shoe on the roof.
Before I can make it, though, an anxious-looking Dan overtakes me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Schuett!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wha-at?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger has his head buried in his parka and he won't come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come out when the movie starts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he won't. He says he's never coming out. What if he
suffocates?'' I assure Dan that Roger is not going to stop
breathing just because he has his head stuffed in his coat, but Dan
insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, where is he?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In your room.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan's right. There's a headless, oversize Indians jacket with
feet at Roger's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger, take off the parka and tell me what's wrong.'' The
parka shakes. ``You can't go around like this all day.'' He mumbles
he can because there's nothing in the student handbook that says he
can't. I warn him I'm going to check when I go to the office for
help with Patty's shoe.
</P>
<P>
   He mutters something and I leave.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway down the hall, Tommy catches up with me. ``Ms. Schuett!
Ms. Schuett! Kenny needs you RIGHT now.'' I wheel and head back to
209. Kenny meets me at the door clutching a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I put the ice cream bars?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice cream bars for the movie. I told the kids in 4th period
I'd bring em.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny, it's 70 degrees in here. How do you propose we keep
this stuff from melting?'' He shrugs. Patty hollers for her shoe,
and Dan wants to know why Roger isn't coming out of his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Since they never covered this stuff at teacher school, I decide
to wing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny, hand out the ice-cream.'' He gapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, we eat it now or you wind up wearing it.
Take your pick.'' He catches on and rips the box open.
</P>
<P>
   Now, where was I? Oh, right. Patty's shoe and Roger's
hibernation. And it's not even 8 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Three days left and already I've begun to eat things I don't
even like _ two jelly donuts from a box in the teacher's lounge _
just because they're there. I guess maybe that's how teachers
measure stress _ days, hours, and all the jelly donuts they can
eat.

 &HT;    Lewinsky exercises her libido
 &HT;    BY Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a photographic coup, Vanity Fair ($3.50) features Nancy and
Ronald Reagan in the first portrait of the former president and
first lady in six years. But the more interesting pictures are the
ones of Monica Lewinsky at Malibu, Calif. The six-page layout by
celebrity photographer Herb Ritts was one of William Ginsburg's
last publicity stunts before being replaced as Lewinsky's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95), which ran one of Ritts' photos of the former White
House intern posing a la Sally Rand behind a raft of pink feathers,
reports that Lewinsky's new legal team, Jacob Stein and Plato
Cacheris, will not court the media as frenetically as Ginsburg did.
Ginsburg says he agreed to the Vanity Fair shoot because special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr had ``imprisoned'' Lewinsky's libido.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Ritts was able to rectify this. In the photos,
Lewinsky does not look or act like a young woman facing an
indictment. She frolics on a grassy dune in blue jeans and a red
and white checked shirt, poses in a sophisticated black dress and
then hides seductively behind pink plumage.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES: In a fascinating cover story, U.S.
News &AMP; World Report ($2.95) reveals that infants learn to tune in
to their native language by the time they are 10 months old. Two
recent studies show that the size of toddlers' vocabularies depends
on how much their mothers talk to them. At 20 months, children of
talkative mothers had 131 more words in their vocabularies than
children whose mothers were less loquacious. By age 2, the gap had
more than doubled to 295 words.
</P>
<P>
   JOGGING OUR MEMORIES: Do you find yourself forgetting your car
keys more often? Don't worry. Newsweek's ($2.95) cover story on
memory says forgetfulness is America's latest health obsession.
Aging baby boomers are ingesting everything from Ginkgo bilboa to
estrogen to boost their brain power.
</P>
<P>
   THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION: Skip New York's ($2.95) cover story on
the best doctors in New York City (good information, but only if
you're planning on getting sick in the Big Apple), but be sure to
read Garrison Keillor's witty essay on choosing the perfect M.D.
His advice: Never choose a doctor who uses his first initial or a
cardiologist who leaves religious tracts around the waiting room.
``I eliminate doctors whose first name is the same as any of the
dumbest people I went to high school with. ... And I avoid doctors
in solo practice at an address whose house number ends with a
fraction.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSE SHAVE: Reading about shaving usually is as fascinating as
watching someone shave, but James Surowiecki's article on ``The
Billion-Dollar Blade'' in The New Yorker ($3) is an exception.
Surowiecki goes into the Gillette laboratories to describe the
development of the Mach 3, a triple-blade razor with an edge twice
as hard as steel. Gilette, which spent $50 million in a seven-year
research project, predicts the blade will revolutionize shaving.
</P>
<P>
   THE KING OF ROCK? Dave Matthews looks like Forrest Gump and his
band features a violin. So how did he become one of rock's hottest
stars? Spin ($2.99) profiles the unlikely superstar, whose group
sold out the 78,000-capacity Giants Stadium in 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   X MARKS THE SPOT: In case you want to see the movie ``The
X-Files: Fight the Future,'' and you've never watched the
television series, Entertainment Weekly ($2.50) offers a beginner's
guide to the conspiracies, the agents and the cigarette smoking
man.
</P>
<P>
   GONE FISHING: You'll never look at a deviled crab the same way
after reading Michael Finkel's man-against-nature adventure saga in
P.O.V. ($2.95). Crab fishing is the deadliest job in America, says
Finkel, who ventured into the Bering Sea in January. ``Each winter,
a snow-crabber faces about a 1 percent chance of not returning
home. That's 75 times the death rate for firefighters; 110 times
the death rate for members of the armed forces.''

THOUSANDS TO GATHER FOR STATE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Republicans, giddy with the
possibility of Gov. George W. Bush leading a statewide sweep in
November, will stream into Fort Worth this week for the biggest
political convention in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14,000 delegates and alternates _ more than the
number attending the Republican National Convention _ are eligible
to attend the three-day event that starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With their eyes fixed on maintaining control of the Texas Senate
and taking over the Texas House for the first time in more than 120
years, Republican activists are optimistic about their chances to
become the state's majority party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a history-making year for the Republican
Party,'' said Mark Sanders, a GOP consultant in Austin. ``It is a
very balanced ticket statewide with individuals who bring their own
strengths to each race.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jane Nelson, chairwoman of the Texas convention, said
that she is proud of the growth of the party since she was elected
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our year. November is going to be the month the
Republican Party assumes majority party status in this state,''
Nelson said. ``It is so exciting to see the energy in the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking not too far below the surface, however, is a division
between social conservatives and the more moderate party members
who have financially supported the GOP for years. Because of the
differences, the convention at times may resemble an unruly
fundamentalist tent revival.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials fret that the party's sometimes strident
political message and image will scare away the independent voters
needed to win elections. There also is a concern that the GOP is
becoming an exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who elect the party apparatus are not the same
people who elect officials'' to public office, said Rep. Todd
Smith, a freshman Republican House member from Euless who has
butted heads with the GOP's conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into all these stupid fights over what is a
conservative, and there is no single, accepted definition of that
term and people tend to use it for their own purposes,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 16,000 GOP activists and family members are expected to
flock to the Fort Worth Convention Center starting Thursday. The
general sessions will be held Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So many conventioneers are coming to town that the city's
outdated convention center is bursting at the seams, with some of
the party's caucuses, dinners and receptions scheduled to be held
in nearby hotels, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every hotel room booked in Fort Worth and beyond,''
said Nelson, who is from Flower Mound but represents several North
Texas counties. She has helped to coordinate this year's
convention, which will cost about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Christian Coalition is sponsoring a dinner with
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee scheduled to be the keynote speaker.
The new national chairman of the Christian Coalition, Randy Tate,
is also scheduled to appear.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few open convention events is a communitywide,
patriotic rally on Friday in General Worth Square, just north of
the convention center. It will honor Texas veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the 1998 GOP convention is ``Changing the Course of
Texas History.'' Although Texas is trending toward becoming a
Republican state, Democrats still control the state House and
several statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican Party is almost bubbly this year over its
prospects in November. With polls showing him far ahead of
Democratic foe Garry Mauro, Bush is expected to be the first
governor in history to win consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind him is a ticket that party officials said mirrors
the makeup of Texas. Lieutenant governor candidate Rick Perry, land
commissioner nominee Tony Garza and state comptroller hopeful
Carole Keeton Rylander are candidates with something to offer to
every constituency, party activists said.
</P>
<P>
   After wresting control of the state Senate from the Democrats in
1996, there are high hopes among party loyalists that the GOP will
be able to maintain its grip on the Senate while electing eight
additional members to take control of the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of squabbling between conservatives and
moderates, state party Chairwoman Susan Weddington said that,
unlike during previous conventions, there aren't likely to be any
major fights over platform planks and policies.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Kim Brimer, who defeated a Democrat to win his
Arlington district in 1989, said delegates can disagree but they
must remember that they represent the party, and should not offend
undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most tantamount thing I do is represent my district. I won
it from a Democrat. I can't be a cookie-cutter Republican,'' said
Brimer, who is supportive of Texas House Speaker Pete Laney, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush pushes a bipartisan message on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supporting any Democrats, but I'm willing to have
Democrats support me,'' Bush said.

<P>
   In 1988 Congress passed a resolution proclaiming its goal of ``a
drug-free America by 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug policy has failed persistently over the decades
because it has preferred such rhetoric to reality, and moralism to
pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians confess their youthful indiscretions, then call for
tougher drug laws. Drug-control officials make assertions with no
basis in fact or science. Police officers, generals, politicians
and guardians of public morals qualify as drug czars _ but not, to
date, a single doctor or public health figure.
</P>
<P>
   Independent commissions are appointed to evaluate drug policies,
only to see their recommendations ignored as politically risky. And
drug policies are designed, implemented and enforced with virtually
no input from the millions of Americans they affect most: drug
users.
</P>
<P>
   Drug abuse is a serious problem, both for individual citizens
and society at large, but the ``war on drugs'' has made matters
worse, not better.
</P>
<P>
   Drug warriors often point to the 1980s as a time in which the
drug war really worked. Illicit drug use by teen-agers peaked
around 1980, then fell more than 50 percent over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 presidential campaign, Republican challenger Bob
Dole made much of the recent rise in teen-agers' use of illicit
drugs, contrasting it with the sharp drop during the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's response was tepid, in part because he
accepted the notion that teen drug use is the principal measure of
drug policy's success or failure. At best, he could point out that
the level was still barely half what it had been in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, however, no one had ever heard of the cheap, smokable
form of cocaine called crack, or drug-related HIV infection or
AIDS. By the 1990s, both had reached epidemic proportions in
American cities, largely driven by prohibitionist economics and
morals indifferent to the human consequences of the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the federal budget for drug control was about $1
billion, and state and local budgets were perhaps two or three
times that. By 1997, the federal drug-control budget had ballooned
to $16 billion, two-thirds of it for law enforcement agencies, and
state and local funding to at least that.
</P>
<P>
   On any day in 1980, approximately 50,000 people were behind bars
for violating a drug law. By 1997, the number had increased
eightfold, to about 400,000. These are the results of a drug policy
overreliant on criminal justice ``solutions,'' ideologically wedded
to abstinence-only treatment, and insulated from cost-benefit
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine instead a policy that starts by acknowledging that drugs
are here to stay, and that we have no choice but to learn how to
live with them so that they cause the least possible harm.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a policy that focuses on reducing not illicit drug use
per se but the crime and misery caused by both drug abuse and
prohibitionist policies.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine a drug policy based not on the fear, prejudice and
ignorance that drive America's current approach but rather on
common sense, science, public health concerns and human rights.
Such a policy is possible in the United States, especially if
Americans are willing to learn from the experiences of other
countries where such policies are emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not averse to looking abroad for solutions to the
nation's drug problems. Unfortunately, they have been looking in
the wrong places: Asia and Latin America, where much of the world's
heroin and cocaine originates.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of U.S. efforts to keep drugs from being produced abroad
and exported to American markets have failed. Illicit drug
production is bigger business than ever before. The opium poppy,
source of morphine and heroin, and cannabis sativa, from which
marijuana and hashish are prepared, grow readily around the world.
The coca plant, from whose leaves cocaine is extracted, can be
cultivated far from its native environment in the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   Crop-substitution programs designed to persuade Third World
peasants to grow legal crops cannot compete with the profits that
drug prohibition makes inevitable. Crop-eradication campaigns
occasionally reduce production in one country, but new suppliers
pop up elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   International law-enforcement efforts can disrupt drug
trafficking organizations and routes, but they rarely have much
impact on U.S. drug markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even if foreign supplies could be cut off, the drug-abuse
problem in the United States would scarcely abate. Most of
America's drug-related problems are associated with domestically
produced alcohol and tobacco. Much if not most of the marijuana,
amphetamine, hallucinogens and illicitly diverted pharmaceutical
drugs consumed in the country are made in the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the glue, gasoline and other solvents used
by kids too young or too poor to obtain other psychoactive
substances. No doubt such drugs, as well as new products, would
quickly substitute for imported heroin and cocaine if the flow from
abroad dried up.
</P>
<P>
   While looking to Latin America and Asia for supply-reduction
solutions to America's drug problems is futile, the harm-reduction
approaches spreading throughout Europe and Australia and even into
corners of North America show promise.
</P>
<P>
   These approaches start by acknowledging that supply-reduction
initiatives are inherently limited, that criminal justice responses
can be costly and counterproductive, and that single-minded pursuit
of a ``drug-free society'' is dangerously quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   Demand-reduction efforts to prevent drug abuse among children
and adults are important, but so are harm-reduction efforts to
lessen the damage to those unable or unwilling to stop using drugs
immediately, and to those around them.
</P>
<P>
   Most proponents of harm reduction do not favor legalization.
They recognize that prohibition has failed to curtail drug abuse,
that it is responsible for much of the crime, corruption, disease
and death associated with drugs, and that its costs mount every
year.
</P>
<P>
   But they also see legalization as politically unwise and as
risking increased drug use. The challenge is thus making drug
prohibition work better, but with a focus on reducing the negative
consequences of both drug use and prohibitionist policies.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that have turned to harm-reduction strategies for help
in alleviating their drug woes are not so different from the United
States. Drugs, crime and race problems, and other socioeconomic
problems are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   As in America, criminal-justice authorities still prosecute and
imprison major drug traffickers as well as petty dealers who create
public nuisances. Parents worry that their children might get
involved with drugs. Politicians remain fond of drug war rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   But by contrast with U.S. drug policy, public-health goals have
priority, and public-health authorities have substantial influence.
Doctors have far more latitude in treating addiction and associated
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Police view the sale and use of illicit drugs as similar to
prostitution _ vice activities that cannot be stamped out but can
be effectively regulated. Moralists focus less on any inherent
evils of drugs than on the need to deal with drug use and addiction
pragmatically and humanely. And more politicians dare to speak out
in favor of alternatives to punitive prohibitionist policies.
</P>
<P>
   Harm-reduction innovations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ efforts to stem the spread of HIV by making sterile syringes
readily available and collecting used syringes;
</P>
<P>
   _ allowing doctors to prescribe oral methadone for heroin
addiction treatment, as well as heroin and other drugs for addicts
who would otherwise buy them on the black market;
</P>
<P>
   _ establishing ``safe injection rooms'' so addicts do not
congregate in public places or dangerous ``shooting galleries'';
</P>
<P>
   _ employing drug analysis units at the large dance parties
called raves to test the quality and potency of MDMA, known as
Ecstasy, and other drugs that patrons buy and consume there;
</P>
<P>
   _ decriminalizing (but not legalizing) possession and retail
sale of cannabis and, in some cases, possession of small amounts of
``hard'' drugs; and integrating harm-reduction policies and
principles into community policing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these measures are under way or under consideration in
parts of the United States, but rarely to the extent found in
growing numbers of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: America, wise up!

   During the early 1980s public-health officials in Europe and
Australia realized that infected drug users were spreading HIV by
sharing needles.
</P>
<P>
   Having already experienced a hepatitis epidemic attributed to
the same mode of transmission, the Dutch were the first to tell
drug users about the risks of needle sharing.
</P>
<P>
   They also worked to make sterile syringes available and collect
dirty needles through pharmacies, needle-exchange and methadone
programs, and public health services. Governments elsewhere in
Europe and in Australia soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The few countries in which a prescription was necessary to
obtain a syringe dropped the requirement. Local authorities in
Germany, Switzerland and other European countries authorized
needle-exchange machines to ensure 24-hour access.

set up more syringe-exchange programs than state and local

   During the early 1980s public-health officials in Europe and
Australia realized that infected drug users were spreading HIV by
sharing needles.
</P>
<P>
   Having already experienced a hepatitis epidemic attributed to
the same mode of transmission, the Dutch were the first to tell
drug users about the risks of needle sharing.
</P>
<P>
   They also worked to make sterile syringes available and collect
dirty needles through pharmacies, needle-exchange and methadone
programs, and public health services. Governments elsewhere in
Europe and in Australia soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The few countries in which a prescription was necessary to
obtain a syringe dropped the requirement. Local authorities in
Germany, Switzerland and other European countries authorized
needle-exchange machines to ensure 24-hour access.
</P>
<P>
   In some European cities, addicts can exchange used syringes for
clean ones at local police stations without fear of prosecution or

<P>
   Cannabis, in the form of marijuana and hashish, is by far the
most popular illicit drug in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of Americans admit to having tried it.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana's popularity peaked in 1980, dropped steadily until
the early 1990s, and is now on the rise again. Although it is not
entirely safe, especially when consumed by children, smoked heavily
or used when driving, it is clearly among the least dangerous
psychoactive drugs in common use.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 the administrative law judge for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Francis Young, reviewed the evidence and concluded
that ``marihuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.''
</P>
<P>
   As with needle exchange and methadone treatment, American
politicians have ignored or spurned the findings of government
commissions and scientific organizations concerning marijuana
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse _
created by President Nixon and chaired by a former Republican
governor, Raymond Shafer _ recommended that possession of up to one
ounce of marijuana be decriminalized. Nixon rejected the
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 a panel appointed by the National Academy of Sciences
reached the same conclusion as the Shafer Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1973 and 1978, with attitudes changing, 11 states
approved decriminalization statutes that reclassified marijuana
possession as a misdemeanor, petty offense or civil violation
punishable by no more than a $100 fine. Consumption trends in those
states and in states that retained stricter sanctions were
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 scholarly evaluation of the Moscone Act, California's
1976 decriminalization law, estimated that the state had saved half
a billion dollars in arrest costs since the law's passage.
Nonetheless, public opinion began to shift in 1978. No other states
decriminalized marijuana, and some eventually recriminalized it.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1973 and 1989, annual arrests on marijuana charges by
state and local police ranged between 360,000 and 460,000. The
annual total fell to 283,700 in 1991, but has since more than
doubled. In 1996, 641,642 people were arrested for marijuana, 85
percent of them for possession, not sale, of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by concern over rising marijuana use among adolescents
and fears of being labeled soft on drugs, the Clinton
administration launched its own anti-marijuana campaign in 1995.
But the administration's claims to have identified new risks of
marijuana consumption _ including a purported link between
marijuana and violent behavior _ have not withstood scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Congress nor the White House seems likely to put the
issue of marijuana policy before a truly independent advisory
commission, given the consistency with which such commissions have
reached politically unacceptable conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, governments in Europe and Australia, notably in the
Netherlands, have reconsidered their cannabis policies. In 1976 the
Baan Commission in the Netherlands recommended, and the Dutch
government adopted, a policy of separating the ``soft'' and
``hard'' drug markets. Criminal penalties for and police efforts
against heroin trafficking were increased, while those against
cannabis were relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana and hashish can now be bought in hundreds of
``coffeeshops'' throughout the country. Advertising, open displays,
and sales to minors are prohibited. Police quickly close
coffeeshops caught selling hard drugs. Almost no one is arrested or
even fined for cannabis possession, and the government collects
taxes on the gray market sales.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands today, cannabis consumption for most age
groups is similar to that in the United States. Young Dutch
teenagers, however, are less likely to sample marijuana than their
American peers. From 1992 to 1994, only 7.2 percent of Dutch youths
between the ages of 12 and 15 reported having tried marijuana,
compared to 13.5 percent of Americans in that age bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Far fewer Dutch youths, moreover, experiment with cocaine,
buttressing officials' claims of success in separating the markets
for hard and soft drugs. Most Dutch parents regard the ``reefer
madness'' anti-marijuana campaigns of the United States as silly.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch coffeeshops have not been problem free. Many citizens have
complained about the proliferation of coffeeshops, as well as
nuisances created by foreign youth flocking to party in Dutch
border cities.
</P>
<P>
   Organized-crime involvement in the growing domestic cannabis
industry is of increasing concern. The Dutch government's efforts
to address the problem by more openly and systematically regulating
supplies to coffeeshops, along with some of its other drug policy
initiatives, have run up against pressure from abroad, notably from
Paris, Stockholm, Bonn and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 French President Jacques Chirac began publicly
berating The Hague for its drug policies, even threatening to
suspend implementation of the Schengen Agreement allowing the free
movement of people across borders of European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chirac's political allies called the Netherlands a
narco-state. Dutch officials responded with evidence of the
relative success of their policies, while pointing out that most
cannabis seized in France originates in Morocco (which Chirac has
refrained from criticizing because of his government's close
relations with King Hassan).
</P>
<P>
   The Hague, however, did announce reductions in the number of
coffeeshops and the amount of cannabis customers can buy there. But
it still sanctions the coffeeshops, and a few municipalities
actually operate them.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the attacks, in the 1990s the trend toward
decriminalization of cannabis has accelerated in Europe. Across
much of Western Europe, possession and even minor sales of the drug
are effectively decriminalized.
</P>
<P>
   Spain decriminalized private use of cannabis in 1983. In
Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court effectively sanctioned a
cautious liberalization of cannabis policy in a widely publicized
1994 decision.
</P>
<P>
   German states vary considerably in their attitude; some, like
Bavaria, persist in a highly punitive policy, but most now favor
the Dutch approach. So far the Kohl administration has refused to
approve state proposals to legalize and regulate cannabis sales,
but it appears aware of the rising support in the country for Dutch
and Swiss approaches to local drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996 Luxembourg's parliament voted to decriminalize
cannabis and push for standardization of drug laws in the Benelux
countries. The Belgian government is now considering a more modest
decriminalization of cannabis combined with tougher measures
against organized crime and heroin traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, cannabis has been decriminalized in South
Australia, the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra), and the
Northern Territory, and other states are considering the step.
</P>
<P>
   Even in France, Chirac's outburst followed recommendations of
cannabis decriminalization by three distinguished national
commissions. Chirac must now contend with a new prime minister,
Lionel Jospin, who declared himself in favor of decriminalization
before his Socialist Party won the 1997 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll found that 51 percent of Canadians favor
decriminalizing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is clearly shifting.

much of Western Europe, possession and even minor sales of the drug
are effectively decriminalized.
</P>
<P>
   Spain decriminalized private use of cannabis in 1983. In
Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court effectively sanctioned a
cautious liberalization of cannabis policy in a widely publicized
1994 decision.
</P>
<P>
   German states vary considerably in their attitude; some, like
Bavaria, persist in a highly punitive policy, but most now favor
the Dutch approach. So far the Kohl administration has refused to
approve state proposals to legalize and regulate cannabis sales,
but it appears aware of the rising support in the country for Dutch
and Swiss approaches to local drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996 Luxembourg's parliament voted to decriminalize
cannabis and push for standardization of drug laws in the Benelux
countries. The Belgian government is now considering a more modest
decriminalization of cannabis combined with tougher measures
against organized crime and heroin traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, cannabis has been decriminalized in South
Australia, the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra), and the
Northern Territory, and other states are considering the step.
</P>
<P>
   Even in France, Chirac's outburst followed recommendations of
cannabis decriminalization by three distinguished national
commissions. Chirac must now contend with a new prime minister,
Lionel Jospin, who declared himself in favor of decriminalization
before his Socialist Party won the 1997 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll found that 51 percent of Canadians favor
decriminalizing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is clearly shifting.

<P>
   The United States pioneered the use of the synthetic opiate
methadone to treat heroin addiction in the 1960s and 1970s, but now
lags behind much of Europe and Australia in making methadone
accessible and effective.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone is the best available treatment in terms of reducing
illicit heroin use and associated crime, disease and death.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s the National Academy of Sciences' Institute
of Medicine stated that of all forms of drug treatment, ``methadone
maintenance has been the most rigorously studied modality and has
yielded the most incontrovertibly positive results ... Consumption
of all illicit drugs, especially heroin, declines. Crime is
reduced, fewer individuals become HIV positive, and individual
functioning is improved.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the institute went on to declare, ``Current policy ...
puts too much emphasis on protecting society from methadone, and
not enough on protecting society from the epidemics of addiction,
violence, and infectious diseases that methadone can help reduce.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone is to street heroin what nicotine skin patches and
chewing gum are to cigarettes _ with the added benefit of legality.
Taken orally, methadone has little of injected heroin's effect on
mood or cognition. It can be consumed for decades with few if any
negative health consequences, and its purity and concentration,
unlike street heroin's, are assured.
</P>
<P>
   Like other opiates, it can create physical dependence if taken
regularly, but the ``addiction'' is more like a diabetic's
``addiction'' to insulin than a heroin addict's to product bought
on the street. Methadone patients can and do drive safely, hold
good jobs, and care for their children. When prescribed adequate
doses, they can be indistinguishable from people who have never
used heroin or methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Popular misconceptions and prejudice, however, have all but
prevented any expansion of methadone treatment in the United
States. The 115,000 Americans receiving methadone today represent
only a small increase over the number 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For every ten heroin addicts, there are only one or two
methadone treatment slots. Methadone is the most tightly controlled
drug in the pharmacopoeia, subject to unique federal and state
restrictions. Doctors cannot prescribe it for addiction treatment
outside designated programs.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations dictate not only security, documentation and
staffing requirements but maximum doses, admission criteria, time
spent in the program and a host of other specifics, none of which
has much to do with quality of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the regulations do not prevent poor treatment. Many
clinics provide insufficient doses, prematurely detoxify clients,
expel clients for offensive behavior and engage in other practices
that would be regarded as unethical in any other field of medicine.
Attempts to open new clinics tend to be blocked by residents who
don't want addicts in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In much of Europe and Australia, methadone treatment was at
first even more controversial than in the United States; some
countries, including Germany, France and Greece, prohibited it well
into the 1980s and 1990s. But where methadone has been accepted,
doctors have substantial latitude in deciding how and when to
prescribe it so as to maximize its efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   There are methadone treatment programs for addicts looking for
rehabilitation and programs for those simply trying to reduce their
heroin consumption. Doctors in regular medical practice can
prescribe the drug, and patients fill their prescriptions at local
pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of general practitioners throughout Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and Canada (notably in Ontario and British Columbia)
are now involved in methadone maintenance. In Belgium, Germany, and
Australia this is the principal means of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating methadone with mainstream medicine makes treatment
more accessible, improves its quality, and allocates ancillary
services more efficiently. It also helps reduce the stigma of
methadone programs and community resistance to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors prevent American doctors from experimenting with
the more flexible treatment programs of their European
counterparts. The Drug Enforcement Administration contends that
looser regulations would fuel the illicit market in diverted
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   But the black market, in which virtually all buyers are heroin
addicts who cannot or will not enroll in methadone programs, is
primarily a product of the inadequate legal availability of
methadone.
</P>
<P>
   Some conventional providers do not want to cede their
near-monopoly over methadone treatment and are reluctant to take on
addicts who can't or won't commit to quitting heroin. And all
efforts to make methadone more available in the United States run
up against the many Americans who dismiss methadone treatment as
substituting one addictive drug for another and are wary of any
treatment that does not leave the patient ``drug free.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral methadone works best for hundreds of thousands of heroin
addicts, but some fare better with other opiate substitutes. In
England, doctors prescribe injectable methadone for about 10
percent of recovering patients, who may like the modest ``rush''
upon injection or the ritual of injecting.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Austria, Switzerland and Australia are experimenting
with prescribing oral morphine to determine whether it works better
than oral methadone for some users.
</P>
<P>
   Several treatment programs in the Netherlands have conducted
trials with oral morphine and palfium. In Germany, where methadone
treatment was initially shunned, thousands of addicts have been
maintained on codeine, which many doctors and patients still prefer
to methadone. The same is true of buprenorphine in France.
</P>
<P>
   In England, doctors have broad discretion to prescribe whatever
drugs help addicted patients manage their lives and stay away from
illegal drugs and their dealers. Beginning in the 1920s, thousands
of English addicts were maintained on legal prescriptions of
heroin, morphine, amphetamine, cocaine, and other pharmaceutical
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition flourished until the 1960s, and has reemerged in
response to AIDS and to growing disappointment with the
Americanization of British prescribing practices during the 1970s
and 1980s, when illicit heroin use in Britain increased almost
tenfold. Doctors in other European countries and Australia are also
trying heroin prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government began a nationwide trial in 1994 to
determine whether prescribing heroin, morphine, or injectable
methadone could reduce crime, disease and other drug-related ills.
Some 1,000 volunteers _ only heroin addicts with at least two
unsuccessful experiences in methadone or other conventional
treatment programs were considered _ took part in the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The trial quickly determined that virtually all participants
preferred heroin, and doctors subsequently prescribed it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Last July the government reported the results so far:
</P>
<P>
   _ Criminal offenses and the number of criminal offenders dropped
60 percent,
</P>
<P>
   _ The percentage of income from illegal and semilegal activities
fell from 69 percent to 10 percent,
</P>
<P>
   _ Illegal heroin and cocaine use declined dramatically (although
use of alcohol, cannabis and tranquilizers such as Valium remained
fairly constant),
</P>
<P>
   _ Stable employment increased from 14 percent to 32 percent,
physical health improved enormously,
</P>
<P>
   _ Most participants greatly reduced their contact with the drug
scene.
</P>
<P>
   There were no deaths from overdoses, and no prescribed drugs
were diverted to the black market. More than half those who dropped
out of the study switched to another form of drug treatment,
including 83 who began abstinence therapy. A cost-benefit analysis
of the program found a net economic benefit of $30 per patient per
day, mostly because of reduced criminal justice and health care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss study has undermined several myths about heroin and
its habitual users. The results to date demonstrate that, given
relatively unlimited availability, heroin users will voluntarily
stabilize or reduce their dosage and some will even choose
abstinence; that long-addicted users can lead relatively normal,
stable lives if provided legal access to their drug of choice; and
that ordinary citizens will support such initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In recent referendums in Zurich, Basel and Zug, substantial
majorities voted to continue funding local arms of the experiment.
And last September, a nationwide referendum to end the government's
heroin maintenance and other harm-reduction initiatives was
rejected by 71 percent of Swiss voters, including majorities in all
26 cantons.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands plans its own heroin prescription study in 1998,
and similar trials are under consideration elsewhere in Europe,
including Luxembourg and Spain, as well as Canada. In Germany, the
federal government has opposed heroin prescription trials and other
harm-reduction innovations, but the League of Cities has petitioned
it for permission to undertake them.
</P>
<P>
   A survey early last year found that police chiefs in 10 of the
country's 12 largest cities favored letting states implement
controlled heroin-distribution programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia last summer, a majority of state health ministers
approved a heroin prescription trial, but Prime Minister John
Howard blocked it. And in Denmark, a September 1996 poll found that
66 percent of voters supported an experiment that would provide
registered addicts with free heroin to be consumed in centers set
up for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, attempting to reduce overdoses, dangerous injecting
practices, and shooting up in public places, has also taken the
lead in establishing ``safe injection rooms'' where users can
inject their drugs under secure, sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about a dozen such rooms in the country, and
initial evaluations are positive. In Germany, Frankfurt has set up
three, and there are also officially sanctioned facilities in
Hamburg and Saarbrucken.
</P>
<P>
   Cities elsewhere in Europe and in Australia are expected to open
safe-injection rooms soon.

   In May 1994 the State Department forced the last-minute
cancellation of a World Bank conference on drug trafficking to
which critics of U.S. drug policy had been invited. That December
the U.S. delegation to an international meeting of the U.N. Drug
Control Program refused to sign any statement incorporating the
phrase ``harm reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995 the State Department successfully pressured the
World Health Organization to scuttle the release of a report it had
commissioned from a panel that included many of the world's leading
experts on cocaine because it included the scientifically
incontrovertible observations that traditional use of coca leaf in
the Andes causes little harm to users and that most consumers of
cocaine use the drug in moderation with few detrimental effects.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of congressional hearings have addressed multitudinous
aspects of the drug problem, but few have inquired into the
effectiveness of various European harm-reduction policies.
</P>
<P>
   When former Secretary of State George Shultz, then-Surgeon
General M. Joycelyn Elders and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke pointed
to the failure of current policies and called for new approaches,
they were mocked, fired and ignored, respectively _ and thereafter
mischaracterized as advocating the outright legalization of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, in contrast, informed, public debate about drug
policy is increasingly common in government, even at the EU level.
In June 1995 the European Parliament issued a report acknowledging
that ``there will always be a demand for drugs in our societies ...
the policies followed so far have not been able to prevent the
illegal drug trade from flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU called for serious consideration of the Frankfurt
Resolution, a statement of harm-reduction principles supported by a
transnational coalition of 31 cities and regions. In October 1996
Emma Bonino, the European commissioner for consumer policy,
advocated decriminalizing soft drugs and initiating a broad
prescription program for hard drugs. Greece's minister for European
affairs, George Papandreou, seconded her.
</P>
<P>
   Last February the monarch of Liechtenstein, Prince Hans Adam,
spoke out in favor of controlled drug legalization. Even Raymond
Kendall, secretary-general of Interpol, was quoted in the Aug. 20,
1994, Guardian as saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution of thousands of otherwise law-abiding citizens
every year is both hypocritical and an affront to individual, civil
and human rights. ... Drug use should no longer be a criminal
offense. I am totally against legalization, but in favor of
decriminalization for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   One can, of course, exaggerate the differences between attitudes
in the United States and those in Europe and Australia. Many
European leaders still echo French President Jacques Chirac's
punitive, U.S.-style antidrug pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Most capital cities endorse the Stockholm Resolution, a
statement backing punitive prohibitionist policies that was drafted
in response to the Frankfurt Resolution. And the Dutch have had to
struggle against French and other efforts to standardize more
punitive drug laws and policies within the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, support for harm-reduction approaches is growing in
the United States, notably and vocally among public-health
professionals but also, more discreetly, among urban politicians
and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most innovative needle exchange and other
harm-reduction programs can be found in America. The 1996 victories
at the polls for California's Proposition 215, which legalizes the
medicinal use of marijuana, and Arizona's Proposition 200, which
allows doctors to prescribe any drug they deem appropriate and
mandates treatment rather than jail for those arrested for
possession, suggest that Americans are more receptive to
drug-policy reform than politicians acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe and Australia are generally ahead of the United
States in their willingness to discuss openly and experiment
pragmatically with alternative policies that might reduce the harm
to both addicts and society.
</P>
<P>
   Public-health officials in many European cities work closely
with police, politicians, private physicians and others to
coordinate efforts. Community policing treats drug dealers and
users as elements of the community that need not be expelled but
can be made less trouble some.
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts, including crackdowns on open drug scenes in
Zurich, Bern and Frankfurt, are devised and implemented in tandem
with initiatives to address health and housing problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, in contrast, politicians presented with
new approaches do not ask, ``Will they work?'' but only, ``Are they
tough enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators are reluctant to support drug-treatment
programs that are not punitive, coercive and prison-based, and many
criminal-justice officials still view prison as a quick and easy
solution for drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons from Europe and Australia are compelling.
Drug-control policies should focus on reducing drug-related crime,
disease, and death, not the number of casual drug users. Stopping
the spread of HIV by and among drug users by making sterile
syringes and methadone readily available must be the first
priority.
</P>
<P>
   American politicians need to explore, not ignore or
automatically condemn, promising policy options such as cannabis
decriminalization, heroin prescription and the integration of
harm-reduction principles into community policing strategies.
Central governments must back, or at least not hinder, the efforts
of municipal officials and citizens to devise pragmatic approaches
to local drug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Like citizens in Europe, the American public has supported such
innovations when they are adequately explained and allowed to prove
themselves. As the evidence comes in, what works is increasingly
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is mustering the political courage.

RAW POWER DRIVES TENNESSEE WILLIAMS PLAY `NOT ABOUT NIGHTINGALES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: U.S. premiere of play is Wednesday) 
 
By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tennessee Williams considered ``Not About
Nightingales'' unique among his works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never written anything since then that could compete
with it in violence and horror,'' the playwright wrote, recalling
his early, unproduced play about prison atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence intrigued Vanessa Redgrave when she read it in the
preface to Williams' 1957 success, ``Orpheus Descending.'' Redgrave
starred in the 1989 London production of ``Orpheus,'' while her
background reading launched her search for the earlier ``lost''
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this subject had impassioned and outraged Tennessee
when he read news stories about it,'' Redgrave said. ``Because of
that paragraph in his preface to `Orpheus Descending,' I knew he
still felt strongly about it, even years later. Given the writer he
was, I just expected a play from him on this topic would be
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of Redgrave's fascination is the world premiere of
``Not About Nightingales,'' which stirred considerable excitement
when it opened in March at London's Royal National Theater of Great
Britain. A collaboration among the National, Redgrave's Moving
Theater and Houston's Alley Theater, the production will have its
U.S. premiere Wednesday at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   To characterize ``Not About Nightingales'' as the dramatic event
of the year requires no hyperbole whatsoever. Just consider the
facts. Here is the long-overdue premiere of a previously unseen
work by the legendary creator of ``The Glass Menagerie,'' ``A
Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' and other
modern classics _ the man many regard as America's greatest
playwright. In ``Nightingales,'' playgoers will find a work
atypical of the writer _ essentially political rather than personal
in nature. Yet they also will find early expression of themes that
recur throughout Williams' oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Trevor Nunn, the National's new artistic
director, formerly in the same position with the Royal Shakespeare
Company and one of the world's most-renowned theater artists. His
credits including ``Nicholas Nickleby'' and ``Les Miserables''
(both co-directed with John Caird), ``Arcadia,'' ``Cats,''
``Aspects of Love'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams (1911-83) wrote ``Not About Nightingales'' in 1938, at
age 27 _ seven years before his breakthrough to fame with the 1945
Broadway premiere of ``The Glass Menagerie,'' which announced his
arrival as a mature dramatist. Yet ``Nightingales'' is not the work
of a beginner. Rather, it is the culmination of several years of
apprentice playwriting, much in the socially conscious,
Depression-era vein of Clifford Odets' ``Waiting for Lefty'' and
``Awake and Sing.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1935, Williams had ``his Cairo! Shanghai! Bombay!''
produced by an amateur group. In 1937, a St. Louis amateur troupe
called the Mummers staged his ``Candles to the Sun,'' about a
miners' strike, and, later that year, his next proletarian drama,
``Fugitive Kind,'' set in a waterfront flophouse.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for ``Nightingales'' came in September 1938,
when Williams read a newspaper account of events at a prison in
Holmesburg, Pa. Convicts on a hunger strike were locked in a
steam-heated cell called ``the Klondike,'' and four were roasted
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The outraged writer began his play, shaping it as a titanic
power struggle between Butch O'Fallon, the convict who leads the
hunger strike, and Boss Whalen, the sadistic warden. Caught up in
that struggle are Canary Jim, a sensitive prison trustee due for
parole, and Eva Crane, the warden's new stenographer, who is
attracted to Jim but must fend off the warden's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, ``Nightingales'' was the first play Williams
signed with his ``nom de plume'' ``Tennessee,'' rather than his
birth name of Thomas Lanier Williams. He included it in a package
of works entered in a contest held by New York's famed Group
Theater. Though Williams did not win the playwriting prize, which
would have guaranteed production, his promise was acknowledged with
a $100 prize for a set of one-acts (but no nod for
``Nightingales''). Nightingales went unproduced.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars knew of ``Nightingales'' and the other early Williams
works, which are mentioned in passing in biographies. Yet no one
capable of launching a production took up the cause, until
Redgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Vanessa and brother Corin Redgrave founded their
Moving Theater in 1993, Maria St. Just, executor of Williams'
estate, located a copy of the manuscript and gave it to Vanessa.
After some research at the University of Texas, other materials
would be used to shape an edition for the play's world premier in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave considers ``Nightingales'' important in our
understanding of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, this is the work of a young guy _ about 26 when
he started it. We have to realize that at this point, he'd only
worked with small troupes, limited in their resources and
experience. He didn't know the great international movements, the
innovations of (directors) Erwin Piscator and Max Reinhardt. What's
extraordinary is that ... he wrote a trailblazing work unlimited by
the common wisdom as to what you can do onstage. He disregarded the
rules. That's the only way great drama is written.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunn believes the play went unproduced for ``relatively
undramatic'' reasons. Because it was based on a real-life case
(still wending its way through the judicial system when Williams
wrote it) and because of the accusatory nature of the writing,
producers likely would have considered its presentation impossible
at the time. There were other controversial aspects, including an
openly gay character called the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '40s, Williams put the script aside and moved on to
other projects: the play ``Battle of Angels,'' which would be his
first Broadway-bound production, but would close in Boston in 1941;
and ``Portrait of a Girl in Glass,'' the short story that
ultimately would evolve into ``The Glass Menagerie.''
</P>
<P>
   Corin Redgrave was impressed with ``Nightingales''' ``sheer
skill and grasp and daring'' upon his first reading of the script
in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all, I was impressed with the subject. Though it's not
an uncommon theme, it's certainly not something I'd expected of
Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of ``Nightingales''' prospects for New York or
London's West End, Nunn said nothing is definite beyond the Houston
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things are possible,'' Nunn said. ``It would be wonderful
if someone would come forward and say they want to take the play to
New York. We need a producer who wants to do it. We're waiting with
baited breath and increasing anxiety. We love the play.''

FEES DIMINISHING PROGRAMS' ALLURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Direct investment programs, which allow small investors to buy
stock directly from a company for little or no fees, have been a
popular option.
</P>
<P>
   But the programs, which include dividend reinvestment plans or
``DRIPs,'' have lost some of their shine because many companies
have started charging when they've added features or created a new
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, there are companies that may no longer be
appropriate for those who want to contribute small amounts of money
on a regular basis,'' said Vita Nelson, publisher of The Moneypaper
in Mamaroneck, N.Y., a publication that tracks direct investment
plans. ``They impose fees for cash investments and for reinvesting
dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor in Hammond, Ind., a
newsletter that focuses on dividend reinvestment plans, said there
are generally three types of fees:
</P>
<P>
   _ A one-time enrollment fee, ranging from $5 to $15. ``When you
start to get north of $10, it starts to get a little excessive,''
Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fees of $1 to $10 for each purchase, depending on the size
of your investment &UR; . &LR;  ``When you start to get above $5 per
purchase, that starts to get a little aggressive,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   _ A fee to reinvest dividends. A company may charge a percentage
of the amount reinvested, up to a set total. Carlson said the
amounts range from 50 cents to $5 per reinvestment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a detestable fee based on principle,'' he said. ``If I
am willing to be a committed investor to the company, they're going
to charge me a fee? To me, that seems ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   As plans add costs, they are also offering added services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the companies have bells and whistles in the plans,''
Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Those extras include allowing purchases using automatic
deductions from bank accounts, earmarking funds to go directly to
an Individual Retirement Account, allowing investors to borrow
against the value of their DRIP shares, and buying and selling
stocks on a daily basis instead of only on a set date.
</P>
<P>
   That goes beyond the services offered by DRIPs in the past,
Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fees anger Nelson, who did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Moneypaper recently yanked General Electric Co. from its MP
63, an index of companies offering direct investment plans, because
GE started charging a fee of ``at least'' $3 per cash investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a typical $50 investment, the new `no-load' plan would
deduct over $3 or more than 6 percent of the investor's funds,
which is excessive by any standards, so it's poison to the small
investor,'' Nelson said. ``We view such heavy charges as a betrayal
of the shareholders who have long supported this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of General Electric said the fee is necessary to pay
for the program's operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new direct stock purchase plan, which took effect this
month, is an enhancement of the dividend reinvestment plan, said
Tony Zehnder, GE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There is a $7.50 fee to enroll in the plan and a $3 fee for each
additional stock purchase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees are for purchases,'' Zehnder said. ``There is no fee
for having the dividends reinvested.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for fees is coming from transfer agents, typically
banks that maintain records of stock owners. Most fees by companies
with DRIPs are used to pay transfer agents, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transfer agents are pushing a fee agenda in order to have more
companies do this in order to generate income for themselves,'' he
said. ``These programs are very important to transfer agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The fees also steer away investors who are not likely to invest
a significant amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some companies, the fees represent a hurdle rate for a
committed investor,'' Carlson said. ``Fees help defray the cost of
operating the plan and they filter out some of the investors who
are tire-kicking and are apt to stay in the plans shorter than the
long-term investor.''
</P>
<P>
   All this doesn't mean that you ought to write off all direct
investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get the impression that most plans are no longer viable
for the small investor,'' Nelson said. ``That is not true. Most
plans have not changed. Most plans do not charge fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is increasingly important to consider the fees before
investing in a dividend reinvestment plan, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to evaluate what is the fee compared with other
companies of comparable quality,'' he said. ``How does the fee
compare to what my other options are in the non-DRIP world?''

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gee, I got back to work a week ago, having been on the road, and
durned if all heck hadn't broken loose during my absence.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, taking his direction from the Pat
Robertson wing of the Republican Party, was busily undermining 20
years of U.S. support for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Athletic Conference discovered that it was
unworkable after all. I suspect that the crowning blow was the
proposal to add the Universities of Beirut and Greenland to the
far-flung league.
</P>
<P>
   Another wacked-out kid had shot up another school, killing other
kids.
</P>
<P>
   And then Barry Goldwater died.
</P>
<P>
   I had not been a Goldwater admirer back in the 1960s (in my
heart, I doubted he was right about some things), but I came to
appreciate his love of personal liberty later on. Indeed, by
accident I even had a treasured exchange of letters with him in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   I had wondered, in a column, if Goldwater might not later have
regretted his ``extremism in defense of liberty is no vice''
statement at the 1964 Republican convention, considering that so
many people took it as a defense of extremism in general. The
column was carried in an Arizona newspaper and brought to the
former senator's attention. So he wrote to me (addressing me as
``Miss Truly'') to thank me for ``bringing the statement to the
attention of this generation,'' to say that he thought it had been
borrowed from one of the old Greeks and to add that he remained
proud of what he said and would say the same thing again.
</P>
<P>
   I responded to thank him for his letter and to point out that I
was actually a ``hairy-legged, balding, middle-aged Mister'' and
not a ``Miss.'' He seemed to find this amusing and wrote again to
say he was sorry for the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Two things stood out about this exchange of notes: First, his
letters obviously were from him, and not boilerplated by some
secretary. Second, Barry Goldwater was not a man to change his mind
or harbor regrets about his straightforward conservative
principles.
</P>
<P>
   He had been ill this year, and making few public pronouncements,
but I have to wonder what Goldwater must have thought about some of
the ``conservative'' stuff going on in the America of Randy Tate,
James Dobson and Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It ill serves Goldwater to give him credit for the current wave
of conservatism, which often seems based less on his view of
freedom than it is on a call for state control over the private
lives and morals of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around this country, you become aware of just how free a
people we are. Oh, we are asked to observe speed limits and other
laws enacted for our safety and for the public health and
well-being. But ours is still a land where a great measure of
diversity and even personal eccentricity is tolerated. Individual
initiative is still treasured. Look at the businesses starting up.
Anyone, literally, can do it. Look at all the thriving churches.
Listen to the free speech being expressed. Hark to the political
discourse (if you can find it lurking someplace behind the
name-calling).
</P>
<P>
   We are free, folks. We have liberties that others can only dream
about. People who keep saying Microsoft is being sued for being
successful miss the point. Microsoft is being sued because others
have to have the same chance Microsoft had. America is still about
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Big-Brother-like brand of government intrusion upon
the individual (supported by a lot of folks who are uncomfortable
with the Bill of Rights) that Goldwater decried and I find
offensive. I may not agree with the way that give-everybody-a-gun
advocates read the Second Amendment, but I'd rather leave it at
that than risk losing stuff like free speech and separation of
church and state and protection from unreasonable searches. To me,
it is unthinkable that conservatives would want to change a word in
the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   There are twin related threats to such an American vision of
responsible freedom. Self-serving religio-patriotism (the kind that
wants to mix country and theology and impose them on others) is
one, and our national love affair with victimization is the other.
We seem to revel in considering ourselves victims of racism,
victims of the Supreme Court, victims of government, victims of big
business, victims of death rays from outer space, victims of
teachers unions, victims of sexism, victims of the United Nations,
victims of affirmative action, victims of technology, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans _ conservative, liberal or whatever _ can do better
than that.

NEW YORK EXUDES COMPASSION FOR ITS WORST OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Keep your eyes open for Marc Plano.
</P>
<P>
   He's a white guy, 36, 5-feet-10-inches, about 175 pounds. He has
sort of a wide-eyed stare and a full head of dark hair that he
wears a bit long. Two days after Christmas, 1996, Marc Plano was at
the home of his ex-girlfriend's mother, in an Albany suburb. The
woman was 83 years old. Marc Plano walked into her bedroom. He
ignored her requests to leave and spent hours beating her. He left
the elderly woman with broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, he also raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had a conviction for a violent felony in another
state some years earlier and a string of less serious beefs with
the law, he was sentenced about 13 months ago in Albany County
Court as a first-time violent felon. He got 2-1/2 to five years. He
also was given credit against his prison term for time served in
jail before his conviction. Which means he'll be out of prison
soon. The parole board can release him as early as August 1999. And
the system absolutely has to let him go by July 2, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For the rape and beating of an 83-year-old woman, Marc Plano
will serve no more than 38 months in state prison and possibly as
few as 27 months. If you wonder why there's so much howling about
this system and its shortcomings, Marc Plano is only one
conspicuous example.
</P>
<P>
   It's because of outrages like this that Gov. George Pataki has
been fighting for sentencing reform in New York. Under current law,
violent felony offenders might receive a sentence that sounds tough
_ say, three to nine years. But they're eligible for parole after
serving one-third of that sentence, three years, and must be
paroled after serving two-thirds, which would be only six years.
</P>
<P>
   So, the top end of any such sentence basically constitutes
consumer fraud. Nobody serves the full sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jenna's law _ named for a young woman murdered in downtown
Albany by a violent felon on parole _ felons would be given fixed
sentences. And, if that sentence is nine years, they'd have to
serve six-sevenths of it. That would be seven years and nine
months. Also, if they behaved badly in prison, they'd serve the
full nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats initially opposed changing the law, especially in
an election year. They didn't want the governor, a Republican,
running around bragging that he'd gotten done what needed to be
done. Now Assembly Speaker Shelly Silver says he favors a change in
sentencing laws, but he'll offer a proposal with his stamp on it,
not the governor's.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also wants to pump more money into prison drug and
alcohol and education programs, which seems not to appeal very much
to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the moment, we have a stalemate. Meanwhile, bad guys like
Marc Plano, who really do hurt people, are being sentenced all over
New York to prison terms that sound far tougher than they really
are, thanks to the Empire State's generous parole provisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to note that two New York City cops have been
killed so far this year, each by a paroled violent felon, and that
28 states around the country don't even have parole. They simply
keep their criminals locked up for their full terms and off the
street for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those are states that treat violent criminals as
though they've done something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, we're far too kind, compassionate and enlightened
to think that way. We're pussycats.
</P>
<P>
   And we pay for it.
</P>

JURORS RECONSIDER CONVICTION OF TEXAS BAR OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA PRENTICE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Minutes after Joe Kennedy was sentenced in May to
probation for raping a female employee of his downtown Irish pub,
five jurors told him they had made the wrong decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We want to make this right. We know you are
innocent,''' the former bar owner said Monday. ``I'm glad they are
going with their consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Sid Harle will decide Friday if the jurors can
testify as part of a motion for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Catherine Babbitt asked for a new trial after
the five jurors from Kennedy's trial signed sworn statements saying
they were uncomfortable about voting to convict Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has until Friday to provide the judge with court
decisions supporting a juror's right to testify about what happened
in closed-door jury deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated more than 14 hours over two days before
convicting Kennedy of sexual assault on May 18. It took only
minutes for jurors to agree to sentence Kennedy to five years
probation and six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted at a second trial, he could face up to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to take the chance of a long prison term,''
Kennedy said Monday. ``I did not commit this crime and I will prove
my innocence in court.''

AUTHOR'S CHALLENGE NOW IS FOR SECOND NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Oprah Winfrey called Jacquelyn Mitchard, the talk
show host was merely a fan wanting to share how much she enjoyed
the writer's first novel, ``The Deep End of the Ocean.'' But
Winfrey also made it clear that she wouldn't be having Mitchard on
her show because she had learned that discussing fiction on
television was ratings suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Winfrey called Mitchard, which was just three
weeks later, the talk show host confessed she just could not get
the book out of her mind, had bought copies as gifts for all of her
producers and had instructed them to find a way to make fiction
somehow work on television. What they came up with _ and what they
wanted Mitchard to appear on as the first guest _ was something
they were going to call Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought then,'' Mitchard recalled recently in Seattle,
``that if there never got to be a second Oprah Winfrey book, at
least my book got to be the first Oprah Winfrey book. I also
thought it could do something to enhance sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' became an instant publishing
legend. Within hours of its Winfrey anointing, the list of people
requesting a copy in the New York Public Library grew to 4,000. And
within 10 days, the crush of demand prompted publisher Viking to
rush 800,000 copies into print. Nine months later, there are 3
million copies of ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' in print, with a
film version starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Whoopi Goldberg
scheduled for fall release.
</P>
<P>
   Few writers would dare let themselves dream dreams as grand as
what happened to Mitchard and her heart-searing novel about a
family's worst nightmare _ the sudden disappearance of a child in a
busy moment of distraction in a public place and the period of
family turmoil afterward, amid the lingering guilt and grief.
</P>
<P>
   For the author herself, the huge success of ``The Deep End of
the Ocean'' also set up a daunting challenge _ what she would do
for a second novel to fulfill her $500,000, two-book contract with
her publisher. Second acts for writers with first-time success are
often as daunting as they are for athletes and other public
figures; there is widespread belief in a curse called the
``sophomore jinx.''
</P>
<P>
   Life had already dealt Mitchard far more daunting challenges,
including caring for her newspaper editor husband in his losing
battle with colon cancer until his death in 1993, then raising
their four children on her own in Madison, Wis., as she attempted
to expand her writing from her newspaper journalism to a first
novel. But her difficult struggles _ at one time the single
mother's checking account dwindled down to $86 _ only seemed to
further deepen her rock-solid Midwestern level-headedness.
</P>
<P>
   So this was Mitchard's mind-set as she approached her second
novel: ``It's a devil's bargain. Whatever I write can't sell better
than my first book did; there has to be a shortfall. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to avoid writing another family drama. I wanted
to do a different kind of story because at the least _ at the very
least _ I didn't want people to be able to say I did the same book
twice. . . . And it was also important for me to have it over with,
that dreaded second novel. I wasn't going to fuss around for six
years and have someone then say I hadn't lived up to the promise of
my first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Mitchard _ who is no woo-woo spiritualist _ had the
essence of her novel's plot come to her in a dream. It is set in
San Antonio, Texas, where Mitchard had recently adopted a
2-year-old, and it centered on a 14-year-old girl's first love for
a charismatic prison inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard's ``The Most Wanted'' (Viking, 407 pages, $24.95) is an
unabashed women's tale of life changes wrought by love and romance,
with both the 14-year-old woman-child and her rescuer-mentor, a
40-year-old public-assistance attorney, narrating their heartening
stories in alternating chapters. It is a character-driven novel
where leisurely pace and small pleasures gradually give way to a
powerful sense of gathering doom, although the doom never quite
dims the expectation that the heroines' selflessness will be
rewarded and love will triumph.
</P>
<P>
   As the 45-year-old author emphasized, ``My goal with this book
wasn't lofty. I just wanted to write a love story that was poignant
and dangerous and sexy and one that didn't make you hate yourself
in the morning for having read it. I really think that topics like
romantic love deserve better treatment in books. After all, who in
the hell doesn't get involved in romantic love in their lives _
we're all thinking about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard _ who jokes about having ``dated more dentists than any
woman in America'' _ created a love interest in ``The Most Wanted''
that had her friends and even the author herself salivating.
Charley Wilder is a carpenter by trade but more of an artisan, a
soft-spoken and caring younger man of unassuming strength who
listens, really listens, to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up this guy and kept e-mailing my friends who all
agreed how cool he was,'' Mitchard recalled. ``We all kept saying,
`If only Charley was a real human being, instead of a made-up
character.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then into Mitchard's life _ or actually into a tiling job in
Mitchard's bathroom _ stepped Chris Sornberger three months ago.
This carpenter and artisan did not look exactly as Charley Wilder
does in the book, but almost everything else about him seemed to
fit with Mitchard's descriptions, right down to how he slept at
home not in a bed but rather in a Yucatan hammock (edited out of
the book).
</P>
<P>
   This was life imitating art beyond all reason. Or as Mitchard
put it: ``If there is a dimension of life that you might call
destiny, it was like a big rubber hammer hitting me over the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mitchard told Sornberger, who is 12 years younger, that
perhaps he ought to read ``The Most Wanted'' before they got
involved any further. And that did not deter him in the slightest.
The two were married only a month after their initial meeting on a
bathroom remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   So now it's farewell to all those stories that once dubbed
Mitchard, as she recalled with a smile, ``the little widow who
could.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchard and her remarkable success will continue to serve
as testament to what true grit and high energy and profound
graciousness can reap, even after personal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between me and somebody who would not try to
live a larger life after a disaster is that I was too afraid of
withering from boredom to not take the risk,'' Mitchard emphasized.
``And once you say, `I'm willing to walk the walk no matter where
it takes me,' then you can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also have to be willing to do whatever it takes, which
is often a hell of a lot more than you think you can do. But that
turned out to be healthy for me _ it forced me back on reserves I
might not have known I had. I didn't want to live a life where
people think isn't she brave. I'd much rather have people think I'm
goofy _ and I wanted children not to grow up and be timid either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a most ordinary person. I am medium everything, even a
medium talent. But I will push that as far as I possibly can.''

THERE'S NOTHING LIKE BEING A KID IN SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you remember when May turned to June turned to Summer and you
were still trapped behind a school desk while the sounds and smells
of summer seemed to say: Six times seven is 42 and it doesn't make
any difference because in exactly two more weeks we'll be outta
here and riding our bikes all day and climbing trees and checking
out whose garden will offer up the best filched tomatoes(?)
</P>
<P>
   It was anticipation. It was knowing that out there, just beyond
the schoolyard, there were days when you actually woke up early and
made your bed and wolfed down breakfast and ran out the door to do
maybe absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what are you going to do today?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, nothing . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when being farmed-out was every kid's dream, going
to the grandparents' farm or the aunt and uncle's farm or the
neighbor's family farm, where there were real cows and horses and
pigs and real milk and helping with chores you wouldn't be caught
dead doing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Summer was not having to come home from school and change into
play clothes because summer meant you didn't even have to put shoes
on if you didn't want to, and getting dirty was part of summer's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But on the leading edge of summer, we sat listless at our school
desks and passed notes about Albert having to go to the dreaded
Summer School because he couldn't remember six times seven is 42.
And kids from St. Bartholomew's School would ride their bikes by
our open school windows and taunt us with the fact that Catholic
school kids got out two weeks earlier and being Catholic sounded
like a pretty good deal because they got out of school early and
didn't face the prospect of losing several weeks of summer at a
distinctly Protestant invention called Vacation Bible School
because Catholic kids seemed to get their religion pounded up their
noses every day of the year anyway and they even took communion
long before the rest of us even had to start learning about Martin
Luther and the grace of God, which didn't seem to make much of an
impression when you were a kid on the leading edge of summer.
</P>
<P>
   June _ actually, right after the Memorial Day parade _ was when
``Girls Baseball'' started night games at the not-so-elegant
stadium with wooden bleacher bench seats. These Girls of Summer had
been Rosie the Riveters during The Big One, and had filled-in the
very-minor league demand for local baseball games. Entire families
went for loose-change admission prices and watched teams like the
Olympia Queens take on the Rockolas while nighthawks circled above
us and occasional balls were knocked over the wood fence into the
leftover Victory Gardens surrounding the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Summer from the front end was the sound of the Milwaukee Road
and the Chicago and North Western trains blowing their whistles as
they crossed one another's rights-of-way, and the not-so-distant
chance of crouching on a wooden overpass with your country cousin,
waiting for the chance to drop stones down the locomotive smoke
stack and coming home with soot all over you.
</P>
<P>
   In June, there were games at night because you were allowed to
stay out long after the street lights went on, and your grandmother
would let you use an old quart Mason jar for catching fireflies,
which some kids called lightning bugs. And you could sleep on the
screened porch and hear the adults across the street laughing and
drinking as their swing creaked back and forth, and it wouldn't be
long until you also could hear the night sounds from the annual
carnival that ran a whole week in the Sears, Roebuck parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Whole summers of ``doing nothing'' were jammed with unending
marbles games and top-spinning contests and inner-tube gun wars and
loud clackety-clackety races down the blocks of WPA sidewalks on
steel roller-skate wheels nailed to wooden crates still smelling of
oranges and celery.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early part of June, before we could chant ``School's
out! School's out! Someone left the monkeys out!'' we were still
trapped behind those desks, gazing out the open windows like
animals in those almost-real enclosures at the zoo where you had to
hold your sister's hand so she didn't get kidnapped by rumored
unsavories who could blend in with the crowds, which is why your
mother could never actually point out someone who was liable to be
a kidnapper.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, it wasn't kidnappers snatching us away; it was the
sounds and smells of summer coming through the classroom window,
the butterfly zigzagging from one blossom to another on the catalpa
trees ringing the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   And the alleged fact that six times seven is 42 was as
unfathomable as the Catechism because when you're young and it's
June, what's really important is knowing what time the Good Humor
guy comes down your street.
</P>
<P>
   STILL HERE: Reports of My Demise, or possible retirement, are
drastically premature. Last week's column must have read like a
swan song to some, but you shall not be that lucky. Hahn is alive
and well and hopes to be gainfully employed at the P-I for years to
come, for which at least his creditors and the family dog remain
thankful.

MOVIE ABOUT OUT-OF-THE-CLOSET TRAVAILS REFLECTS CANADIAN DIRECTOR'S
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Imagine you're a youth who left home and didn't return
for 10 years because your family ostracized you for being gay.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you've come up with the idea to make a movie about it.
It's wildly anarchic and chronicles a teenage boy's suicide, a
father's alcoholism, a mother's disappearance and a daughter's
wedding that will reunite the clan in a weekend of trauma and
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Then toss in the fact that it's told in flashbacks, set in a
remote Nova Scotia home and uses a lush, overripe garden as a messy
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   And add that its cast mostly consists of unknown actors from
Canadian theater and TV, with the most familiar face that of New
Zealand actress Kerry Fox (``An Angel at My Table,'' ``Shallow
Grave,'' ``Welcome to Sarajevo''), who plays foul-mouthed sister
Rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Does it stand a chance at the box office? If you said no, think
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hanging Garden,'' which is 29-year-old Thom Fitzgerald's
first feature film after working in the theater, has been one of
Canada's biggest domestic hits of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie won prizes at the Toronto Film Festival and won for
best screenplay at the Canadian Genie Awards _ the equivalent of
America's Oscars _ beating Atom Egoyan's critically praised ``The
Sweet Hereafter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier,'' confesses Fitzgerald, on a visit to
Seattle for screenings of ``The Hanging Garden'' at the Seattle
International Film Festival. His dark, non-literal comedy has just
opened in New York and is set to be released in Seattle on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald says his script evolved from a very literal place,
then ``worked backward,'' diverging from real life. It took three
shaky years for the story to make it from the first draft to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire to write it came from feeling far away from my
family. But the root of the story is the idea of the teenage
William killing himself. I certainly never tried to hang myself in
a garden. I'd never do that. But the feelings William has over
losing hope, well, I did experience that as a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   But his teen angst didn't result only from his being gay,
Fitzgerald says. ``I would venture to guess more teens than not
feel a complete loss of power. They're close to adulthood but they
can't make a blessed decision. After awhile, that weighs pretty
heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a decade has passed, Fitzgerald says he still struggles
with the idea that he's ``out of the closet'' to his family. ``My
mother, when I was 18, through her sobs, made me swear not to tell
the rest of the household,'' he laughs. ``It's hard when you can't
talk to family about your friends, love life or even your work.
That repression certainly pushed me to make the film in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hanging Garden'' is full of mystery and allusion. The
director says that it has something to do with his ``objections to
movies and everything else being so very literal these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The gay subtext and lack of name actors could have become an
obstacle to getting financing for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt,'' he admits, ``but not much. The non-literal aspect
gave people more pause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as casting a name, I thought I'd start at the top and
since I know Andrew Macdonald's mother (Macdonald produced
``Shallow Grave`` and ``Trainspotting''), I thought perhaps he'd
give Kerry Fox the script since they worked together on `Shallow
Grave.' They're great friends and I would never have been able to
get it into her hands had I sent it to her agent at ICM. I'm sure
they would have thrown it in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls, ``I met her in London and not only is she a great
actress, she's an even nicer human being. She agreed to do it and
the next day I met with Channel 4 Films (one of the producers).
Luckily they realized they not only had a script with Kerry Fox
attached but it helped that one of the programming executives was a
lesbian and had a huge crush on her.''
</P>
<P>
   With Egoyan, David Cronenberg, Patricia Rozema and now
Fitzgerald making Canada a significant contributor to the
iconoclastic art-film world, does the director think his country
has a particularly distinct sensibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all the time how Canadian films are dark and often
cross the lines of good taste. It's true of Egoyan and Cronenberg's
films and other things like Lynne Stopkewich's `Kissed,' as well as
my movie. But there are all these other films out there. There's an
entire population of filmmakers who closely emulate what American
moviemakers do, but on a smaller scale.''
</P>
<P>
   And are Canadians more tolerant of small, gay, art films? After
all, in the past few years the Canadian film industry has praised
and given awards to such movies as ``Lilies'' and ``When Night Is
Falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald notes that ``the Oscars, by contrast, still reward
commercial success. You rarely have a film win prizes that doesn't
do big business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, it's different because one doesn't necessarily
expect a good film to make money. After all, 2 percent of Canadian
box office dollars are spent to see Canadian films. That's a low
ratio compared to what we shell out to see American movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He's recently completed a second film, even though he calls
directing ``a nightmare, a horror, because there are all these
people lined up waiting to ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any answers for any of them but it was all stuff
a director needs to know. Making movies is very different from the
theater where there are more actors than crew,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that the whole process got easier the second
time behind the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made `The Hanging Garden' so hard is that everything I
said and tried to do was up for discussion. It wasn't trusted, but
judged, because it was my first film. On my second film, nothing I
said was ever questioned and I think they thought I was smarter
than I actually am.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds, with a laugh, ``I hope there will be a middle ground.
I'll have a sophomore flop and then things can finally get back to
normal.''

PATAKI PLANS CRIME-FIGHTING SYSTEM MODELED ON NEW YORK CITY
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACEY TULLY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Borrowing from a crime-fighting tool used in New
York City, Gov. George Pataki has announced a pilot program
designed to help counties share crime data, map trends and nab more
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The program is modeled after New York City's successful Comstat
system, which turns dry crime statistics into maps of criminal hot
spots. Within a year, the state hopes to institute a similar
data-sharing system among 10 counties, with the hope that this will
help the police agencies map county-to-county trends, share
resources and confront crime more effectively. Officials hope to
expand the program statewide by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals don't abide by jurisdictional borders,'' Pataki,
Republican, said in announcing the program Monday. The pilot
program includes the counties that comprise the State Police Troop
G area, including Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady
counties.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's crime rate has plummeted during the time it has
been using the Comstat tracking system, fueling a statistical drop
in crime statewide. Murders dropped by 44 percent statewide between
1995 and 1997 and rapes have declined 15 percent, according to
projections made by the Department of Criminal Justice Services.
</P>
<P>
   But not all counties have seen such a dramatic drop. In
Rensselaer County, for example, violent crime increased 33 percent
between 1992 and 1996. Between 1996 and 1997, it jumped another 6
percent, according to the most recent statewide statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they
fear that as New York City's crime rate drops, criminals move
northward, where drugs fetch higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, 1,226 of the suspects arrested in Albany
said they were born in New York City, up from 644 in 1991, city
records show. A kilo of heroin that sells for as little as $75,000
in New York City can trade for as much as $180,000 in the Albany
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we do get some crime from New York
City,'' said Albany Police Chief Kevin Tuffey, adding that the
problem of dealing with the criminal commute north was the subject
of a law enforcement seminar held two weeks ago in New York City.
``That's what this will help us to track.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration's pilot program is called the Crime
Analysis Partnerships to Upgrade Regional Enforcement, or CAPTURE.
</P>
<P>
   The CAPTURE system, which will cost an estimated $500,000 to
start, will enable the police in one area to tap into a program
that will tell them if the police in another jurisdiction have
encountered a similar crime pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (criminals) are moving in the direction of least
resistance,'' said Deputy Chief Jack Nielsen of the Albany Police
Department. ``This will help tell us where to shore up.''
</P>
<P>
   The details are still being worked out. But the program may
require the state to equip the smaller policing agencies with a
computer or a fax machine enabling them to provide data to the
state on a weekly or biweekly basis.

   Both geographically and culturally, California has always seemed
on the extreme edge of the United States. This is where the crazy
fashions start, from oat bran to surfing shorts to New Age
crystal-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   It is where a black mayor can appear in Chinese robes on a
catwalk, and his rival can be photographed naked in the shower; it
is where anything goes, morally, spiritually or gastronomically,
except the lighting up of a cigarette in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that many Americans have often dreamed of seeing
California, like some extravagant growth, painlessly removed from
the body politic.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-money, anti-special treatment But California has shown
surprising thoughtfulness of late, and never more so than in June
2nd's primary election.
</P>
<P>
   There, a millionaire candidate, Al Checchi, who had spent around
$40 million on his campaign (a record, even for America) was
soundly beaten in the Democratic primary for the governorship; and
another millionaire, Darrell Issa, was beaten in the Republican
primary for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Voters had more sense than to be swayed by these men's money,
which was a poor cover for the fact that they had no political
experience and the vaguest ideological convictions. Instead, they
opted for candidates whose careers commended them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a flawless choice: Gray Davis, the relatively
impoverished victor over Checchi, now owes a lot of money to the
special interests who helped him. But the result adds a hopeful
note to the endless debate about the proper role of money in
American elections.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's appearance on the scene was not, as some feared,
pernicious: he challenged the establishment at his own expense,
which was a good thing, but then found his millions did not sway
the voters, which was just as encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's ads swamped the airwaves but did not work, suggesting
there may be a natural limit to the usefulness of spending money on
commercials (the tactic which most inflates the cost of political
campaigning in America).
</P>
<P>
   Above all, California has shown that voters can usually be
trusted: in all the agonizing over campaign-finance reform, perhaps
the only vital rule is that they should know where a candidate's
money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Californians voted to end the state's program
of bilingual education, by which non-English-speaking children are
taught in their own language for several years.
</P>
<P>
   This costly program, the largest of its kind in the country, had
patently failed to reduce the dropout rate of Latino high-school
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it still had the backing of the education
establishment and many politicians; and again, it says much for the
common sense of California's voters that they chose to scrap it,
opting instead to give children a year of ``sheltered immersion''
in English.
</P>
<P>
   Latino parents supported the proposal almost as heartily as
Anglos, and for a simple reason: in America, despite the currency
of Spanish, English is the language of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, equally sensible, reason for this vote. In
recent years, California has turned against any kind of
preferential treatment for minorities. In 1996, it became the first
state to bar racial preferences in state hiring and contracting and
in admissions to state universities, a bold move that deserved more
imitators on the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual vote is an extension of this policy. California's
voters now believe that after many years of trying to assist blacks
and Latinos by applying admissions quotas or easier standards, the
proper approach is to spend more money on education at earlier
stages and across the board.
</P>
<P>
   With a booming economy and a $4 billion budget surplus, there is
money at last for improving the state's lagging schools; and, with
it, the confidence to defy entrenched bodies, such as the teachers'
unions, that stand in the way of color-blind reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went smoothly on election day. Californians
turned down a proposal that union members should give their
approval before their dues are spent for political purposes: a
victory for labor that will have national implications.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, at less than 40 percent, showed that relentless
campaigning-by-television has dulled the taste for taking part in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   There was still far too much money around, even if it proved
ineffectual. And promised for November's ballot are propositions to
ban fluoride in water, to forbid the ``recreational display'' of
dolphins, and to stop drunk-drivers losing the use of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is California; too much good sense all at once may
be hazardous to your health. &QL;

special interests who helped him. But the result adds a hopeful
note to the endless debate about the proper role of money in
American elections.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's appearance on the scene was not, as some feared,
pernicious: he challenged the establishment at his own expense,
which was a good thing, but then found his millions did not sway
the voters, which was just as encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi's ads swamped the airwaves but did not work, suggesting
there may be a natural limit to the usefulness of spending money on
commercials (the tactic which most inflates the cost of political
campaigning in America).
</P>
<P>
   Above all, California has shown that voters can usually be
trusted: in all the agonizing over campaign-finance reform, perhaps
the only vital rule is that they should know where a candidate's
money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Californians voted to end the state's program
of bilingual education, by which non-English-speaking children are
taught in their own language for several years.
</P>
<P>
   This costly program, the largest of its kind in the country, had
patently failed to reduce the dropout rate of Latino high-school
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it still had the backing of the education
establishment and many politicians; and again, it says much for the
common sense of California's voters that they chose to scrap it,
opting instead to give children a year of ``sheltered immersion''
in English.
</P>
<P>
   Latino parents supported the proposal almost as heartily as
Anglos, and for a simple reason: in America, despite the currency
of Spanish, English is the language of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, equally sensible, reason for this vote. In
recent years, California has turned against any kind of
preferential treatment for minorities. In 1996, it became the first
state to bar racial preferences in state hiring and contracting and
in admissions to state universities, a bold move that deserved more
imitators on the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual vote is an extension of this policy. California's
voters now believe that after many years of trying to assist blacks
and Latinos by applying admissions quotas or easier standards, the
proper approach is to spend more money on education at earlier
stages and across the board.
</P>
<P>
   With a booming economy and a $4 billion budget surplus, there is
money at last for improving the state's lagging schools; and, with
it, the confidence to defy entrenched bodies, such as the teachers'
unions, that stand in the way of color-blind reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went smoothly on election day. Californians
turned down a proposal that union members should give their
approval before their dues are spent for political purposes: a
victory for labor that will have national implications.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, at less than 40 percent, showed that relentless
campaigning-by-television has dulled the taste for taking part in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   There was still far too much money around, even if it proved
ineffectual. And promised for November's ballot are propositions to
ban fluoride in water, to forbid the ``recreational display'' of
dolphins, and to stop drunk-drivers losing the use of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, this is California; too much good sense all at once may
be hazardous to your health. &QL;

<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, perhaps the most incompetent nationalist in
modern history, continues to hack away at what is left of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31 voters in tiny Montenegro, which, with Serbia, is all
that is left of the Yugoslav federation, strongly backed their
reformist president, who no longer recognizes the authority of
Yugoslavia's government. The next step may be a referendum on
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Milosevic is stepping up his war on separatists in
Kosovo, Serbia's Albanian-speaking province. Over 200 people have
been killed this year, perhaps 40 this week. Refugees are streaming
out of Kosovo. Young Albanians eager to join up with the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army are streaming in.
</P>
<P>
   This is harrowingly familiar. Seven years ago Milosevic's
attempt to enlarge Serbia's share of Yugoslavia _ which then
included Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia _ cost at least
100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, too, is the dilemma faced by western leaders: should
they watch the bloodshed, as they did for too long in Bosnia, or
risk compatriots' lives and their own political careers by getting
involved in somebody else's war, as America did in Vietnam?
</P>
<P>
   Muscular diplomacy, they had hoped, would save them. The Contact
Group _ America, Russia and the four big West European countries _
punished Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo with sanctions. Even as
he continued to pound the Albanians, he agreed to talk to their
leader; sanctions were eased. But the West now admits it will have
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest worry is that the war will spread to Kosovo's two
neighbors, Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The separatists use both countries (and Montenegro) as havens
and as conduits for arms. Milosevic's forces might well be tempted
to chase them across borders, setting off a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has the extra worry that Kosovo's strife will inflame
relations between its own Albanian-speaking population and the
country's dominant Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week foreign ministers from NATO's 16 members decided to
upgrade a military exercise in Macedonia and launch one in Albania.
The goal is sensible: to warn off Serbia and bolster the stability
of two governments that have so far steered clear of Kosovo's war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even these modest reassurances pull NATO into dangerous
territory. Two countries that serve as bases for attacks on
Yugoslavia, albeit not deliberately, now have an implicit security
guarantee. To protect them, NATO may have to go beyond the
hand-holding measures it has planned so far.
</P>
<P>
   The main option is some form of ``preventive deployment'' of
troops. This may be necessary, but NATO must be explicit _ in
public _ about what it is trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot send troops merely to ``monitor'' borders; if invaders
swept past them, NATO would become a laughingstock. Nor should NATO
seal borders against arms smuggling and infiltration. If it did, it
would rightly be accused of holding down the Albanians while
Milosevic's men pummelled them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, lastly, should NATO police Albania's chaotic northeast,
where an outlaw mini-state run by adherents of the ex-president,
Sali Berisha, terrorizes the locals and succors Kosovo's
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO operation should have one mission: to deter organized
aggression and, if necessary, repel it by force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's strategists suggest 23,000 troops would be needed along
the 140-kilometer (90-mile) border between Kosovo and Albania. That
is too many, especially if the force is not to be expected to
intercept arms and guerrillas. NATO needs only enough troops to
back up its deterrent role: it can watch borders from the air and
send extra troops in case of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this were to succeed, NATO would have other worries.
Albanians are not angels. While Serb police mop up separatist
settlements, the Kosovo Liberation Army has driven some Kosovo
Serbs out of their villages; in a province that is nine-tenths
Albanian, the guerrillas look the likelier ethnic cleansers.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO guards the borders behind which they hide, the Serbs
will accuse it of sheltering terrorists. Western governments, which
have used that term to describe Kosovo's guerrillas, will be forced
to agree. That would be bad. But inaction would be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever NATO does, things can always get nastier in the
Balkans. If Serbia's crackdown became wholesale slaughter, it would
have to consider direct intervention in Kosovo. And the West would
face some more hard choices if Montenegro opted for independence
and Milosevic chose to send in his army.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's next Balkan operation may not be its last. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans teaching their own children has more
than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation
varies enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, schools are financed according to the number of
pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come
in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president
of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The
National Education Association handbook declares that ``home
schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive
education experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
</P>
<P>
   They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep
into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet
bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over
the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the
senior admissions officer.
</P>
<P>
   Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children
and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny
minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are
some real haters,'' says Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans teaching their own children has more
than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation
varies enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, schools are financed according to the number of
pupils attending. ``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come
in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president
of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either. The
National Education Association handbook declares that ``home
schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive
education experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
</P>
<P>
   They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
</P>
<P>
   When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
</P>
<P>
   When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep
into mainstream magazines. Amazon.com, the biggest Internet
bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
</P>
<P>
   The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over
the past two decades. ``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the
senior admissions officer.
</P>
<P>
   Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
</P>
<P>
   Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children
and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated
herds.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
</P>
<P>
   One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny
minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated. ``There are
some real haters,'' says Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. &QL;

KENNETH STARR'S OBSESSION WITH A FIVE-LETTER WORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr is out to get the truth about Bill Clinton. He
wants the truth about a 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater. He
wants the truth about a 24-year-old lady called Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   To get that truth, Starr has done most things short of cracking
kneecaps. He has hidden a microphone on an accomplice. He has
subpoenaed bookshop records to see what Lewinsky might be reading.
He has allowed a witness who refused to talk to be kept in jail for
nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous place in Washington these days is between
this prosecutor and potential evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This week was pretty good for Starr-gazers. The prosecutor
declared that Clinton was under ``serious criminal investigation.''
His spokesman said that Clinton himself might soon receive a
subpoena, requiring that he testify under oath about his cordial
friendship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky herself, as if rattled, abruptly changed her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, having won a legal battle over the right to require
Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, to testify, filed a brief
with the Supreme Court, urging that he be let loose on various
other members of the White House staff, including Secret
Servicemen, who have never yet had to divulge the content of
private presidential conversations. No matter: the truth must out.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the headlines. But, on June 1, Starr also gave a
speech to a bar association in North Carolina, in which he expanded
on his passion for the truth at some length.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this speech, it was often said that the prosecutor's
moral sense was unusually developed: he had grown up as the son of
a conservative minister in small-town Texas; he had never smoked or
drunk or cursed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also said that his lifestyle exuded disciplined devotion:
his teenage hobby was shoe-polishing and his summer job was selling
Bibles; and, though he is busy these days, he likes to rise early
and jog to a creek near his house, where he pauses to sing a hymn
and pray.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's oration has made Starr's moralism seem
increasingly bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his speech darkly, brooding on a ``disease'' that
``threatens our safety, our democracy, and the very foundations of
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease, he explained, is that lawyers no longer take their
responsibility to the truth seriously. It used to be that lawyers
were like Atticus Finch, the hero of Harper Lee's novel, ``To Kill
a Mockingbird'': people who searched out the truth to counter an
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Starr, lawyers are like ``Bruiser'' in John Grisham's
book, ``The Rainmaker'': people who will do anything for their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, Starr says, that even though 25 out of 42
presidents have been lawyers, the profession is held in contempt
these days. One of the candidates in the Washington, D.C., mayoral
primary is campaigning on the fact that he is not a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Having softened his audience, Starr then developed his main
point. ``Truth is intended to be the primary goal of our judicial
system,'' he declared; if witnesses must swear to tell ``the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,'' then surely lawyers
should tell the same.
</P>
<P>
   In support of this contention, Starr cited Nix v Whiteside, a
1986 Supreme Court ruling that a defense lawyer should not assist a
client in committing perjury. Starr concludes that ``lawyers have a
duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The unwavering pursuit of truth should indeed animate
prosecuting lawyers like himself; but if you run Starr's general
argument by Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who is America's leading legal ethicist, you get an
interesting reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr's claim is not only ludicrous; it is pernicious,''
comes the response.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no lawyer should be party to perjury, defense
counsels have a duty to impede the search for truth in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   They may advise their clients to invoke the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, which means they can refuse to testify. They may argue
that incriminating evidence is inadmissible on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they know their client to be guilty, defense lawyers are
supposed to pick holes in the prosecution's arguments, and to get
their clients off.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's first duty is to the client, not to the truth,
because the alternative is terrible. If lawyers refuse to defend
clients whom they suspect to be guilty, then some defendants will
appear in court without a lawyer. If suspects know that lawyers may
desert them, they will not be able to confide in them and so
prepare a good defense.
</P>
<P>
   The right to a fair trial cannot exist without defense lawyers
devoted to the business of defending. It is for judges and juries _
and prosecutors _ to worry about truth.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr himself was defending tobacco companies some years
ago, and signing briefs arguing that nicotine might not be
addictive, he seemed to understand that the quest for truth must be
balanced against the rights of defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is hunting Clintons, Starr has grown obsessed by
this five-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year he even cited the First Amendment's
free-speech clause as he tried to squash hostile press stories:
``The First Amendment is interested in the truth,'' he said. But
the whole point of the First Amendment is to prevent people like
Starr from pursuing the truth to the point of trampling liberties.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Starr, hunting the Clintons is a soul-destroying
business. The president has used every legal trick available to
slow the prosecutor's progress. He has invoked executive privilege
to shield his staff from subpoenas; he has invoked attorney-client
privilege when that failed.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the president has assured voters that scandal
investigations will not distract him from the task of government;
but this week (not for the first time) his lawyers claimed the
opposite, in order to persuade a court to keep the investigators at
bay.
</P>
<P>
   All these frustrations are taking their toll on the prosecutor.
In the end, it is to be hoped, Starr may indeed get to the truth;
if the truth does not get to him first. &QL;

   MASON, TEXAS _ The motto of Grace Christian School _ ``Fight the
good fight of faith'' _ could be that of many an English private
school. The difference is that Grace means it.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of thousands of recently established fundamentalist
Christian schools across America, with a mission to major in Jesus
Christ and minor in everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Grace is housed in a small white clapboard schoolhouse beside a
dried-up creek in Mason, a pretty ranching town of 2,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside, and it is immediately clear that this is a
different kind of school, with humble resources. Desks line the
main room. Teenagers sit next to small children. The atmosphere is
attentive. There are no classrooms as such, just a single teacher
and two teaching assistants walking up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has 35 children, aged 6 to 18. Its largest-ever graduating
class was three; but in recent years its graduates have gone on to
West Point and Texas A&AMP;M University, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentalist schools are growing fast. In Fort Worth, Texas,
enrollment in them has grown by 30 percent since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of these schools do not report to the local
educational authorities, exact numbers are difficult to come by;
but Christian Schools International, one of several umbrella
organizations, claims about 3,200 member schools in the United
States, with 600,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for their growth is frustration at the removal
of God from the public schools. But some parents have in general
lost confidence in the state's ability to educate their children,
and others question the government's right to dictate educational
standards.
</P>
<P>
   When is a Christian school a fundamentalist school? There are no
hard-and-fast rules; but an unequivocal belief in creationism is
probably the most reliable indicator.
</P>
<P>
   So is a sense of ministering to the whole child. ``We believe
that every human has three parts: spirit, body and soul, and that
we should minister to all three parts,'' says John Burges, the
principal and only full-time teacher at Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Parents often quote Deuteronomy chapter six, verse seven _ ``And
thou shalt teach (God's Commandments] diligently unto thy
children'' _ as the source of their preference for such schooling.
How, they ask, can one diligently teach scripture in a secular
school system?
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum itself is overtly Christian. Almost every subject
on the Accelerated Christian Curriculum, which Grace uses, has a
Christian slant.
</P>
<P>
   Parents pay around $125 per child each year for books and course
materials. Some of these courses, such as grammar, are laudable for
their basic approach.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more worrying. The history curriculum carries the
notion of America's ``manifest destiny'' far beyond Monroe's
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Spain was defeated in North America because it was Catholic.
George Washington was preserved by a miracle during the
French-Indian war. All Muslims are ``descendants of Isaac's
half-brother Ishmael,''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, ``Americanism'' is the divine template for the world.
</P>
<P>
   Larger fundamentalist schools charge fees and grant
scholarships, but smaller ones have a different approach. Grace is
typical. Its shoestring budget allows it to educate each child for
roughly $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, parents sit down with the school to discuss how
much they can afford to pay, ranging from $50 to $200 a month for
each child. Teachers' pay is paltry. Burges draws a salary only
when all the bills have been paid; in a good year he takes home
$12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford a laboratory, Grace uses the great outdoors as
its classroom. In deer season the whole school goes hunting (PE),
butchers a deer (Biology), then cooks it (Home Economics) into
venison burgers for school lunch. And everyone says grace first. &QL;

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.

<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the general public may not immediately recognize a Monet
from a Manet, but they are as moved and touched by the paintings as
anybody. They can't put those feelings into words in the way a
professor can, but they still feel. It's amazing to me how the
cognoscenti, as it were, dismiss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customer has become more educated and more
sophisticated and I think Las Vegas has as well,'' he said.
Clearly, attracting new and, hopefully, wealthier clients, is part
of what both the Rio and Mirage are after.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is. When a gentleman comes in with a lady, he
doesn't want to hear about Picasso.'' Show a ``Seated Woman'' to
folk in Las Vegas, he seems to be saying, and how many will know
whether it is real or fake? And, more to the point, how many will
care? &QL;

   LAS VEGAS _ How to tell the genuine from the fake in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
</P>
<P>
   And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
</P>
<P>
   Take seriously also the giant hoardings that went up last week
outside the still unfinished Bellagio Hotel. While other properties
along the Strip boast a predictable roster of entertainers past
their sell-by dates _ Paul Anka, David Cassidy and Wayne Newton _
the Bellagio trumpets: ``Coming soon, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir and
Cezanne.''
</P>
<P>
   A second sign tantalizes: ``Special Guests, Pablo Picasso and
Henri Matisse.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
</P>
<P>
   To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be crammed, however, with a collection of
Impressionist and contemporary art to rival the world's leading
galleries. It is already being dubbed the ``Louvre of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after purchasing a rare Romanov snuffbox at auction
in New York for $74,000, the president of the Rio Casino, David
Hanlon, Sunday morning delivered it to Dr. Vadim Znamenov, the
Peterhof's general director, as a gift. ``To the Peterhof with
love: Sin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Other casinos in Vegas are also dipping into serious art. The
MGM Grand, while coy about its plans, is expected to decorate its
soon-to-be-built ``MGM Mansion'' with world-class paintings.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
</P>
<P>
   In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
</P>
<P>
   David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the grand tradition of American industrialists such as
Frick and Mellon and Barnes, who have made large sums of money and
bought prodigious collections to show off,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has greeted Wynn's spree with such equanimity. Nash
concedes that it has ``most certainly driven up the price among
top-of-the-line pictures.'' Other collectors are being squeezed
out, as well as galleries and museums hungry for masterpieces.

<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians _ and a large number
of Israelis _ fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian-Israeli confrontations now occur several times daily
_ with almost the same frequency as they did during the
``intifada'' uprising that preceded the now-dead Oslo agreement.
And still, incredibly, oil is being poured upon the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem _
anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement _ and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, according to Gingrich, is to blame for the
virtual collapse of the ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The EU itself is considering whether Israel should be blocked
from all future trade concessions with Europe because of its
settlements policy.
</P>
<P>
   EU diplomats were outraged to find that produce arriving in
Europe from the ever-growing Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza were being labelled ``made in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac has been infuriated
by Netanyahu's rejection of his offer of a ``Saviors of Peace''
conference, launched with Egyptian President Mubarak in Paris two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army have already staged a computer projection of
the violence which could soon break out on the West Bank and Gaza.
Another wicked suicide bomb by a Palestinian might provide the
Netanyahu cabinet with a reason to retake West Bank towns _ in a
search, no doubt, for ``terrorists'' _ where they would be
confronted by Arafat's armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Israeli ``intelligence sources'' (for which read the
Israeli army's chief of staff) have been telling the Jerusalem Post
that Arafat may have been smuggling rocket-propelled grenades _
``even missiles'' _ through a series of tunnels linking Gaza to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy _ all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place _ helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
</P>
<P>
   Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Israel's representative at the U.N., Zvi
Cohen, claimed _ untruthfully _ that the Hezbollah had been using
the U.N. position as ``their headquarters.'' This astonishing and
mendacious statement went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling _ that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds
_ perhaps thousands _ dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arafat is still, according to the Israelis, not doing enough
to ``crack down on terrorism,'' even though the PLO leader has
detained at least 70 Hamas members since March 29 (the day on which
the Hamas leader Muhi al-Din al-Sharif was mysteriously killed) _
most of whom, according to Amnesty International, were cruelly
tortured by the PLO in prisons in Ramallah and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 men have now been murdered in Palestinian custody _
all held for questioning about ``threats to Israel's security'' _
though not a word of criticism of this appalling abuse of human
rights has come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally imprisoned in the notorious Khiam jail by Israel's
proxy Lebanese militia allies, Ali Hussein Ali Ammar was then
secretly _ and illegally, under international law _ transferred to
Israel where he was sentenced to four and a half years for
``membership of an illegal organization'' and military training
inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When he was due for release in 1991, he was put under
``administrative detention'' and Israel now admits that he and the
other 21 Lebanese are now held solely as ``bargaining chips.''
</P>
<P>
   American cowardice _ in the face of the immensely powerful
Jewish lobby in the United States _ has now produced a situation in
which Washington remains supinely silent while Netanyahu, according
to the Israeli paper Yediot Ahronot, threatens to ``burn
Washington'' should President Clinton attempt to force Israel to
accept a 13 percent withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the State Department and the American press go on
talking about ``putting the peace process back on track,'' the most
tired and most untruthful metaphor in recent Middle East history.
</P>
<P>
   And still American journalists refuse to explain how or why the
``peace process'' has collapsed. Indeed, only last week, Richard
Cohen was telling Washington Post readers that ``on any given day,
it looks as if a deal can be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies _ as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. &QL;

Israel always claims to be.

   In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. &QL;

 c.1998 The Independent, London

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians _ and a large number
of Israelis _ fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian-Israeli confrontations now occur several times daily
_ with almost the same frequency as they did during the
``intifada'' uprising that preceded the now-dead Oslo agreement.
And still, incredibly, oil is being poured upon the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem _
anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement _ and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, according to Gingrich, is to blame for the
virtual collapse of the ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The EU itself is considering whether Israel should be blocked
from all future trade concessions with Europe because of its
settlements policy.
</P>
<P>
   EU diplomats were outraged to find that produce arriving in
Europe from the ever-growing Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza were being labelled ``made in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac has been infuriated
by Netanyahu's rejection of his offer of a ``Saviors of Peace''
conference, launched with Egyptian President Mubarak in Paris two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army have already staged a computer projection of
the violence which could soon break out on the West Bank and Gaza.
Another wicked suicide bomb by a Palestinian might provide the
Netanyahu cabinet with a reason to retake West Bank towns _ in a
search, no doubt, for ``terrorists'' _ where they would be
confronted by Arafat's armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Israeli ``intelligence sources'' (for which read the
Israeli army's chief of staff) have been telling the Jerusalem Post
that Arafat may have been smuggling rocket-propelled grenades _
``even missiles'' _ through a series of tunnels linking Gaza to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy _ all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place _ helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
</P>
<P>
   Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Israel's representative at the U.N., Zvi
Cohen, claimed _ untruthfully _ that the Hezbollah had been using
the U.N. position as ``their headquarters.'' This astonishing and
mendacious statement went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling _ that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds
_ perhaps thousands _ dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arafat is still, according to the Israelis, not doing enough
to ``crack down on terrorism,'' even though the PLO leader has
detained at least 70 Hamas members since March 29 (the day on which
the Hamas leader Muhi al-Din al-Sharif was mysteriously killed) _
most of whom, according to Amnesty International, were cruelly
tortured by the PLO in prisons in Ramallah and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 men have now been murdered in Palestinian custody _
all held for questioning about ``threats to Israel's security'' _
though not a word of criticism of this appalling abuse of human
rights has come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally imprisoned in the notorious Khiam jail by Israel's
proxy Lebanese militia allies, Ali Hussein Ali Ammar was then
secretly _ and illegally, under international law _ transferred to
Israel where he was sentenced to four and a half years for
``membership of an illegal organization'' and military training
inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When he was due for release in 1991, he was put under
``administrative detention'' and Israel now admits that he and the
other 21 Lebanese are now held solely as ``bargaining chips.''
</P>
<P>
   American cowardice _ in the face of the immensely powerful
Jewish lobby in the United States _ has now produced a situation in
which Washington remains supinely silent while Netanyahu, according
to the Israeli paper Yediot Ahronot, threatens to ``burn
Washington'' should President Clinton attempt to force Israel to
accept a 13 percent withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the State Department and the American press go on
talking about ``putting the peace process back on track,'' the most
tired and most untruthful metaphor in recent Middle East history.
</P>
<P>
   And still American journalists refuse to explain how or why the
``peace process'' has collapsed. Indeed, only last week, Richard
Cohen was telling Washington Post readers that ``on any given day,
it looks as if a deal can be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies _ as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. &QL;

HOLBROOKE: ``WORLD LOOKS TO WASHINGTON FOR MORE THAN RHETORIC''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what does Kosovo represent?
</P>
<P>
   Not one to hestitate, Richard Holbrooke said: ``It's another
Bosnia. It emanates from the same roots. It presents many of the
same dangers, particularly an unraveling of all of southern
Europe's boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's reference was not simply to the proximity of the
former Yugoslav province. The architect of the Dayton agreement was
also speaking of Bosnia as a metaphor for post-Cold War crisis,
evil, aggression, and threats to core European and American values
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be other Bosnias in our lives, areas where early
outside involvement can be decisive and American leadership will be
required,'' he writes in ``To End a War,'' his first-rate,
absorbing account of the sickeningly slow and then inspiring US
response to the war in which he was a central player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's richest nation, one that presumes to great moral
authority, cannot simply make worthy appeals to conscience and call
on others to carry the burden. The world will look to Washington
for more than rhetoric the next time we face a challenge to
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As it will this week in Kosovo, where Holbrooke will once again
be a player. With the same evil _ mass murder as an instrument of
aggressive, suppressive policy flowing directly from Slobodan
Milosevic's Belgrade _ the moment for NATO's intervention with US
leadership appears at hand.
</P>
<P>
   What Holbrooke describes as ``classic preventive diplomacy'' has
yet to stop the Bosnia-like slaughter to force the majority, ethnic
Albanians, from their homes in the south. The dangers of escalation
and a spread across the Albanian border mount daily.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush and then President Clinton drew a hard line
against any violent suppression of autonomy for Kosovo's Albanian
population. It may have been easier, but both presidents were also
in the right when they did so.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Holbrooke notes the seminal nature of Kosovo's role
in the Balkan history, culture, and recent horror. It is the
revered site of the battle 600 years ago where the Turks defeated
the proud Serbs and the spiritual capital of Serbia, even though 90
percent of its population is Albanian today. It is also the place
where Milosevic went in 1989 to ignite the modern period of
turmoil, war, and genocide. As Holbrooke also notes, this is where
a crowd that may have numbered a million people were inflamed as
Milosevic put a match to the dry wood of Serbian resentments.
</P>
<P>
   If, until his death in 1980, Josip Broz Tito used one-party,
independent (of Moscow) rule to govern six republics and five
nations that spoke four languages, practiced three religions, and
used two alphabets, Milosevic attempted the substitution of extreme
Serbian nationalism as master of this mess.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the carnage and wreckage of his unique
combination of demagoguery and megalomania are obvious. But
Milosevic still sits in Belgrade, in some ways with more insidious
consequences for his region than those flowing from Saddam
Hussein's continued presence in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The core of ``To End a War'' is Holbrooke's riveting account of
the 14 days at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio where the
Dayton agreement was negotiated. As someone with a fully developed
sense of history, the diplomatic trade, politics, writing, himself,
and the other players, he tells a great yarn. But the enormous
value and timeliness of the volume is its wrapping paper of history
and analysis leading into and out of the drama-stuffed conference.
</P>
<P>
   As both the cause of the carnage and the key negotiating partner
at Dayton, there is an inevitable, mixed nature to Holbrooke's
portrayal of the Serbian leader. His Monte Cristo cigars,
vulgarity, calculated volatility, and realism are present
throughout, offered to the reader with grudging fascination if not
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, however, does Holbrooke mince so much as a word in
describing what Milosevic did to cause and direct war and atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one cannot but wonder whether Holbrooke and the Clinton
administration will be able to shift to direct hostility toward the
man who was central to their success at Dayton in late '95. Bosnia
could be resolved in the context of Milosevic's continued rule;
it's not clear if Kosovo can or even should be.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other Bosnias'' of which Holbrooke writes comprise all the
hot, post-Cold War cases globally _ from the Persian Gulf and
Somalia to Northern Ireland, South Africa, Rwanda, and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely avoiding the pretense of grand doctrine, he nonetheless
makes clear his preference for a responsibly activist mixture in
foreign policy of the strategic realism of Nixon, Ford, and Bush
with the more idealistic missions of Carter and Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   This way is already being wisely paved by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. And if Al Gore should get through the political
minefield in the year 2000, you are studying the words of her
deserving successor.

IMPORTS ARE A BLESSING, NOT A CURSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ready or not, here comes a new attack of dyspepsia over
America's annual trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling began in March, when the Commmerce Department
reported that imports for 1997 had exceeded exports by $113.7
billion _ the largest trade deficit since 1988. This was, it was
almost everywhere reported, bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sharp deterioration in America's trade performance,'' the
Associated Press called it. The Washington Post headlined the
story, ``Off balance, and likely to get worse.'' Lou Dobbs, the
host of CNN's ``Moneyline,'' opened his show, ``We begin tonight
with today's troubling report on trade, a report that showed the
nation's trade deficit soared by 24 percent in December.'' And The
Wall Street Journal warned darkly that ``1988 could shape up to be
an even more dismal year for trade than 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicians followed the media. The Senate voted to create
an Emergency Trade Deficit Review Commission. ``Our trade
policies,'' scolded Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, ``are
soft-headed ... weak-kneed ... incompetently negotiated.'' When the
Senate Finance Committee holds a hearing on the subject later this
week, other Capitol Hill protectionists will have even harsher
things to say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pat Buchanan is out with a new book, ``The Great
Betrayal,'' an anti-free trade polemic. ``America's merchandise
trade deficit ... is a cancer,'' he thunders. ``Either we cut it
out, or it will kill America.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about trade deficits that triggers such bile? For 22
years the United States has run large and expanding trade deficits
with the rest of the world. For most of those 22 years, the US
economy has rocked. Protectionists glower that trade deficits cost
jobs, harm manufacturers, and wreck American competitiveness. They
do? Look around! These are myths, disproved by the vigor of the
richest and most productive economy on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying ... much of the misunderstanding about trade
deficits,'' writes Daniel T. Griswold in a recent paper for the
Cato Institute, ``is the assumption that exports are good and
imports are bad.'' That is certainly Buchanan's view. He paints
international trade as a zero-sum game: Between any two countries,
the one that exports the most wins. But if Buchanan and the
gloomers are right, if we are losing the worldwide trade war
because of the deficits we run with Mexico, Japan, and Germany, why
is the American marketplace roaring with good health? And why are
the Mexican, Japanese, and German economies gasping with
unemployment and stagnation?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, Dorgan, and the protectionists they hang out with are
wrong. Imports are not a curse on Americans; they are a blessing.
Our trade deficit is not a sign of disaster but of strength. They
``mean lower prices and wider choice for American consumers,'' as
Griswold writes. And ``by exerting downward pressure on prices,
imports raise the real wages of American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Imports make our lives better, more efficient, or more
comfortable, which is why American consumers and manufacturers want
them. The family in Nashville or Sacramento that has a Japanese car
in its garage, French wine in its cellar, an Indian rug on its
floor, Korean appliances in its kitchen, Canadian salmon in its
refrigerator, Italian shoes in its closet, and Kenyan coffee in its
pantry may well be running a trade ``deficit'' with the world. In
the give-and-take of international commerce, is this family getting
pummeled? Of course not. Its ability to exchange dollars for such a
rich assortment of goods is a sign of its economic vitality and
success, not desperation.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, and very sad, that the lower price of
imports can sometimes put Americans out of work. But slapping
tariffs or quotas on foreign exporters in order to save US jobs is
always counterproductive. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration
sought to protect American auto workers by limiting imports of
foreign vehicles. It worked, after a fashion: 22,000
car-manufacturing jobs were saved. But the import quotas drove up
the price of a new US automobile by an average of 41 percent. Sales
plummeted _ and 50,000 automobile sales workers were laid off. The
net result of the government's protectionism was the loss of 28,000
jobs, and more-expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trade-deficit fearmongers always want the government to raise
prices. Tariffs, import quotas, ``Super 301'' sanctions,
anti-dumping duties _ by whatever name they appear, the effect of
protectionist measures is always to force up the price Americans
must pay for goods and services. Sometimes their effect is open;
often it is hidden. Either way, they must fail. No nation can make
itself more successful or more comfortable by steadily, stealthily
hiking prices.
</P>
<P>
   Remember always: America's balance of trade is not a real
economic event. It is only an accounting fiction. International
commerce does not occur between nations, it occurs among
individuals. ``Every international transaction that Americans
engage in,'' Griswold points out, ``will by definition leave both
parties to the transaction believing they are better off.''
Otherwise there would have been no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Will we import more than we export this year? Export more than
we import? It doesn't matter. So long as we are free to buy and
sell and invest across international borders, we are sure to end
the year better than we started it.

HERE'S A GREAT ATHLETE WHO MOVES COUCHES FOR SPENDING MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the country's greatest athletes was on the third floor of
a gray Victorian on Dana Street in Cambridge yesterday lugging
boxes of books out to a purple moving truck parked at the curb. A
week earlier, Jamie Koven, a 25-year-old graduate of Brown
University, stood on a platform near Lyon, France, as a band played
the Star Spangled Banner while he was presented with the World
Championship medal for single-scull rowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty countries participated,'' Koven was saying in between
trips to the top floor. ``Twenty-four guys competed to see who
would represent the United States. Only one got to represent our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' he said humbly. ``It was really neat. I beat a German
guy who had won Olympic gold medals in 1992 and 1996. Third place
went to a British guy who had one Olympic gold and one bronze. It
was nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Koven is from Green Village in New Jersey. He attended St.
Paul's in Concord, N.H., prior to Brown, where he majored in
mechanical engineering. He is a big, strong kid _ 6-foot-4, 200
pounds _ who is out on the Charles River at dawn and again at dusk,
practicing, when he is not lugging beds, books, and pianos for
Larry O'Toole, who owns Gentle Giant Movers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tremendous for keeping in shape,'' Koven declared,
drenched from the aerobics of running between house and truck.
``It's great cross-training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be willing to bet that the men Jamie beat returned to
their countries with huge headlines,'' O'Toole said. ``And here we
have, literally, one of the world's finest athletes and nobody
knows it because his sport isn't accorded any attention here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Bulls played the Jazz for the basketball
championship of the globe. The NBA features Michael Jordan, the
most famous athlete in the whole universe. But it also features a
cast of felons and perverts like Dennis Rodman who get millions to
perform with no requirement to behave. Koven _ in a single day _
works harder than a Rodman or a Shaquille O'Neal do in a week and
he symbolizes the pride of athleticism far better than many who are
displayed daily on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Koven's is a solitary enterprise: One man in one boat on a
flat surface of water racing against a current as well as the
others out there alongside him. It is an old sport, a purely
amateur enterprise played out a long way from the celebrity that
accrues to those who play our big games.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Koven worked with O'Toole, John Brokars, a rower from
Northeastern, Greg Young of the University of New Hampshire team,
and Rob Hellman from Cornell. Here we had one sport's own version
of Michael Jordan _ Koven _ tilting a daybed down three flights of
narrow stairs.
</P>
<P>
   He is a wonderfully gifted amateur athlete trying to make enough
money to compete in the World Cup tournament in Europe this summer.
He has a couple of corporate sponsors to help pay the tab, but
moves couches for spending money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to fund the trip myself,'' Koven pointed out. ``The
World Cup takes place across seven weeks. That's a lot of money so
I'm always looking for sponsors. It starts next week in Brussels,
moves to the Henley Regatta in England July 4, and the last race is
in Lucerne, Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An athlete of Jamie's stature would get great coverage in
those other countries,'' O'Toole stated. ``Here, we don't even
cover rowing in the newspapers or on TV. It's too bad because Jamie
is a wonderful example of what is possible when you combine skill
with dedication and hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional hockey players disgraced the country and themselves
during the Olympics. Basketball, baseball, and football have thrown
their titles open to the highest bidder and richest owners. And, in
Cambridge yesterday, one of America's best was moving furniture
through a muggy morning in order to earn money to represent the
United States with pride, integrity, and the kind of character
missing among so many whom we foolishly regard as role models
simply because they happen to play a more popular sport.

FORMER CONGRESSMAN BEGINS PROBATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACQUE CROUSE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A Hispanic rights organization is asking President
Clinton to pardon a former U.S. congressman who was booted from
office and later imprisoned on federal racketeering and bribery
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Albert G. Bustamante, D-Texas, concluded his prison
sentence Monday for the 1993 conviction, but must serve two years
of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Obledo, president of the California Coalition of Hispanic
Organizations, has urged the president to pardon the former Texas
lawmaker, according to a letter Bustamante shared Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says Bustamante was found guilty of ``sham'' charges
and asked for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pardon is not what is important to me,'' Bustamante said.
``I and my family have gone through it all. But what I want to get
across, for people to understand, is how they (prosecutors) have
really misused the power Congress gave them, especially with the
racketeering law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been able to convince a lot of people that I did
something wrong, that I'm a crook, and that's what hurts them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, a Democrat who served four terms in Congress, was
defeated in 1992 by Henry Bonilla, a Republican who still
represents the South Texas district.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, 63, was convicted by a federal jury in 1993 on
charges of accepting $340,000 in bribes while in office, including
payments from a food-service company that was seeking to win a
contract with the Air Force. He entered the federal prison in El
Paso on May 22, 1995, and served 35 months of a 42-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to a San Antonio half-way house in February, but was
soon released to home confinement. Bustamante wore an ankle
bracelet for electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, now I begin another chapter of this,'' he said of the
probation. ``I will be able to move around, relax a little, go out
with family and friends. And I want to look at the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante may move about more freely, but cannot travel out of
south central and west Texas without having restrictions lifted and
he must report to a federal probation officer once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante is manager of a commercial shopping center in San
Antonio. He said he also has been asked to work helping open trade
markets for goods from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said about a year ago he would not accept a pardon if
one was offered to him. But throughout his trial and federal prison
term, the former congressman steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.

SHOULD US USE FROZEN ASSESTS TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On April 9, 1995, Alisa Flatow, a Brandeis
University junior studying in Israel, boarded a bus to a beach
resort in the Gaza Strip. She never made it. A terrorist,
reportedly backed by Iran, drove a bomb-laden van into the bus,
killing Flatow and seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Now the legal legacy of Flatow's death _ and similar incidents
of violence against US citizens, including the 1988 bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 _ could significantly affect the financial leverage
the US government can use to retaliate against countries that
sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton must decide soon if the US-based assets of
embargoed nations, nearly $3 billion now frozen by Washington in US
banks, should be used to compensate the victims of terrorist
attacks, including $247 million that a US judge recently said
should be paid to Flatow's family.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Clinton is that it would take only a few big,
successful lawsuits and big damage awards to drain most of the
frozen foreign assets of terrorist states and deprive him of a
major foreign policy tool.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, for example, the government was
able to quickly freeze about $12 billion in Iranian assets, which
was almost all turned over to Iran and an international tribunal as
part of an accord that freed the hostages. Now, US officials are
privately debating whether the effort to improve relations with
Iran would be harmed by paying the Flatows from about $20 million
in Iran's remaining real estate assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to discuss the Flatow case on the
record because Clinton has not made a decision. But with little
notice, Clinton may have set a precedent for paying the Flatow
family when, in November 1996 he ordered $1.2 million in frozen
Cuban assets be paid to the families of four Miami-based pilots
shot down by the Cuban Air Force in February of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, my case is even clearer,'' said Alisa's father,
Stephen Flatow, a New Jersey lawyer who said he hopes to spend much
of the compensation on charitable causes and posting rewards for
capturing terrorists. ``We have demonstrated that international
terrorism from Iran comes from the highest levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatow's request is not frivolous; he has an act of Congress and
an unprecedented court ruling on his side. Last year, Flatow filed
his suit after an antiterrorism act was amended to allow US
citizens to sue and collect damages from a foreign government that
sponsors terrorism. Congress, however, did not say how victims
could collect damages if a country fails to pay. Clinton supported
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March, US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth in
Washington agreed with Flatow that Iran sponsored the terrorist
group responsible for killing Alisa. Her death was caused by a
nickel-sized piece of shrapnel that is believed to have ricocheted
off the bus ceiling into her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``An innocent girl was needlessly killed,'' Lamberth said. The
judge, after hearing testimony from the 20-year-old's friends and
professors at Brandeis, held Iran responsible for $247 million in
damages. Iran, which refused to represent itself before the judge,
has refused to pay the award. That prompted Flatow's lawyer,
Stephen Perles, to seek payment from the Iranian assets frozen by
the US government.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we hope to accomplish with this litigation
is to change the way the United States is able to retaliate against
countries that murder our children through terrorist acts,'' Perles
said. ``In the past, frozen assets have remained just frozen
assets. ``We hope to use this litigation to add the financial sting
and release those assets to victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin agreed after the
ruling in the Flatow case that Iran sponsors Palestinian terrorist
organizations. But Rubin, in a statement that upset Stephen Flatow,
added that the Clinton administration wanted dialogue with Iran and
said that ``our policy doesn't get affected by court judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential decision to freeze foreign assets is one of the
toughest economic sanctions. Privately, administration officials
expressed concern that using the frozen assets to compensate for
terrorist acts could backfire because the money would not be
available to use as leverage against a country.
</P>
<P>
   Once the funds are frozen, they accrue interest and become a
subject of negotiations. For example, the United States froze
Vietnam's US-based assets in the wake of the war and only released
them after relations between the two countries began to be
normalized recently. A tribunal is determining who gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow is not alone in eyeing the US government's trove of
frozen foreign assets.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the families of three of the four ``Brothers to
the Rescue'' pilots who were shot down by the Cuban Air Force went
to court to seek damages against Cuba. With Cuban representatives
refusing to appear in court, a judge awarded the three families
$188 million. This was separate from the $1.2 million that Clinton
provided for the pilots' families in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now a third and much larger case is winding through the courts.
About 160 families of the 270 victims of Pan Am 103 have sued
Libya, which has long been suspected of playing a role in the
destruction of the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cuba and Iran cases, Libya has sent representatives
to US court to deny the charges and has delayed the suit. Libya is
expected to challenge the constitutionality of the law that allows
the suits, potentially having an impact on all three cases.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has been working with 20 families
of Pan Am 103 victims from Massachusetts, said recently that he
supports the use of frozen foreign assets to compensate the
families. The issue could come before Congress if Clinton decides
he cannot take any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these families are awarded compensation by the court,
they should be able to collect,'' Kennedy said. ``In cases where
payment is refused, the United States is well within its right to
use a country's frozen assets to see that the families get the
justice they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $20 million in Iranian assets, mostly in real
estate, the United States has frozen assets of Iraq, Libya, Cuba,
North Korea, the former Yugoslavia, and the Sudan. The funds, which
typically remain in US banks until they are unfrozen, add up to
$2.94 billion, including $1.4 billion from Iraq frozen during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the Flatow family stresses that this isn't about money. ``I
never expected to see a nickel,'' Stephen Flatow said. He said he
does expect to see justice, and now hopes the US government will
unfreeze Iranian assets to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   For Alisa's friends, the effort to win payment from Iranian
assets is part of an effort to keep her memory alive. Lauran
Sloane, Alisa's roommate at Brandeis, read a four-page testimonial
to Alisa at the March trial and is still grappling with loss of
what she called an ``incredible friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how much she loved the state of Israel,'' Sloane said.
``She would not want people deterred from going, which terrorism
definitely does. I hope that it sends a message that the Flatows
want, that it will stop terrorism and violence.''

ARTHUR DOVE MAY HAVE CREATED THE FIRST ABSTRACT PAINTING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``ARTHUR DOVE: A RETROSPECTIVE''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling show organized by Debra Bricker Balken, in
collaboration with William C. Agee and Elizabeth Hutton Turner. At:
Addison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, through
July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ A scholarly debate rages over whether it was
the American Arthur Dove or the Russian Wassily Kandinsky who made
the first abstract painting. Check out the splendid Dove show at
the Addison Gallery and you may decide, who cares? The selection of
over 80 paintings, drawings, pastels, and assemblages is both
ravishing and revolutionary. It demonstrates Dove's greatness _
whether he was ``first'' in a field that is not, after all, a race.
</P>
<P>
   Dove was championed early on by Alfred Stieglitz, the pionering
photographer and dealer who first showed Dove's work at his 291
Gallery in New York in 1910, and then in his subsequent galleries
from 1925 to 1946, the year Dove died. But despite the reputation
he gained as one of America's foremost modernists, and despite the
patronage of collector Duncan Phillips _ which is why the Phillips
Collection in Washington, D.C., is so rich with Doves _ the artist
remained on the edge financially.
</P>
<P>
   His career predated the age of the art star. He lived on a
cramped boat for seven long winters in the '20s, then in derelict
farmhouses in upstate New York, finally in an abandoned post office
on Long Island. His death coincided with the dawn of Abstract
Expressionism. Debra Bricker Balken, the curator who spent five
years organizing the Dove show, says Dove's late paintings directly
influenced Abstract Expressionists including Mark Rothko and
Barnett Newman. But the debt hasn't been acknowledged. The dislike
of the notoriously narrow-minded critic Clement Greenberg for
artists in Stieglitz's circle helped push Dove aside for decades,
until a 1973 retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York. There
hasn't been another major Dove show until the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Dove's geographical isolation meant he didn't engage in the art
socializing that might have boosted his career, Balken contends. In
matters of style, too, he charted his own course instead of signing
onto one of the early 20th century's many ``isms.'' That, too,
helped push him into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   His painting is an idiosyncratic response to nature at its
broadest and most basic, his signature image a sun with concentric
halos, radiating outward. You bask in these paintings. The first
one you encounter at the Addison is the 1935 ``October.'' The
seasons, the weather, the time of day, all play important parts in
Dove's work. ``October'' is a scroll-like horizontal filled with
rounded, rollicking forms leaning against each other as if drunk.
They're abstractions of trees, but they have anthropomorphic
qualities as well: A couple of them have notches you might read as
chattering mouths. Dove has layered one color over another here,
creating luscious effects. This is a painting you might want to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest work in the show, the 1909 ``Still-Life Against
Flowered Wallpaper,'' reflects Dove's absorption of Cezanne and
other French painters during a 15-month sojourn in France. The
change from 1909 to the abstractions of 1910-11 is swift and
definitive. In these small nonrepresentational works he gives birth
to a new style, and while there are affinities and influences, the
style is recognizably his. The palette temporarily dims, as if with
the seriousness of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   In the teens and early 1920s, he worked out the vocabulary of
shapes he'd draw on throughout his career _ zigzags, rays, circles
that close as tight as a fist and then explode into halo after halo
of carefully graded color. He experimented with metallic paints
that make his surfaces sparkle. He painted on sheets of metal, as
in the 1927 ``Something in Brown, Carmine and Blue,'' which looks
like an oil slick. He tried out assemblage, as in the 1925 ``Goin'
Fishin,''' a boxy construction with real strips of bamboo arranged
in the fan formations he also liked to paint.
</P>
<P>
   And he made achingly lovely works, like the 1923 ``After the
Storm, Silver and Green (Vault Sky),'' in which a pale moon, sliced
in half by the top edge of the picture, shoots arcing rays of light
down onto the water. There's a mystic, magnetic communication
between moon and sea here, the waves straining skyward. The work
also offers a prime example of Dove's curved and angled
brushstrokes. It's hard to think of another painter who used the
direction of brushwork to such expressive effect. Here, the strokes
that create the light cascade like fireworks or a weeping willow.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1927, Dove started painting with the radio on. Some works
are titled after what he heard, songs by Gershwin or Irving Berlin,
for instance. In these musical paintings, Dove captured the
Zeitgeist of the jazz age. The 1927 ``George Gershwin _ I'll Build
a Stairway to Paradise'' perfectly conveys that song's ebullient
staccato rhythm through horizontal jabs of black paint that curve
their way upward: This staircase is a spiral. The Gershwin
painting, with its musical repetitions and variations, illustrates
one of Dove's guiding principles: If you like a shape or color,
stick with it, repeat it, play with it.
</P>
<P>
   As a colorist, Dove had few peers among his contemporaries; he
created harmony in hues both tender and robust. In the exquisite
1929 ``Fog Horns,'' a trio of rounded forms in muted violets,
centered with black, aim right at you, the echoing bands suggesting
sound. By skillfully manipulating the overlapping colors, he
achieved translucent, watercolor effects in oil.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a master in manipulating scale. In the 1930 ``Silver
Tanks and Moon,'' a canyon plunges between the two towering forms;
a tiny moon presides over the scene. This painting makes a good
comparison with a Georgia O'Keeffe, the 1928 ``Wave Night,'' in
another room at the Addison. The O'Keeffe, like so many of the
Doves, features dramatic contrasts of scale, careful gradations of
color, halos, and the tiniest speck of a moon.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1930s, Dove's paintings exhibited an almost
worshipful attitude toward the sun and moon, illustrated at the
Addison by a lineup of seven exultant paintings of orbs, all
radiant, expansive, and weightless. They're all big _ his work
ballooned along with his confidence _ except for the 1937 ``Golden
Sun,'' which features a minute yellow circle shooting rays down on
a diagonal, to warm the earth below. This little icon was once
owned by O'Keeffe, who carried it with her, wherever she went,
until her death.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1940, something happened to Dove's painting. It became
flatter, more factual, and abstract. Even in paintings that still
refer to nature, like the blazing 1941 ``Indian Summer,'' there is
a jigsaw puzzle look. Gone is the misty evanescence. Gone, too, is
some of the enchantment that had been called up by an artist
communing so directly with the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The Addison is a fine venue for this show, which opened at the
Phillips Collection, then went to the Whitney Museum, and, after
Andover, travels to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Given
this itinerary of major museums, you wonder why the show didn't go
to the Museum of Fine Arts, which, thanks to the late collector
William H. Lane, has excellent Doves, several on loan to the
Addison now.
</P>
<P>
   The Addison's relatively small size makes it easy to take in the
Dove show and then to cruise through nearby galleries to put Dove
in context. The comparison with O'Keeffe is a natural. The two were
contemporaries, and both were in Stieglitz's circle, although
O'Keeffe, who married Stieglitz, was of course closer. But there
are also more adventurous comparisons to be made. The Addison's
``Toilers of the Sea,'' a brooding little moonlit seascape by the
idiosyncratic, turn-of-the-century artist Albert Pinkham Ryder, is,
like Dove's paintings, simplified, shape-conscious and, above all,
invested with an almost supernatural force. It's spellbinding. The
Doves even bear comparison with the Addison's Winslow Homers,
especially the 1904 ``Kissing the Moon.'' And while it's a stretch,
you can even compare Dove with the Addison's 1974 Brice Marden
painting, ``Third Figure,'' a vertical row of three canvases in
deepening shades of gray-blue. It's the same gray-blue, similarly
graded, that Dove uses. The Addison exhibition does what a great
solo show should: After you see it, you tend to look at everything
else through the prism of that one artist's achievement. In Dove's
case, that's a pleasure. His painting is ecstatic.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FAMILY MAN &QL; 
 &UR; Calvin Trillin (FSG, $20)
</P>
<P>
   Here is the only advice you'll get from Trillin about parenting:
``Try to get one that doesn't spit up. Otherwise, you're on your
own.'' Trillin seemed vaguely uncomfortable writing about his
father, Abe, in a previous book, ``Messages From My Father.'' Here,
he's back on familiar ground with Alice and their two daughters.
Much of this, in fact, is made up of old stories, reminiscences of
when the girls were in diapers (they long since have removed them
and moved on), or later, when he and Alice used vital parts of
their Sunday newspaper to line the guinea pig's cage. There are new
reflections on old columns, on the differences between men and
women, on his well-documented passions for Halloween and a good
meal, and on other preoccupations of a self-described ``fifties guy
at heart.'' The voice is familiar, funny and oddly sweet in this
age of familial dysfunction, and his wife and girls are still good
subjects. ``It does seem unfair,'' he admitted to Alice, ``but we
all have to construct our little stories with the tools available
to us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MUHAMMAD ALI READER &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Gerald Early (Ecco, $26)
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes were wise and canny, like Ray Robinson's,'' Murray
Kempton wrote as he watched Cassius Clay after his astonishing
victory over Sonny Liston in 1964. Clay looked at the journalists
who had laughed at him before the fight and said, ``I told you. I
just played with him. I whipped him so bad and wasn't that good.
And look at me: I'm still pretty.'' Was that what drew so many
writers to him? The brash, poetry-spouting man who would drive up
to a schoolyard at recess and shout, ``Come here, all you beautiful
Black children!'' (The difference between him and the Pied Piper,
Clay explained to Gordon Parks, was that the piper didn't have a
Cadillac.) Here is a splendid collection of writings about Muhammad
Ali by the likes of Irwin Shaw, Jimmy Cannon, Norman Mailer, Pete
Hamill, Roger Kahn, Garry Wills, Hunter Thompson, Joyce Carol Oates
and Gay Talese. There's also an excerpt from Ali's 1975 interview
with ``Playboy,'' in which he talks about how he would like to be
remembered _ as a man who never looked down on those who looked up
to him, as a man who wouldn't hurt his people's dignity by doing
anything that would embarrass them, as a great boxer who became a
preacher and a champion of his people. And then, he added, ``I
wouldn't even mind if folks forgot how pretty I was.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; RANTING AGAIN &QL; 
 &UR; Dennis Miller (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   We went through this in search of something to laugh at, and
came up dry. It's an awful book. Here's Miller on abortion: ``This
is (begin itals) the (end itals) big debate. And I'm talking bigger
than who was the better Darrin on ``Bewitched.'' On motherhood: ``A
63-year-old woman has had a baby last year. You know what the first
clue was she was pregnant? She missed her Jurassic Period.'' On
smoking: ``If you're saying you didn't know cigarettes were bad for
you, you're lying through that hole in your trachea.'' Are you
smiling yet? This material came from Miller's HBO show ``Dennis
Miller Live.'' It should have stayed there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TITAN &QL; 
 &UR; Ron Chernow (Random House, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Chernow won the National Book Award for ``The House of Morgan,''
and his new book, an epic biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.,
already is being hailed as one of the best of the year. Son of a
con man who deserted his wife and five children, Rockefeller was
raised by his mother as a strict Baptist. Her prudent nature (and
philanthropy, despite her difficult circumstances) and his father's
daring combined to make Rockefeller the man he became _ one,
Chernow writes, who ``flouted government and rode roughshod over
competitors'' and incarnated the capitalist revolution that
followed the Civil War and transformed American life. What sets
this biography apart from others is Chernow's use of a 1,700-page
transcript of interviews conducted with Rockefeller from 1917 to
1920 by a newspaperman who intended to write an authorized
biography. That book never materialized. In the transcript, Chernow
found Rockefeller to be ``analytic, articulate, even fiery; he was
also quite funny, with a dry Midwestern wit.'' The result is a
splendid portrait of both a superb businessman and a complex human
being. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BOOK OF POLITICAL LISTS &QL; 
 &UR; (Villard, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   You will be shocked to know that only nine of our nation's
presidents had facial hair and that only one of them was a
Democrat. That five presidents were fat (William Howard Taft had a
body-mass index of 42.3, with 30 as the threshold of obesity), and
13 were/are (Bill Clinton is one) overweight. That George
Washington, Herbert Hoover, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant and
John Quincy Adams had asteroids named after them. That John F.
Kennedy is on a list of ``Presidents Who Had Mistresses'' even
though John F. Kennedy Jr. is editor of ``George'' magazine, which
put these lists together. We thought they wrote books like this
only about baseball. We were wrong. Here is a collection of what
can only be called the minutiae of politics, intensely trivial
facts that only a junkie could love. Our favorite list offers H.L.
Mencken's thoughts on democracy, which he called ``the theory that
two thieves will steal less than one.'' &QL;

YOUNGSTER FROM D.C. GHETTO FINDS SUCCESS AGAINST ALL ODDS

   A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN &QC; 
An American Odysey from the Inner City to the Ivy League &QC; 
By Ron Suskind &QC; 
Broadway, 372 pp., $25 &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of 52 promising minority teenagers chosen for a science and
engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
the summer of 1994, 51 had the advantage of coming from solid
backgrounds and schools. The exception was Cedric Jennings, a drug
dealer's son determined to study his way out of a Washington, D.C.,
ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling to keep up with his classmates that summer,
Jennings was told he was not ``MIT material.'' But the next year,
he became the first student in a decade from his gang-ravaged high
school to be admitted to the Ivy League: Brown University. There,
he is holding his own, academically and socially, with upper-class
whites bred for elite educations.
</P>
<P>
   In a country stratified more than ever by race and class,
Jennings is an increasingly rare exemplar of upward mobility. His
achievement demonstrates the continuing vitality of _ and the
enormous barriers to _ the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Suskind, better known in these parts for a controversial
Wall Street Journal piece suggesting that cocaine use caused the
death of Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis, first told Jennings's
story in a Pulitzer Prize-winning Journal series. Now, he brings it
up to date in ``A Hope in the Unseen,'' an absorbing, painstakingly
reported book that illuminates the lives and emotions of Jennings
and his parents and friends. One of the best of a recent spate of
accounts about black America by white journalists, it should be
required reading in college education and sociology courses.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, Suskind avoids pontificating about Jennings's
experience; there's no need. Every detail proclaims the odds
against his protagonist. Violence and naysayers _ Jennings calls
them ``dreambusters'' _ are so pervasive at his high school that he
doesn't show up at an assembly to accept an award for fear that
resentful peers will insult or beat him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Less than 10 percent of his peers in the senior class at
Ballou High School were accepted by any college; fewer can afford
to go. &UR;  &LR; One classmate, as talented as Jennings, witnesses a murder.
Afraid of retaliation, he seeks popularity by becoming the class
clown. His grades slip, and he ends up working in a mailroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings's father has two college degrees, but wastes his
intelligence and charm shuttling between prison and barbershops,
where he sells haircuts and heroin. And the Rolls-Royce-driving
minister at the Pentecostal church where Jennings and his
strong-willed mother turn for consolation and support inveighs
against the temptation of godless academe.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Jennings competes against students from beyond the
ghetto _ on the SATS, at MIT, and Brown _ he's hindered by a lack
of information they take for granted. He's listened to every
hip-hop CD, but he's never heard of Freud or Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relying on dialogue, Suskind unfolds the story
through the characters' minds. This technique, which he calls
``internal voice,'' speeds up the narrative, but at times begs
credulity. How does Suskind know, for example, what a friend of
Jennings was thinking just before she dozed off in church?
</P>
<P>
   The second half of the book, covering Jennings's freshman year
at Brown, does lag occasionally. Jennings took most of his courses
pass-fail, removing much of the suspense over his academic
performance. And he's not the only neatnik ever to be afflicted
with a messy roommate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Suskind's chronicle suffers from one unavoidable
problem: his own contribution to Jennings's rise. The Journal
series earned Jennings audiences with Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas and a Boston benefactor began sending him $200 a
week, which may have distorted his value as a case study.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Suskind who got Jennings into MIT or Brown. It was
Jennings's own perseverance, and his resistance to the temptations
of drugs and defeatism, that qualified him for affirmative action
``enrichment'' programs that too often benefit those already
relatively enriched.
</P>
<P>
   As one MIT administrator ruminates, ``It would take two years of
tutoring, not six weeks, to bring some of the inner cities'
brightest up to the level where they might be accepted to MIT.
Their similarity to the polished suburb-bred minority kids goes
little more than skin deep.''

PRIEST INVOLVED IN WRESTLING MATCH WITH BOY RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Catholic priest who admitted having a
nighttime wrestling match with a teen-age boy who worked in the
rectory announced in the church bulletin that he was resigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Aylward, pastor of St. Catherine of Siena
Catholic Church in Burlingame, attributed the resignation to
``personal and administrative pressures'' and to two successful
battles with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I ought now to turn over the reins of running the
parish to someone with both a greater heart for administration and
a greater talent for bringing together the disparate elements of
the parish,'' Aylward, 60, said in the resignation announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo district attorney's office investigated the
incident but concluded there was not enough evidence to file
charges. The archdiocese conducted an investigation and said the
pastor's behavior was inappropriate but not sexual.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward publicly apologized for his ``foolishness and
imprudence'' and said he had begun therapy with ``a mental health
professional'' for ``the benefit of his evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Conley, who also worked at the church, reported
the wrestling incident to church and civil authorities, and was
later put on administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   Conley said he was being unfairly punished for his revelations.
The archdiocese, however, said Conley was disciplined for previous
transgressions and for insubordinate and disrespectful behavior
toward his bishop during the process of reporting the wrestling
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Conley remains on administrative leave without assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward, who was ordained in 1964 and holds a doctorate in
music, was appointed to St. Catherine's in 1996. During his tenure,
he won the admiration and respect of many parishioners, but also
caused dissension among others who disagreed with his pastoral
style.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward was unavailable for comment, his lawyer said.

 &HT;     SURPRISE GUN BATTLE A REMINDER GUERRILLA GROUPS FIND FERTILE
GROUND AMONG MEXICO'S INDIANS
 &HT;     NOTE: El Charco is about 105 miles south of Acapulco.
 &HT;     By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CHARCO, Mexico _ After most of the soldiers had retreated and
the blood was almost dry, a small group of Mexican villagers crept
back into this remote mountain village at dusk Monday to observe
the remains of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying machetes, the men whispered in their native Indian
language and stared at the pock marks of hundreds of bullets
Mexican Army troops had pumped into their schoolhouse Sunday during
a predawn attack. A gruesome silhouette of blood reveals a rebel
fighter's final moments _ shot dead, perhaps at close range, head
and back pressed against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who died in here were all peasants,'' said
Francisco Ticurcio, a resident of El Charco, a Mixteco
(Meesh-TE-ko) Indian village buried at the end of a long, torturous
mountain road 105 miles south of Acapulco, southern Guerrero
state's famous tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Army attack, which killed 11, wounded five and led to
the arrest of 21 suspected rebel affiliates, was a startling
reminder that leftist guerrilla movements _ other than the
Zapatistas in southern Chiapas state _ are still active among
Mexico's impoverished peasant Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly nervous, Ticurcio said in broken Spanish that he doesn't
know who the 11 people were who died in the surprise shootout, the
worst such clash between the military and leftist rebels in Mexico
in two years. But he said masked rebels armed with guns and wearing
uniforms had been visiting this village of sugar cane fields and
thatched-roof huts almost once a month since last August.
</P>
<P>
   He said crowds of up to 70 people gathered to hear the rebels,
who usually numbered 15 _ four who spoke Spanish as their primary
language, including a woman, and 11 who were Mixteco Indians from
other isolated villages near El Charco in the Southern Sierra Madre
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Those who died were identified as members of the Popular
Revolutionary Army, known as the EPR, a mysterious armed Marxist
group that had been largely silent for the past year. The EPR
announced its formation in June 1996, a year after Guerrero state
police stopped and shot dead 17 peasant activists who were
traveling on a road to attend a protest meeting near Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In August of that year, the EPR staged its battle debut with
bloody raids in seven states in which 18 people died. In early
1997, ambushes and clashes with the Army killed several soldiers
and at least two rebels. People in a village 60 miles north of
Acapulco were too afraid to claim the rebels' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rebels discovered in El Charco may have been
affiliated with yet another group, the Popular Indigenous
Revolutionary Army, unknown to authorities until now, according to
Guerrero's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Servando Alanis Santos, said this week
that the state is investigating ``possible links'' to guerrilla
activity in El Charco with elected authorities in Ayutla, the
municipality where El Charco is.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Ayutla township is a member of Mexico's
center-left opposition party, the Democratic Revolution Party _ or
PRD _ which has long complained in Guerrero that its members have
been persecuted and killed by sympathizers of Mexico's dominant
political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1990, PRD sympathizers were killed by state
police after they had occupied a city hall in the Guerrero town of
Cruz Grande to protest electoral fraud. Since 1996, some PRD
members have been accused of being sympathizers of the EPR.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's remarks about El Charco may signify a new
hostile attitude against the PRD here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon Ayutla president Odilon Romero and a group
of supporters piled in a pickup truck and drove an hour into the
mountains to visit El Charco.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by foreign journalists, he called the attack ``a
lamentable event,'' and said he had long been aware of the
desperate poverty the Indians of El Charco and other villages
suffer in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Charco is a town that has always demanded services, like
potable water, electricity, jobs,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew nothing personally of EPR activity in El Charco
or other Indian villages, only information from news reports
indicating that as far back as 1996 rebels had visited some towns
in Guerrero to invite villagers to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said using weapons to make change doesn't do any
of us any good,'' Romero added. ``I've proposed peace, not
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   El Charco, which means ``the puddle'' in Spanish, is a typical
poor Indian village of about 300. Residents are openly disgruntled
and complain about their poverty, but on Monday appeared reluctant
to talk about their feelings towards the rebels who had been
attempting to recruit among them.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers grow corn and sugar cane, and travel into Ayutla
on Sundays to sell avocados, bananas and other fruit they harvest
to earn cash.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, residents said, they awoke to a barrage of
gunfire and realized their schoolhouse _ a simple pastel-colored
cement building _ was under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it was on a routine patrol to search for marijuana
and poppy fields that are grown in the mountains here when soldiers
came upon the rebels. Villagers said the Army approached on foot
and appeared to have surrounded the school in a stealthy move.
</P>
<P>
   When bullets started flying, the villagers said, they fled into
the tropical hills around El Charco. Only late Monday afternoon did
they return to inspect the school, where pools of blood outlining
bodies stained the building's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Out on a basketball court, long trails of blood showed where
bodies were dragged out. Shattered glass covered the school's floor
and an outside walkway, evidence that bullets entered the school
and rebels had broken windows to fire back. Two Indian women in
long skirts and braids walked gingerly _ barefoot _ over the glass
and among third grade Spanish and mathematics workbooks scattered
about.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it had taken a woman from Mexico City who was a
teacher into custody after the shootout. Villagers said El Charco
didn't have a female teacher, but that a woman was among the
Spanish-speaking rebels who met with them from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was a friend of the peasants,'' Ticurcio, the
Indian villager, said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they had returned to inspect the damage,
guard their possessions and obtain food to eat. An Army patrol
stood by on a nearby bluff overlooking El Charco, maintaining
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Ticurcio and the others said they wanted the Army to retreat
completely from the area around the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid of them,'' said Jose Jimenez, his ragged white
clothes smudged from a night sleeping in the woods. ``Of course we
are afraid of them.''

 (Undated): ... bad luck
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But you can't look at it from a Western point of view,'' Gould
says. ``This is John's life we're talking about _ the only life
he's ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   Before passing judgment on the Maasai, Tome warns, consider
those things they simply do not have: child abuse, homelessness,
murder, stress-related disease, heart disease, depression,
materialism, loneliness, and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life is very simple,'' he says. ``It's a beautiful way to
live, really.''
</P>
<P>
   At his lectures, Tome presents a slide show, with images of the
huts, cows, people, and stunning mountains and grasslands of his
home, the land called Maasai Mara, traversing Kenya and Tanzania.
That he loves the Maasai Mara is obvious: His eyes get sad, and he
speaks reverently of the natural beauty of the land he lives on.
The Maasai word for God, he says, is ``Inkai,'' the Maa word for
``blue sky.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains that the Maasai originated in Israel and moved on,
following their herds, to Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan, and eventually
Tanzania and Kenya, where they remain. He knows this because of the
Maasai's meticulously held oral history, told and retold in his
village. Watusi and the Nubian cultures began as Maasai, and have
related languages and beliefs, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his travels, Tome says, the only place he thinks even
remotely matches the natural splendor of Maasai land has been Utah,
the place he has liked the best. The place Tome has liked the
least, he says, is New York City, where everyone is mean and
rushing for no discernible reason, and where nature has been
entirely corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Food has been a difficult issue for Tome, who during a recent
lunch interview ordered a roast beef sandwich _ eating only the
meat _ and whole milk, which he said ``tastes like water'' compared
to what they drink at home. He does not eat vegetables, all of
which he calls ``grass,'' or cow food. He did, however, enjoy a
piece of pound cake, and conceded that he could see how Western
culture would ``easily spoil many Maasai who might not be grounded
in their own culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Tome says that the Americans he most identifies with are Native
Americans, who have ``an incredibly similar history of having their
land stolen from them, of having been stuck on reservations.'' He
has also taken a liking to chubby blond women, according to Gould,
who says with a disapproving sigh that ``he has one in New York,
one in England, and one in Denmark.'' (Gould thinks of herself as a
mother figure.) Tome, when prodded, admits to liking ``upper-weight
women'' and to having fallen in love with a wealthy English hotel
owner, even to the point of asking his father if he would mind if
they married, but will not go into more detail than that.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Americans Tome finds he has the least in common
with are African Americans. ``They seem to expect so much from
me,'' he says. ``It's like they want me to represent them somehow.
One even got mad at me the other day because I wasn't going around
teaching African-American history. That's crazy. I try to tell them
that I am from East Africa, and the slaves were taken from West
Africa, a world away from us. Americans in general don't understand
how big and diverse Africa is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tome is the oldest of 21 children born to one man and his three
wives. Tome's father taught him to tend cattle when he was a boy,
which he did every day. ``We don't play the way American children
do. We just start working. A Maasai 10 years old can handle so much
more responsibility than an American at 10 years old. The American
will have trouble just cleaning his room, but the Maasai can herd
400 cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young boy _ he estimates that he was about 10 _ he killed
his first lion, by mistake, when he threw a spear at one that was
eating one of his cows. As an adolescent, he, with all the other
young men his age, went through the ritual to become a warrior and
killed another lion.
</P>
<P>
   There are rituals for women and girls, but Tome does not give
details, saying they are ``secret and we don't want them printed in
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Tome is still a warrior and will remain one until he is made an
elder. Warriors cannot marry, in case they die in battle. Tome says
many parents in his village are already courting him for their
daughters, because of his celebrity, which makes life hard for him.
``All these girls' parents want me to marry their daughters (when
he becomes an elder). I don't like to hurt people's feelings, so I
can't reject anyone. That's why I haven't married yet, because I
can't say no to any woman.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his presentation, Tome is bombarded with
questions. Some of them are good. Some are, shall we say, taken
from Hollywood stereotypes. But he is used to it. And he is
patient, just like his father, Retiti, who is his best friend and
mentor, and is known in the village for always thinking before
speaking, and for never raising his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Maasai never shout,'' Tome says. ``Especially not to
children. Why do you do that here? It tortures them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't the women get jealous if the husband has lots of
wives?'' someone asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really,'' Tome says. ``Sometimes, you know, there are
some jealous people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you run out of women if every man marries more than
one?'' asks another.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Maasai men die in battles. And there are always more women
born. Of the 21 children in my family, only eight are boys. When
the baby comes, everyone waits and hopes it's a boy. When a girl
comes, everyone just says `Oh well' and goes on with their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tome wants to go home. But more than that, he wants his home to
be around in 50 years. So he continues. Next stop, Disney World,
then back to Maine, then off to Arizona, back to Maine, to Utah, to
Maine, then off to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel about the Western world?'' someone asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect all cultures,'' Tome answers, carefully. ``All of us
are human beings. But there are many things I don't understand. The
rushing. The cars. You may think cars make your life easier, but
what are you going to do when you run out of clean air? And
television. Wonderful technology, but why don't you all just talk
to each other? And the way you treat the elderly and children here.
And materialism, and this obsession you have with physical
appearance. I miss home, where what matters most is how you treat
other people, how thoughtful you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you worry that by setting up this school, Maasai
children will abandon traditional life for the luxuries of the
Western world?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to be seduced by the comforts of Western life,''
Tome says. ``But I think most Maasai would prefer to live in the
Maasai way. I would never think to leave home to adopt the Western
way of life. You wake up here, and see no clean environment. All I
want is for us to be respected enough to be able to live the way we
want.''

YOUNG MAASAI WARRIOR MOVES TO MAINE, DISCUSSES HIS CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 2 takes with art (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Nemaru Ole Tome, a young warrior from the Maasai lands of
eastern Africa, stands at the head of a long conference table in
Cambridge, talking to a group of professional Americans about the
first time he saw an automatic door. (He'd thought the folks
telling him to walk through a glass wall were sadists.) He recalls
the first time he saw a television; he'd asked how they got the cow
small enough to put in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Tome's long hair is dyed deep red with ocher, plaited into
thousands of delicate braids. His left earlobe is elongated. When
he grins at his own mishaps, you notice that his four bottom front
teeth are missing. He wears red overlapping togas, more than a
dozen beaded necklaces, elaborate beaded headgear, and beaded
bracelets. He carries a large spear and shield, a foot-long knife
holstered at his waist, a carved walking stick, and a fly whisk
made of wildebeest tail _ that is to say, everyday Maasai men's
clothing. His audience wears the mall-purchased uniforms of the
working young: neutral trousers with white shirts and ties, pants
with pumps, suits with scarves.
</P>
<P>
   With the insight, timing, and cadence of a stand-up comedian,
Tome tells exactly how he came to live in York, Maine, about 7,500
miles from home and centuries removed from the Maasai world of his
upbringing _ a world of no electricity, written language, running
water, structured time, calendar, or medical care.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Tome says, he saw his village ``exploited and
treated like wildlife'' by a government that used it as a tourist
attraction; he saw his ancestral land taken without permission. As
a very young man, he took a job at a tourist hotel near his village
so that he could teach himself English and Swahili by listening to
tourists. He asked questions about the Western world and told the
Westerners what he could about his.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he came to New England, setting up
headquarters in the York, Maine, home of Nancy Gould, a nurse he
met when she traveled to Kenya, and opening P.O. Box 402 and an
e-mail address, swara44(AT)aol.com. From here, Tome has manifested
his mission: to educate the Western world about the Maasai by
giving lectures, and to raise money. The funds would be used to
build the first school in his village, which, according to him,
would be the first school in Kenya to teach Maa, the Maasai
language, and Maasai history. He has already raised $100,000
speaking in places as disparate as a Hopi Indian reservation and
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, he is brutalized by homesickness. He hates airplanes
and can't stomach most of the salty, processed foods our world
offers. His clothes draw stares and pointing everywhere he goes. He
has taken to wearing Western clothes occasionally, to blend in, but
he prefers his Maasai wardrobe. He is one of the most popular and
well-loved people in his village, but here, Tome is the consummate
outsider, looking in.
</P>
<P>
   But the journey continues, and will until he has raised half a
million dollars. Not, he says, so that the Maasai can one day
conform to the Western world _ rather so that the Maasai, once
known as Africa's fiercest warriors, can learn to defend themselves
against a new enemy: the encroaching decay wrought by television,
Twinkies, and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long, long time to get here,'' Tome begins his
talk. ``We Maasai walk everywhere. That's why we are so long and
skinny and have no heart disease. We walk all day long. It's normal
for us to walk about 40 miles a day. It took me many months to walk
here. I had to swim the ocean, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tome pauses, half closes his eyes, and surveys the suits for
response. Everyone stares, dumbfounded, impressed, dubious, or just
plain uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Tome says finally, enjoying their gullibility.
``Of course I took a plane. What do you think I am, crazy?''
Laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Tome goes on to explain that he finds airplanes quite boring,
except for going through the metal detector, which bleeps
convulsively, thanks to his enormous knife: ``They usually make me
give it to the pilot before we take off.'' He winks.
</P>
<P>
   Tome's travels are funded by the companies, universities, and
schools where he speaks (lectures run between $300 and $400, plus
expenses) and by friends such as Gould, who says her love for
Maasai culture explains why she has invested thousands of dollars
and endless hours helping Tome book his lectures. ``John doesn't
skim money off the top,'' Gould says in an interview in Maine.
``He's legit. He's not materialistic, so he saves every penny for
the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, like many other Westerners who have visited Maasai land,
readily concedes that life in a Maasai village probably isn't for
everyone. Housing is a small hut made by hand from cow dung and
wood and shared _ with newborn livestock. The Maasai believe God
intended all cows to belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   Maasai mothers pry their children's lower front teeth from their
mouths with knives. Though anthropologists have theorized that this
is done for beauty, Tome explains that it began as a defense
against tetanus, which causes lockjaw.
</P>
<P>
   In a Maasai village, there is no running water or electricity.
Diet consists exclusively of blood (from live cows), milk, meat,
and, occasionally, cornmeal. Males must improve their manhood by
killing a lion with no more than spears or knives. Females can
expect to have their genitals mutilated without anesthesia, to lead
a life of carrying heavy bundles of firewood, and to be one of
several wives of a (usually) much older man, chosen by their
parents. Maasai people never know their age because the Maasai have
no set time and no calendar, in part because counting, like
pointing and posing for photos, is bad luck.

COMPANIES HAVE TO OFFER GOOD BENEFITS TO KEEP EMPLOYEES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the US unemployment rate hovering at 4.3 percent, the
lowest level in 28 years, companies are doing all they can to
retain good employees.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the findings of a study of 378 US companies. Sponsored
by Manchester Partners International, a Boston consulting firm,
researchers reported that 67 percent of companies surveyed say
higher compensation and benefits are the best ways to hold on to
valuable managerial staff in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two percent cited stock options, 27 percent offer profit
sharing, and 26 percent pointed to retention bonuses as effective
incentives. Others said they encourage casual dress, support
flexible hours and schedules, and offer tuition reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies reported an average annual turnover rate of 15
percent. One-third of the firms said it costs an average of $10,000
to replace a single employee.
</P>
<P>
   Call them surf abusers. That's what some employers are calling
employees who spend work hours playing computer games and surfing
pornographic sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Elron Software Inc. of Cambridge, said it polled
100 companies that rely on Internet monitoring software to track
employee usage. Of the firms surveyed, 62 percent said they have
reprimanded an employee for surfing Web sites that are off limits
during work hours.
</P>
<P>
   How do you find the right employees in a tight labor market? You
train them yourself. The New England College of Finance, formerly
The New England Banking Institute, will join with banks, financial
services firms, high-tech companies, and universities to help
create a continual source of skilled labor for financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 250 banks are involved in the institute's new
educational agenda. So are International Business Machines Corp.,
Boston University, and the University of Wisconsin. The college
said it will collaborate with community organizations in Greater
Boston to develop a Financial Services Academy to train low-income
workers for entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth M. Batson developed a foundation that awards education
grants to needy African-American students. Maura S. Doyle is the
first woman to become clerk of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial
Court. Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a business professor at Harvard
University, helps companies manage change, and Jacqueline Weis
Liebergott is the first female president of Emerson College.
</P>
<P>
   These four women are among a dozen who will be honored Thursday
at the 4th Annual Academy of Women Achievers Awards luncheon at the
Sheraton Boston Hotel and Towers. Sponsored by the YWCA, the
luncheon is designed to encourage the advancement of women and
honor those who have broken through barriers to accomplish their
goals.

HOLBROOKE: ``WORLD LOOKS TO WASHINGTON FOR MORE THAN RHETORIC''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what does Kosovo represent?
</P>
<P>
   Not one to hestitate, Richard Holbrooke said: ``It's another
Bosnia. It emanates from the same roots. It presents many of the
same dangers, particularly an unraveling of all of southern
Europe's boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's reference was not simply to the proximity of the
former Yugoslav province. The architect of the Dayton agreement was
also speaking of Bosnia as a metaphor for post-Cold War crisis,
evil, aggression, and threats to core European and American values
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be other Bosnias in our lives, areas where early
outside involvement can be decisive and American leadership will be
required,'' he writes in ``To End a War,'' his first-rate,
absorbing account of the sickeningly slow and then inspiring US
response to the war in which he was a central player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's richest nation, one that presumes to great moral
authority, cannot simply make worthy appeals to conscience and call
on others to carry the burden. The world will look to Washington
for more than rhetoric the next time we face a challenge to
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As it will this week in Kosovo, where Holbrooke will once again
be a player. With the same evil _ mass murder as an instrument of
aggressive, suppressive policy flowing directly from Slobodan
Milosevic's Belgrade _ the moment for NATO's intervention with US
leadership appears at hand.
</P>
<P>
   What Holbrooke describes as ``classic preventive diplomacy'' has
yet to stop the Bosnia-like slaughter to force the majority, ethnic
Albanians, from their homes in the south. The dangers of escalation
and a spread across the Albanian border mount daily.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush and then President Clinton drew a hard line
against any violent suppression of autonomy for Kosovo's Albanian
population. It may have been easier, but both presidents were also
in the right when they did so.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Holbrooke notes the seminal nature of Kosovo's role
in the Balkan history, culture, and recent horror. It is the
revered site of the battle 600 years ago where the Turks defeated
the proud Serbs and the spiritual capital of Serbia, even though 90
percent of its population is Albanian today. It is also the place
where Milosevic went in 1989 to ignite the modern period of
turmoil, war, and genocide. As Holbrooke also notes, this is where
a crowd that may have numbered a million people were inflamed as
Milosevic put a match to the dry wood of Serbian resentments.
</P>
<P>
   If, until his death in 1980, Josip Broz Tito used one-party,
independent (of Moscow) rule to govern six republics and five
nations that spoke four languages, practiced three religions, and
used two alphabets, Milosevic attempted the substitution of extreme
Serbian nationalism as master of this mess.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the carnage and wreckage of his unique
combination of demagoguery and megalomania are obvious. But
Milosevic still sits in Belgrade, in some ways with more insidious
consequences for his region than those flowing from Saddam
Hussein's continued presence in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The core of ``To End a War'' is Holbrooke's riveting account of
the 14 days at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio where the
Dayton agreement was negotiated. As someone with a fully developed
sense of history, the diplomatic trade, politics, writing, himself,
and the other players, he tells a great yarn. But the enormous
value and timeliness of the volume is its wrapping paper of history
and analysis leading into and out of the drama-stuffed conference.
</P>
<P>
   As both the cause of the carnage and the key negotiating partner
at Dayton, there is an inevitable, mixed nature to Holbrooke's
portrayal of the Serbian leader. His Monte Cristo cigars,
vulgarity, calculated volatility, and realism are present
throughout, offered to the reader with grudging fascination if not
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   At no time, however, does Holbrooke mince so much as a word in
describing what Milosevic did to cause and direct war and atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one cannot but wonder whether Holbrooke and the Clinton
administration will be able to shift to direct hostility toward the
man who was central to their success at Dayton in late '95. Bosnia
could be resolved in the context of Milosevic's continued rule;
it's not clear if Kosovo can or even should be.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other Bosnias'' of which Holbrooke writes comprise all the
hot, post-Cold War cases globally _ from the Persian Gulf and
Somalia to Northern Ireland, South Africa, Rwanda, and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely avoiding the pretense of grand doctrine, he nonetheless
makes clear his preference for a responsibly activist mixture in
foreign policy of the strategic realism of Nixon, Ford, and Bush
with the more idealistic missions of Carter and Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   This way is already being wisely paved by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. And if Al Gore should get through the political
minefield in the year 2000, you are studying the words of her
deserving successor.

SHOULD US USE FROZEN ASSESTS TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF TERRORISM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On April 9, 1995, Alisa Flatow, a Brandeis
University junior studying in Israel, boarded a bus to a beach
resort in the Gaza Strip. She never made it. A terrorist,
reportedly backed by Iran, drove a bomb-laden van into the bus,
killing Flatow and seven others.
</P>
<P>
   Now the legal legacy of Flatow's death _ and similar incidents
of violence against US citizens, including the 1988 bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 _ could significantly affect the financial leverage
the US government can use to retaliate against countries that
sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton must decide soon if the US-based assets of
embargoed nations, nearly $3 billion now frozen by Washington in US
banks, should be used to compensate the victims of terrorist
attacks, including $247 million that a US judge recently said
should be paid to Flatow's family.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Clinton is that it would take only a few big,
successful lawsuits and big damage awards to drain most of the
frozen foreign assets of terrorist states and deprive him of a
major foreign policy tool.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, for example, the government was
able to quickly freeze about $12 billion in Iranian assets, which
was almost all turned over to Iran and an international tribunal as
part of an accord that freed the hostages. Now, US officials are
privately debating whether the effort to improve relations with
Iran would be harmed by paying the Flatows from about $20 million
in Iran's remaining real estate assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to discuss the Flatow case on the
record because Clinton has not made a decision. But with little
notice, Clinton may have set a precedent for paying the Flatow
family when, in November 1996 he ordered $1.2 million in frozen
Cuban assets be paid to the families of four Miami-based pilots
shot down by the Cuban Air Force in February of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, my case is even clearer,'' said Alisa's father,
Stephen Flatow, a New Jersey lawyer who said he hopes to spend much
of the compensation on charitable causes and posting rewards for
capturing terrorists. ``We have demonstrated that international
terrorism from Iran comes from the highest levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatow's request is not frivolous; he has an act of Congress and
an unprecedented court ruling on his side. Last year, Flatow filed
his suit after an antiterrorism act was amended to allow US
citizens to sue and collect damages from a foreign government that
sponsors terrorism. Congress, however, did not say how victims
could collect damages if a country fails to pay. Clinton supported
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March, US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth in
Washington agreed with Flatow that Iran sponsored the terrorist
group responsible for killing Alisa. Her death was caused by a
nickel-sized piece of shrapnel that is believed to have ricocheted
off the bus ceiling into her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``An innocent girl was needlessly killed,'' Lamberth said. The
judge, after hearing testimony from the 20-year-old's friends and
professors at Brandeis, held Iran responsible for $247 million in
damages. Iran, which refused to represent itself before the judge,
has refused to pay the award. That prompted Flatow's lawyer,
Stephen Perles, to seek payment from the Iranian assets frozen by
the US government.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we hope to accomplish with this litigation
is to change the way the United States is able to retaliate against
countries that murder our children through terrorist acts,'' Perles
said. ``In the past, frozen assets have remained just frozen
assets. ``We hope to use this litigation to add the financial sting
and release those assets to victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin agreed after the
ruling in the Flatow case that Iran sponsors Palestinian terrorist
organizations. But Rubin, in a statement that upset Stephen Flatow,
added that the Clinton administration wanted dialogue with Iran and
said that ``our policy doesn't get affected by court judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential decision to freeze foreign assets is one of the
toughest economic sanctions. Privately, administration officials
expressed concern that using the frozen assets to compensate for
terrorist acts could backfire because the money would not be
available to use as leverage against a country.
</P>
<P>
   Once the funds are frozen, they accrue interest and become a
subject of negotiations. For example, the United States froze
Vietnam's US-based assets in the wake of the war and only released
them after relations between the two countries began to be
normalized recently. A tribunal is determining who gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow is not alone in eyeing the US government's trove of
frozen foreign assets.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the families of three of the four ``Brothers to
the Rescue'' pilots who were shot down by the Cuban Air Force went
to court to seek damages against Cuba. With Cuban representatives
refusing to appear in court, a judge awarded the three families
$188 million. This was separate from the $1.2 million that Clinton
provided for the pilots' families in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now a third and much larger case is winding through the courts.
About 160 families of the 270 victims of Pan Am 103 have sued
Libya, which has long been suspected of playing a role in the
destruction of the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cuba and Iran cases, Libya has sent representatives
to US court to deny the charges and has delayed the suit. Libya is
expected to challenge the constitutionality of the law that allows
the suits, potentially having an impact on all three cases.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has been working with 20 families
of Pan Am 103 victims from Massachusetts, said recently that he
supports the use of frozen foreign assets to compensate the
families. The issue could come before Congress if Clinton decides
he cannot take any action.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these families are awarded compensation by the court,
they should be able to collect,'' Kennedy said. ``In cases where
payment is refused, the United States is well within its right to
use a country's frozen assets to see that the families get the
justice they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $20 million in Iranian assets, mostly in real
estate, the United States has frozen assets of Iraq, Libya, Cuba,
North Korea, the former Yugoslavia, and the Sudan. The funds, which
typically remain in US banks until they are unfrozen, add up to
$2.94 billion, including $1.4 billion from Iraq frozen during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the Flatow family stresses that this isn't about money. ``I
never expected to see a nickel,'' Stephen Flatow said. He said he
does expect to see justice, and now hopes the US government will
unfreeze Iranian assets to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   For Alisa's friends, the effort to win payment from Iranian
assets is part of an effort to keep her memory alive. Lauran
Sloane, Alisa's roommate at Brandeis, read a four-page testimonial
to Alisa at the March trial and is still grappling with loss of
what she called an ``incredible friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how much she loved the state of Israel,'' Sloane said.
``She would not want people deterred from going, which terrorism
definitely does. I hope that it sends a message that the Flatows
want, that it will stop terrorism and violence.''

   VIDALIA-ONIONS (Glennville, Ga.) _ In springtime, you know
you're in Vidalia country without reading the signs. As soon as you
leave the piny woods of Fort Stewart, the vast Army base, you come
upon an amazing sight: row after row of burlap bags stretching
across the sandy fields as far as the eye can see, full of onions
drying in the Georgia sun. A local curiosity only 25 years ago,
Vidalia onions have joined the ranks of seasonal foods keenly
awaited by American consumers. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   FRANCE-TURBOT (Paris) _ In a refrigerated warehouse at Roissy
Airport, near Paris, a man in a white lab coat lifts turbot out of
a cold seawater tank and lays them, one by one, into styrofoam
boxes. Now and then, a fish quivers its fins lethargically as it
settles into the box, but that is the only sign of life. Roughly 18
hours later, they arrive in Tokyo, where a truck fitted with water
tanks awaits them. The turbot are unpacked and slipped into the
tanks. Instantly, as if touched by a magic spell, they flutter back
to life. As incredible as their revival is, it is often brief. The
trucks deliver the fresh, live turbot to restaurants around the
city where many become part of dishes before the day is over. For
many chefs today, though, that is the point. They want to have the
freshest possible ingredients, no matter how extreme the measure is
to get it to them. By Amanda Hesser.

   NY-PIZZA-RENAISSANCE (New York) _ New York pizza is a phrase

to meet on Thursday with Helene David-Weill, the chairman and chief

   SPAGO (Beverly Hills) _ When Wolfgang Puck opened Spago in West
Hollywood in early 1982, he changed American restaurants. He did
not do it by serving California cuisine or putting caviar on pizza;
in fact, he didn't do it with the food at all. Puck, and his wife
and partner, Barbara Lazaroff, were the first restaurateurs to
realize that rich Americans longed for great food without
formality. And so he began serving oysters without ostentation and
foie gras without fuss. Puck opened Spago Beverly Hills last year,
switching his focus from the casual West Hollywood location to a
far more refined setting. His restaurant changed with the times and
once again gave an early clue to a new direction for dining in
America. By Ruth Reichl.

   BABY-BROCCOLI (Undated) _ A new sprout in the enchanted broccoli
forest is causing semantic chaos in specialty produce markets and
leaving adventuresome cooks searching for words. The diminutive

six inches; the head is a loose cluster of flowerettes that

WHY COMPANIES SHOULD CONSIDER A 30-HOUR WORKWEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You don't have to be Don Corleone to make your
employees an offer they can't refuse. Just tell them that if they
can come up with a way to improve productivity, you'll reduce
everybody's workweek to 30 hours _ without cutting pay.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they can't come up with a plan, you can bet they'll try.
And try. And try. While they'd be doing it to increase leisure
time, consider how a 30-hour workweek might help your business:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATTRACTING, KEEPING WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Company A pays $800 a week for working 40 hours. Company B, its
competitor, pays $800 a week for 30 hours. Where would you apply?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, lots of energetic workers will want to work 40 or 50 or 60
hours a week. Great. But at Company B, they know they can cut back
to 30 if business is slow or their personal life is hectic.
</P>
<P>
   And when Company B employees choose to put in those extra hours,
they can work at home or in the office or at a bar, for that
matter. Whatever works best.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 30-hour argument is more compelling for
white-collar jobs, it has also succeeded in manufacturing. In an
excellent story about the 30-hour workweek last October, U.S. News
&AMP; World Report pointed to improvements at Metro Plastics
Technologies in Indiana after it switched to a 30-hour week. The
quality of the product improved dramatically, and now there are
hundreds of applicants for jobs that used to stand vacant for
months.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter week also should dramatically reduce job turnover.
You'll waste less time on recruiting, interviewing and training,
and existing workers won't spend countless hours covering for
missing people and getting new workers up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REDUCING STRESS, ABSENTEEISM
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed, obviously, since the 40-hour workweek
became the standard in the 1930s. Cities are more crowded, so
commutes take longer. Both parents usually work, either by choice
or necessity, so child care is more complicated and housework
usually has to be done by people who have already worked a full
day. Technology has made work less demanding physically, but more
challenging mentally.
</P>
<P>
   The National Safety Council estimates that stress causes 1
million people a day to miss work. The American Institute of Stress
says 40 percent of employee turnover is related to job tension. Do
you think the 30-hour week would reduce those figures?
</P>
<P>
   Have you at least thought about whether the parents in your
company might do better if they had, say, five six-hour days so
they could be home when their children are? Or that others might do
better in three 10-hour shifts?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INCREASING CREATIVE ENERGY
</P>
<P>
   Creativity often comes in bursts. People start a great project
and they're willing to work like mad because it's fun. But then
they reach a plateau and the energy isn't there anymore. So they
sputter until the next good idea comes along.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-hour week gives them more time away from the office until
they feel refreshed. Not only does that help them, it keeps them
from distracting other workers who are on great projects.
</P>
<P>
   If your company has trouble coming up with fresh ideas, maybe
it's because you don't have any fresh people. In many careers these
days, employees are tired long before they're retired.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BETTER TIME MANAGEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Even in busy workplaces, people waste an awful lot of time, and
not just on watercooler conversations. They make personal calls,
run errands on company time and call in sick even when they're not.
They're preoccupied with things like making sure their kids get
home from school and hooking up with a plumber and checking out the
help-wanted ads.
</P>
<P>
   Can you blame them? An awful lot of things in life can be done
only from 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. If workers had one free
day a week, they could take care of those things on their own time,
keeping the office focused on work without making you look like a
tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   If you give employees the challenge of figuring out what works
best, they'll get rid of the wasted time _ even if they can't cut
back to 30 hours _ because they have a strong incentive. But they
won't volunteer those ideas now because they figure you'll just use
it as an excuse to lay people off or pile on more work.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. News story pointed to what happened at J.W. Pepper &AMP;
Son, a Pennsylvania sheet-music distributor. For the 29 slowest
weeks of the year, Pepper employees work four 7 1/2-hour days. The
rest of the year, they work five 7 1/2-hour days, and they have
been trained to handle several tasks so they can shift from
department to department as needed. In the first six years of the
new structure, sales doubled _ without adding employees.
</P>
<P>
   Your workers also will be the ones putting pressure on people
who waste time or call in sick excessively. After all, if one or
two people forced everybody else to work an extra 10 hours a week,
don't you think co-workers would, uh, gently correct them?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EMPLOYEE WILL FEEL APPRECIATED
</P>
<P>
   You're giving workers a strong say in how the company is run,
and a vested interest in whether it succeeds. While others pay lip
service to letting their workers have balanced lives, you're
actually doing it. Gee, do you think that might help morale?
</P>
<P>
   For your part, you have to do only two things: Give your workers
a chance, and promise them in writing that you won't use their
suggestions as a way to lay people off or make them work harder
during a 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   This is your chance to be the hero for a change. Don't blow it.

PRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO RESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEANNE RUSSELL  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sam Kirkpatrick has announced he will resign as
president of San Antonio's only public university after nearly a
decade of service.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation, effective June 30, 1999, comes five weeks after
University of Texas System Chancellor William Cunningham visited
the troubled University of Texas at San Antonio campus. Both men
said the resignation was not forced.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick, 54, brought new programs and buildings to a young
University of Texas at San Antonio after his arrival in January
1990. Under his leadership, the university has added 30 new
degrees, including two doctoral programs with a third pending. A
downtown campus, for decades an unfulfilled promise to San
Antonio's inner city, rose on the site of a failed shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last several months, Kirkpatrick's relations with
faculty and community groups have been strained. Professors reacted
angrily to an error-ridden attempt to equalize salaries. When the
No. 2 administrator, Provost Ray Garza, resigned in April, critics
questioned Kirkpatrick's commitment to Hispanics in leadership
positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kirkpatrick had used up much of the good will he
received when he took on the tough task of leading the university
through a decade of fast growth, changing demographics and rising
academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know when it's time to go,'' Kirkpatrick said
Monday, adding that his tenure has been ``far more successful than
I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to take a research fellowship at the American
Association of State Colleges and Universities in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who in April met with some faculty, students and
staff on a visit widely seen as an opportunity for him to assess
how the groups' relations with Kirkpatrick had soured, complimented
the president's accomplishments at UTSA.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he had not asked for Kirkpatrick's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the next president will build on Sam's (Kirkpatrick's)
momentum,'' Cunningham said. The chancellor said he planned a
follow-up visit to UTSA next Tuesday, and would meet with the same
campus leaders to discuss the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Art Vega, who heads the Faculty Senate, said he felt
``cautiously optimistic'' about the news of Kirkpatrick's impending
departure and hoped Cunningham would hire a new president swiftly
for a smooth transfer of power. Vega is the former chairman of La
Raza Faculty and Administrators Association, a group that
criticized Kirkpatrick's shortage of high-level Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   If Kirkpatrick stays through June 1999 as planned, he will have
lasted twice the national average of university presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the student population became nearly 40 percent
Hispanic and the faculty, 27 percent minority. The number of
Hispanic administrators, however, never reached community
expectations in a city where Hispanics are a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pritchard, associate dean of graduate studies, said
Kirkpatrick unsuccessfully tried to overcome UTSA's reputation as a
white, middle-class university serving San Antonio's North Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``UTSA is, quite rightfully, suffering for the sins of its
fathers, the ethnic politics of this city,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She credited Kirkpatrick for being a ``change agent,'' and said
the new leader could build on his accomplishments while repairing
relations with various university groups.

   VIDALIA-ONIONS (Glennville, Ga.) _ In springtime, you know
you're in Vidalia country without reading the signs. As soon as you
leave the piny woods of Fort Stewart, the vast Army base, you come
upon an amazing sight: row after row of burlap bags stretching
across the sandy fields as far as the eye can see, full of onions
drying in the Georgia sun. A local curiosity only 25 years ago,
Vidalia onions have joined the ranks of seasonal foods keenly
awaited by American consumers. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   FRANCE-TURBOT (Paris) _ In a refrigerated warehouse at Roissy
Airport, near Paris, a man in a white lab coat lifts turbot out of
a cold seawater tank and lays them, one by one, into styrofoam
boxes. Now and then, a fish quivers its fins lethargically as it
settles into the box, but that is the only sign of life. Roughly 18
hours later, they arrive in Tokyo, where a truck fitted with water
tanks awaits them. The turbot are unpacked and slipped into the
tanks. Instantly, as if touched by a magic spell, they flutter back
to life. As incredible as their revival is, it is often brief. The
trucks deliver the fresh, live turbot to restaurants around the
city where many become part of dishes before the day is over. For
many chefs today, though, that is the point. They want to have the
freshest possible ingredients, no matter how extreme the measure is
to get it to them. By Amanda Hesser.

   NY-PIZZA-RENAISSANCE (New York) _ New York pizza is a phrase

to meet on Thursday with Helene David-Weill, the chairman and chief

<P>
   SPAGO (Beverly Hills) _ When Wolfgang Puck opened Spago in West
Hollywood in early 1982, he changed American restaurants. He did
not do it by serving California cuisine or putting caviar on pizza;
in fact, he didn't do it with the food at all. Puck, and his wife
and partner, Barbara Lazaroff, were the first restaurateurs to
realize that rich Americans longed for great food without
formality. And so he began serving oysters without ostentation and
foie gras without fuss. Puck opened Spago Beverly Hills last year,
switching his focus from the casual West Hollywood location to a
far more refined setting. His restaurant changed with the times and
once again gave an early clue to a new direction for dining in
America. By Ruth Reichl.

   BABY-BROCCOLI (Undated) _ A new sprout in the enchanted broccoli
forest is causing semantic chaos in specialty produce markets and
leaving adventuresome cooks searching for words. The diminutive
hybrid _ mild, peppery and slightly sweet _ is basically a baby
broccoli. Its pale stems are as slim as spears and rarely exceed
six inches; the head is a loose cluster of flowerettes that
resemble infant broccoli rabe. By Molly O'Neill.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

 &UR; By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

 &UR; By KEITH SCHNEIDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   &UR; WHY CARE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW C. REVKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

<P>
   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New

<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

 &HT;     SURPRISE GUN BATTLE A REMINDER GUERRILLA GROUPS FIND FERTILE
GROUND AMONG MEXICO'S INDIANS
 &HT;     NOTE: El Charco is about 105 miles south of Acapulco.
 &HT;     By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CHARCO, Mexico _ After most of the soldiers had retreated and
the blood was almost dry, a small group of Mexican villagers crept
back into this remote mountain village at dusk Monday to observe
the remains of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying machetes, the men whispered in their native Indian
language and stared at the pock marks of hundreds of bullets
Mexican Army troops had pumped into their schoolhouse Sunday during
a predawn attack. A gruesome silhouette of blood reveals a rebel
fighter's final moments _ shot dead, perhaps at close range, head
and back pressed against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who died in here were all peasants,'' said
Francisco Ticurcio, a resident of El Charco, a Mixteco
(Meesh-Tay-ko) Indian village buried at the end of a long,
torturous mountain road 105 miles south of Acapulco, southern
Guerrero state's famous tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Army attack, which killed 11, wounded five and led to
the arrest of 21 suspected rebel affiliates, was a startling
reminder that leftist guerrilla movements _ other than the
Zapatistas in southern Chiapas state _ are still active among
Mexico's impoverished peasant Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly nervous, Ticurcio said in broken Spanish that he doesn't
know who the 11 people were who died in the surprise shootout, the
worst such clash between the military and leftist rebels in Mexico
in two years. But he said masked rebels armed with guns and wearing
uniforms had been visiting this village of sugar cane fields and
thatched-roof huts almost once a month since last August.
</P>
<P>
   He said crowds of up to 70 people gathered to hear the rebels,
who usually numbered 15 _ four who spoke Spanish as their primary
language, including a woman, and 11 who were Mixteco Indians from
other isolated villages near El Charco in the Southern Sierra Madre
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Those who died were identified as members of the Popular
Revolutionary Army, known as the EPR, a mysterious armed Marxist
group that had been largely silent for the past year. The EPR
announced its formation in June 1996, a year after Guerrero state
police stopped and shot dead 17 peasant activists who were
traveling on a road to attend a protest meeting near Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   In August of that year, the EPR staged its battle debut with
bloody raids in seven states in which 18 people died. In early
1997, ambushes and clashes with the Army killed several soldiers
and at least two rebels. People in a village 60 miles north of
Acapulco were too afraid to claim the rebels' bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rebels discovered in El Charco may have been
affiliated with yet another group, the Popular Indigenous
Revolutionary Army, unknown to authorities until now, according to
Guerrero's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, Servando Alanis Santos, said this week
that the state is investigating possible links to guerrilla
activity in El Charco with elected authorities in Ayutla, the
municipality where El Charco is.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Ayutla township is a member of Mexico's
center-left opposition party, the Democratic Revolution Party _ or
PRD _ which has long complained in Guerrero that its members have
been persecuted and killed by sympathizers of Mexico's dominant
political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1990, PRD sympathizers were killed by state
police after they had occupied a city hall in the Guerrero town of
Cruz Grande to protest electoral fraud. Since 1996, some PRD
members have been accused of being sympathizers of the EPR.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's remarks about El Charco may signify a new
hostile attitude against the PRD here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon Ayutla president Odilon Romero and a group
of supporters piled in a pickup truck and drove an hour into the
mountains to visit El Charco.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by foreign journalists, he called the attack ``a
lamentable event,'' and said he had long been aware of the
desperate poverty the Indians of El Charco and other villages
suffer in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Charco is a town that has always demanded services, like
potable water, electricity, jobs,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew nothing personally of EPR activity in El Charco
or other Indian villages, only information from news reports
indicating that as far back as 1996 rebels had visited some towns
in Guerrero to invite villagers to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said using weapons to make change doesn't do any
of us any good,'' Romero added. ``I've proposed peace, not
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   El Charco, which means ``the puddle'' in Spanish, is a typical
poor Indian village of about 300. Residents are openly disgruntled
and complain about their poverty, but on Monday appeared reluctant
to talk about their feelings towards the rebels who had been
attempting to recruit among them.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers grow corn and sugar cane, and travel into Ayutla
on Sundays to sell avocados, bananas and other fruit they harvest
to earn cash.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, residents said, they awoke to a barrage of
gunfire and realized their schoolhouse _ a simple pastel-colored
cement building _ was under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it was on a routine patrol to search for marijuana
and poppy fields that are grown in the mountains here when soldiers
came upon the rebels. Villagers said the Army approached on foot
and appeared to have surrounded the school in a stealthy move.
</P>
<P>
   When bullets started flying, the villagers said, they fled into
the tropical hills around El Charco. Only late Monday afternoon did
they return to inspect the school, where pools of blood outlining
bodies stained the building's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Out on a basketball court, long trails of blood showed where
bodies were dragged out. Shattered glass covered the school's floor
and an outside walkway, evidence that bullets entered the school
and rebels had broken windows to fire back at the army. Two Indian
women in long skirts and braids walked gingerly _ barefoot _ over
the glass and among third grade Spanish and mathematics workbooks
scattered about.
</P>
<P>
   The Army said it had taken a woman from Mexico City who was a
teacher into custody after the shootout. Villagers said El Charco
didn't have a female teacher, but that a woman was among the
Spanish-speaking rebels who met with them from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was a friend of the peasants,'' Ticurcio, the
Indian villager, said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they had returned to inspect the damage,
guard their possessions and obtain food to eat. An Army patrol
stood by on a nearby bluff overlooking El Charco, maintaining
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Ticurcio and the others said they wanted the Army to retreat
completely from the area around the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid of them,'' said Jose Jimenez, his ragged white
clothes smudged from a night sleeping in the woods. ``Of course we
are afraid of them.''

BURGER WITH NO NEED OF KETCHUP  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c. 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were several things that inspired me to create a salmon
burger. I knew it would taste good, which is really reason enough.
And I figured people would be unlikely to cover it with ketchup,
another plus. Then there's the fact that salmon is sold everywhere,
and when on sale, it's not much more expensive than ground meat.
Finally, the oils contained in salmon are actually supposed to have
some health benefits _ at least according to the current wisdom _
thanks to its high percentage of omega-3 fatty acids.
</P>
<P>
   The creation process, however, was not as easy as I had hoped.
When I used hand-chopped or coarsely ground fish, the burger fell
apart almost before I got it into the pan. When I ground it fine,
it held together well, but the meat became so dense and dry during
cooking that even I was reaching for the ketchup bottle after one
bite. It was at that point that I began incorporating eggs,
mayonnaise, bread crumbs and all the other extra ingredients of
``hamburgers'' made without meat. My goal, however, was not just a
salmon burger _ it was a minimalist salmon burger.
</P>
<P>
   And here are the results of my researches: If you finely grind
part of the salmon, it will bind the rest, which can be coarsely
chopped to retain its moisture during cooking. Some coarse bread
crumbs keep the burger from becoming as densely packed as bad
meatloaf. This approach, along with a few simple seasonings,
produced a delicious burger in not much more time than it takes to
make one from ground round.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you have a food processor, the method is quite
simple. About one-quarter of the salmon is finely ground, almost
pureed; the machine takes care of that in about 30 seconds. Then
the rest of the fish is chopped by pulsing the machine on and off a
few times. The only other trick is to avoid overcooking. Whether
you saute, broil or grill this burger, it's best when the center
remains ... well, salmon color. Two or three minutes a side usually
does the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon takes better to a wider variety of seasonings _
especially subtle ones _ than ground meat. And the two-step
grinding process means that those flavorings that you want minced
fine, like garlic or ginger, can go in with the first batch of
salmon; those that should be left coarse, like onion or fresh
herbs, can go in with the rest.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SALMON BURGERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 20 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds skinless, boneless salmon
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   { cup coarse bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers, drained
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut the salmon into large chunks, and put about a quarter of
it into the container of a food processor, along with the mustard.
Turn the machine on, and let it run _ stopping to scrape down the
sides if necessary _ until the mixture becomes pasty.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the shallots and the remaining salmon, and pulse the
machine on and off until the fish is chopped and well combined with
the puree. No piece should be larger than a quarter inch or so; be
careful not make the mixture too fine.
</P>
<P>
   3. Scrape the mixture into a bowl, and by hand, stir in the
bread crumbs, capers and some salt and pepper. Shape into four
burgers. (You can cover and refrigerate the burgers for a few hours
at this point.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Place the butter or oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet, and
turn the heat to medium-high. When the butter foam subsides or the
oil is hot, cook the burgers for 2 to 3 minutes a side, turning
once. Alternatively, you can grill them: let them firm up on the
first side, grilling about 4 minutes, before turning over and
finishing for just another minute or two. To check for doneness,
make a small cut and peek inside. Be careful not to overcook. Serve
on a bed of greens or on buns or by themselves, with lemon wedges
and Tabasco or any dressing you like.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Variety of Approaches to Seasoning &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seasoning the Salmon Burger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The recipe's mustard, shallots and capers are not the only
approaches to consider for seasoning the four salmon burgers.
</P>
<P>
   While pureeing the first batch of salmon, you can:
</P>
<P>
   _Use a combination of soy sauce (about a tablespoon), sesame oil
(a teaspoon) and ginger (a teaspoon). Use peanut oil for sauteeing
if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   _Add a small clove of garlic (don't overdo it, because the
garlic will remain nearly raw and strong tasting).
</P>
<P>
   For the coarser, second batch, you can:
</P>
<P>
   _Use a quarter of a cup onion or scallions, in addition to or
instead of the shallots.
</P>
<P>
   _Add spice mixtures like curry or chili powder, using a teaspoon
to a tablespoon, depending on your spice capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _Add 1 tablespoon or more of fresh herbs, like parsley, chervil,
dill or cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add red or yellow bell pepper (half a cup), cored, seeded and
roughly chopped.
</P>
<P>
   With the bread crumbs, try mixing in lightly toasted pignoli (a
quarter cup or more) or sesame seeds (about a tablespoon).

ICE CREAM SANDWICHES, HANDMADE TO ORDER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the early 1980s, ice cream sandwiches were the
rage in New York City. Every ice cream shop made them, and there
were pushcarts that specialized in them, too. Then, like any fad,
they faded away.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. Standing in line recently at Sedutto's on First Avenue
between 78th and 79th Streets, I spied a canister of chocolate
wafer cookies and had a flashback: would they make sandwiches with
them?
</P>
<P>
   Not only would they make them, they would make them with any
flavor I wanted. My custom ice cream sandwich turned out to be a
marriage made in culinary heaven, the slight bitterness of
cappuccino ice cream playing off the chocolate, the cold creaminess
off the crisp cookie.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to order cappuccino, of course, but you do have
to know to order the sandwiches because they are not listed on the
menu. They cost $2.25, just about the same price they were 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   One small warning: eating them is not simply a matter of taking
a bite. They are squishier than the commercial kind, and there is a
certain skill required. Never try to cram the top and bottom cookie
and the ice cream filling into your mouth at the same time. Can't
be done. Just take a bite out of the lower cookie and a bit of the
ice cream. Then flip the sandwich over and repeat. In the end, it
is just barely possible to eat top, bottom and middle all together,
without having the ice cream fall to the floor.

 BALTIMORE: ... immediate area
<TEXT>
<P>
   Explore the world-class National Aquarium or the Maryland
Science Center, for instance, or take a walk along the water to the
city's impressive Little Italy section, which boasts historic
housing and Old World-style bakeries and restaurants that rival
those in Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you want to continue the rail experience, head in the
opposite direction _ west on Pratt Street _ and visit the fun and
fascinating B&AMP;O Railroad Museum.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a host of hotels at the Convention Center stop,
ranging from inexpensive ones like a Days Inn to pricier
alternatives like a Marriott and the Renaissance Harborplace.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY CENTER
</P>
<P>
   Locals get off the trolleys here to attend classes at the
University of Maryland's city campus, or to switch to a subway
train headed elsewhere. But visitors are more likely to utilize
this stop to drop their luggage at the Omni, Hilton, or Tremont
Suites hotel or, better yet, to attend a matinee at the nearby
Morris A. Mechanic Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 lineup at this first-rate theater includes several
dance performances _ by the Virsky Ukrainian National Dance
Company, by an Irish group telling a passionate tale titled
``Spirit of the Dance,'' and by an Argentinian troupe of singers
and dancers in a production called ``Viva El Tango'' _ as well as a
monthlong run of the smash hit ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   LEXINGTON MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Hang a right at the corner a half-block from where the train
lets you off, and prepare for sensory overload. Even before you
enter the cavernous building that houses America's oldest
continuing marketplace (begun in 1782), the scene outside _ with
street vendors selling everything from plastic baseball bats to
tennis shoes to religion _ captivates you. And you know,
immediately, that you're in for an experience that's the antithesis
of upscale, post-modern, Faneuil Hall-style entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lexington Market is gritty-urban, some of its shops are
marked by signs that you might otherwise see at an antiques store,
and some purveyors run operations that have been in business here
for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled between the soul-food sellers, butcher shops, and
fresh-vegetable stands are stylized kiosks that sell video
casettes, croissants, and sushi, of course. But the bulk of the
establishments seem to be ones like Huber's Cookies (open since
1886, though they probably didn't sell bagels back then) and
Pollock Johnny's (wickedly good sausage smothered in grilled onions
and green peppers).
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the sights and sounds of the place are a flashback
to a time gone by _ and that's a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful, isn't it?'' asks Nancy Faidley Divine, the
third generation of her family to run John W. Faidley Seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Her carry-out/stand-up restaurant opened in 1886, and today it's
the place to go for one of the best crabcakes you'll ever have the
pleasure to place in your mouth. Crabcakes are a Baltimore
specialty, and Faidley's sells several different kinds. The one
that draws customers from all over the country, though, is the
``big-lump'' for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   It's hand-made with just the chunks of sweet meat found behind
the swimming fins of Maryland blue crabs. The crabmeat is then
tossed with saltines, Old Bay Seafood Seasoning, Worcester sauce,
egg, black pepper, and several mustards in a perfect combination.
Nothing fancy, but a very high-class act almost worth making the
trip for all on its own.
</P>
<P>
   CULTURAL CENTER
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the last stop visitors will use headed north
before arriving at Penn Station, except for those bound for the
suburbs, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Baltimore and the acclaimed Maryland Institute
College of Art are located close by, but the real attractions for
tourists are theatrical and artistic.
</P>
<P>
   This year's lineup at the Lyric Theater, for instance, includes
a gospel musical called ``I Know I've Been Changed''; a one-woman
show with Chita Rivera called ``Chita and All That Jazz''; and the
blockbuster ``Riverdance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scheduled performances at the Joseph Meyerhoff
Symphony Hall are ``Gershwin, By George!'' as well as ``Marvin
Hamlisch's Prom Night,'' and regular performances by the
well-regarded Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra is
playing its last season under music director David Zinman, who took
the BSO to new artistic heights.
</P>
<P>
   Also a short walk away are the Walter's Art Gallery, which
currently features a Monet exhibit; and the Maryland Historical
Society, which displays both fine artwork and artifacts.

BALTIMORE'S MANY DELIGHTS PLEASE VISITORS
</HEADLINE>
   2 takes (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Coast to coast, from Los Angeles to Boston,
Americans love to gripe about their cars, buses, subways, and other
motorized means of getting from here to there.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimoreans are no different. To hear them tell it, this
charming city's six-year-old, $500 million light rail system is too
slow, too geographically limited, too expensive ... well, you get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But out-of-towners like Douglas Robinson and Renee Lacey, who
periodically visit Lacey's sister here, tell a very different
story. ``The light rail is our little secret,'' says Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   For only $1.35 each, the couple from outside Phoenix can board
one of the small, clean, above-ground cars _ they look like the
newer trolleys on the Green Line in Boston _ and travel from
Baltimore-Washington International Airport to a downtown hotel. A
cab, by comparison, would run just over $20, including tip.
</P>
<P>
   Along much of the rail route, Lacey and Robinson enjoy the view
of homes and green hills instead of highways, and then take in what
she calls ``the real nitty gritty'' of urban scenes as they glide
quietly toward their destination.
</P>
<P>
   And for train lovers, like an 8-year-old girl and a 10-year-old
boy clutching their colorful pull-along suitcases, there's also
clearly a thrill to the ride itself, to the occasional light
screech of the train on its tracks, to the old-style whistle the
driver pulls as each stop approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Most important for tourists (especially those in no hurry, since
the trains really don't break any speed records), the light rail
system cheaply and efficiently travels to some of Baltimore's most
interesting and alluring sites. Those range from the much-praised
Inner Harbor development, with its multitudinous trendy shops and
restaurants set along the city's lovely harbor; to the
less-heralded but wonderfully funky Lexington Market; to the small
cultural district, with its few but fine theaters and museums; to
the Orioles' state-of-the-art stadium at Camden Yards, which is a
visual wonder that's worth seeing, even if you care nothing at all
about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this isn't the way all vacationers will want to get
around Baltimore. Many travelers don't want to carry bags on and
off trolley cars, for instance, and there are no stops near some of
the places you might want to go; moreover, some of the attractions
the system advertises as being ``nearby'' require a 10- to
20-minute walk after disembarking.
</P>
<P>
   One more advisory: This is an urban transportation system, with
the word ``urban'' emphasized. So, even though police regularly
patrol the cars, visitors may not want to ride at night, and should
take any other precautions that accompany city life.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it's particularly tempting to ride the rails now that
two recently completed extensions are in place: to and from the
airport and Pennsylvania Station _ a grand, old-style downtown
train terminal that was renovated a couple of years ago to include
snazzy eateries, gift stores, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.35 mentioned above gets you a one-way trip anywhere on
the light rail system, which contains about 30 stops and runs from
the airport to the south all the way to suburban Hunt Valley north
of the city. A smart buy, for $3, is a pass that allows on-and-off
priveleges for a full day; and if you really like the trains,
spring for a weekly fare card for just $11.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Convention and Visitors Center at 800-282-6632 can
provide lots of information about which sites are accessible via
light rail (as well as by cab, car, the city's small subway system,
and other public transportation). But, as a starting point, here
are a few stops we made and enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   CAMDEN YARDS
</P>
<P>
   After passing through several residential and industrial areas,
the first gotta-see sight traveling from the airport northward is
Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Conveniently enough, Camden Yards is
also the name of the light rail stop.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, the ballpark combines past and present with
such flare that it started a trend in new sports arenas nationwide.
And it isn't just a venue for Cal Ripken admirers; within the walls
of this awesome facility are bars, restaurants, and souvenier
shops.
</P>
<P>
   It's so popular that since it opened in 1992, about 285,000
visitors have paid $5 each to take tours, which are available daily
all year. ``It's really amazing, but it's a unique attraction,''
says Orioles spokesman Kevin Behan.
</P>
<P>
   Real baseball fans will want to take a three-block walk from
Camden Yards and spend another $5 to visit the Babe Ruth Birthplace
and Baseball Center. Harborplace, the inner-harbor development that
instigated the transformation of Baltimore's downtown area, is also
just a 10-minute stroll away.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several major hotels, including the Hyatt Regency
and the Sheraton, are very near this stop. Or you can pick up a
commuter train here to Washington, D.C., which is just an hour away
and offers some pretty good tourism of its own.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION CENTER
</P>
<P>
   If there's nothing happening at the convention center itself
(check with the Visitors Center), this is the rail stop closest to
Baltimore's most-popular attraction: Harborplace and the other
shops and restaurants at the Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to lose yourself at this grandiose, expansive version
of Quincy Market, but you should pull yourself away because there's
so much else to do in the immediate area.

THE FREEDOM TRAIL _ BIRTHPLACE OF AMERICAN LIBERTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ These are the sites that stir the soul.
</P>
<P>
   They are the places where the idea of freedom flourished, and
where some of the people who fought for that idea lived, worshiped,
died, and now rest forever.
</P>
<P>
   They are places like Faneuil Hall, where the cry of ``no
taxation without representation'' echoed through the meeting hall,
presaging the American Revolution; the Bunker Hill Monument, near
land where Colonel William Prescott is said to have shouted ``Don't
fire until you see the whites of their eyes!''; and the Granary
Burying Ground, where Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and John Hancock
are buried.
</P>
<P>
   They are the sites, 16 in all, that make up Boston's Freedom
Trail, a 2 1/2-mile path, linked by a red-brick line, that draws
some 3 million visitors a year from throughout the world. It is a
trail that can be walked in as little as an hour but which leaves
an impression that may well remain with you always.
</P>
<P>
   No one can improve upon the meaning of these hallowed places,
which also include Paul Revere's home, the Old North Church (where
the two lanterns associated with Revere shone so brightly on April
18, 1775), the Boston Common, and the site of the Boston Massacre.
But people can make the sites more accessible, attractive, and even
entertaining. And they have done just that.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays visitors _ and residents, too _ who walk the trail will
find new signs, informational kiosks, brass medallion markers, and
better pedestrian ramps. That's because of a million-dollar
appropriation last year by Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who recently
walked part of the trail at an event kicking off the spring-summer
tourist season. With the Old North Church looming in the background
and Paul Revere himself standing nearby, the mayor told a group of
schoolchildren, ``These are not just buildings _ they're part of
your freedom. ... We preserve the past for our future.''
</P>
<P>
   People who walk the trail will encounter the present as well,
what with cars wending their way down the city's narrow streets and
the occasional clatter of construction being heard. But Linda
McConchie, the new director of the Freedom Trail Foundation, says
she believes visitors will benefit from ``the intellectual
stimulation of the trail's urban context. It's the world we live
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors should also benefit by meeting people from the past.
The Freedom Trail Players act as authentically costumed
ambassadors, telling people about life in Revolutionary Boston and,
perhaps equally important, offering directions and tips, such as
where to find a rest room. (They don't, however, try to pretend
you're in the 1700s. That would be hard to do, considering the
aformementioned cars and construction.) In addition, the Faneuil
Hall Marketplace historic characters, Ben Franklin among them, lend
a hand.
</P>
<P>
   And free 90-minute trail tours are conducted by Park Rangers
from April through October. Eight sites, primarily on the Freedom
Trail, constitute Boston National Historic Park, and since 1976 the
National Park Service has infused more than $50 million into
restoration and other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   More upgrades are on the way. This year, Menino will unveil the
city's handicapped-accessible guide to the trail. And thanks to a
grant from the Massachusetts Office of Travel &AMP; Tourism, the
Freedom Trail Foundation will publish a color visitor map and guide
and create a Web site. That grant is also responsible for bringing
back the Freedom Trail Players.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a major new exhibit, ``The Bloody Massacre on King
Street: The Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770,'' has opened at the
Old State House Museum at 206 Washington St., sponsored by the
Bostonian Society. Visitors can walk through a re-creation of the
moonlit Boston street where five men were killed in a clash with
British redcoats. Viewing the various displays _ including bullets,
a British musket, and autopsy reports _ people can ponder the
causes of those killings and be reminded that there were legal
maneuvers and courtroom drama long before the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   The Old South Meeting House has reopened, too, after a $7.2
million appropriation from Congress to the National Park Service.
This is where raucous pre-Revolutionary debates took place,
including one attended by 5,000 outraged colonists that led to the
Boston Tea Party. The historic space has been restored, with a
variety of new amenities, including a gift shop and those
all-important rest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   At the spring-summer kickoff event, Mary Jane McKenna, executive
director of the Massachusetts Office of Travel &AMP; Tourism, read a
proclamation at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, declaring Boston's
visitor season officially open. But she didn't stop there.
``There's nowhere in Disney with a Freedom Trail,'' she told the
onlookers. ``And we have buildings with all four sides!''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a hearty ``Huzzah!'' from the crowd.

THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THIS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among items from the Titanic on view beginning July 1 at the
World Trade Center is a lamp that indicated the ship's direction.
The exhibit features more than 300 items recovered from the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Put three-cornered hats on a group of kids and something amazing
happens. Revolutionary Fun includes Colonial Williamsburg, where
the past comes to life every day.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a titanic summer for Boston. More than 300
events are planned, and the events range from below sea level to
the heights of Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's waterfront will be particularly lively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic: The Exhibition'' comes to the World Trade Center on
July 1. The show, the largest showing of Titanic artifacts to date,
will be set up next to the new Seaport Hotel and across from the
Trade Center. More than 300 objects recovered from the wreck site
will be presented throughout the two-hour exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be taken on a narrative and visual journey to the
bottom of the North Atlantic where the Titanic rests. The
exhibition will highlight the innovative technology used to explore
the Titanic wreckage. For information, call 888-744-7998. The show
runs through Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While the exhibition is in town, the Museum of Science will
bring back to its huge Omni screen ``Titanica.'' Also on the screen
at the museum this summer is ``Everest,'' the dramatic story of a
science journey to the pinnacle of the world. Do reserve tickets,
as the film has been sold out since its opening this spring. For
tickets, call 617-723-2500.
</P>
<P>
   July 23-26 will see an international salute to the unsinkable
Old Ironsides, the USS Constitution, which is celebrating its 200th
birthday. Naval vessels from around the world will be coming to
Boston for the event, passing in review as the Constitution is
anchored by the Fish Pier.
</P>
<P>
   After the review, the Constitution and the vessels will be open
for touring at Charlestown Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Other bicentennial events for the oldest active naval vessel in
the world include a Boston Pops concert at Harborlights,
competitions, a jazz brunch alongside the Constitution, fireworks,
and ``Liberty on Landsdowne Street,'' an international crew welcome
reception on this club-happy street. For information on harbor
cruises for this event, call Durgan Travel at 800-234-9959.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the 17th annual season for Boston Harborfest, which
has held the No. 1 spot among the Top 100 Events in North America
by the American Bus Association. Among the 160 events planned for
the celebration, June 30 to July 5, are fireworks, tours, the
greatest chowderfest anywhere (a tough choice in a city known for
its chowder), harbor island walks, and ship tours.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, the harbor is a great place for
exploring. Visitors can take sightseeing cruises, dinner cruies,
sail on tall ships, take a whale-watching cruise, cruise to Cape
Cod, and now, after a 20-year absence, go deep-sea fishing for blue
or bottom fish (call Boston Harbor Cruises at 617-227-4321).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the place to be on July 4 is along the Charles River
for the annual Boston Pops concert. More than 500,000 people are
expected for the concert led by Keith Lockhart. This year's 25th
anniversary performance will again end with the stirring ``1812
Overture'' accompanied by church bells, cannons, and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more on tap throughout the summer. Arthur's World
is at the Children's Museum, with lots of interactive exhibits, and
children will be able to fantasy play in their favorite Arthur
setting, which is designed to reinforce the message that being
smart and into books is cool. Reservations are recommended. For
tickets, call TicketMaster at (617 or 508) 931-2787 or at Filene's
locations. At the Museum of Science, Robotics features a huge
hands-on exhibit with the latest technology to demystify computers,
engineering, and artifical intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, there will be music galore, with Boston's
Summer Music Festivals and everything from Bach to Blues. Along the
waterfront, Harborlights Music Festival will be featuring 30
international performers. On stage, Disney's ``Beauty and the
Beast'' will be at the Wang Theater from July 2 through Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a sampling of what's on this summer. For
complete information and a guide to Boston, call the Greater Boston
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau at 888-SEE-BOSTON. Callers will also
receive a Family Friendly ValuePass with discounts to attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Other money-saving deals for visitors include the Boston
CityPass ($26.50 for adults, $20.50 for seniors 65 and older,
$13.50 for youths 13-18; under 13 is either free or very reasonably
priced), which provides a 50 percent discount to six major
attractions in the city. Also available is a visitor transit pass,
``The Visitor Passport,'' that provides discounts on attractions,
dining, tours, bike and sailboat rentals, shops, and unlimited
rides on the T. The pass is $5 for one day, $9 for three days, and
$18 for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading for Santa Fe, the place to stay is Hotel Santa
Fe, the nation's only Native American-owned off-reservation hotel.
The hotel, a joint venture of Picuris Pueblo, represents an unusual
collaboration that has brought economic growth to Picuris and a new
blend of cultures to the city. Works by Native American artisans _
pottery, paintings, and weavings _ fill the hotel. Guests will find
a Native American restaurant, music, and history. The hotel
features every modern amenity along with New Mexican furnishing.
For information, call 800-210- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beginning July 1, there's a new way to get to Martha's Vineyard.
Motorcoach service will be offered from the Kingston MBTA station
to the ferry docks in Woods Hole. The service is a cooperative
effort by the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship
Authority and the Plymouth &AMP; Brockton Street Railway Co. The
one-way fare, which includes bus transportation and the ferry to
the island, is $12 a person. Advance reservations are not
necessary. The service also means that travelers from Boston and
South Shore communities can get to the island without a car.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Bluffs will hold its seventh annual Harbor Festival on June
13 (rain date is June 14). The festival features music, food and
lots of fun.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So you'd like to become a travel guidebook author? Well, here's
your chance. The third annual Institute for Guidebook Writing will
be held in Cambridge, July 19-22. Six experienced authors,
including Arthur Frommer, the dean of American guidebook authors,
will participate in the weekend that will provide everything one
needs to know about writing guidebooks. For information on the $295
course, call Tom Brosnahan at 978-287-0540, or check the Web at

<P>
   If you're in New York City on Tuesday, join the 20th annual
Museum Mile Festival that runs from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. from 82nd to
104th streets. Along the way, stop in at any of the nine top
museums; admission is free for the night. Along the route are El
Museo del Barrio; the Museum of the City of New York; International
Center of Photography; the Jewish Museum; Cooper Hewitt, National
Design Museum of the Smithsonian Institution; National Academy
Museum, School of Fine Arts; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum;
Goethe-Institut New York/German Cultural Center; and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

   You've used UPS to send packages around the world, now let them
fly you to some sunny destinations. TNT Vacations is now using UPS
passenger jets on Bahamas and Aruba charter vacations. Michael
Bloomer, president of TNT, said it takes UPS only four hours to
convert their jets to passenger service, and because there are
fewer seats, there is more passenger leg room and comfort.

NOTHING NAMES THESE PLACES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These American towns have nothing names: None, Mo.; Unnamed,
Wash.; Nowhere, Okla.; Nada, Texas; Nadaburg, Ariz.; No Name,
Colo., Nameless, Tenn.; and Nameless Cave, S.D. And those are just
a few of the peculiar names for neighborhoods, villages, towns, and
other locales described in ``A Place Called Peculiar'' by Frank G.
Gallant (Merriam-Webster, $14.95). Other examples:
</P>
<P>
   _Peculiar, Mo., where a place marker proclaims: ``In 1861-1864
while bloody battles raged throughout the Southern states nothing
happened here.'' How it got its name is a long story, having to do
with a government error.
</P>
<P>
   _Smut Eye, Ala., where a popular gathering spot was the smithy.
The shop was so dirty and sooty that men went home with ``smut'' in
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _Corkscrew, Fla., which took its name from the winding Corkscrew
River. The only problem is that the river doesn't wind much these
days.
</P>
<P>
   _Ducktrap, Maine, where the Penobscot Indians trapped ducks that
were molting and couldn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   _Loudville, Mass., a village in Northampton, which was named not
for the sometimes boisterous Clear Falls but for industrialist
Caleb Loud.
</P>
<P>
   As the author puts it, America takes a ``no-holds-barred,
call-'em-as-you-see-'em, idiosyncratic approach to place naming
that is not replicated anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  Which of the world's capital cities has the
highest elevation? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``They wanted to take us to historic places. We
wanted to go to Jack's Joke Shop.'' _ humorist Dave Barry,
describing a class trip to Boston when he was in the ninth grade in
Armonk, N.Y., in the 1960s. (The class also visited Salem, where a
student _ we can't imagine which one _ set off a stink bomb in the
secret staircase of the House of Seven Gables, causing the
cancellation of future trips.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Contest time: &LR;  You can win a trip to Shangri-La _ the hotel,
that is. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, a group of 35 award-winning
properties in the Asia-Pacific region, has added on-line bookings
to its Web site, www.shangri-la.com. To publicize that, Shangri-la
is sponsoring a 10-question contest on the site. Participants will
be asked about the hotel group and selected properties. (Hint: The
answers can be found throughout the Web site.) There will be a
drawing from among correct answers, and the winner and a companion
will be flown by United Airlines to Hong Kong for four nights each
at the Island and Shangri-La hotels there. The contest ends June
30.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Casinos in Korea: &LR;  Casinos are popular with visitors to Korea _
so popular that 13 of the country's deluxe hotels, from Seoul to
Chejudo Island, have them. The largest is the Sheraton Walker Hill
hotel Casino in Seoul, and the hotel also presents a Las Vegas-type
stage show. At Korean casinos, all of which are
government-approved, you'll find all the popular games of chance.
But there's one thing you won't find: Korean gamblers. Koreans
aren't allowed to play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How's that again? &LR;  A notice on the board at the Graceland
Wedding Chapel proudly proclaimed: ``Lorenzo Lamas and Jon Bon Jovi
were married here!'' But not, as the sign might make it appear, to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Did you guess it? &LR;  La Paz, Bolivia, at 12,001 feet, is the
highest-elevated capital city in the world.

 &HT;    ADVOCACY GROUPS FINDING THE INTERNET A POWERFUL RESOURCE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the tax-exempt group Putting Children First
was founded last year to promote school vouchers in Texas, it faced
a problem common to all such start-ups: How to attract contributors
and members who could mount an effective lobbying campaign?
</P>
<P>
   The answer came from a new but not unpredictable source: the
Internet. Mining the membership of Juno Online Services, the
nation's second largest carrier of personal e-mail accounts, the
Texas organization recently targeted its promotional advertising to
thousands of Texas e-mail users, many of whom e-mailed back,
wanting to be put on the group's mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Greg Talley, the group's executive
director. ``It's cheaper than a postage stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters have long been accustomed to the glossy political
pamphlets that arrive in the mail before elections and the barrage
of television advertising on the evening news. But tax-exempt
groups such as Putting Children First are now experimenting with
the power of the Internet to distribute political issue
advertising, recruit supporters and wage on-line lobbying campaigns
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Another special interest group, which Juno declined to identify,
is paying Juno to send Juno's members an issue ad on legislation
currently before Congress. Voters who receive this ad will have the
option of e-mailing their member of Congress a pre-written letter
on the subject with a click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   Juno also is talking to political candidates who could use the
company's database of 5 million members to send campaign literature
about themselves _ and their opponents _ to voters before the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for on-line advocacy is really fantastic,'' said
Oron Strauss of Net.Capitol, Inc., a private company that designs
Web pages for advocacy groups. ``The speed with which you can react
and mobilize large numbers of constituents or members is really
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   All members of Congress now have e-mail addresses to communicate
electronically with constituents. Many candidates for political
office set up Web pages that prompt visitors to give them their
name and address to receive more information.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites for advocacy groups such as Americans for Tax Reform,
a conservative anti-tax group in Washington, have features that
allow visitors to read about an issue and then e-mail their member
of Congress about it.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, recently launched
a Web site describing the costly environmental effects of driving
sports utility vehicles (SUVs). When Web surfers search for SUVs on
one of the Web search programs, they find the Friends of the Earth
site along with sites promoting SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Juno Advocacy Network, a division of a New York company,
is taking issue advocacy a step farther, allowing advocacy groups
to target users unsolicited.
</P>
<P>
   In return for free e-mail, Juno members must complete a detailed
survey about their interests, financial position and family life
and agree to receive advertisements every time they log on to check
their mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company keeps its subscriber list confidential, but special
interest groups can come to Juno with a specific description of the
kind of people they would like to reach with their advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Children First, for example, figured its ideal member
would be a mother between the ages of 25 and 45 who is also
religious. Juno quickly identified about 30,000 of the 361,000
members it has in Texas that fit the profile.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning two weeks ago, those Juno users checking their e-mail
were greeted by a colorful screen ad from Putting Children First.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ardai, president of Juno, predicts that public interest
groups will soon value the speed of the internet and Juno's ability
to target voters based on their interests, background and street
address at little cost. On-line issue ads cost less than direct
mail, taking into account printing and production costs and
postage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a vote, we can get the word out from the people who
have an opinion to the people who are merely forming an opinion _
the constituents _ and then encourage (them) to send their opinion
... to their representatives,'' said Ardai. ``This would by postal
mail take weeks, if not months. But on line, a company could come
to us today and we could have a message up to our users ...
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons people don't write their Congress people
more often is because they don't know who they are. ... But here
you don't even have to know who your Congress people are ... We
know what ZIP code you are in. We know what district you live in,
and we can have a button on the screen that says click here and
your message will go to your representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Political advertising on the Internet is still so new that most
experts and observers are unwilling to predict how quickly it will
catch on, or just what it signifies for American democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Reed, who ran the Web page for the Clinton-Gore 1996
election campaign and advises candidates on how to use the Internet
for campaigning, says Juno's membership base is still too small to
make it cost-effective for candidates to send out campaign
literature to voters in their district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the audience gets large enough, I think you will see
every campaign tactic (on the Internet) that you currently see in
other mediums,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the potential for more ``sophisticated'' communication
between voters and politicians, Ardai noted that politicians could
e-mail a 12,000-word issue paper to voters for a fraction the cost
of mailing it. But he conceded that political dialogue in the
United States has been a ``steady drive in the other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress report that more and more of their
constituents use e-mail, and that they treat e-mail like ordinary
mail. But members of Congress also distinguish between constituent
letters and mass mailings prompted by a special interest lobbying
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal messages are the most powerful,'' said Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Juno also has the monopoly on on-line issue ads,
since other e-mail providers do not offer their services in
exchange for demographic information from subscribers that can be
sold to advertisers. Unless special interest groups have electronic
mailing lists of their own, they have to pay Juno for the
permission to use theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And Juno won't take just anything. Ardai and David Shaw,
chairman of D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., which owns Juno, decided the company
won't run issue advertising from tobacco companies as ``a matter of
principle,'' said Ardai. Other types of advertising will be decided
on a case-by-case basis, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the arbiters of taste, certainly not
opinion, but we presume we will draw some lines,'' Ardai says.
``Something that would offend a member who merely holds a different
opinion, that's fair game. But something that would offend every
reasonable human being who saw it, that's not fair game.''

BANKS GET HIGH MARKS FOR LENDING, BUT WILL THAT CONTINUE AFTER
MERGER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While investors cheered the proposed $34 billion
merger of San Francisco's Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and Norwest Corp. of
Minneapolis, a consumer organization questioned whether the new
bank can keep up Wells Fargo's record as a strong lender to
businesses and consumers in low-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to provide
financial services to all neighborhoods where branches are found.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer watchdogs say that Norwest has done a fine job of
community lending in its home state of Minnesota. But California's
population and ethnic groups are more diverse, and their financial
needs are greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells Fargo is a leader among banks of its size,'' said Robert
Gnaizda, general counsel at the Greenlining Institute in San
Francisco. ``The question now is: Can the new bank maintain that
same leadership? Can it commit to the same high level of
performance as the old Wells?''
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called Wells Fargo, will be based in San
Francisco and be headed by Norwest Chairman Richard Kovacevich.
Paul Hazen, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, will be the new
bank's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Norwest executives said their bank haD a strong
reputation for working closely with community groups, including
Hispanics and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of our record, and we hope to maintain what
Wells Fargo has done in California,'' Norwest spokesman Larry Haeg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bank will respond to the needs of California's
communities,'' said Diane Lilly, president of the Norwest
Foundation, which gave $26 million last year to nonprofit
organizations in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, as part of its 1995 merger with First Interstate,
promised to donate $30 million a year to nonprofit groups and loan
$4.5 billion a year for community reinvestments over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong commitment to the communities in which
we serve, and there won't be any changes in our existing
presence,'' said Lisa Rossi, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gnaizda said the Greenlining Institute would meet this month
with Norwest executives to discuss the bank's practices on
community lending and charitable giving.
</P>
<P>
   Recent mergers in the banking industry have led to growing
criticism that bigger banks are charging higher fees for checking
and other services that hurt lower and middle-income customers.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest and Wells Fargo executives would not comment on fee
structures, saying it was too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts call Norwest a consumer-friendly bank. It's the
nation's leading mortgage lender, loaning $60 billion last year to
homeowners. Norwest also offers an average of four products per
customer, from checking accounts to home loans. That is more than
any other banking rival.
</P>
<P>
   While investors and executives cash out big-time in the bank
megadeals, evidence is growing that small businesses and consumers
may lose out. Mergers often mean poorer service and higher prices
for bank customers, according to consumer advocates and
congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Reserve study last year showed that savings enjoyed by
bigger banks when they merge have not been passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Product and service fees charged by multistate banks are
``significantly higher'' than fees charged by banks doing business
in only one state, according to the Fed study.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts and executives at Wells Fargo
and Norwest predict that the merger should have no trouble clearing
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing off on mergers, the government looks at three
elements: the banks' financial resources, the antitrust issues and
the banks' performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, which
requires banks to provide services to all communities, including
poorer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Both banks are strong financially. To appease the Justice
Department on antitrust grounds, the banks may have to shed some
branches in the Southwest. On Community Reinvestment Act matters,
both banks are rated ``outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer watchdogs hope that Norwest's entry into California
will heighten market competition among the state's big banks and
savings and loan institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so much industry consolidation, my long-term fear is
consumers will have less choices and less diversity in services,''
said Ken McEldowney of Consumers Union in San Francisco. ``I hope
to see more aggressive competition for customers' accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo has century-old business roots in the West and a
well-known market brand with its familiar stagecoach logo. The bank
also is strong in commercial lending, automated teller machines,
supermarket banking and on-line banking.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest is a respected, fast-growing community bank that
specializes in consumer finance. The bank is the nation's largest
mortgage lender, operating mostly in the Midwest and Southwest.

<P>
   PARIS _ Every two or three weeks in a refrigerated warehouse at
Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, a man in a white
laboratory coat lifts live turbot out of a cold seawater tank and
lays them, one by one, into dry styrofoam boxes. The fish lie
almost completely still, but they are very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, 108 of the flat, spotted brown fish are packed
and sealed into boxes and whisked onto a plane. Roughly 18 hours
later, they arrive in Tokyo, where a refrigerated truck waits.
While passengers stumble off groggy and tired, the turbot, cool and
well rested, slip into tanks and, as if touched by a magic spell,
flutter back to life.
</P>
<P>
   But as incredible as their revival is, it is brief. The turbot
are headed to restaurants around the city, where they are likely to
become part of the menu before the day is over.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with the freshest possible ingredients has reached
a new extreme. France Turbot, a fishery in western France, is the
first company in the world to ship live fish out of water to
destinations like Hong Kong, Tokyo and, just last week, Boston. But
others may soon follow in the wake of its success, including the
Browne Trading Co., a fish purveyor in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Live fish does not come cheap. In the United States, it costs
more than twice as much as dead, freshly caught fish _ in the case
of turbot, about $17 a pound wholesale, compared with $8 a pound.
But, says Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef at Jean Georges in
Manhattan, the difference in taste is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's alive,'' he said, ``it's like a raw oyster. It has
an algae flavor. It's totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that the turbot could survive out of water came by
accident at France Turbot, which sits hidden among tall grasses in
the middle of a marsh on Ile de Noirmoutier, an island just off the
coast near Nantes. Workers found that jumpers, or fish that leap
out of the water and land on the side of the concrete tanks, would
sometimes be alive even after a few hours. Researchers at the
company chalked up the turbot's resilience to its natural habitat
in coastal waters close to the ocean floor, which can sometimes dry
up at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   The company was already transporting live fish _ in seawater
tanks on trucks _ across Europe, so it began experimenting in 1992.
But it took almost six years to figure out how to ship the fish
without water.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting technique is surprisingly straightforward. The
process begins at the fishery, where the fish are not fed for
nearly a week, while the temperature of the water in the tanks is
gradually lowered. By shipping time, the water is 37 degrees, and
the fish's metabolism has slowed to such low levels that the fish
are in a hybernationlike state. They lie still on the bottom of the
tank. When the water temperature is this low, the turbot also load
up on oxygen, padding themselves for time out of water. And unlike
some fish, when turbot are out of water, they can absorb up to 40
percent of their oxygen through their skin.
</P>
<P>
   Once researchers understood how to extend the survival time,
they went to work on transporting the fish safely and soundly,
because, said Remi Dhellemmes, a manager at the fishery, ``the
survival rate is due to the lowest stress rate.'' If the stress
level is minimized, he said, so are any effects on the flesh or
sweet, mild flavor of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers spent six months designing a a light styrofoam box
that looks a lot like the pieces used for packing electronic
equipment. Each box holds just two fish _ 1{ to 2 pounds each and
about a foot long. A small compartment on the side holds a handful
of crushed ice to keep the air cool and humid during transport, and
space above and below the fish keeps oxygen circulating.
</P>
<P>
   France Turbot has been able to keep some turbot alive for 40
hours out of water, but its goal is less ambitious. It would rather
guarantee a 100 percent survival rate after 24 hours, so that the
fish can easily make the 18-hour journey from Paris to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fish are taken from water, timing is crucial. They are
swiftly transported in water tanks to Charles de Gaulle Airport _
about a five-hour drive from Noirmoutier. There, in their sort of
suspended animation, they are carefully positioned in the styrofoam
boxes, stacked inside a plastic-lined cardboard box and sealed,
much as a gift would be packed up to be sent in the mail. Then it
is a mad dash to the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The first overseas shipment was last December. It went to Tokyo.
In Japan, where live fish is practically all that is sold,
importers were equipped for handling the turbot once they arrived
at the airport. The business took off at once, and now France
Turbot is shipping a total of about 1,000 pounds of live turbot to
Tokyo and Hong Kong every two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such success has moved the company to experiment with other fish
and shellfish. Crabs and eel will probably be next, Dhellemmes
said, because they are sturdy enough to withstand the trip
overseas. But not all fish can be shipped this way. In tests on
wild Dover sole, for instance, 1 of 20 were alive after about 24
hours out of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that fish caught at sea is always a little
damaged, and they're not used to shipping conditions,'' Dhellemmes
said. ``So they die in transport.''
</P>
<P>
   And high-activity fish like sea bass and salmon consume their
oxygen too quickly to survive the long transport.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping this way is so expensive that it has to be foolproof.
Chefs and purveyors, though, seem willing to brush aside the cost
for the sake of a fresher product. Rod Mitchell, the director of
Browne Trading Co. in Portland, Me., who imported live turbot for
the first time last week, has his own plans for the live fish
business. He is constructing a tank system like the one used by
France Turbot, and he plans to ship local fish to restaurants
across the country by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The demand, so far, is almost entirely from Asian restaurants,
where fresh fish means live fish. He is hoping that American and
French restaurants will come to the same conclusion. ``It's going
to take a lot of convincing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But Vongerichten, who started buying locally caught live
fish from New York Fish House in Elizabeth, N.J., three weeks ago,
said he may begin buying the live turbot, too.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has used black sea bass, fluke and sea robin at the
restaurant. The fish arrive in styrofoam boxes filled with water
and oxygen, and because the restaurant does not have seawater
tanks, they are killed and filleted right away. Diners eating the
fluke, Vongerichten said, ``thought it was Dover sole because it
was so firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all chefs, though, are sold on the idea of live fish. ``I'm
not interested in it,'' said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin
in Manhattan. ``The fish we receive here was in the water, what,
yesterday,'' he said. ``And I think it is extremely fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of flavor,'' he added, ``I challenge anyone to prove
to me live fish is better than one caught yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the future for live fish sales in the United States is
unclear. But France Turbot is getting a good start.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the company packed up 20 cool, sleepy turbot for
the first trial shipment to the United States. The fish were loaded
onto an American Airlines jet in Paris in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., they arrived at Logan International Airport in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m., Mitchell was lifting them from their boxes at the
Imperial Seafood Restaurant on Beach Street in Boston's Chinatown.
They were moist and cool and ready to move. The fish flipped and
twisted in his hand, and the instant they hit the water they
fluttered their fins and waved their bodies, moving like racehorses
out of the start. All 20 revived.
</P>
<P>
   But soon their number was 19. Albert Leung, one of the owners of
the restaurant, took one to the kitchen, where it was cleaned and
scaled, sprinkled with fresh ginger and gently steamed. He topped
it with shredded scallions, a few drops of hot oil, soy sauce and
nothing more. The flesh was pleasantly firm, sweet and saline, and
yes, completely different from turbot a day or two old.
</P>
<P>
   Ripert has at least one challenger. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York pizza is a phrase synonymous with pizza
greatness, yet for years New Yorkers could find the genuine article
in only a few isolated spots. Now pizza lovers can rejoice: the
true New York pizza is back in town.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the by-the-slice pies congealing in
neighborhood display windows as they await reheating, or the sodden
boxes delivered to the door.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about classic New York pizza: pies cooked quickly in
extremely hot ovens, generally coal-fired, until the thin crust
achieves a gloriously charred, smoky crispness. The dough is
prepared daily; the mozzarella is real, not packaged; tomatoes are
the best quality, and toppings are simple and used in moderation _
no pineapple or Thai chicken. The pizzas are cooked to order and
never sold by the slice.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 10 years ago, the classic pizza was on the
endangered list, treasured as an artifact of old New York but
bypassed by a culture that preferred its pizzas fast, cheap and
delivered. Just a few pizza landmarks, most famously John's
Pizzeria on Bleecker Street, Patsy's Pizza in East Harlem and
Totonno's Pizzeria Napolitano in Coney Island _ all presided over
by rival clans _ zealously preserved the traditions. Disciples were
required to make pilgrimages to these hallowed halls for a taste.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those three families, plus a newcomer, are almost
entirely responsible for a pizza renaissance in New York. The
landmarks have been joined by a new set of great names: Grimaldi's
under the Brooklyn Bridge; Lombardi's on Spring Street; Nick's in
Forest Hills, Queens, and Rockville Centre, on Long Island; Candido
on the Upper East Side; Polistina's on the Upper West Side; Zito's
in the East Village and, most recently, Angelo's on West 57th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the landmarks have themselves branched out. There
are now John's, Patsy's and Totonno's in many Manhattan
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Why the renaissance? It's driven, I think, by the same sense of
renewed connoisseurship that gave rise to the microbrewery boom,
for example. And, as with the ponds of microbrews measured against
oceans of Budweiser, it's easy to forget that the number of classic
pizzerias amounts to no more than a leaf of fresh basil in a sea of
canned tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   At its highest level, pizza making is a labor-intensive
artisanal craft requiring dedication and training. The coal ovens,
more than twice as hot as the gas oven at the corner pizzeria,
demand an apprenticeship to master their intricacies. Good pizza
makers, or ``stick men,'' are artists, shifting and moving the pies
within the oven as they cook, equalizing the effects of hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Ferreting out the freshest mozzarella cheese, building
relationships with tomato suppliers and sausage makers, starting
dough fresh each day, rather than in advance, being willing to
jettison ingredients past their prime _ all this takes rare
dedication when it's so much easier to buy long-lasting
factory-made mozzarella, or make a week's supply of dough and
freeze it.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental regulations also make it hard to build new coal
ovens. Nowadays in New York City, coal ovens can only be rebuilt or
replaced under an environmental grandfather clause _ not installed
from scratch. Pizza makers have become architectural historians,
seeking out spaces that once housed a coal-burning oven, like old
bakeries or restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The determination to make pizza the hard way seems to come from
being born and bred into a pizza-making tradition.
</P>
<P>
   New York pizza did not exist before 1905, when Gennaro Lombardi,
a Neapolitan immigrant, began to sell pies in his grocery store in
Little Italy. Lombardi's was by most accounts the first New York
pizzeria, and Lombardi, who hired and trained a series of other
immigrants, became the sturdy tap root of a tree of family and
acquaintances that would go on to define great New York pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary pizza makers _ John Sasso of John's, Patsy
Lancieri of Patsy's and Anthony (Totonno) Pero of Totonno's _ are
all said to have learned their craft at Lombardi's brick-walled
coal oven. Nearly a century later, their descendants, including
Lombardi's grandson, are fueling the expansion. New York's pizza
dynasties are now in their third and fourth generations, and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lot of the energy has come from new blood, the
Angelis-Tsoulos clan, which joined the pizza pantheon just a few
years ago. In 1994, Nick Angelis, the son of a Greek pizza maker
who learned the art in Naples, opened Nick's Pizza in Forest Hills.
It is dedicated to preserving the tradition of New York's great pie
men. Paradoxically, he uses a new kind of gas oven that can achieve
the high heat necessary for the best pies. No matter. It's hard to
imagine a better crust than Nick's: blackened and barely crisp,
glistening and golden, with a faintly smoky flavor. The crust is
matched by the other ingredients: pure, creamy mozzarella,
delicious roasted peppers, terrific sausage. Angelis has since
opened a second branch in Rockville Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nick Tsoulos, his brother-in-law, seeing how well
Angelis was doing, decided to bring such a pizzeria to Manhattan.
He made an arrangement with the owners of the East Harlem Patsy's
to use that name and in 1995 opened Patsy's Pizza at 509 Third
Ave., near 34th Street. The smooth, blackened crust lacks that
classic smoky flavor, but the toppings are superb: wonderfully
mellow mozzarella and excellent sauce made of plum tomatoes. The
three other Patsy's that have since opened in Manhattan are just as
good.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the clan combined forces and opened Angelo's at 117 W.
57th Street, named after Angelis' father and run by Nick and John
Pashalis, Angelis' cousins. The pizzas are excellent, very much
like the Patsy's pies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, these new pizzerias have heightened tensions
among old-line pizza dynasties, which regard one other with all the
sunny warmth of rival boxing promoters. Yet, faced with newcomers,
they band together with a universal sneer at Angelis and Tsoulos as
imitators.
</P>
<P>
   More serious is the battle over the name Patsy's. The original
Patsy died in the 1970s, and his widow sold the East Harlem
pizzeria to longtime employees in 1991, to the chagrin of Patsy
Grimaldi, her nephew, who opened a Patsy's in Brooklyn in 1990. He
got even angrier when the Tsoulos Patsy's began to open in
Manhattan. Finally, in a fit of independence _ not, he insists,
through any legal coercion _ he changed the name of his pizzeria to
Grimaldi's. Nor is there any love lost between the East Harlem
Patsy's and all the others.
</P>
<P>
   If the mantle of Patsy Lancieri were awarded on quality alone,
Grimaldi's, at 19 Old Fulton St., near Front Street, under the
Brooklyn Bridge, would win hands down. The crust, bready and dense,
is excellent, and the fragrant tomato sauce, the fresh mozzarella
and the home-roasted peppers are spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the original Patsy's, in a picturesque storefront in a
remnant of an Italian neighborhood at 2287-91 First Avenue, near
118th Street, has not kept up with its estranged cousins. The pizza
is good, but the crust lacks snap, and the flavors lack liveliness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New York is not the only place that has given its name to a
style of pizza. Following are some others.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, CONN.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven's claim to pizza fame is the clam pie. As made at
Frank Pepe's, it is elemental and delicious: whole clams with
garlic, olive oil and oregano, on a thin, brittle crust. Many New
Haven pizzerias call their pies ``apizza,'' pronounced a-BEETS.
Jesse Sheidlower, a slang specialist in the reference division of
Random House, suggests that comes from a dialect spoken in Catania
in Sicily, where Frank Pepe was from. In Manhattan, Lombardi's at
32 Spring St., serves a superb version.
</P>
<P>
   NEAPOLITAN
</P>
<P>
   Pizzas made according to the rules of the Naples Pizza
Association, a trade group based in Italy, are different from New
York pies. They are smaller, 9 to 10 inches in diameter, and the
crust is softer and breadier than the crisp New York version.
Neapolitan pizzas must also be made with buffalo mozzarella, San
Marzano tomatoes and a special flour, and must be cooked in a
wood-burning oven. In New York, La Pizza Fresca at 31 E. 20th St.,
is one of only two restaurants in the United States to receive the
association's certificate of authenticity. Many designer pizzas
made in fancy restaurants are closer to Neapolitan pizza than to
New York pizza.
</P>
<P>
   SICILIAN
</P>
<P>
   These pizzas, traditionally rectangular, are significantly
thicker than the Neapolitan versions, with typically puffy,
breadlike dough. In New York, Sicilian pizza can be sampled at
Matese Pizzeria, 26-15 Francis Lewis Boulevard, Whitestone, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   Deep-dish pizzas as made famous by the original Pizzeria Uno and
still served at the chain are Chicago's signature. They are
characterized by thick, bready crusts and chunky toppings, and may
be derived from Sicilian pizza. Chicago pizzas have become baroque,
with double crusts encasing all manner of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles chef Wolfgang Puck must take both the credit and the
blame for California pizza. In his hands, crisp, thin-crusted pizza
became a vehicle for unusual and delicious toppings like duck
sausage and goat-cheese-and-sun-dried-tomato. But in less tasteful
hands, the California pizza has become a cliche for bad marriages,
like ham and pineapple. California Pizza Kitchen, 201 E. 60th St.,
serves many examples of the genre.

A TART THAT GIVES CHOCOLATE AND BOOZY CHERRIES EQUAL BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the seventh of eight columns by Daniel Boulud, the chef
and owner of Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan. His collaborator on
these columns is Dorie Greenspan.) 
 (HLW)  
 By DANIEL BOULUD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I was a kid, I was forbidden to drink alcohol
but was allowed to eat Mon Cheri, a chocolate-cherry candy that
tasted boozy and made me feel like a grown-up. This
cherry-chocolate tart, with its cherries poached in port, is
definitely not kid stuff, but it was inspired by those foil-wrapped
candies of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The tart has three elements: a cocoa crust, cherries and a soft,
sensuous milk-chocolate filling. The challenge was to keep the
chocolate intense without letting it overwhelm the cherries.
</P>
<P>
   The crust was easy. I wanted it to have a full flavor (that is
why I based it on bitter cocoa powder), a crisp texture and a quiet
personality. The crust had to be a supporting player in every sense
of the word, and because it is not too sweet, it is.
</P>
<P>
   But chocolate is a notorious scene stealer. So I gave the
cherries the extra complexity they needed by poaching them in a
citrus-infused port. Cherries have a resilient firmness and their
own sweet, ever-so-slightly acidic taste. Poaching softened their
texture; using port gave them a deeper flavor, and tossing in an
orange added zing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus fortified, these cherries might have been a match for many
chocolates, but I chose companionable milk chocolate. When you
taste this tart, half the experience is cherries, half chocolate.
And to make certain the textures would be equally harmonious, I
decided on a satiny filling, a cross between a custard and a flan.
It is made with a runny ganache: a mixture of cream and chocolate
that's bound with eggs. Baked slowly in a moderately low oven, it
retains a silkiness that's the right counterpoint to the crisp
crust and semisoft cherries.
</P>
<P>
   I make miniature versions of this dessert at the restaurant, but
at home I serve a family-size tart. If you want, you can boil down
the leftover poaching mixture until it's thick enough to be poured
as a sauce (it's too good to waste) and serve it alongside the
tart.
</P>
<P>
   MILK CHOCOLATE AND CHERRY TART
</P>
<P>
   Time: 3 hours
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces, at room
temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ruby port
</P>
<P>
   4{ tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   { vanilla bean, split lengthwise and scraped
</P>
<P>
   1 thin strip of orange zest (all pith removed)
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 orange
</P>
<P>
   { pound cherries, halved and pitted
</P>
<P>
   4{ ounces high-quality milk chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of finely grated orange zest
</P>
<P>
   Unsweetened whipped cream, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small bowl, lightly beat 1 egg, and set aside. In the
bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, combine butter
pieces, confectioners' sugar, flour and cocoa. Mix on low speed
until crumbly. Add the beaten egg, and mix until the dough comes
together in a ball.
</P>
<P>
   2. Divide dough in half, and shape into disks. Wrap in plastic,
and refrigerate one piece for at least one hour, or overnight.
(Freeze the other disk for another tart; it is necessary to make
the full quantity of dough to achieve the proper consistency.)
</P>
<P>
   3. While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a small
saucepan, combine ruby port, 1 tablespoon sugar, vanilla bean,
strip of orange zest and juice. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and
simmer 10 minutes. Add cherries, bring back to a boil, then reduce
heat and simmer 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and cool to room
temperature. Drain cherries, reserving the port mixture, and pat
dry between paper towels. To make a sauce, strain the mixture into
a small pan, and boil down to a glaze; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch-round,
1\-inch-deep fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. On a lightly
floured surface, roll dough to a thickness of [ inch. Fit dough
into pan, and trim excess even with the rim. Line the dough with
parchment paper or foil, and fill with dry beans or rice. Bake
until firm but not fully baked, 13 to 15 minutes. Remove the paper
and beans, and cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   5. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Place chocolate in a
large heatproof mixing bowl. In a small saucepan, combine cream and
remaining 3{ tablespoons sugar. Bring to a boil, and immediately
add to the bowl of chocolate. Whisk until smooth. Add remaining 2
eggs, one at a time, whisking until smooth. Stir in grated orange
zest.
</P>
<P>
   6. To assemble, place the crust on a baking sheet. Arrange the
cherries, cut side down, in the crust. Pour over the chocolate
filling; it will come nearly to the top. Bake until the center of
the tart is gently set, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
Serve drizzled with the port glaze and garnished with whipped
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: one 8-inch tart (8 servings).

   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,

<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree

no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

 &UR; By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

 &UR; By KEITH SCHNEIDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

   &UR; WHY CARE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW C. REVKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

<P>
   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy

of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New

<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

HAVE WHEELS, WILL TRAVEL, EVER LIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I henceforth claim my section of the overhead bin. For too long
I have conceded it to any desperate passenger waddling down the
aisle with an elephant bag and nowhere to stash it.
</P>
<P>
   I have been one of those polite but invisible passengers. With
blind trust that my own bags are checked and stowed in the belly of
the same plane, I proceed right to my seat _ after my zone is
called, of course _ stash my purse and strap down.
</P>
<P>
   Then I check to see what movie's playing and white light the
plane. You know, envision the plane with a protective silver halo.
It's sort of like praying, but a psychic friend once told me about
white-lighting and I like the image.
</P>
<P>
   I am a likeable no-hassle passenger. I listen to the flight
attendants' safety routine. I observe the closest exit sign. I wait
patiently for the drink cart and complimentary peanuts, even when
they are barbecue-flavored sesame sticks.
</P>
<P>
   I let the guy in the seat in front of me lean so far back I end
up smelling of mint shaving gel. The worst offense I have ever
committed in the sky is to stash my gum in the airsick bag which is
all that's left, now that they've sealed up the ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
   I believe when you're airborne you need all the good karma you
can get. If flight attendants gave out stickers I would get a gold
star except that flight attendants never notice people like me.
</P>
<P>
   We are the ones who walk off the plane, thank the crew members
and get a look back like, ``Who are you?''
</P>
<P>
   They notice the others, the ones who require attention, the big
babies who demand playing cards and extra napkins and didn't really
mean to order a veggie plate because now the lasagna with meat
sauce looks good and who, somewhere in the middle of lunch,
proclaims he'll have an anxiety attack if he can't squeeze past the
cart in the aisle and get to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   All that's changed because I have crossed over. I have become
part of the carry-on crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is another part of that lifelong process in becoming an
adult. To finally learn how to live for more than a week out of one
small bag, to get on and off a plane with said bag and not join the
anxious crowd grabbing for the same black bag regurgitated at the
baggage carousel.
</P>
<P>
   I have been flying since flight attendants wore hats, but I have
finally joined the jet set.
</P>
<P>
   It is because I now have wheels. My mobile bag was a gift from
someone who has been lecturing me for years on the hazards of
over-shlepping my bounds. He's right. My arms are tired. I need to
save them for writing stories and pulling radishes and waving
sparklers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides I find I like the image. You should have seen the new
efficient me my last spin through San Francisco International.
</P>
<P>
   I did not have to wait in line. I clipped along so very fine. I
looked like I was very smart. Because my suitcase is a cart.
</P>
<P>
   Only months ago I was a disheveled traveler. The kind that
flails and bumps along wild-eyed and overloaded through airport and
hotel lobby and along streets in faraway cities with no cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Coat askew, straps cutting into my shoulder, tote bags dangling
from my elbow, banging into strangers, clutching something in each
hand, tickets in an unknown pocket or between my teeth and with so
many pieces of baggage thumping my thighs, I was black and blue
before I unpacked.
</P>
<P>
   Now I walk through the airport calm and cool, like I've got no
more than a poodle on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a place for my newspaper and my tickets and a little
thing to attach to a book bag. All that's missing is a drink
holder.
</P>
<P>
   I, however, promise not to become one of those aisle jammers who
makes her bags her neighbor's burden like the woman on a flight
from Los Angeles who attempted to wrestle her two massive duffels
into the bin by balancing on an armrest and falling back onto the
head of the man in the next seat.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases flight attendants are like traffic cops, never
there when you need them to make a bust. Clearly, the offender's
bags exceeded the dimensions of a legal carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   I always wonder why men, limited to two carry-ons _ say, a suit
bag and a briefcase _ don't protest women boarding with their two
plus a purse that's big enough to hold a bottle of mineral water,
guidebook, extra socks and complete makeup supplies for a midflight
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't want to start anything.

<P>
   GLENNVILLE , Ga. _ In springtime, you know you're in Vidalia
country without reading the signs. As soon as you leave the piney
woods of Fort Stewart, the Army base where American troops trained
for the Persian Gulf war, you come upon an amazing sight: row after
row of burlap bags stretching across the sandy fields as far as the
eye can see, full of onions drying in the Georgia sun.
</P>
<P>
   A local curiosity only 25 years ago, Vidalia onions have joined
the ranks of seasonal foods keenly awaited by American consumers.
The name is protected by law now, like that of Bresse chickens or
Coca-Cola. Vidalias can be grown only in the distinctive soil of 13
contiguous counties between Macon and Savannah in southeast
Georgia, plus parts of seven others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the total yield from 15,800 acres was 3.5 million
pounds, worth $89 million _ big money in a rural, historically poor
area where crossroads hamlets bear names like Daisy, Hopeulikit and
Ohoopee.
</P>
<P>
   People have eaten onions since antiquity; according to some
historians, the ancient Egyptians worshiped them. Robert Courtine,
the great French epicure, called the onion ``the truffle of the
poor,'' though the rich could hardly do without them, either. They
have only one flaw: eaten raw, they upset delicate digestions, and
their pungency lingers unalluringly on the breath.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Swift understood the problem perfectly:
</P>
<P>
   There is, in every cook's opinion,
</P>
<P>
   No savory dish without an onion;
</P>
<P>
   But lest your kissing should be spoiled
</P>
<P>
   The onion must be thoroughly boiled.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the onion in question is a Vidalia onion, named for the
small town from which the first Vidalias were shipped several
decades ago. Squat and thin-skinned, remarkably juicy and pale
ivory in color, Vidalias are sweet when raw, sweet when cooked and
succulent either way.
</P>
<P>
   Vidalias are to run-of-the-mill onions as foie gras is to
chopped liver, although it is the humble yellow or Spanish onion
that provides the deep, rich base for a thousand and one down-home
stews, braises and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Bake Vidalias in a covered dish with herbs, olive oil and
balsamic vinegar; slice them in an onion, tomato and basil salad;
make a raw onion sandwich, or prepare something elaborate, like the
Vidalias stuffed with spicy sausage and topped with a cheese sauce
that have been a spring tradition for years at Elizabeth Terry's
award-winning restaurant in Savannah, Elizabeth on 37th.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bubin named his restaurant for them. At Vidalia, in
Washington, he goes through 20,000 to 30,000 pounds of sweet onions
a year, he said, using them in the marmalade that he puts on every
table; in his trademark baked onion recipe; in a dish of shrimp and
grits with caramelized onions, and even in an onion and black
pepper pound cake. When no Vidalias are available, he brings in
sweet onions from farther south, usually from Guatemala or Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing comes close to Vidalias,'' Bubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Vidalia onions are grown from yellow Granex or Granex hybrid
seed. But this is one case where the environment matters more than
the lineage.
</P>
<P>
   William Randle, a professor of horticulture at the University of
Georgia at Athens, said the sandy, loamy soil found in parts of
southeast Georgia has a remarkably low sulfur content. Since sulfur
generates pungency in onions (and in their relatives shallots and
garlic), low sulfur means sweet onions. In addition, he said,
temperatures hereabouts are ideal _ above freezing during the
winter, then hot but not too hot in the spring, when heat is needed
for the rapid formation of the underground bulb on the onion plant.
</P>
<P>
   Similar conditions in other parts of the country enable farmers
there to grow excellent sweet onions, too. There are Walla Wallas
from southeast Washington state, Texas 1015's from South Texas,
Mauis from Hawaii and California Imperials from the Imperial
Valley, all produced in smaller quantities than Vidalias.
</P>
<P>
   A Toombs County farmer named Moses Coleman, or so local legend
has it, first noticed the exceptional sweetness of Vidalia onions.
He began growing them commercially in 1931, but the boom did not
begin until years later. There are now more than 150 onion growers
in this region, many of them former tomato farmers who lost their
markets in the early 1970s to Florida competitors who benefited
from a growing season that started earlier and lasted longer.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the producers, Elizabeth Terry and others here say,
Delbert Bland deserves the most credit for making the Vidalia onion
what it is today. A lanky, bearded, tobacco-chewing good old boy
who is likely to call a visiting Yankee ``hoss'' on first meeting,
he graduated from high school in 1974, when the local tomato
business was failing. He persuaded his father, Raymond, to try
onions. Their first planting, five acres, was a flop: ``bad yield,
worse sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But they persisted. Raymond Bland worked in the fields, as he
always had; at 71, he still drives a tractor almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke my heart,'' Delbert Bland recalled, ``to see farmers
work hard all year, then take their crops to town and ask the guys
with neckties, `How much will you give me for this?' I didn't want
to live that way.''
</P>
<P>
   So the younger Bland, who is 41, went into sales, much
encouraged by a Wall Street Journal article describing Vidalias as
``the caviar of onions.'' He traveled the country, distributing
samples, tearing out Yellow Pages entries for supermarkets in city
after city, heading back to Glennville and sending off letters
(``badly typed at 12 words a minute,'' he says with calculated
self-mockery) to buyers for supermarket chains, big and small.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in 1983, he took an ad in Southern Living, an eighth
of a page, for $2,700. He sold 1,000 10-pound bags for $12.95
apiece, and a career as a direct marketer was born. Soon Bland
Farms was spending $300,000 a year on ads. Inspired by a similar
label on Florida grapefruit, Bland started affixing a sall decal
to each onion, identifying it as a true Vidalia. He sent 10 pounds
of onions to every food editor in the country, reaping a whirlwind
of free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   And from a student at Duke University who had been running a
modest retail business to help pay his way through school, Delbert
Bland bought the rights to a toll-free number (800-VIDALIA, or
800-843-2542) for a bargain price: $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Bland was puzzled by the merchandising mumbo jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never learned to read and write,'' Bland said. ``He
thinks if you're talking on the phone you're not working. So he
came to me one day and asked me, `Son, if you can get a phone
number free, what are you spending all that money for?'''
</P>
<P>
   He soon had his answer.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1998 crop, Bland Farms planted 2,600 acres in onions,
more than twice as much as any local competitor and almost a fifth
of the entire Georgia crop. Their packing sheds, which cover seven
acres, are the largest of their kind anywhere. At full tilt, Bland
Farms can process 30,000 50-pound bags of Vidalias a day.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is no backwoods enterprise. Planting and harvesting are
planned with the help of data from global positioning satellites.
Farm bosses communicate with walkie-talkies, and when I visited the
Blands in May, the desk of Delbert's wife, Sandra, a snappily
dressed former nurse who manages mail-order sales, held a computer
and the latest issue of Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   Bland onions are sold in all 50 states, in Britain and in
military commissaries around the world. The company mails 2 million
catalogs a year, through which it sells not only onions but baked
goods, relishes and salsas and other onion products. In dollar
volume, it is second only to the Northwest giant Orida in
supermarket sales of frozen onion rings.
</P>
<P>
   With 125 full-time employees and 1,200 or so seasonal helpers,
Bland Farms will gross something in the neighborhood of $30 million
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered that this was the Bible Belt as well as Vidalia
country when I saw the bumper sticker on the back of Delbert
Bland's red Chevy pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Men Love Jesus,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing top-quality onions, Bland explained as we climbed in and
headed toward some of his nearby fields, is a painstaking process.
Seeds are sown by hand in seedbeds in September. Plants are pulled
up in November and December, then dropped by hand into predrilled
holes, 70,000 to an acre, by workers crawling on all fours.
</P>
<P>
   During the cool months, the onion-to-be forms its rings, and
when the first blast of heat hits, sometime in March, the rings
begin growing rapidly. Bland has measured the growth, and he said
an onion swells as much as an eighth of an inch every 24 hours
during the process called ``bulbing.''
</P>
<P>
   At harvest time, a flat blade is drawn under the onions, cutting
them from their roots and forcing them halfway out of the ground.
Then they are picked by hand and dropped into burlap coffee-bean
and potato bags, which are left in the fields to begin the drying
process that makes onions last longer.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the sheds, they are dried some more in warm rooms, then
hand sorted for size and quality. The best go into foam-lined boxes
for mail-order customers, the rest into bags or boxes. Some jumbos
are three inches in diameter, but size, in the experts' judgment,
has no impact on flavor.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one crop a year, harvested in April, May and June.
After that, Bland said, ``the gnats move in and the onions melt in
the heat.'' Soybeans take over most of the fields for the long, hot
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But technology, which Bland likes almost as much as he likes
marketing, has extended the season. A colleague of Randle's named
Doyle Smittle, now retired, adapted a storage technique that apple
growers had used for many years, and Vidalias are now available
from April through October. The growers get twice their spring
prices in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The process is known as ``controlled atmosphere.'' Most of the
oxygen is extracted from huge, thick-walled rooms and replaced with
a mixture containing 92 percent nitrogen at a temperature of 34
degrees and a humidity of 75 percent. Oxygen is what makes onions
rot; nitrogen prevents that.
</P>
<P>
   In a control room nearby, an English-made monitoring system,
which looks sophisticated enough to monitor a space flight,
automatically takes a sample of the air in each room each hour and
sounds an alarm if anything is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Does Delbert mean it, can Delbert possibly mean it, I wonder,
when he says: ``I don't eat onions myself. I'd much rather chew
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   STUFFED VIDALIA ONIONS WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 medium Vidalia onions
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound bulk spicy sausage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh sage
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup grated white Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh orange peel
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced shallot (optional)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup dry white wine or dry vermouth
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced fresh lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   \ cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a kettle of water on high
heat, and bring to a boil. Peel the onions, and cut off 1 inch from
each end. Using a sharp-edged spoon, scoop out the centers of the
onions to within about { inch of the bottom. Reserve the centers of
the onions.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place the onions in a shallow baking dish, drizzle with the
melted butter and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add boiling
water to the baking dish until it is halfway up the sides of the
onions. Cover with a lid or foil, and bake until the onions are
tender, about 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the onions from the
water to an oiled baking sheet, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mince the reserved onion centers. In a medium skillet over
high heat, combine the minced onion, sausage, parsley and sage.
Saute, stirring well to break up and brown the sausage. Drain and
discard the fat. In a mixing bowl, combine the sausage, \ cup of
the cheese and orange peel. Spoon this mixture into the cavity of
each onion, and sprinkle the onions with the remaining cheese; set
aside. Keep the oven hot.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare the lemon butter sauce: In a small saucepan, combine
the olive oil, garlic, shallot, wine, lemon peel and lemon juice.
Bring to a boil and reduce to about 2 tablespoons. Add the cream,
and reduce to about 4 tablespoons. Reduce heat to medium. Whisk in
the cold unsalted butter one piece at a time, until it is melted
and the sauce is thick, about 1 minute. Strain the sauce; keep warm
or it will separate. The sauce may be kept warm in a thermos or
over a pan of hot water for up to 2 hours before serving.
</P>
<P>
   5. Return the onions to the oven until the cheese is melted,
about 5 minutes. To serve, spoon a pool of lemon butter sauce onto
each plate, and top with an onion.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

AMERICAN CHEF ASKED TO OPEN RESTAURANT IN LOUVRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mon Dieu! The mother of modern American cooking has been asked
to open a restaurant at the temple of French culture in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters, whose restaurant in Berkeley, Calif., Chez
Panisse, has become a shrine to American cooking, is to meet in
California Thursday with Helene David-Weill, the chairwoman and
chief executive of the Museum of Decorative Arts of the Louvre, to
discuss plans for the museum's new 330-seat restaurant. The
building in which the museum is housed is being restored, and the
restaurant is scheduled to open at the end of the year 2000. The
restaurant will look out on the Tuileries Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   If the women, both of whom confirmed that the talks began in
December, can come to an agreement, it would mark a triumphant
return to Paris for Ms. Waters. She went to France 35 years ago,
when she was 19, when the French were raising food organically.
Today, many of their crops are heavily sprayed with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived at the bottom of a market street and took all of that
in by osmosis,'' Ms. Waters said. She brought it back to the United
States and opened Chez Panisse, where the cooking with local
ingredients is American with a Provencal emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   She and Mrs. David-Weill share the same philosophy. ``Alice
Waters is the quintessence of taste and savoir-faire,'' she said.
``She searches for perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Were there no French chefs for such an undertaking? Mrs.
David-Weill said she did not find them. ``Probably there are very
good people in France but they didn't come to us,'' said Mrs.
David-Weill, whose husband is the chief executive of Lazard Freres,
the French investment banking firm. ``We thought Alice was very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, when Ms. Waters was in Paris, intermediaries
introduced her to one of Mrs. David-Weill's board members. ``I want
this museum to be international and Alice loves France and
understands the way French people react,'' Mrs. David-Weill said.
``And she wants to come back to France.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview two years ago to mark the 25th anniversary of
her restaurant, Ms. Waters said: ``The act of eating is very
political. You buy from the right people, you support the right
network of farmers and suppliers who care about the land and what
they put in the food. If we don't preserve the natural resources,
you aren't going to have a sustainable society.''
</P>
<P>
   And she added in an interview earlier this week, ``I feel it is
an obligation to help people understand the relation of food to
agriculture and the relationship of food to culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters has also worked on projects with schoolchildren that
dovetail with the museum's education programs. In 1994, she began
the Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley to teach children how to cook and
take care of the land. She envisions the Louvre restaurant as a
place where patrons can talk to the people who are cooking, where
informational cards explain where the food comes from.
</P>
<P>
   In France, a country especially chauvinistic about its food, the
question arises about a foreigner, and an American at that, opening
a restaurant in its cultural treasure. ``I am very happy because I
have heard very good comments about Alice Waters,'' said France's
only six-star chef, Alain Ducasse. He has three stars for his Paris
restaurant, which bears his name, and for his Monaco restaurant, Le
Louis XV. ``All countries know how cooking should be. Twenty-five
years ago, obviously the disparity was greater.'' That said,
Ducasse still thinks ``French chefs are the best technicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Gagnaire, chef and owner of the three-star Paris
restaurant bearing his name, said the choice of Ms. Waters was
``formidable.'' He described Ms. Waters as a ``vraie grande
cuisiniere'' _ a real good cook. Since French chefs are always
exporting themselves, he said, ``why would foreigners not come
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters is sensitive to the idea of an American taking over a
restaurant at the august Louvre. ``I could not do this by myself,''
she said. ``I couldn't possibly do it if there were any kind of
resistance. I would need to have good will.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she plans to use French suppliers and chefs, working
with an advisory committee of friends, including the chef Michel
Troisgros; Lulu Peyraud, the owner of Domaine Tempier, a winery in
Bandol, and the baker Lionel Pouillon. ``My French friends are very
excited,'' she said. ``They are very concerned about the future of
French food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters still considers the possibility of such a
collaboration fantasy. ``The most powerful part for me is the
recognition by the French that Chez Panisse is a good place to be
and to eat,'' she said. ``It just took my breath away. It's the
most extraordinary thing that could happen to you: to be recognized
by people you want to recognize you.''

semantic chaos in specialty produce markets and leaving
adventuresome retailers and cooks searching for words.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive hybrid _ mild, peppery and slightly sweet _ is
basically a baby broccoli. The pale stems are as slim as spears and
rarely exceed six inches long; the head is a loose cluster of
florets that resemble infant broccoli rape.
</P>
<P>
   Its flavor marries well with butter or olive oil, lemon, lime,
light-tasting vinegars, pancetta, prosciutto, tarragon, Parmesan or
fresh goat cheese. And because of its understated flavor, it is a
logical candidate to serve with shellfish and mild-tasting meats
like chicken or veal.
</P>
<P>
   But what to call it? Marketers have tried everything from
brocoletti and broccolini to asprobroc and asprospeer: it's as if
retailers had closed their eyes and pointed to a page of ``What
Shall We Name the Baby?''
</P>
<P>
   Sakata Seed Corp., the Japanese company that developed the
hybrid in 1993, called it aspiration, invoking the company's hopes
while suggesting a relation to asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, when Sakata went into partnership with Mann Packing
Co., a large broccoli producer in Salinas, Calif., the vegetable's
lineage was revealed as slightly more humble. Aspiration, it turns
out, is a cross between broccoli and gai lan, or Chinese broccoli.
Asparagus is not part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Richard Leibowitz, the owner of Culinary Specialty
Produce, a vegetable distributor in Mountainside, N.J., crossing
broccoli with asparagus would be like breeding a chipmunk with a
tree. It can't be done.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz, who also publishes a weekly newsletter for fancy-food
grocers, has followed the naming game. ``My sense is that
broccolini will stick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most vegetable marketers agree. The name broccolini emphasizes
its relationship to broccoli, said Joe Nucci, a spokesman for Mann
Packing. The affectionate diminutive also appeals to the country's
ongoing infatuation with baby vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with conventional broccoli, the edible part is not the
stalk, but only the tender side shoots. Unlike its larger ancestor,
which is harvested once a season, broccolini is harvested five
times a year and is therefore more like a firm, yet pliant sprout.
So, though it has the delicate fresh personality of a spring green,
it is available year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It can do just about anything broccoli can do, while looking
cuter, tasting milder and lasting longer. It is delicious diced,
blanched, cooled and tossed with a lemon vinaigrette, and it is an
affable candidate for stir-frying or sauteeing.
</P>
<P>
   If handled well _ it needs a cool, moist environment _
broccolini will keep for up to 21 days in the refrigerator (in
stores, it's kept pert with crushed ice on top).
</P>
<P>
   This little green is so new to the market and goes by so many
aliases that it can be difficult to find. But the seeds have
already passed from specialty boutique growers to major broccoli
producers. Mann Packing, for instance, currently has 1,000 acres of
broccolini under cultivation and expects to be growing 10,000 acres
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it is available at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third
Ave. (at 71st Street); Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas
(Ninth Street), and Gourmet Garage, 453 Broome St. (Mercer Street).
Like broccoli, it is sold by the bunch, which looks like bouquets
of flowers and ends up costing slightly less than twice the price
of broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, it will be in conventional grocery stores across
the country. And for the moment, at least, it still answers to the
name broccolini.
</P>

LOUIS L'AMOUR: THE PROUST OF THE PRAIRIE GALLOPS ON  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURANGO, Colo. _ If you saw Maggie Rock in a movie, or read
about it in a novel by Louis L'Amour, you would recognize it as the
kind of craggy butte where hostile Indians might gather before
descending on a wagon train in the valley below. But late one
recent afternoon, there were just a couple of casual explorers on
the ridge, one of them Kathy L'Amour, the novelist's widow, who
goes up there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   A fit, lively woman in her 60s who favors embroidered western
shirts and lizard boots, she owns Maggie Rock, along with 1,800
acres of spectacular ranchland near this mountain town in the
southwest corner of the state. She and her husband bought most of
the ranch in 1983 after nearly 20 years of looking for one in the
region where he set some 40 of his 116 books, which have sold an
astounding 250 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a research place for Louis,'' Mrs. L'Amour said.
``There are three Indian tribes _ the Utes, the Navajos and the
Apaches _ in the area. It's cattle country, sheep country, horse
country, mining country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the wind and the darkening sky (nothing to fool
around with at 9,000 feet) chased her back down the precipitous
ridge slope, Mrs. L'Amour remarked on the view _ the magnificent
valley 1,000 feet below, the 19th-century ranch house and barn the
size of matchboxes from this height _ and the life of her husband,
a self-educated man who died 10 years ago today at 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what it was like for him, to go from having
nothing to having this?'' she said. The ranch is a fine symbol of
the empire of Louis (pronounced Louie) L'Amour, the most prolific
and beloved writer of westerns _ ``frontier fiction'' in publishing
parlance _ in American history, though he actually lived most of
the year in Los Angeles. It represents not only the territory he
described in his books but also a piece of the world that was
earned by his labor after spending the first half of his life in
wandering adventures, often in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer size, the ranch suggests the dimensions of L'Amour's
readership: it would take a mammoth basin like this one to hold all
the books he's sold, and maybe they wouldn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers defy belief. The 116 books by Louis L'Amour, most of
them paperback originals, are all in print _ in print! _ from
Bantam Books, his publisher for four decades, the last 16 of them
published since his death. They include 90 novels, 21 short-story
collections, four works of nonfiction and one book of poems,
``Smoke From This Altar,'' which was published first by a tiny
press in Oklahoma in 1939 and reprinted by Bantam in 1990. That is
his least-selling book, with a mere 107,000 copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling book is ``Last of the Breed,'' a contemporary
novel about an American Indian pilot shot down in Siberia. (L'Amour
never felt constrained by the western genre, and he wrote several
books toward the end of his life that were huge crossover
successes, appealing both to his longtime fans and other readers
who never went near a western.) It reached No. 1 on the New York
Times best-seller list in 1986 and has 3.75 million copies in
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he's written on the fiction side has at least 1
million copies in print,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam vice
president who has been L'Amour's publicist since 1975. That does
not include ``Monument Rock,'' a just-published hardcover
short-story collection that had a first printing of 207,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are 190 million copies of L'Amour's novels out there, and
28 million copies of his short-story collections, which probably
makes him the best-selling short-story writer of all time. Perhaps
most remarkable is that although his work has been published in 26
languages over the years, the vast majority of the books, 223
million, have been sold in the United States and Canada. He has
sold close to 40 million books since his death.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A Fearless Omniscience
</P>
<P>
   The attraction? L'Amour's prose does not, of course, rival
Proust's, nor do his characters show too much complexity; the good
guys and the bad guys are pretty clear from the beginning. But the
plots are more or less irresistible, moving to an inevitable
gunfight; the hardscrabble territory of the 19th-century West is
described with authenticity, and the frontier virtues (hard work,
perseverance, tenacity and skill in outdoor survival) are earnestly
espoused. He wrote with a fearless omniscience, entering the minds
of cowboys and Indians, sheriffs and cattle rustlers, women,
children and even animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hungry, and he wanted meat,'' he wrote of a grizzly
bear in a 1968 novel, ``Down the Long Hills,'' ``and there were,
too, other possibilities of food where the man-smell was. He had
raided camps before this and gotten away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But L'Amour never wrote about sex.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Education of a Wandering Man,'' an autobiographical volume
that was the last book he finished, he explained: ``I am not
writing about sex, which is a leisure activity. I am writing about
men and women who were settling a new country, finding their way
through a maze of difficulties and learning to survive despite
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was, in other words, the kind of writer that Republican
presidents devour, that soldiers read in foxholes, that sixth
graders deconstruct in book reports. Letters from fans indicate
that many people would never read at all if it weren't for Louis
L'Amour. Aside from Stephen King, he may be the only writer with
his own personal book-of-the-month club; each month, subscribers
get a different leatherbound volume, and by now, some 25,000 people
have them all: 10 years' worth of L'Amour books. And though critics
have not been overly kind to L'Amour, he has his literary admirers,
including the novelist Louise Erdrich and Daniel Boorstin, the
historian and former Librarian of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told a good story,'' said Beau L'Amour, the writer's
son, who is working on a biography that will concentrate on the
peripatetic years that his father referred to as his ``yondering''
days. ``And the western provides a great format for looking at our
society, how we got here. What happened on the frontier has a lot
to say about who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. L'Amour and Beau are the caretakers of the L'Amour oeuvre,
which continues to grow. After his father's death, Beau, now 37,
discovered boxes of unpublished stories from the 1950s among his
papers; ``Monument Rock'' is the third volume of those to be
published. Three more are to follow, one each June, and they
include not just western stories but sea stories, boxing stories
and mysteries, among the many genres L'Amour took on when he was
scrambling to make a living selling short stories to pulp
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Unpublished Novel, But It's Rough
</P>
<P>
   These went unpublished, Beau theorized, because as the pulps
began to dwindle, it became harder to publish stories. At the same
time, the paperback original emerged, and his father, always
concerned with making a living, went the route that would earn him
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a novel,'' Beau said, speaking by phone from Los
Angeles, ``though it's a draft that's quite rough. It's a '50s
adventure story set in Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis L'Amour was born in Jamestown, N.D., in 1908, the youngest
of seven children. His father, a Canadian (he changed the family
name to LaMoore; Louis eventually changed it back), was a
veterinarian and farm machinery salesman who, after a series of
local bank failures, moved the family to the Southwest in 1923.
Louis split from his parents to visit an older brother in Oklahoma,
and that started nearly three decades of wandering.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the circus, worked on ships and in mines, and became a
professional boxer, reading voraciously and writing when he could.
He served in Europe in World War II, and when he returned, he
settled in Los Angeles and began sending story after story to the
pulp magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy L'Amour was 20 when she met her future husband in 1952;
she went on a double date with a woman in her acting class. The
other woman was Julie Newmar, who would go on to become, among
other things, Catwoman on the ``Batman'' television series. Ms.
Newmar's date, later her fiance, was Louis L'Amour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went to New York,'' recalled Mrs. L'Amour, who still has
the sparkling smile and coquettish manner of a young actress of
that era. (She appeared in episodes of ``Death Valley Days'' and
``Gunsmoke.'') ``And they became disengaged. And one day, I was
driving down the street, and he was buying a newspaper on Sunset
Boulevard. And I stopped and said, `I don't know if you'll remember
me,' and he said, `I've been looking everywhere for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in February 1956, and until he died she was
his personal assistant as well as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really loved to write, and he felt he wrote best when he
wrote a lot,'' she said. Once, she said, considering a move from an
electric typewriter to a computer, he was told by Beau that it
would take him six weeks to get accustomed to it, so he decided
against the switch, reasoning it would cost him an entire book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the clack clack clack,'' Mrs. L'Amour said. ``He loved
to be at the typewriter, and I did the things that allowed him to
do that. He never paid a bill, never wrote a check. And I drove him
everywhere. He didn't drive. In return, he gave me this incredible
life.''
</P>
<P>
   L'Amour died of lung cancer, although he never smoked. One
theory, Mrs. L'Amour said, was that the cause was mica dust left in
his lungs from his days as a young man in the mines. But he was
robust virtually to the end. Standing just below Maggie Rock, Mrs.
L'Amour recalled the day her husband, in his late 70s, climbed
alone up the steep, thickly wooded ridge from the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just never occurred to me that I'd be here, and Louis
wouldn't be here,'' she said. ``That's how dumb I am. That it's 10
years since he's gone, that he's still selling so many books, it's
more of a publishing event than a personal one. I miss him every
day.''

THE PERIL OF TAMPERING WITH WINE-BUYERS' ILLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (mk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine scandals are few and far between in Bordeaux but when they
occur, as in the current crisis involving Chateau Giscours, they
become major events, not just in France but worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What piques public interest is not so much the numbers _ in this
instance, some 1,600 cases of Giscours' second-tier wine _ but the
irony. The Bordeaux wine trade fosters an image of itself as an
elite group, removed from the tawdry machinations of the
marketplace and governed by an old-fashioned code of honor. Because
of this unified image, trouble, even at only one chateau, resounds
throughout the region. When one chateau sneezes, all of Bordeaux
catches cold.
</P>
<P>
   By now most of the wine world is aware of the charges of
fraudulent winemaking leveled last week against Chateau Giscours, a
third growth in the 1855 classification of Bordeaux chateaus, and
one of the largest wine estates in the Bordeaux region. Giscours is
in the commune of Labarde, about 20 miles north of the city of
Bordeaux and a part of the famous Margaux wine district.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeaux prosecutors, acting on information supplied by
government fraud inspectors, have indicted two of the chateau's
employees, an enologist and the former cellar master who now lives
in Lebanon, and charged that under their direction, Chateau
Giscours engaged in fraudulent practices. These include mixing the
chateau's wine with cheaper wine from another district, mixing one
vintage with another and treating the wine with wood chips to
simulate barrel aging. Also, the indictments claim, sugar was added
to boost the wine's alcoholic content, and at one time or another,
water, milk or acid, to stretch the wine and to improve its bouquet
and taste.
</P>
<P>
   While the indictments mention only one vintage, 1995, French
press reports said that the investigation had been under way for
two years and that the inspectors had determined there had been a
pattern of fraud over an unspecified period of time. The inquiry
became public last week, just as prices for 1997 Bordeaux wines
were being released for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The current owner of the vineyards and winery, a Dutch investor
named Eric Albada Jelgersma, said the charges had been exaggerated.
He added that he had been unaware of what was happening and would
buy back any of the wine cited, the chateau's 1995 second wine, La
Sirene de Giscours. Still to be determined is the impact of
Giscours' problems on the rest of the Bordeaux market _ and on the
public trust.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions in the wine trade ranged from anger to dismay as in
recent weeks, one chateau after another has announced prices for
the wines of 1997, a good but unexceptional vintage, that are up to
25 percent higher than those for 1996. In New York, Michael Aaron,
chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, a major retailer, announced that he
would not offer future contracts for the 1997s.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated wine enthusiasts customarily buy future contracts;
that is, they pay for a wine two years before it is aged, bottled
and released, in expectation that its price will escalate by the
time it is shipped. ``Even though we will be obliged to purchase
some 1997s,'' Aaron said, ``we feel that offering futures on these
wines is not in the interest of our clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the 1997s, unlike some previous, highly praised
vintages, are unlikely to increase in value over the next two
years. Current prices for Bordeaux wines are at levels unimaginable
even a decade ago. The 1997 opening price of Chateau Margaux, one
of the five so-called first growths of Bordeaux, announced last
month was 600 francs, or more than $100 a bottle, which translates
into a retail price of around $200.
</P>
<P>
   As always happens at or near the peak of the Bordeaux price
cycle, the chateau owners and Bordeaux exporters are being accused
of avarice and greed. And since such astronomical price levels have
little to do with the intrinsic quality of the wine and everything
to do with demand, any bad news might bring down the whole shaky
edifice.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the system so fragile is the fact that it is based on
trust. Many fine wines are bought by people who know little about
the subject but assume that a famous label and high price insure
the best. Often, they have no interest in drinking the wine; they
hold it, hoping to sell at an even higher price a few years later.
Bordeaux tampers with their illusions at its peril.
</P>
<P>
   There are inevitable _ and ominous _ parallels between the
current Bordeaux market and the market in the 1970s. In 1974, after
the prestigous firm of Cruse &AMP; Fils Freres had been found guilty of
similar charges _ vats in their cellars were found with labels
``can be used as Beaujolais in the U.S.'' _ the entire Bordeaux
market collapsed. Big exporting firms went bankrupt; great chateaus
were sold for pittances, their cellars clogged with unwanted wine.
Distributors and retailers in this country who had invested heavily
in the mediocre 1971 vintage and the poor 1972s lost sizable sums.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, it seemed, no one was interested in Bordeaux and its
wines. The Bordeaux market did not fully recover until the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is important because it's not particularly difficult to do
what Giscours is accused of doing. A connoisseur might recognize
the deception; hardly anyone else would. Many cellar techniques can
be artificially replicated, which means that illegal activities are
often difficult to detect. Several Bordeaux chateau owners
maintained that the charges against Giscours were an indication
that the anti-fraud laws worked. In fact, most wine fraud
investigations stem from tips from disgruntled employees and
suspicious (or jealous) competitors. In Giscours' case, it was one
or more former employees who called in the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Many techniques banned in Bordeaux are permissible in other
countries and even in other parts of France. Using oak chips or
staves is common for inexpensive California wines; using sugar to
boost alcoholic content is legal in Burgundy, and the use of acid,
which adds zest to wines, is common in hot countries. Citric acids
are used in California.

</P>
<P>
   Jelgersma, the owner of the vineyards at Chateau Giscours, noted
last week that only a small amount of wine from outside the Margaux
boundaries had been used and that it had gone only into the
chateau's second wine. Many Bordeaux chateaus bottle the wine from
their less impressive vats and from younger vines separately under
a second label.
</P>
<P>
   Jelgersma said that the illegal wine in the blend cited by the
prosecutors actually came from two Giscours vineyards just over the
line from the commune of Margaux. Giscours wines are entitled to
use the Margaux name on their labels. Wines from the two other
vineyard are entitled only to be listed as coming from the
Haut-Medoc, a less prestigious name.
</P>
<P>
   Jelgersma is referred to as the owner of Giscours; exactly what
he owns is unclear. Apparently, he owns the right to make the wine
but not the vineyards or the chateau. They still belong to the Tari
family, which bought the estate in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, dissension among the Taris, exacerbated by
financial problems, had its effect on the wine. In 1995, Jelgersma
bought the production rights from Pierre Tari, who had succeeded
his father, Nicolas, as director of Giscours. The Taris have spent
much of the last five years fighting each other in the Bordeaux
courts.
</P>
<P>
   One Bordeaux figure, Bruno Borie, whose family owns Chateau
Ducru-Beaucaillou in St. Julien, saw darker elements at work.
``It's no coincidence that this story broke just when Bordeaux was
enjoying considerable prosperity,'' he said. ``That it broke during
a controversy over the 1997 prices, that it broke just as the press
of the world was descending on France _ and particularly on
Bordeaux _ for the World Cup, that it appeared first in Le Monde
rather than in the Sud-Ouest'' _ the leftist Paris newspaper rather
than in the possibly more understanding Bordeaux daily _ ``and that
it appeared on a national holiday'' _ June 1 _ ``when journalists
had little chance to check facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing about Chateau Giscours earlier this year, France's
best-known wine critic, Michel Bettane, observed: ``Little by
little, in the 1980s, the wine lost its reputation, even as nature
supplied us with a series of very great vintages. At present,
internal discord has completely paralyzed the evolution'' of the
Giscours wine.

   Clusters of heavy showers and thunderstorms will douse parts of
the central Mississippi, Tennessee and lower Ohio River valleys
Wednesday. Storms will erupt as humid air 2,000 feet above the
ground racing north at almost 60 mph from the Gulf of Mexico is
lifted by a jet stream disturbance arriving from the southern
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri appears to be in the direct line of fire, with
rainfalls of five inches or more possible by Thursday morning.
Flash flooding is likely in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Farther southwest, a few severe thunderstorms will flare up over
west Texas along a boundary separating dry air from the Rockies and
the plateaus of Old Mexico from gathering humid air from the Gulf
of Mexico. These storms will have the potential to spawn strong
winds, large hail and tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, isolated vigorous thunderstorms are possible over
the southern Rockies as an upper-level trough of low pressure
pivots northeast from Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered potent thunderstorms will boil up over eastern Oregon
as a jet stream disturbance arrives from the Gulf of Alaska. To the
east, hit-or-miss strong thunderstorms will mushroom over the
northern Plains as an insurgent upper-level disturbance dips south
from Canada and lifts moist surface air.
</P>
<P>
   Some showers and thunderstorms will develop near a wavering
front strung across the Middle Atlantic States. Flooding will occur
in areas where a few heavy storms follow on the heels of one
another. Meanwhile, much of New England will be dry, save for
isolated showers in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: JUNE GLOOM
</P>
<P>
   Ocean fog and stratus settled over California shores on Monday.
At San Diego, 0.07 inches of rain also fell, establishing a new
record for the date. Protracted periods of low clouds are common at
the coast in June, giving rise to a local expression, ``June
gloom.'' Ocean fog forms when moist, Pacific air passes over chilly
offshore waters. In transit, this marine layer is cooled to the
point where net condensation begins and fog forms and then rolls
ashore. As coastal waters warm in July and August, the marine layer
typically grows thinner, allowing morning fog and low clouds to
disperse faster. &QL;

IMPOVERISHED JEWISH COMMUNITY FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL IN CUBA

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Five years ago Lourdes Albo, 44, converted to Judaism,
seeking to fill her spiritually empty soul.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of communists, she had been baptized Catholic. Yet
Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution and ensuing dictatorship meant
communism was what she knew best. She found it offered no solace
when her mother died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 5 years old in 1959. My childhood, my schooling,
was very secular. When my mother died, I was very spiritually
depressed. I went back to church. At that time, I needed something,
but church was not enough,`` said Albo, whose father was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   One Yom Kippur, the Jewish high holy day, Albo went to the
Patronato, a Conservative synagogue and Jewish community center in
Havana. Worshipping there assuaged her grief. Soon her daughter,
also named Lourdes, began accompanying her. Both converted a few
months later, joining a growing renewal of Cuba's small,
impoverished Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   That renaissance continues, thanks in large measure to tireless
assistance from American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Houston lay leader Frieda Dow made her third trip to Cuba this
spring, returning once more amazed by the courage and persistence
of the Caribbean faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need the support of the Jewish people throughout the
world, to know that we are there for them,'' Dow said. ``They need
to know we want to bring them back into the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1959 revolution, an estimated 15,000 Jews made their
home in Cuba, an island 90 miles south of Florida. Thousands fled
when Castro took over. Those who remained faced near extinction in
the 1980s. Havana's three synagogues barely survived, rarely able
to attract more than a ``minyan,'' the 10 Jewish men required to
hold a service.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the island, organized Jewish activity was
scarce-to-nonexistent. Until the last several years, most Jewish
youngsters had never seen a Jewish wedding or a bat mitzvah,
according to a report from the American Jewish Joint Distribution
Committee. That New York-based agency coordinates most stateside
outreach to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Poor conditions in Cuba persisted as the United States continued
its trade embargo, isolating the island's Jews from world Jewry and
their North American brethren. Up until 1991, Cuba's government
discouraged religious practice and forbade many religious
gatherings. After revisions to the island's constitution in 1992,
some restrictions were relaxed and world Judaism began reaching out
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in that effort was Rabbi Schmuel Szteinhendler, who now
lives in Santiago, Chile, and previously resided in Guadalajara,
Mexico. For several years, Szteinhendler made four trips a year to
Cuba, conducting holiday services, performing weddings and ritual
circumcisions, and handling conversions of children of Jewish
fathers. (Under Jewish tradition, one is considered a Jew if born
of a Jewish mother.)
</P>
<P>
   Visitors were dismayed at the hardships suffered by Cuban Jews.
Wages averaged $15 a month. Soap, cooking oil, gasoline and other
staples were rationed. Medicines, from antibiotics to basic
over-the-counter drugs such as Tylenol and Tagamet, were hard to
obtain. Worship and community facilities were in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   The January visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba focused an
international spotlight on the island's woes _ especially the
travails of its religious groups _ for the first time in four
decades. During the papal visit, observers expressed cautious hope
that conditions would improve. Recent visitors to the island see
some progress, but they worry it is coming much too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the ongoing paradox of being Jewish in Cuba
once again made news after Jack Rosen, president of the American
Jewish Congress in the United States, met for six hours with Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as life is getting better for Cuba's Jews, it is getting
worse,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other foreign visitors, he saw some relaxations in
government restrictions. But Rosen said that the embargo so
negatively influences Cuban life that many young people leave the
island, further winnowing Judaism's slim ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining community inevitably is increasingly elderly and
infirm. Lifting restrictions on humanitarian relief is absolutely
necessary if the community is to be sustained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jose Miller, a surgeon and Patronato president, laments the
obstacles facing Cuban Jews, but admits problems are similar across
the island.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, nothing is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Necessities are so scarce that middle-class families welcome
extra soap, shampoo and notebooks spirited in by visitors or sent
by relatives in the United States. While there is some building,
much housing is substandard, with several generations crowding into
three- and four-room apartments with peeling paint and vintage
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are not any different than any other citizens in this
country,'' Miller said. ``What other people need, Jews need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews don't need matzoh; we receive that from the Canadian
Jewish Congress every year at Passover. We have been going through
many hard things for many years. This is not a paradise, but today
we have much more liberty and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the United States insists on strangling this country,
it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews who have visited Cuba said the Jewish community needs
almost everything and is particularly vulnerable because it is so
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total number (of Jews in Cuba) is only twice the number of
Jews who live in Bellaire,'' said Houston attorney Michael
Rubenstein of the residential city of 15,000 just outside Houston.
``There are shortages of almost everything. Few Cubans own cars,
and the public transportation system is in shambles. And although
there are plenty of doctors and hospitals, medical care is awful
due to the incredible shortages of essential supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein, part of the 18-member Houston group that went to
Cuba in late spring, said Cuban society operates by two simple
precepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule No. 1: Nobody gets anything. Rule No. 2: Rule No. 1
doesn't apply to foreign visitors,'' he said. As with other
visitors, tourists who stay in four-star hotels and dine at
luxurious buffets will see only one side of Cuba _ not the one most
Cubans hassle with day after day.
</P>
<P>
   To address the shortages, Americans may ask tourists to take
envelopes of U.S. dollars _ always useful _ to relatives in Cuba.
Most visitors go in with just a few clothes, stuffing their
suitcases with medications, toiletries, books, even condoms.
</P>
<P>
   Those gifts may mean the difference between good health and long
bouts of sickness for many Jews, says Adela Dworin, who works at
the Patronato.
</P>
<P>
   And the visitors who bring them are reminders to the community's
aging leadership that the Cubans are not alone. Dworin has lived in
Cuba since 1924. She was a child when her family emigrated from
Russia fearing another series of pogroms against Jews. The Jews
most active in Havana today often are middle-aged people and
youths, newcomers to Jewish life. Their presence offers hope to the
few who remained faithful during those years when religious
practice was much harder to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more young people are active today,'' said Dworin.
``Women of all ages are the most active.''
</P>
<P>
   Their participation means life will get better, said service
leader Luis Chanivecky, 70, adding: ``We are having many visitors.
And many Cubans are starting to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hanukkah last winter, about 300 turned out for observances.
Other Jewish community programs include a youth club, Sunday
School, Israeli Dance Group, women's club and other communal
holiday celebrations. Havana's Jewish leaders continue to seek out
younger Jews, bringing back sons and daughters born into interfaith
marriages or raised with no philosophy but communism.
</P>
<P>
   Exact figures vary, but leaders estimate about 2,000 Jews live
in Cuba today. Most reside in Havana, but smaller communities exist
in several outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most Jews who do leave emigrate for economic reasons.
Anti-Semitism has never been a major problem in Cuba. Although one
famous boatload of refugees was turned away in 1939, Cuba offered
sanctuary to many fleeing Adolf Hitler's Third Reich during the
World War II era.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Cuban Jews would celebrate such solidarity with the rest
of the world. Jose Zaak, 29, travels by bus for more than seven
hours once a month from Camaguey to Havana. The trip is expensive
for a struggling student, but worth it to Zaak, who arrives on
Fridays in time for Sabbath services and departs the next day.
Judaism is reviving and he wants to be part of its renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, it was (like) a blackout,'' Zaak said. ``Now
the light is coming back.''

BROADWAY ATTENDANCE RECORD: 11.5 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attendance at Broadway shows hit an all-time high of
11.5 million during the season that just ended, according to
figures released Tuesday by the League of American Theaters and
Producers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 season, which closed with the presentation of the
Tony Awards on Sunday night at Radio City Music Hall, also saw a 12
percent increase in box-office grosses to $558 million, said Jed
Bernstein, the league's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the increases was the inauguration of
three new Broadway theaters: the New Amsterdam Theater, where Walt
Disney Co. opened ``The Lion King'' in December; the Ford Center
for the Performing Arts, where Livent opened ``Ragtime'' in
January, and the Kit Kat Klub in the revamped Henry Miller Theater,
where the Roundabout Theater Company opened its revival of
``Cabaret'' in March.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributing factor was that Broadway theaters were used
more often than they had been in the previous season, a total of
1,442 weeks compared to 1,347 the season before. The 1997-98 season
saw 33 shows open in Broadway theaters, the league said. Three were
musical revivals, 9 were new musicals, 8 were revivals of plays, 11
were new plays, and 2 (``Forever Tango'' and ``Patti LaBelle on
Broadway'') were designated as ``specials.''
</P>
<P>
   Producers for the biggest Tony winners said they had experienced
surges in ticket sales following the ceremony. ``Lion King'' drew
six awards, including one for best new musical, while ``Ragtime,''
``Cabaret'' and ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' all won four.
</P>
<P>
   But other shows, which failed to win an award, have decided to
end their struggle. Producers of ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and
the musical ``1776,'' both revivals, announced Tuesday that they
would close after Sunday's performances. ``Honour,'' a new play
starring Jane Alexander, announced on Monday that it would also
close on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a battle,'' said Stewart Lane, one of the producers
of ``1776.'' ``We fought the good fight.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ When Wolfgang Puck opened Spago in West
Hollywood in early 1982, he changed American restaurants. He did
not do it by serving California cuisine or putting caviar on pizza;
in fact, he didn't do it with the food at all.
</P>
<P>
   Puck, a classically trained French chef who began his
apprenticeship at age 13, and his partner, Barbara Lazaroff, now
his wife, were the first restaurateurs to realize that rich
Americans longed for great food without formality.
</P>
<P>
   And so he began serving oysters without ostentation and foie
gras without fuss. He told his customers that they could come in
blue jeans if they wanted, and it turned out that they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should always feel like a party in the restaurant,'' Ms.
Lazaroff said then, as she and Puck took the starch out of fine
dining.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the couple opened Spago Beverly Hills, switching
their focus from the casual West Hollywood location to a far more
refined setting. The new restaurant once again gave an early clue
to a new direction for dining in America.
</P>
<P>
   The food is better than ever. A recent meal that Puck cooked on
the regular chef's night off began with three extraordinary
appetizers that showed off the different directions traveled by
Puck's restless culinary spirit. Crayfish with beets from the Chino
Ranch was pure California cuisine, the best vegetables snatched
from the garden and left to speak for themselves. Hamachi, a single
soft slice of raw yellowtail served with ginger, seaweed and sticky
rice, was proof of Puck's enduring interest in Asian cooking. White
asparagus with horseradish cream, on the other hand, was straight
from his Austrian homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The next course was another homage to Austria. Puck's marrow
soup was the richest, most wonderful broth you could imagine,
filled with slices of poached marrow and a single, silky dumpling.
It was, simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten.
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by more white asparagus _ the season is so short
_ in brown butter and bread crumbs. And then langoustines from
Santa Barbara with fava beans dressed in apple balsamic vinegar and
pumpkinseed oil, two delicacies made only in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Then the waiter proudly showed off an entire turbot steamed in a
jacket of ginger and garlic. The pure white fish was firm and
tender, the contrast with the herbs intense enough to frame its
clean flavor. Afterward the waiter appeared with the tiniest rack
of lamb, each chop no more than a couple of bites, surrounded by
roasted garlic and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there were cheese and just a morsel of dessert: tiny
lemon meringue tarts in a drizzle of berry coulis. The last flavor
was bittersweet and just right.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meal that demonstrated a chef at the height of his
power. And it was an answer to all the people who say it is
impossible for a chef to open inexpensive cafes, as Puck has done,
without losing his culinary edge. But what impressed me even more
than the food was the new maturity of service in the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The new Spago still feels like a party. But it is considerably
less casual than the old one. Busboys hover about, bringing bread
almost before you want it and keeping your glasses filled with
water. Waiters work harder: That turbot arrived as a whole fish to
be sliced at the table. There is a new seriousness to the wine
list, as well. The sommelier, Michael Bonacorsi (who came from
Masa's in San Francisco), has assembled a varied and unusual group
of wines to go with the food. Best of all, he talks about his
favorites with knowledge and absolutely no pretension.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been slowly inventing a new style of service, one
that is different from the classic European model. The great
restaurateur Joe Baum was among the first to bend his energies to
this. Danny Meyer, the owner of Union Square Cafe and Gramercy
Tavern in Manhattan, has been another thoughtful practitioner of
the new, less formal American style.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out in California, Spago first made a statement 16
years ago, and now the new one is making another. It is one more
proof that American dining is coming of age.

`THE FARM: ANGOLA, U.S.A.': OF LIFE, AND DEATH, BEHIND BARS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No stereotypes about prison life intrude on the
candor and intimacy of ``The Farm: Angola, U.S.A.,'' the discreetly
searing documentary that shared top honors at this year's Sundance
Film Festival and opens at the Film Forum on Wednesday. With
extraordinary tact and acuity, the filmmakers Jonathan Stack, Liz
Garbus and Wilbert Rideau, who is an inmate, explore the world
inside a vast maximum security prison and consider the coping
mechanisms that make up everyday life there. The place is the
Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, a former slave plantation
named for its African population. Prisoners, 85 percent of whom
will die at Angola, do field work for as little as 4 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of six men trying to overcome the odds,''
the film's narrator states. But those odds are indeed daunting.
Only four of the six subjects here are still alive when the film is
over. New inmates with long sentences learn that their friends and
relatives are liable to forget them. (The average Angola prisoner
never receives a visit after his first three years.) And the only
goals with even a prayer of being realized are spiritual ones.
``The Farm'' includes shockingly dismissive parole board
deliberations for a man who insists that he was wrongly accused of
two rapes by women who admitted thinking that all black men looked
alike and who received a 100-year sentence for those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The parole board scene, like many other sequences here, attests
to the filmmakers' skill at unobtrusively entering the prisoners'
world and at avoiding trite, melodramatic ideas about
incarceration. No cafeteria fights or tin cups banging against bars
here; the inmates have become a tractable group thanks to the
virtual hopelessness of their situation. Some, like the model
prisoner Ashanti Witherspoon, who was sentenced to 75 years for
armed robbery and now counsels new inmates about what they can
expect, have become the helpful citizens they never were before.
All speak of their past crimes as if they were part of a separate
life.
</P>
<P>
   Logan (Bones) Theriot, now an old man dying of lung cancer,
recalls coming home from overseas to a wife who was pregnant by a
friend of his and of being enraged when she later treated the baby
badly. ``My wife and I had a little trouble and I killed her,'' he
says, while the camera visits the mug shot of a young,
vital-looking Logan. Barely a trace of his earlier self remains in
a man whose most formative years seem to have been lived at Angola.
Fellow prisoners are seen crying for Theriot and doing their best
to comfort him as the end draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Though every inmate in ``The Farm'' shares the dream of freedom,
the film explores what it means to be beyond fighting impossible
odds and seeking sustenance wherever it can be found. From the
white warden who notes pettily that it costs $10,000 a day to feed
5,000 men to the prison preacher who could be free if Louisiana's
governor signed his pardon, this thoughtful, gripping film examines
prison life from every imaginable angle except the unsurprising
ones. In conveying the humanity of prisoners lost in an unyielding
system, ``The Farm'' does for these men what they may never be able
to do for themselves.

`BE SWEET': A CAREER BASED ON THE SECOND CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, seeing a camera pointing in his direction, the amiable and
celebrated parodist of Soviet life, Vladimir Voinovich, wiped away
the smile that was on his face and assumed a melancholy air.
``Satirists are supposed to look gloomy,'' he said as the
electronic flash illuminated his features.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of humorists, who in any case are more or
less indistinguishable from satirists. The same is certainly said
by Roy Blount Jr., who has entertained a loyal following of readers
with what must by now be thousands of rueful, poignant, funny
articles and a number of books. His latest, ``Be Sweet,'' is a
rambling variation on Voinovich's remark, summed up in various of
Blount's darker comments:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much constructive you can do with self-loathing
other than make humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as unsightly adolescents shave off patches of hair and
put studs in their noses to make it appear that they  &UR; mean &LR;  to be
ugly, I began to cultivate my comic potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody Allen once told an interviewer that being funny `is
always a second choice.' The first choice, I guess, is being . . .
sweet. Or happy, or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Be Sweet'' is a kind of memoir tracing Blount's humoristic
origins in what the pop psychologists call a dysfunctional family.
The attention here is especially on Blount's late mother, Louise, a
Southern woman whose parents died when she was a child and whose
fear of abandonment led her to cultivate the kind of guilt-inducing
tragic mien that has kept various funny men in business for
decades. ``My mother loved me to pieces, as she often said, and I'm
still trying to put them together,'' Blount writes.
</P>
<P>
   And so, his book of brief sketches, each of them vaguely focused
on some autobiographical element _ Blount's relationship with his
younger sister, his appearances on television talk shows, his
experience of being taken for other people _ elaborates on the idea
of funniness as a defense against melancholy and the lack of
self-regard, as a substitute for self-pity. Chapter after chapter
Blount brandishes the absurdist sensibility that has made him
famous, and he sometimes makes you laugh out loud as he does so.
</P>
<P>
   Likable as Blount is, though, and tickled, intrigued, touched as
you will be by certain passages of unillusioned self-revelation,
``Be Sweet'' remains an uneven, hit-or-miss piece of work. To put
this as an economist might: Blount's book is a literary version of
the law of marginal utility. The first few chapters are the most
enjoyable; what works beautifully when it comes in small doses
eventually reaches a point of diminishing returns as the author
meanders at book length through his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that bright and memorable passages are absent. Blount
is so smart and engaging that he couldn't avoid them if he tried.
But by the time you are midway through ``Be Sweet,'' you are awash
in deja vu. Blount repeats a bit too many times some of his
personal themes; at the same time, his riffs on other subjects,
like his struggles with ``female consciousness,'' have a more than
twice-told quality.
</P>
<P>
   Blount's technique is to sustain a kind of casual, contrarian
chatter full of free associations, self-interruptions, anecdotes,
jokes, limericks and other doggerel (most of which is very clever).
The starting point, as Blount reminds us several times, is that he
is 55; he is ``a single grandfather''; he lives alone. He is also
haunted by memories of a child wounded by the possessive,
emotionally terrified and terrifying Louise. `` `I just want to get
you children raised,' Louise used to say, `and then I want to
die,''' is the kind of thing Blount cites as evidence of his
mother's character. ``The time has come,'' he says, ``to lift the
family curse,'' and he is off and running on his diverse, diverting
but also jumbled remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there are sentences of pure genius. ``Miss Shirley,''
Blount writes of his eighth-grade teacher, ``was a large, confused
but obdurate, percolating but never quite fully brewed woman who
blew things out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to understand his mother represent a shrewd and
affecting attempt at a kind of posthumous reconciliation. Some of
Blount's jokes _ there is an off-color one about Tonto and the Lone
Ranger that alone is almost worth the price of this volume _ are
very funny, even thought they come, like much else in ``Be Sweet,''
apropos of almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Blount's chapter called ``Sauce for the Genders'' _ which begins
with a citation from Yeats to the effect that many men have been
ruined by the desire for a wife and child _ is a good example of a
digressive style mixing charm with mannerism. He begins with a
memory of some embarrassment caused by his mother. He veers to the
subject of his youthful curly hair and then to his 1960s and '70s
haircuts. He riffs briefly on the differences between men and women
before going on to the walk-on role he played in the movie
``Philadelphia,'' his recollections of being taught to drive by his
mother (and her near-hysterical fearfulness), a joke about Adam and
Eve, an e-mail message about dying computer screens sent by his
sister, the Oedipal complex and an odd passage that he read in an
Ohio newspaper. This helter-skelter narrative is punctuated by
single-phrase paragraphs aimed at establishing an easy intimacy, a
kind of bar-stool familiarity with the reader:
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa boo-boo bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, Well, gee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, everybody is interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Blount's new book are examples of a mind that is
always rambunctiously engaged in an astonishing array of
activities, from playing in a writers' rock-and-roll band to
interviewing Willie Mays. But ``Be Sweet'' does not have its
author's usual effortlessness. It strains too hard for its effect,
which prevents it from being one of the more brilliant products in
Blount's otherwise impressive oeuvre.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tea in the garden is an inviting notion on a balmy
afternoon in late spring. And the new, umbrella-shaded garden at
Sweet Melissa in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, fulfills the fantasy. Sweet
Melissa, a pastry shop and cafe that opened in April at 276 Court
St., serves tea from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. daily except Monday. The
tea, brewed in old-fashioned china pots, is accompanied by
irresistible palmiers, scones, fruit tartlets or chocolate souffle
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Murphy, who was the pastry chef at Home, Drovers Tap
Room and Home Away From Home, all in Greenwich Village, is the
co-owner and baker.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one doesn't linger for tea, the shop is worth a visit to
take home some delicate madeleines (75 cents each), a sugar-glazed
lemon tart ($14), fallen chocolate souffle cake ($24), moist banana
bread ($6), a nutty sticky bun ($2), a berry-topped custard tartlet
($3.50) or a thimble-size blueberry tartlet ($1).
</P>
<P>
   The shop also has tables indoors and serves light fare like
salads, soups and sandwiches ($4.50 to $8.95) until 10 p.m. from
Tuesday through Thursday, midnight on Friday and Saturday, and 5
p.m. on Sunday. It is closed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In French Kitchens
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to dine in a place that carries two or three
Michelin stars in France, or to try to follow a recipe in a
cookbook written by the chef. But now nonprofessionals can spend
five or six days there cooking in restaurant kitchens alongside
great chefs like Alain Senderens and Michel Rostang in Paris,
Michel Troisgros in Roanne, Gerard Boyer in Reims and Jacques
Chibois in Grasse.
</P>
<P>
   L'Ecole des Chefs, run by Annie Jacquet-Bentley, a restaurant
consultant in Birchrunville, Pa., offers internships in 17 two- or
three-star French restaurants. Most of the restaurants accept only
one intern at a time, though some take couples. There are also
internships with Pierre Herme, the pastry chef at Laduree in Paris,
and with Potel &AMP; Chabot, the Parisian caterer.
</P>
<P>
   The price, which includes meals with the restaurant staff and a
workday of eight to 12 hours, is $1,950 in a two-star restaurant,
$2,450 in a three-star (accommodations and transportation not
included). Though no French is required, applicants are expected to
have cooking experience, and not all are accepted. Students and
recent graduates of culinary schools may also apply.
</P>
<P>
   L'Ecole des Chefs offers the same program to experienced working
chefs, but the cost is $3,900 in a two-star restaurant, $4,900 in a
three-star. Information: (610) 469-2500.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff's Notes for Cooks
</P>
<P>
   For a reference aid, Instant Culinary Guides are
information-filled bookmarks that can be slipped into cookbooks.
The slender, fold-out brochures, held in plastic sleeves, come in
three versions, offering advice on cooking terms, wines and
cheeses, or conversions and substitutions. The guides are $2.50
each at Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstores. The set of three can be ordered
by mail for $7.50, plus $2 for shipping, by calling (800) 636-0044.
(By mail, they do not come in the protective plastic sleeves.)
</P>
<P>
   Chocolates by the Number
</P>
<P>
   There's no guesswork with the chocolates of Joel Durand, a
confectioner in St.-Remy-de-Provence, France. He offers boxes of 32
squares of filled milk and dark chocolates, with each chocolate
marked with a number; a little guidebook lists the flavor of each.
And we're not talking just mocha or mint. The fillings are also
seasoned with star anise, chicory, lavender or a mixture of almonds
and black olives. My only complaint is that too many of the candies
are coated in milk, not dark chocolate, and lack the bitter
contrast that some of the wilder flavors need. The nine-ounce box
of chocolates is available at Aux Delices, 1075 East Putnam Ave.,
Riverside, Conn., or by mail for $30, plus shipping: (203)
698-1066.

   ONLINEADS _ A Texas tax exempt organization promoting school
vouchers appears to be the first group in the country to send paid,
political advertising to thousands of computer users via the
Internet. So-called issue ads on the Internet are just the tip of
the iceberg. Soon to come will be candidates sending electronic
campaign litterature to voters and issue ad campaigns that will
prompt voters to e-mail their members of Congress on pending
legislation, all at the click of a button. (Foskett, Cox News
Service).

   TOBACCO _ WASHINGTON _ Senate backers of a national tobacco bill
make their first attempt Tuesday to cut off debate on the bill and

Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., to use proceeds from the bill to beef up
drug interdiction forces. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

an unusually high percentage of contributions from small donors,
perhaps an indication that he has more grass roots support than
usually thought. (Sherman, Cox News Service).

   BAPTIST _ SALT LAKE CITY _ Coverage of the opening of the

and a vote on an amendment to the ``Statement of Faith'' that says,
among other things, marriage is between a man and a woman and wives
should be subservient to their husbands. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BISHOP-PROFILE _ He's a man who prays almost as much as he
breathes. He's a man who not only gives inspirational books to
friends but also takes the time to mark pages he thinks will boost
their spiritual deficits. He is a living history of Florida
catholicism, someone who helped shepherd the explosive growth from
80,000 faithful in 1945 to more than 2.5 million today. But, now,
he's also the highest ranking Catholic in U.S. history to leave his
job for molesting a child. (Houck, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

the U.S. military shipped a ``small amount'' of sarin nerve gas to
Vietnam in 1967 but never used it. (Brice, Atlanta

<P>
   DEATHPENALTY _ The federal appeals court in Atlanta Tuesday
ordered a new trial for Wilburn Wiley Dobbs, who has spent 24 years
on Georgia's death row. Dobbs killed a Chickamauga grocer in 1973.
He won his appeal on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel grounds; his
lawyer, called a racist by Dobbs' new lawyers, has admitted to
telling racist jokes, called Dobbs ``boy'' during the trial and, in
his closing argument, read verbatim a court opinion, not asking the
jury to spare Dobbs' life. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TIME-SCHAFER _ATLANTA _When a federal jury ruled against Michael
Schafer of Austell, Time magazine executives breathed a sigh of
relief. Schafer had sued Time for publishing his picture, although
wrongly identifying him as David Lovejoy, and saying he was
possibly involved in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed
all passengers over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. But on Tuesday,
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Schafer's favor and
ordered a new trial, saying the trial judge wrongly instructed the
jury about ``malicious defamation.'' (Rankin, Atlanta

   EXECUTION _ David Cargill is scheduled to be executed at 7 p.m.
by the state of Georgia for killing the parents of four small
children. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BUGS _ WACO, Texas _ An unseasonably dry spring has
squelched what could have been a horrendous year for bugs, giving
residents a break from the normal battles fought with tiny critters
in Central Texas. The latest rainfall, however, could change that.
Much of the insect population is down this year, particularly
mosquitoes. (Everitt, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   BOXING-FITNESS _ Boxing and its close cousin, kickboxing, have
become the wunderworkouts of choice for the Hollywood A-list, both
on- and off-screen, from Jodie Foster to Ally McBeal. Fitness
boxing is becoming increasingly popular outside Hollywood, too.
Unlike regular boxing, fitness boxing and kickboxing involve no
actual sparring _ except with a heavy bag. But the workout is
incredibly demanding; devotees say it's the toughest exercise
they've ever tried. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MONSTERS _ As sci-fi and monster movies increasingly depict kids
at risk _ and spin off toys that appeal to very young kids _
parents need to arm their kids with two weapons: common sense and
sleep. Atlanta psychologist Stephen Garber, author of ``Monsters
Under the Bed and Other Childhood Fears,'' says kids under 8 or 9
really can't distinguish reality and fantasy. (Lore, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>

   MELANOMA-VACCINE _ The search for a melanoma vaccine is a
microscopic detective story that shows how fast things change in
the treatment of this deadliest form of skin cancer. Evidence

and with fewer toxic side effects than other treatments for
malignant melanoma. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   In the latest skirmish over the Elgin marbles, Greece accused
Britain Tuesday of arrogance in saying that the ancient sculptures
from the Parthenon were better preserved in London than in Athens.
The outburst was prompted by a new book, ``Lord Elgin and the
Marbles,'' by the British historian William St. Clair, which says
that in 1937, workers in the British Museum damaged the fifth
century B.C. marbles by trying to remove their honey-colored patina
with metal scrapers and powerful cleaners. Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said the book buttressed Greece's case for the
marbles' return. Britain acknowledged damage but said it was
exaggerated. Officials maintain that the marbles should stay in
London, safe from the smog of Athens and accessible to millions of
visitors. Many museums fear that if Greece does win back the
marbles, the way may be opened for other nations to reclaim
treasures.

   The Rolling Stones are Moscow bound for the first time in their
30-year career. The Moscow show on Aug. 11 was announced Tuesday as
part of the revised itinerary for the European leg of the Stones'
world tour, beginning in Germany on Saturday and ending in
September in the Netherlands. Earlier this week, after the sale of
300,000 tickets, the Stones postponed the British part of the tour,
which had been scheduled for August. They said a revision of
Britain's tax laws would have cost them $19.5 million, forcing the
band's European tour into the red. The four British concerts have
been rescheduled for next June, in a new tax year.

   A new Picasso has taken up residence at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington. It is a rare oval oil painting, ``A Glass on a
Table'' (1913), that exemplifies Picasso's early creative visual
experiments. The painting, a gift to the Corcoran in memory of
Ingrid and Morton Leeds by their children, is on display through
June 22 as the focus of an exhibit of five Cubist-inspired works
and a Picasso etching.  &QL;

catholicism, someone who helped shepherd the explosive growth from

ordered a new trial for Wilburn Wiley Dobbs, who has spent 24 years
on Georgia's death row. Dobbs killed a Chickamauga grocer in 1973.
He won his appeal on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel grounds; his

boxing is becoming increasingly popular outside Hollywood, too.
Unlike regular boxing, fitness boxing and kickboxing involve no

KEIGO OYAMADA: ECLECTICISM PERSONIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Before speaking a word of greeting, Keigo Oyamada runs
around the offices of Trattoria Records, handing out elaborately
packaged CDs of cutting-edge Japanese rock bands, obscure English
girl groups, French chansons sung by Japanese vocalists and soccer
anthem compilations.
</P>
<P>
   Trattoria may be one of the most eclectic and interesting
boutique labels affiliated with a major record company (Polystar),
and not only does Oyamada help run it, he is also its best-selling
act, Cornelius (named after the chimpanzee from ``Planet of the
Apes''). He is on his first world tour and performs in New York on
Thursday night at Shine, at 380 Canal St. in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Oyamada is an unlikely pop star: thousands of teen-age
girls flock to his concerts to watch him play an idiosyncratic mix
of easy-listening music, psychedelic rock and hip-hop collage.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Oyamada has a cult reputation as a
Japanese analogue to Beck, a restlessly creative introvert
recording rickety, innovative songs from a channel surfer's point
of view. But the best way to understand Oyamada is to take a look
at Trattoria's bizarre back catalog of releases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are the solo albums by Bill Wyman of the
Rolling Stones that Oyamada reissued. ``I saw that Bill Wyman had a
record called `Monkey Grip,' and I liked the name,'' the
primate-fixated Oyamada said via a translator. ``And I could see
putting together an advertising campaign saying, `Trattoria signs
the Rolling Stones.' The albums didn't sell at all, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the album he released by the sprinter Linford
Christie. ``I was looking through the Polystar catalog one day, and
I saw an album cover with a picture of a guy running with a gold
medal around his neck and pulling a tire on a rope, and it cracked
me up so much I had to release it,'' Oyamada explained, laughing.
``I also liked the idea of putting out a record by an Olympic gold
medalist, especially since he sings the Spencer Davis Group's `Keep
On Running' really off tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyamada pulled the collar of his brown jacket over his mouth and
quietly added, ``And that didn't sell either.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many interesting musicians emerging in countries like
Germany, Sweden and Japan, Oyamada is as much a collector as a
musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I listened to a lot of music from overseas,'' he
said. ``And because of the distance that Japan was from all these
other countries, information about the bands, the music and the
scene it was coming from didn't necessarily follow. So I had to
create my own genres. I remember listening only to orange-colored
records, and I'd group them into my orange record series and just
listen to them as orange records. Or if there was skull imagery in
the album artwork, I'd think of them as the skull bands. I just
created my own genres and understandings of them, and that
influences what I do and maybe makes it different.''
</P>
<P>
   Oyamada began his career in a band called Lollipop Sonic and
then Flipper's Guitar, an influential Japanese band that played
gentle, British-influenced lounge pop. After the band broke up,
with Oyamada's partner Kenji Ozawa going on to become a pop star in
his own right, Oyamada reinvented himself as Cornelius.
</P>
<P>
   With each new album, the music seemed to be made more and more
from a listener's perspective than a musician's, with original
playing replaced by samples of everything from the Beach Boys to
``Planet of the Apes'' and songs turning into strange explorations
of pop minutiae.
</P>
<P>
   In his first American performance, at the South by Southwest
music convention this year in Austin, Oyamada fluctuated from
beautiful pop songs to textural noise, interrupting one song to
play a warbling note-for-note version of ``Love Me Tender'' on the
theremin _ an impressive feat considering the difficulty of
pinpointing pitches on that old electronic instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Every member of the band had bowl haircuts, sunglasses and
red-and-white crew-neck shirts. The reasoning behind this costume
is yet another example of how Oyamada copies (or apes) an idea and
then makes it his own.
</P>
<P>
   He said he derived the image from a photograph of Moe Tucker,
the drummer from the Velvet Underground. ``She was wearing a
striped shirt, and I liked the look,'' he said. ``Then I realized
everyone in the Velvet Underground had the same haircut in the
photo. Since the concept of Cornelius is that it is a band with
only one member, it made me think of using a clone idea. So I
dressed the whole band up likes clones of me.''
</P>
<P>
   On his current tour, Oyamada and his band will be wearing
clothing made by the Tokyo clothing company Bathing Ape, with which
he is associated. Its one-room outlet store, hidden in Tokyo's
Harajuku neighborhood, sells only three or four items, usually
T-shirts made with new designs every week, insuring that whenever
school is out the store is crammed with fans trying to get the
latest Bathing Ape wear.
</P>
<P>
   Oyamada, in fact, has become so ape-obsessed since adopting the
pseudonym Cornelius that to find out whether the law in ``Planet of
the Apes'' that ``Ape shall never kill ape'' was true, he got in
touch with a professor studying the field activities of apes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed to find out that monkeys actually kill each
other,'' he said, burrowing his head in his Bathing Ape jacket and
sinking into silent reflection.

 &HT;    Boxing helps women fight stress and calories
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two dozen people, mostly women, are warming up in the
boxing studio. They are all lithe, with sculpted, sinewy limbs.
They think they're in shape.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning is blowing full blast.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 minutes, it will feel like the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing and its cousin, kick boxing, have moved from the ring
into the aerobics studio, picking up a sizable following in the
process. And eliminating sparring while keeping the element of
aggression has made fitness boxing and kick boxing, traditionally
male-dominated sports, vastly more appealing to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a popularity explosion,'' said Bruce Frazier, who
teaches kick boxing at Australian Body Works in Atlanta. ``It's in
vogue. Michelle Pfeiffer does it. And, of course, having it on the
show (`Ally McBeal') hasn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The new incarnation of this ancient sport is less bloody than
competitive boxing but more soul-satisfying than step aerobics.
It's based on two concepts.
</P>
<P>
   One: The training regimen used to turn competitive boxers into
superbly conditioned athletes also works for ordinary people who
want to get fit.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Punching something really hard is fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the act of combat, whether it be real
or imagined, that lends a clarity to your thought,'' mused Frazier.
``For a brief time, you cannot think about the past or the future.
You can only think about the here and now.''
</P>
<P>
   So, boxing may be incredibly rigorous, but at least you get
something for your sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done many other types of exercises, and I find I get the
best workout with this,'' said Taronna Maines, 27, a doctoral
candidate in molecular biology who boxes at Jeanne's Body Tech in
Buckhead. ``Plus, it's such a stress reliever.''
</P>
<P>
   This combination of calorie-incinerating exercise and stress
therapy may explain why kick boxing has become the wunderworkout of
choice for A-list actresses. Kick boxing showed up in ``Romy and
Michele's High School Reunion'' and ``Kiss the Girls,'' and it's
one of the few things we know Jodie Foster does in her private
life. Several gyms in New York and Los Angeles are entirely devoted
to fitness boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is fast becoming popular in Atlanta, too, where
several gyms offer classes. Rick Drew American Karate and
Kickboxing, which started kick-boxing classes in August, has 300
students.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions generally don't involve sparring. Instead, punching
and kicking moves are incorporated into a sort of aerobic routine,
exhausting in its demands for both speed and strength. Most classes
are at least an hour long.
</P>
<P>
   After just 15 minutes of air punches, the students' faces begin
to show fatigue. They perk up when they start hitting the heavy
bag.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the room, Ali Gibson has the classic boxer's
stance, gloves in front of her face, feet planted wide apart. She
glares at the bag as if it had insulted her and lands a hard jab,
then a hook.
</P>
<P>
   The beginners' inexperience shows here. Some just fling their
fists at the bag. Instructor Scott Grove moves around the room,
demonstrating the difference between a hook and a jab.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a really fast learning curve,'' said Scott Daniels,
28, who has been boxing for 1 1/2 years. ``You don't have to feel
like an idiot for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   He started boxing for fitness because he didn't like biking or
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal cardiovascular workout, plus it's fun,''
said Daniels, who works as a financial planner. ``I've also enjoyed
it from the standpoint of just learning how to box.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems many boxing and kick boxing fans are defectors from
other types of aerobic workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got tired of doing the same old step classes,'' said Jong
Han Kim of Kim Brothers World Tae Kwon Do Academy in Roswell,Ga.,
where classes are full. ``They like the idea of putting on
handwraps and boxing gloves. They really like to beat on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the class, Grove tells the students to pair up.
One holds the heavy bag steady while the other punches it 10 times,
rapid-fire. Then they switch and repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The punches get slower and slower. The batteries are running
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something primitively satisfying about kicking and
punching something,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but do it over and over again and your arms start to hate
you.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of class, the students look like they've been jogging
in a sauna. Sweat streams from places they didn't even know could
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   But they walk a little taller than they did when they arrived.
Some even strut a bit.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be back.

 &HT;    The hardest part of knowing how to cook may be knowing when to
stop
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 11: DFO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Willan examined the roast chickens that a student at her La
Varenne Cooking School in France was about to put back into the
oven and declared, ``Those look done to me!''
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was simply checking on the progress of the
birds, was puzzled. ``How do you know?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Willan's first reaction was simply to say it was instinct. ``But
then I realized I do know. It looked crispy brown. It sizzled. You
could wiggle the leg, and it smelled heavenly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have had those puzzling moments in the kitchen. The
recipe said to cook the roast for an hour. So why is it still so
rare? Your mother always told you to boil corn about 10 minutes,
but when you do, the kernels are shriveled and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Professional chefs such as Willan have learned that the answers
to such questions don't come from some divine inspiration, but
rather by using all five senses to carefully observe the cooking
process.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Bruehwiler of Bruehwiler's Bakery in Sandy Springs
says he knows when a loaf of bread is done by touching it. ``It's
like the people you see thumping the watermelon at the farmers
market. You turn the loaf of bread upside down and hit the bottom
with your knuckles,'' he explained. ``If you hear a hollow sound,
then you know it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   For cookies, Bruehwiler goes mainly by sight. As a batch of
cookies nears the end of the baking process, he begins to watch.
``The recipe may say seven minutes. That doesn't mean the cookie
will be done in your oven in seven minutes,'' he said. ``A cookie
is so small and fragile, and a minute can really change the color
and the texture. So you have to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Famed Southern chef Edna Lewis says she can ``hear'' when a cake
is done. How? By pulling it from the oven and holding it to her
ear. If she hears ``quiet bubbling,'' she knows it's not quite
ready. When the bubbling subsides, she knows it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Detecting the moment of optimum doneness is arguably the most
important skill a cook can master, especially in dishes unadorned
with sauces or fancy dressings. ``When you cook things very pure,
then it shows all the mistakes,'' said chef Guenter Seeger of
Seeger's restaurant in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cook It Right: Achieve Perfection With Every Dish You
Cook'' (Reader's Digest Books, $29.95), Willan tells home chefs how
to recognize exactly when more than 150 types of ingredients and
foods are cooked to perfection, from lobster to french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think people these days know a lot more about food,
they know a lot less about cooking,'' said Willan. ``They simply
don't recognize when something is well-cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   She drew on her own experience as the founder of La Varenne, the
famed cooking school, and as a cookbook author. She also sought the
secrets of expert chefs around the world. To illustrate, hundreds
of photographs and explanations of overcooked and undercooked
dishes are shown, next to their perfectly cooked counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Even for experienced cooks, she found that there is sometimes
but one way to achieve the precise product they're seeking:
old-fashioned trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get a cake to fall, and we couldn't get a dark
line around the yolk of a boiled egg to show an overdone egg,''
laughed Willan. ``We ended up boiling 60 eggs for that one

   Steak
</P>
<P>
   Underdone: The meat offers no resistance when pressed, and beads
of meat juice do not yet rise to the surface. Rare: Surface is
well-browned; meat is spongy when pressed in the center; beads of
juice are deep pink. Medium: Surface is crusty brown and meat
resists when the center is pressed; firm at the sides; beads of
juice on surface are deep pink. Well-done: Surface is crusty brown
and dry; meat is firm when pressed; beads of juice on surface are
clear.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect custard sauce will be creamy and smooth, and a clear
trail is left when a finger is drawn across the spoon. Flavor is
delicate, perfumed with vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Green beans cooked just right will be tender enough to bend but
still slightly crisp. They're easy to cut with a knife. The color
is vivid and the taste well-defined and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   When a knife or fork is inserted at the thickest part of the
fish, the flesh nearest the bone flakes away easily and is no
longer translucent. The eye is opaque. If baked, barbecued, broiled
or pan-fried, the skin should be browned and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect muffin will be deep golden and starting to shrink from
the pan; the center rises to a shallow, cracked peak, and a skewer
inserted into the center comes out clean (but may be moist with
fruit). The inside texture is spongy and the muffin is fragrant.
Holey muffins (upper left) will be tunneled and often have a high,
broken peak as a result of overmixing or too much rising agent.
Underbaked muffins (upper middle) will be wet in the center, with a
pale crust; the batter has not yet peaked or begun to shrink from
the pan. Heavy muffins (upper right) have a batter that scarcely
rises, and the top of the muffin is flat; the crust is pale.
Overmixing is most likely the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta is ready when tender but still firm to the bite; pieces
show no tendency to stick together, and flavor is nutty. String
pasta, such as spaghetti and linguine, can be cut with your
thumbnail.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Search for the perfect hot dog leads from Gotham to
Tennessee
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copperhill, Tenn. _ Eat your heart out, New York. While hot dog
vendors are being legislated off the streets of Gotham, here in the
Copper Basin, Raymond Arthur, hot dog maker extraordinaire, still
basks in the glow of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered Arthur just as one of my long-standing rituals _
eating a good hot dog from a cart on the streets of New York _ was
being made very difficult to enjoy. In mid-July, sidewalk food
vendors are supposed to be banned from a huge chunk of New York's
Midtown and financial district: 144 blocks. And now comes news that
that's not enough: Some folks are petitioning the city's Sidewalk
Vendor Review Panel to bar vendors from 95 more blocks in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   New York visits won't be the same for me if I can't easily buy a
hot dog, a bag of chips and a Coke at a Midtown corner, sit on the
sunny side of the street and watch the passing parade.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, such cares were a million miles away the other day
when, here in Copperhill, I had my first hot dog at the Curve
Package Store on West Tennessee Avenue, owned by Arthur and his
wife, Fay.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lyn and I bought a cabin in McCaysville (the two towns
share a downtown), a number of people had told me that Arthur knew
dogs. This day, hot and dry, seemed like a good day to try one.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Bud Man was there, making a delivery.
Barry Johnson of Cleveland, Tenn., added his voice to the chorus of
testimonials for Arthur's steamed hot dogs: ``I've eaten plenty of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does he like about them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling confidently, Arthur noted that Johnson always has his
hot dog the same way: ketchup, mustard and chili. ``His girlfriend
doesn't want him to eat these onions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn's not around; pile some onions on mine, please.
</P>
<P>
   As he laid mine out, Arthur talked with great zest about the
formula for a perfect dog. We agreed that it seems an ideal food on
a hot summer day; it's a no-sweat dish, somehow evocative of fun
and games and grand old pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a recipe that everybody likes,'' Arthur is saying,
discreetly ignoring the chili running down my chin, offering a fork
that I decline. ``All-meat wieners, and I make sure they're fresh.
You can't beat a hot dog like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He ought to know. As of this month, he's been making them for 22
years at this same location (named Curve because that's what the
street does). It was 18 years ago that Arthur stopped using wieners
that were not all beef. He recalls a conversation with his
supplier: ``I said, `How about an all-meat wiener.' They said, `We
got 'em.' I said, `Lay 'em on me.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he's been laying 'em on customers ever since. On a good
Saturday, especially if there's a ballgame at the nearby field,
Arthur might sell 200 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   And how many has Barry Johnson eaten?
</P>
<P>
   Calculating quickly with pen and paper, he figured that, during
the last 10 years, he's consumed ``about 2,000.'' And that's just
one man. Who can imagine how many Raymond Arthur has sold at his
beer store?
</P>
<P>
   He says he has always known the value of quality: ``All it takes
is one bad one to stop people from buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Johnson hasn't had a bad one. And the first one I had
was just great. I don't know when I'll catch up with his 2,000, but
I'll be working like a dog to do it.

 &HT;    COLUMN:Elmore Thrash was good man around House
 &HT;    BY Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--My friend Elmore Thrash died. He was as much a part of
the Georgia Capitol as the lady on the dome, as the gold dome
itself.
</P>
<P>
   He had been there 71 of his 83 years, serving as a little boy
page to the late Sen. Richard Russell, when he was speaker of the
Georgia House in 1927, and as the official House messenger for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   I loved Elmore _ and so did the hundreds of Georgians who knew
him.
</P>
<P>
   He died Monday at an Atlanta nursing home; a service in Decatur
was held Tuesday, and a graveside service is at 11 a.m. today in
Gay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elmore lived most of his life in Valdosta, where he was
in the real estate and house-building business and where there is a
state highway named for him, his parents are buried in Gay, and he
wanted to be buried beside them.
</P>
<P>
   As Marcus Collins, a longtime member of the House and former
revenue commissioner, said of Elmore, ``He was a giver, not a
taker.''
</P>
<P>
   It was true. I couldn't have spent 20 years covering the Georgia
House without the help of Elmore, who sat by the speaker for hours,
keeping tabs on developments. He spent more hours scurrying about
the chamber, talking to people and, even more important, listening
to people.
</P>
<P>
   When the phone in the press section rang, it was often Elmore
saying, ``Sugar, we adjourning in 20 minutes. That committee you
are interested in is meeting NOW. Better get there.''
</P>
<P>
   If I was ill, Elmore heard about it and called me to check. In
the winter when a new session of the General Assembly was shaping
up, Elmore arrived early in Atlanta and was present at the
preliminary indoctrination sessions. He often called to tell me he
was back in town, visiting his children and grandchildren and
getting ready for the upcoming session.
</P>
<P>
   Once Elmore and his then-wife Louise (they were later divorced)
came to Sweet Apple for supper, and Elmore took a marked interest
in all our projects. A make-do lavatory in the guest bathroom
troubled him a little. We didn't want a new one, and old ones were
hard to find. Not for Elmore. He called me from Valdosta one day. A
neighbor of his was tearing down an old house and there was a
marvelous old marble lavatory about to be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want it, Sugar?'' Elmore asked. ``I'll bring it when the
session starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The bellboy at his hotel was surprised at the task of hauling a
bathroom fixture from a gentleman's room to a lady waiting beside a
pickup truck on the curb. Thereafter Elmore would ask, ``How are
things in your bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Elmore was literally reared in the Georgia House. His father and
his grandfathers were members, and so, of course, was their friend
Dick Russell. Elmore graduated from the University of Georgia and
served in the Army as a captain in World War II. He was elected
messenger in the House in 1955, serving the speaker and the members
gladly and taking on the problems of us in the press section.

 &HT;    Willan's cookbook has everything that a cookbook should
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's rare to find a cookbook that not only gives you recipes but
also provides ample explanation of the techniques needed to prepare
them. It's even rarer to find one that tells you what to do if
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We found Anne Willan's ``Cook It Right: Achieve Perfection With
Every Dish You Cook'' (Reader's Digest Books, $29.95) delivers
beautifully on all three points.
</P>
<P>
   The photos are the key to explaining technique. Award-winning
photographer Peter Williams worked with Willan and a crew of 10 for
eight to 10 hours a day over three weeks to shoot photos that
capture the precise moment the lobster is done or the texture of
stiffened scrambled eggs. They averaged a photo every 32 minutes _
no small feat in food photography.
</P>
<P>
   With many recipes, Willan includes ideas for quick fixes, or
ways to salvage a dish when something may have gone wrong. In some
cases, there's nothing you can do, and Willan will tell you so.
Some of her saves:
</P>
<P>
   -- Too much salt in a dish can be counteracted by adding a bland
ingredient, like potato, tomato or mushrooms or a dairy product
such as cream, milk or fresh cheese.
</P>
<P>
   -- For a dry, flavorless roasted chicken, douse with an
Asian-style marinade of soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and
lime juice. Or cut the chicken into pieces, pull meat into shreds
and serve in a sauce or moistened with an herb vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   -- Try topping braised or glazed vegetables that are soft and
tasteless with something crispy, like fried ginger or leek.
</P>
<P>
   But the explanations and tips all work because the recipes are
so good. Just try some of the recipes below, which will allow you
to hone your skills on cooking pasta, steaming mussels, blanching
vegetables and making a caramel sauce. All delicious homework.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti With Red Mussel Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 30
minutes
</P>
<P>
   For this simple, classic dish, seek out the freshest mussels and
ripest tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   4pounds small mussels
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   6garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1pound spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil for the spaghetti.
Scrub mussels under cold running water, pulling off beards with a
small knife. Discard any mussels that do not close when tapped on
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Steam the mussels open: Put them in a large pan, barely covered
with water, cover tightly and cook over medium heat until done (the
shells will have popped open), stirring once, 4-5 minutes. Take the
mussels from the pan, reserving about two cups of the liquid. Cover
the mussels to keep them warm, discarding any that are still
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Make the sauce: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a saute pan, add the
onions and saute until lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic
and continue cooking until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the reserved
mussel juice to the pan, taking care to leave any sandy deposit
behind. Then add the tomatoes and bay leaf and simmer until sauce
is concentrated and just falls easily from a spoon, 5-8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the spaghetti to the boiling water and simmer, stirring
occasionally, until al dente, tender but still firm to the bite,
5-7 minutes. Drain, return spaghetti to the pan and toss with 2
tablespoons olive oil. Transfer to a large serving bowl and keep
warm. Discard the bay leaf from the sauce and add the sauce to the
mussels. Stir to mix, and reheat 1-2 minutes. Taste and adjust
seasoning; salt may not be necessary as the mussels are already
salty. Spoon mussels and sauce over the spaghetti, sprinkle with
parsley and serve.

<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Veal Chops With Lemon and Roasted Red Pepper Relish
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 40 minutes Marinating time: 2 hours Cooking
time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is an ideal recipe for perfecting your chop cooking and
also getting some experience working with roasted peppers, which
can be time-consuming but are well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   1lemon
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup plus 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   4veal chops, cut 3/4 inch thick (about 1/2 pound each)
</P>
<P>
   3red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   2onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup chopped mixed herbs (basil, oregano, marjoram, parsley,
thyme)
</P>
<P>
   Granulated sugar to taste
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Grate the zest from the lemon and squeeze the juice. Combine 1/3
cup of the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a nonmetallic
bowl. Lay the chops in a deep tray and pour olive oil mixture on
top. Cover and leave to marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours,
turning occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, make the red pepper relish: Preheat the broiler.
Roast the peppers under the broiler, turning occasionally, for 7-10
minutes or until the skin chars and bursts. Put them in a plastic
bag or cover them with wet paper towels to loosen the skin. When
cool, peel the peppers, discard the cores and seeds and cut the
flesh into 3/8-inch strips. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a
frying pan. Stir in the onion and garlic and saute until soft but
not browned, 3-4 minutes. Add the pepper strips, herbs, pinch of
sugar, salt and pepper. Saute until heated through and the flavors
are blended, 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Set aside
and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the chops, reserving the marinade. Heat the remaining 2
tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan, add the chops and fry
over fairly high heat until browned, then turn and brown the other
sides. Allow 4 minutes per side for lightly cooked meat, 5 minutes
per side for well-done meat. Transfer the chops to a platter and
keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   To make a jus: skim the fat from the pan, then add the water and
remaining marinade. Stir for 1-2 minutes over low heat to dissolve
the pan juices. Take the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon
zest and chopped parsley. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning,
if necessary. Spoon over the chops and serve with the red pepper
relish.

<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Broiled Scallops With Prosciutto Cream Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20
minutes
</P>
<P>
   When I served this dish to guests, they couldn't stop eating.
But then again, how can you go wrong with wine, butter, cream and
prosciutto? Good practice for cream sauces and seafood preparation.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1garlic clove, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1shallot, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1small carrot, very finely diced
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/3pound button mushrooms, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup cream or creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter, chilled and cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds scallops
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for the grill or broiler rack
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Make the prosciutto cream sauce: Cut the prosciutto in thin
strips about 3/4 inch long. Heat the butter and olive oil in a
saucepan, add the garlic and shallot and saute until fragrant, 1-2
minutes. Add the carrot and saute until carrot begins to soften,
1-2 minutes. Pour in the white wine and boil, stirring, until
reduced by half. Stir in the mushrooms and cook until slightly
softened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in the cream or creme fraiche with the
prosciutto strips and boil until slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the heat to low and gradually whisk in the butter pieces to
make a smooth, creamy sauce. Work on and off the heat, so that the
butter softens and thickens the sauce without melting to oil.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce warm on a rack
over a pan of hot but not boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Discard the small crescent-shaped muscles
at the sides of the scallops. Rinse the scallops and pat dry with
paper towels. Place them on an oiled broiler rack, dot with butter
and season with salt and pepper. Set the rack about 3 inches from
the heat and broil the scallops until done, 2-3 minutes on each
side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, stir all but 1 teaspoon of the parsley into the
sauce. Spoon the sauce on 4 warmed plates, arrange the broiled
scallops on top and sprinkle with reserved parsley. Serve at once.

   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Salty Caramel Sauce With Peaches and Ice Cream
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10 minutes Cooking time: 15
minutes
</P>
<P>
   OK. It took me three tries to get the caramel sauce just right.
Once the sugar starts to brown, things happen fast. The first time
I burned it. The second time I was too cautious and came up with a
tasty but thin sauce. The third time? I used a candy thermometer
and it helped immensely. Was it worth it? You bet. This should
become a standard for Georgia peaches.
</P>
<P>
   6whole peaches
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup salted butter
</P>
<P>
   1cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream (for serving)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Halve the peaches, discarding pits, and set
them, cut side up, in a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle with brown
sugar and dot with butter. Broil about 3 inches from the heat until
the peaches are tender and starting to brown, 7-10 minutes.
Meanwhile make a dark caramel syrup: In a heavy saucepan, heat the
sugar and water, stirring only once or twice, until the sugar is
dissolved. Boil rapidly, without stirring, until the syrup begins
to brown around the edge of the pan. Continue cooking over medium
heat until done, 1-2 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally so the
syrup colors evenly. Once it starts to brown, it colors quickly.
</P>
<P>
   When the caramel is dark, remove the pan from the heat and let
the bubbles subside. Add the butter, stir until smooth, then pour
in the cream. Note: Stand well back, as the caramel will sputter
and foam when butter and cream are added.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Transfer hot peaches to individual plates and spoon
over any juice. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If necessary,
reheat the sauce, stirring until the caramel is completely
dissolved and the sauce is hot. Spoon it over the peaches and serve
at once.

   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter medium-sized muffin pan and
sprinkle with flour, discarding excess. Sift flour, sugar, baking
powder and salt into a large bowl and make a well in center. In a
small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk and oil. Add egg mixture to

batter, or muffins will be heavy. Stir in strawberries and mint.
Spoon mixture into muffin cups, filling two-thirds full. Bake on

   Have trouble finding new ways to get the family to eat veggies?
Try this salad. The spicy peanut sauce is a lively accompaniment to
the fresh beans and sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   1cup crunchy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup hot water, plus more if needed
</P>
<P>
   Soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2pound snow peas, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   1/4pound bean sprouts, cleaned
</P>
<P>
   1/2pound carrots, peeled and cut into julienne strips
</P>
<P>
   6ounces green beans, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Make the spicy peanut sauce: In a blender or food processor,
combine the peanut butter, onion, garlic, pepper flakes, ginger,
sugar and lime juice. Puree until very smooth, adding hot water as
necessary so the mixture churns well. Work in more hot water or
lime juice, adding enough to make a sauce that is thick enough to
coat the back of a spoon. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more
lime juice, soy sauce and pepper. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Add the snow peas
to the water and leave 30 seconds. Drain, refresh with cold water
and drain again. Repeat the process for the bean sprouts and
carrots. Add the green beans to the boiling salted water and cook
until perfectly blanched, 4-6 minutes. Drain, refresh with cold
water and drain again. Arrange the vegetables in individual mounds
on a large serving platter. Serve the sauce separately in a bowl.
The salad may be served at room temperature or chilled.

 &HT;    Three to try: Memphis abounds in fine dining
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memphis
</P>
<P>
   You could eat every meal here in a famous barbecue joint _
Willingham's, Corky's, the Rendezvous _ and convince yourself that
the four food groups consist entirely of pork. Chopped pork, sliced
pork, pulled pork and pork ribs are good enough to keep any errant
greens, grains and vegetables off your plate.
</P>
<P>
   But do try to tear yourself away from pit heaven (if not for
your own sake, at least for your cardiologist's) and sample at
least one of this city's finer dining establishments. With its
metro population topping 1 million, Memphis offers a wide range of
places to break bread _ and not just the white, squishy kind for
mopping up sweet tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three restaurants that could put Memphis on any
culinary map, even a kosher one:
</P>
<P>
   -- Aubergine: This East Memphis bistro, a quiet and
sophisticated haven for ladies who lunch and lovers who dine, got
quite a shake-up with the arrival of chef Jean-Christophe Blanc
earlier this year. Blanc has worked his way through France's finest
kitchens, most recently as sous-chef at Les Pres d'Eugenie, Michel
Guerard's Michelin three-star restaurant in the southwest. Owner
Gene Bjorklund, himself the chef for the past five years, first
invited Blanc to Aubergine for a brief stint as guest chef, but
things worked out so well for both that they've decided to make it
permanent beginning in October.
</P>
<P>
   There is an extra level of finesse in Blanc's food that shows
his training. A lightly dressed pouf of salad greens reveals a few
tiny snippets of herbs and minced bits of shallot clinging to the
leaves, and the flavors register ever so slightly on your palate. A
satiny asparagus and potato soup is as refreshing as cream soup can
be. And a dish of grilled Arkansas quail, marinated with mustard
and herbs and then set over a mushroom fricassee and natural jus,
treats top-drawer ingredients with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Scallops of veal, though, are tough and boring; perhaps Blanc
doesn't yet have the hang of cooking American meat. But they come
with a textbook-perfect brunoise (small dice) of vegetables and an
intriguing side of tempura-battered polenta wedges studded with
raisins and hazelnuts. Considering Blanc's skill, we're willing to
put up with his learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   Open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday and for lunch Tuesday
through Friday. 5007 Black Road, Suite 150. 901-767-7840.
</P>
<P>
   -- Automatic Slim's Tonga Cafe: Most Memphians would agree that
this Caribbean-themed spot serves the hippest chow downtown. The
split-level room across the street from the Peabody Hotel has a
deep downstairs room with a bar running the length of it, and a
smaller upstairs dining loft. The scene is women in short skirts,
sweet cocktails served in martini glasses, and generous portions of
spice-happy food served on Fiestaware. Noise zips through the
electric space, reverberating from both the naked tables and
pressed-tin ceiling, and on weekends an electric violin player adds
his strains to the din.
</P>
<P>
   The Yuparibbean menu brings a tasty ``Island tomato salad'' with
feta and roasted tomato vinaigrette and the house-special
coconut-crusted shrimp with mango relish. The latter were a little
burnt and a little too sweet on the night I tried them. I liked the
huachinango, a whole grilled snapper served with chopped tomatoes,
cucumbers and jalapenos. And I loved the Caribbean voodoo stew, an
enormous portion of shrimp, mussels, sea bass and whatnot in a
spicy, creamy tomato base set around a mound of rice. On top is a
cluster of excellent snow crab legs folded into a showy fan, a kind
of crustacean origami. You'll light up when you see it coming to
your table.
</P>
<P>
   Open Monday through Saturday for dinner and Monday through
Friday for lunch. 83 South Second St. 901-525-7948.
</P>
<P>
   -- Raji: If any non-barbecue restaurant in Memphis has a listing
in the gastronomic Who's Who, it's Raji. Owner Raji Jallepalli has
earned an international reputation for fusing the ingredients and
techniques of French cuisine with the spices of her native India.
Her following includes both Memphis blue bloods who crowd her
converted East Memphis house and a cadre of celebrity chefs and
food writers who join her at culinary seminars and demonstration
dinners throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Foodies love the style of dining at Raji. Each night she offers
a set four-course meal and recommends wines from her intelligent
cellar to match each course.
</P>
<P>
   I've eaten at Raji only once, but I was frankly disappointed by
the menu I sampled. A bland cucumber soup with lovely shrimp is
refreshing for a bite or two, but turns tiresome. Grouper (cooked
to a chewy medium rare) with jalapeno, garlic and ginger has little
of the promised spice but a whole lot of mashed potatoes that you
can tell are gluey from their sheen alone. Pork tenderloin with a
black mustard seed crust sports only a few charred bits of seed
that are discernible to the trained eye, but I don't imagine that
any tongue could actually taste them. The real flavor comes from
the familiar garnish of diced, sauteed apples and a slice of bacon
around the meat; it's not bad, but not memorable. The pot de creme
for dessert is sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the food on the night I visited suffered because Raji
had just come back from a cooking trip and was late getting into
town. I was also among the last customers that evening, after
having cajoled my way into a 10 p.m. reservation. I understand from
reliable sources that Raji can be a brilliant cook. She is
certainly a great hostess, and her personality brings the dining
room to life. I still can't wait to see what she's capable of in
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Open Tuesday through Saturday for dinner. 712 West Brookhaven
Circle. 901-685-8723.

 &HT;    Ancient Peruvian art await visitors to Tennessee's Bluff City on
the Mississippi
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memphis
</P>
<P>
   When the Incas rose to power in the 12th century, they didn't
meet a neighbor in any direction _ along the coastal desert, in the
high plains or throughout the Andes _ that they couldn't conquer.
In little more than 10 years, a small, centralized nation that
numbered its inhabitants in the tens of thousands quickly
transformed into an empire of 10 million and built a civilization
renowned for its architecture, agriculture and metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before the Incan empire, Peru was home to scores of distinct
cultures, each with its own accomplishments in the arts and
sciences. The Moche sculpted expressive facial portraits onto the
sides of pots. The Paracas performed successful brain surgery,
using blades to excise pieces of diseased brain and skull. The
Nazca carved enormous designs in the desert sand, requiring
hundreds of thousands of man-hours and knowledge of complex
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the 35 cultures explored in ``Ancestors of the
Incas: The Lost Civilizations of Peru,'' on exhibit through Sept.
16 at the Pyramid in Memphis. The 300-some objects on display span
3,000 years and range from ceramics, geometric textiles and
ceremonial gold jewelry to several corpses mummified in a fetal
position, ready for their birth into the next world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancestors of the Incas'' is the latest venture from Wonders:
The Memphis International Cultural Series, the municipal agency
that curates splashy exhibits with cross-cultural themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancestors'' probably won't make as big a splash as the
previous show, ``Titanic: The Exhibition,'' which last year drew on
our fascination with that subject to attract more than 600,000
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to ``Titanic'' and other blockbuster Wonders shows such
as ``Napoleon'' and ``Catherine the Great,'' the current exhibit
may seem a bit more cerebral and less showy. But it has its own
thrills. As you enter the exhibition space, the escalator swoops
down through a panoramic photomural of Machu Picchu, the Inca
palace set high in the Andean peaks _ a descent through the steep
terrain of Peru and through its many layers of ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   You begin in an adobe-finished gallery modeled after the
courtyard of Chan Chan, the capital of the Chimu empire. Objects
from different cultures and periods are grouped for their thematic
similarities. In one display, ceramic pots depict eerie
transformations, such as animal faces struggling forth from the
eyes of a potato. An audio guide provides background information on
specific objects, and narrator Martin Sheen gives it his gravest,
get-yourself-into-rehab reading. (A special tape is available for
children.)
</P>
<P>
   One pot depicts the wizened, wrinkled face of an old woman, in
realistic detail. Another is pure abstraction, bordered with a
geometric sea design borrowed from textiles. Unlike other world
cultures, the ancient Peruvians developed textiles before ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   The objects sure to draw the most attention are the three
mummies, creepily well preserved by their many layers of fabric
shroud and the arid climate of their burial sites. The centerpiece
of the exhibit, in a dim, backlit setting, is a 1,500-year-old
sorceress with eight feet of hair coiled down her side and eyes
that seem to follow your movements like a ghastly Mona Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition leads through a gallery that is an
architecturally detailed rendering of Coricancha, a ruin in the
Incan capital of Cuzco built of precisely cut and fit stones.
Inside are 45 gold and silver artifacts unearthed from
archaeological sites of pre-Incan cultures. The famous Incan gold,
you may recall, was melted down into ingots by the Spaniards in the
16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition ends with a gallery depicting large renderings of
the Nazca lines on the carpeted floors and walls, as well as aerial
video footage of these mysterious desert doodles. I found this the
weakest part of the show, as it never quite conveyed the immense
scope and engineering effort involved. But, unlike past Wonders
exhibits, ``Ancestors of the Incas'' is best appreciated in the
small details rather than the grand scope.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ancestors of the Incas: The Lost Civilizations of Peru'': 9
a.m.-10 p.m. daily through Sept. 16. The Pyramid, downtown Memphis.
$12 adults, $11 seniors (age 60 and older), $6 youth (ages 5-16).

 &HT;    As ``Magic Hour'' premires, ``Vibe'' receives walking papers
 &HT;    By Lyle v. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magic in, Sinbad out.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to ex-Los Angeles Laker Earvin Johnson's debut in
``The Magic Hour,'' another late-night talker ``Vibe'' hosted by
the comic Sinbad was cancelled because of low ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vibe'' was designed as a contender for the late-night throne
when it was unveiled last summer with unknown comedian Chris
Spencer sitting in the host chair. It premiered the same week as
another ill-fated syndicated talker ``The Keenen Ivory Wayans
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayans'' was cancelled in February, and although ``Vibe's''
ratings surged when Sinbad took over for Spencer, the show has been
running on fumes for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feedback from advertisers and our core viewers was
terrific,'' says Barry Thurston, president of Columbia Tristar
Television, which distributes ``Vibe.'' ``But in this very complex
and very competitive marketplace, it needed more viewers to sustain
itself.'' ``Vibe'' will stop airing Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Vibe'' was on its deathbed Monday, ``Magic'' celebrated
the birth of a bouncing baby talk show.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, ``Magic's'' first show drew 87,100 households,
finishing second in its midnight time slot to the TBS movie
``Another 48 Hours'' which garnered 103,850 homes.
</P>
<P>
   But ratings don't tell the whole story. Looking robust and
relaxed, Johnson seemed at times to be apologizing for bothering us
with yet another unnecessary gabfest.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite guest on other talk shows, the 6-foot-9 Johnson
explained, ``I always wanted to try the other side of the desk but
these legs just wouldn't fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another square peg on the show is comedian Craig Shoemaker, a
grad of the sycophantic sidekick school who misfired in his opening
joke about the NBA finals game in which the Chicago Bulls
shellacked the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst beating on videotape since Rodney King,''
he quipped as the audience tittered nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent most of the hour playing celeb kissy-face with
guests Arnold Schwarzenegger and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger made an unfortunate remark, calling Johnson and
NBA great Wilt Chamberlain ``two of the strongest animals I've ever
met.'' Later, in a fit of staged spontaneity, Houston revealed her
secret vacuuming fetish. And waddayaknow, there was a Hoover nearby
so she could demonstrate her technique. (Anyone who believes
Houston really cleans her own house, raise your hands.)
</P>
<P>
   Bandleader Sheila E. was the ``Magic Hour's'' lone bright spot.
Wearing a low cut, blue-sequined dress, she played drums like a
woman possessed, ripping up versions of Santana's ``Oyo Como Va''
and Parliament's ``Knee Deep.''
</P>
<P>
   If his ratings hold up, Johnson might survive his 13-week run.
If not, he'll be playing 2-on-2 pickup games with Wayans, Spencer
and Sinbad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Does Bill Cosby have any children other than the son who
died?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.J., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Bill Cosby and his wife, Camille, have four daughters: Erika,
Erinn, Ensa and Evin. The comedian married Camille Hanks on Jan.
25, 1964, while she was attending the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby was shot to death on Jan. 16, 1997, during an
apparent robbery attempt in Los Angeles. Cosby had stopped his car
to fix a flat tire when he was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection began recently in the trial of Mikhail Markhasev,
a 19-year-old Ukrainian immigrant charged in Cosby's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn Jackson, a 23-year-old woman who claims to be Bill
Cosby's daughter, began serving a five-year prison sentence in
April for trying to extort $40 million from Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby testified at the trial that he had an affair with
Jackson's mother in 1974 but does not believe he is the woman's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would I go about getting information on tenants' rights?
</P>
<P>
   _ E.F., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fort Worth Human Relations Commission publishes a Fair
Housing Directory for Tarrant County residents, said Angelica
Orozco, an office assistant with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The free booklet details the rights of tenants and landlords.
For a copy, write to the Fort Worth Human Relations Commission, 908
Monroe St., Fort Worth, TX 76102, or call 871-7525.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the mailing address for New Braunfels' Wurstfest and
the dates when it will be this year?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.V., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Wurstfest, a festival in Landa Park on the banks of the Comal
River, will be Oct. 30-Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $6 at the gate and $5 in advance, but children under
age 12 are admitted free. Scheduled performers include accordionist
Myron Floren, who performed with Lawrence Welk for many years, and
polka musician Jimmy Sturr.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (800) 221-4369 or write to the

TALES OF AN INTERNET ENTREPRENEUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a quick and enjoyable read about life as an
Internet entrepreneur, check out Michael Wolff's ``Burn Rate: How I
Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The term burn rate refers to how fast a company is ``burning''
its capital. On the Internet, where most companies seem better at
spending money than making it, burn rate determines how long your
company has to live. To Wolff's mind, the term also implies that,
sooner or later, everyone gets burned on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, a former journalist, got into the Internet entrepreneur
business almost by accident. His small publishing company created
popular books such as ``NetGuide'' and NetBooks, then branched into
related online products.
</P>
<P>
   Those products made his company an attractive partner for the
Internet's major players, who at the time were hungering for
content to draw customers. By the time Wolff's particular dance
with the big dogs was over, he had made a little money, spent a
lot, lost his company and gained a great deal of wisdom about
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet would defeat everybody _ except the very, very
quickest to alight and then be gone,'' Wolff writes. ``It was a
speeded-up version of culture itself, a series of fads and trends
mixing with social and historical and economic forces and
technological advances and roiled by constant upheaval and sudden
reversals. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   For a taste of Wolff's brisk style, check out the excerpt in the
latest issue of Wired magazine, which describes a failed merger
deal almost chilling in the cold-blooded power plays of the
investment bankers involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the book is worth a read, too, with some
interesting perspectives on America Online as chat-porn megasite
and Microsoft as clueless 800-pound gorilla. And not only does
www.burnrate.com include more information about the 268-page book
and related links, it also includes the book's index.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn Rate'' is published by one of those stuffy old-media
companies, Simon &AMP; Schuster, and costs $25.
</P>
<P>
   Being a computer user often means swimming in an alphabet soup
of acronyms, but here's one PC and Mac lovers alike probably will
get to know well soon: USB.
</P>
<P>
   It stands for Universal Serial Bus, and is a fairly new
technology that replaces the various parallel, serial, SCSI, ADB
and other ports that connect Macs and PCs with everything from
keyboards to modems to hard drives. Though USB has been around for
more than a year, it's not been widely used in existing computers.
</P>
<P>
   Expect that to change this summer. The soon-to-be-released
Windows 98 will include USB as a native part of its code, unlike in
Windows 95, which should dramatically improve the notoriously balky
software problems that have bedeviled the bus.
</P>
<P>
   And Apple Computer's nifty new iMac, to be released in August,
will be the first Macintosh to use the more flexible USB interface
on that platform, further expanding the market.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for peripheral makers to finish converting
their products to the new connection. Companies have been reluctant
to do so, given the reliability problems and smaller markets, but
this summer's changes could push USB-based products into wider
availability.
</P>
<P>
   And with a connection that works on both PCs and Macs, without
the need for adapters or other gimmicks, everyone should benefit
from cheaper prices. Hurrah for that.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz is big over ``Unreal,'' the new computer shoot-'em-up
from Epic Megagames and GT Interactive that just came out to
huzzahs all around the videogaming biz.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: To really appreciate the amazing effects and look
of the game, you need not one, but two 3-D graphics cards in your
computer, said Bill Paris, a writer with Next Generation and Play
Station magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you make the cards work together, but if you
saw it, it'd be worth it,'' Paris raved. ``You'd want to go out and
get another card, just to get the full effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's arrival at Imagine Publishing, whose several computer
publications include both that employ Paris, has virtually blotted
out interest in any other games among the many hard-core players
there, Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   It had to happen, given the nationwide fervor inspired by Beanie
Babies. Now there's a ``complete unauthorized guide on CD-ROM''
called the ``Ultimate Collector for Beanie Babies.'' Blame
Palladium Interactive for this one.
</P>
<P>
   The disk includes just about every smidgen of information a
collector of the little beanbag animals could want, including
variations on the toys' tags, the poem accompanying each type of
toy, their release and retirement dates, item number and value (one
1995 horse Beanie is valued at $4,000, it says), as well as
pictures of the pets.
</P>
<P>
   The database will calculate such things as the value of a
collection, and allow you to track purchases, trades and sales as
you enter your acquisitions into the program.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives you access to a special World Wide Web site that
regularly updates the database's figures. For more information,
contact www.palladium.net, which is Palladium's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, the disk provides WAY more beanie than this baby can
handle. But then again, I'm not the one buying five Happy Meals at
McDonald's to score more Teenie Beanies. There's no explaining the
heart of the collector.

GUESTS GIVE MAGIC AN ASSIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Johnny Carson had to wait 30 years to have a diva
(Bette Midler) sing to him. Magic Johnson, the newest member of the
late-night talk-show circuit, got the royal treatment from Whitney
Houston during his first show Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who also vacuumed the set and joined bandleader Sheila
E. for a second song, showed just how far Johnson's star status
will help him lure big names to appear on ``The Magic Hour,'' (11
p.m. Monday through Friday, KTTV, Channel 11) and just how
comfortable they feel around him.
</P>
<P>
   That is both the show's main blessing and curse. Celebrities
willing to play along make you feel like you are part of the
Hollywood inner circle, but it also leads to contrived bits such as
the vacuuming and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the night's other panel
guest, giving Johnson a blatant set-up line.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzenegger asked why he was the show's first guest. Johnson
went on about how his wife loved Arnold, his kids loved Arnold's
movies and ``Harrison Ford couldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that was funnier than anything sidekick _ and I use the
term loosely _ Craig Shoemaker came up with. During an opening
conversation with Johnson, the show's ``goofy uncle'' unleashed a
Madonna sex joke and one about Rodney King. Has he heard the one
about the Lindbergh baby?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is certainly charming enough to carry a show, and for
his first shot at this gig, he was relaxed and entertaining. He's
already more polished than veteran stage performer Keenen Ivory
Wayans was during his entire talk-show run.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's electric personality was particularly noticeable when
he did a person-on-the-street piece outside of the Chinese Theater
in Hollywood, where he asked regular folks to scream as an audition
for the sequel to ``Godzilla'' he was going to ``produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is billed as having ``60 smiles per hour,'' which may
be an underestimate. Johnson can guffaw with the best of them,
which will further ingratiate him with guests.
</P>
<P>
   If the audience has half as much fun as Johnson seems to be
having, his show could be the rookie that makes the cut.

WHAT'S EMERGING ON HIGH TECH HORIZON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's all about hardware, baby, as both the ShowBiz
Expo and Hi Fi '98 hit L.A. beginning Friday with more big iron
than a convention of blacksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   The Hi Fi '98 show focuses on stereo and home-theater equipment,
with nearly 200 manufacturers taking over 140 rooms (minus the
beds) in the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel and demonstrating to
consumers their latest creations, said spokesman Michael Fremer, a
columnist for Stereophile magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a car show, except you get to test drive the
equipment,'' Fremer said. Fremer suggested bringing a favorite CD,
laser disc, DVD or even vinyl LP along to play on systems, to
better judge the differences between systems.
</P>
<P>
   The show will include demonstrations of high-definition
televisions by the big manufacturers, and nifty new DVD players and
other audio products both cheap and expensive, Fremer said.
Numerous makers of accessories such as cables will be on hand as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The show also will feature a face-off between high-quality
successors to the creaky, 20-year-old CD format. The Super CD and
DSD formats offer much better sound than the current CD format, but
each comes with limitations that have kept either from winning the
battle of succession so far.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous seminars _ including ``how to tune a room,''
question-and-answer periods with Stereophile magazine editors and
help with home theater setups _ will be held during each of the
show's three days, Fremer said. And 22 different bands, about one
every hour the show is operating, will be playing.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day pass to the Hi Fi show is $25 in advance and $35 at
the door, Fremer said. A one-day pass is $20.
</P>
<P>
   The ShowBiz Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center downtown
appeals to a different crowd _ people in the movie business _ and
includes exhibitors showing off everything you need to make a
movie, from coats of armor to lightning-bolt generators to the
Doggiecam, said show manager John Lewinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tools and tips to make movies. It's for the
professional,'' Lewinski said. And the about-to-be professional.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of seminars on four different tracks are a
``two-hour film school'' and ``writer's boot camp.'' Other topics
include digital film restoration, digital television's impacts on
production and independent filming on a micro budget.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speakers include Peter Biskind, whose well-received
recent book ``Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' chronicled the
transformation of the movie business during the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Other top speakers include Peter Bart, editor in chief of show
sponsor Variety, who will talk about the New Hollywood; and WebTV
CEO Steve Perlman and Todd AO president Salah Hassanein, both of
whom will talk about technology's effects on the entertainment
business.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibits-only pass for the expo is $35 per day, and a one-day
pass for the conferences costs $60. Other combinations of three-day
passes also are available. Both shows begin at 10 a.m. Friday
through Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new poll suggests that Elizabeth Dole, head of
the Red Cross, may become the most formidable candidate the
Republicans could nominate for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff of political fantasy. The smart, sophisticated
southern lady would have great trouble overcoming the litmus tests
of the intolerant Republican right wing to win the nomination. But
if she managed that, she could give the Democrats fits in a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   A USA Today-CNN-Gallup trial heat pitting the wife of the GOP's
most recent presidential nominee against Vice President Al Gore,
the expected Democratic nominee, comes up with virtually a tie. She
edges him out by 2 percentage points, 48 to 46, within the polling
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good news for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, in a hypothetical match-up with First Lady Hillary
Clinton, who has not indicated any interest in running, Elizabeth
Dole wins hands down, 55 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Republicans wise enough to go for Dole? Do they have the
courage to be the first to put a woman at the top of a national
ticket?
</P>
<P>
   Would she run? She shows no sign of campaigning, although her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, keeps promoting her in public as a
potential president. Her name pops up regularly on lists of
possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   On paper she certainly has the correct credentials, more
impressive than those of some male GOP candidates currently running
around the country hoping political lightening will strike. She
manages an organization with 32,000 employees and an annual budget
of nearly $2 billion. She has twice been a Cabinet officer. A
lawyer, she has served in the Reagan White House and on the Federal
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In person she is also a winner. Her public performances are
always businesslike, poised and genteel. She charmed the 1996
Republican convention with her composed walk-and-talk among the
delegates praising her husband's abilities. It was generally
considered a bigger hit than his own acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, is enough alone to explain her enduring
popularity. What is her secret?
</P>
<P>
   Her active role in her husband's losing presidential campaign
was supposed to help close the gender gap, the preference that
large numbers of women show for Democrats over Republicans. She was
meant to be the GOP counter to Hillary Clinton, who is a strong
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole did not have any noticeable political impact. Her
husband lost the bulk of the women's vote. The task was probably
impossible in any case. It was his name on the ballot, not hers.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat, she returned to her post at the Red Cross,
where she has been a visible and effective advocate. This is a
white-hat role that reinforces her image as an honorable woman of
disciplined conduct and good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole's personality is softer, more feminine in style
than Hillary Clinton's, which may have much to do with her high
approval ratings. Unlike the first lady, she avoids cutting-edge
policy statements that can offend as well as please. She has always
reflected the senator's views in public and never taken an
independent position.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, she is seen as an able administrator but not a
threatening figure to either men or women.
</P>
<P>
   She has an independent career and is her husband's full
political partner, but she has always played the traditional female
supporting role in public and has let her man have the center
spotlight when they are together. She twice gave up her own career
to campaign with him _ when he ran for vice president in 1976 and
for president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But her principal asset may be a lack of female competition. The
Republican Party has not produced many women of national political
stature, and none can match her name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The next presidential election is two years away, an
eternity in politics. If Texas Gov. George W. Bush is re-elected
this fall, he may burst out of the chute as the GOP favorite with
such force that her name will vanish into the mists of time.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the real question of whether she would run. She is
known as a perfectionist who demands order, precise pre-preparation
and a tidy schedule. Reporters who covered her 1996 campaign
efforts say that she was not comfortable with the hurly-burly,
often chaotic conditions she encountered on the road. It is
difficult to imagine her plunging back into that campaign world in
two years or lusting to assume the complicated, messy burdens of
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But she would certainly liven things up for the Republicans. And
the senator would make an interesting First Husband. Run,
Elizabeth, run.

ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BARGAIN TRAVELING: IT'LL COST YA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HADDAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After one unrelentingly miserable week in Mexico, we were at
last heading home. We hailed a taxi in front of our hotel in
Cozumel. We picked the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heap. It was on its last wheels. The trunk was held
shut with a coat hanger; there were no knobs inside to open the
doors or roll down the windows (they were up).
</P>
<P>
   The interior, in fact, was skeletal. The lining had been torn
away ages ago, and the doors were ribbed metal. Fumes and the
asphalt-heated air from the highway came up from holes in the
floor. It was a long way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Our son, 11 at the time, had not learned how to suffer in
silence. He went into operatic mode, panting, pulling at the collar
of his T-shirt, whining about the heat and wiping at his brow with
exaggerated sighs.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of nowhere, halfway to the airport, the driver
ground the taxi to a halt. He said not a word as he opened the
door, pulling a wrench out of his back pocket as he stood.
</P>
<P>
   This was one big hombre. He came toward the back of the taxi,
opening the door where my son was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   James made a cowering jump into his mother's lap. The writing on
his face was easy to read: ``I'm going to be kidnapped! Murdered by
that wrench! I'll never complain again!''
</P>
<P>
   The driver paid him no mind. He grasped the nub of the former
handle with the wrench and turned, rolling down the window to give
the child some air and hopefully to shut him up. (He may not have
understood English, but he knew the universal language of whining.
Don't we all.) The driver slammed the door, got back in and away we
went to the airport. An uneventful plane ride home, and we were
safe at last.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of boiling temperatures, clouds of flies,
overbooked hotels and crowds of fellow cheapskate Americans, we
vowed never to travel again, and we didn't for four years. We had
been quite thoroughly burned.
</P>
<P>
   We've gotten better. Tentatively, we returned to the road _
several years later, in fact, we returned to Cancun and had a
glorious week in October.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we've learned one important lesson since our first
venture onto foreign soil almost 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There's no such thing as a free taco.
</P>
<P>
   We had come looking for a bargain, expecting paradise at
half-price. We did get a good deal, but it was the underside of
paradise that we purchased.
</P>
<P>
   We have since learned that, like everything else, in travel you
get what you pay for. ``Off-season'' means less than ideal. Sudden
monetary devaluations, if they attract you, are going to attract
hordes of others. And everybody likes the tropics, especially bugs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking about this because of what is going on in Asia now.
Americans will be pouring in, strutting their stuff, expecting the
world on a platter at plastic saucer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are lots of Americans, there are people who have
learned from them some of the less-seemly ways of doing business:
Get away with whatever you can. Praise your product to high heaven.
Make it sound like a steal; Americans can't resist a bargain. Don't
worry about repeat business; the supply of fresh fools is endless.
</P>
<P>
   That free-taco lesson reverberates throughout the travel
business, upscale to downscale: You get what you pay for. If you
don't have the money to do a vacation right _ not necessarily the
top-of-the-line ticket, but not bargain-basement either _ then
don't go, or at least don't expect much.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have a lot better time in your own back yard, swatting
your very own, home-grown flies.
</P>

 &HT;    A&AMP;M football coach Slocum burned by baseball draft
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ One cannot blame R.C. Slocum for never going to another
baseball game in his life, and it's got nothing to do with the
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball could cost the Texas A&AMP;M football coach three prize
football players, or almost 20 percent of his last recruiting
class. It will surprise no one if quarterback Chip Ambres, wide
receiver Choo Freeman and tight end Greg Porter sign major-league
baseball contracts and forego their college football careers. All
three were among the first 80 picks of last week's free-agent
amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Spring Woods safety/wide receiver Robert
Ferguson is not expected to qualify academically and might attend
Tyler Junior College, Slocum might say goodbye to four of his 16
signees.
</P>
<P>
   Ambres, described by some as a better runner but worse passer
than former Longhorn James Brown, was a marquee signee, but
Freeman's potential loss could strike more damage because the
sprinter set a high school state record with 50 career touchdown
receptions. Freeman is said to be asking for a $1.4 million bonus
from the Colorado Rockies, while first-round pick Ambres is
expected to get at least $1 million from the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies did, however, also sign highly regarded quarterback
Vance Smith of Fort Worth Christian, who's a better pro-style
thrower and who was recruited by Tennessee. And Columbus' Matt
Schobel, who might be moved to tight end, could get a stronger look
at quarterback even though he is reportedly up to 250 pounds.
Sounds like Schobel needs to run some bases if he wants to stay in
the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   While I got you:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Duncan's college coach, Wake Forest's Dave Odom, wasn't
surprised by his former player's big splash in the NBA. ``The only
thing that surprised me was he made first-team NBA,'' Odom said.
``I didn't think that would happen in maybe three years. He showed
he could keep his strength up. He always lost weight here from like
250 to 235. MVP? As soon as Michael (Jordan) and (Karl) Malone
leave, you can start talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If Notre Dame is considering joining the Big Ten and perhaps
giving up its lucrative contract with NBC, the sole remaining
big-time independent must be seriously worried about getting
squeezed out of marquee football games and possibly the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   _ Next recruiting season should be ``probably the deepest year
for running backs in Texas in quite some time,'' according to Bobby
Burton of the National Recruiting Advisor. He sees 10 to 12
legitimate NCAA Division I-A running backs. Although none may be in
the Ben Gay-Leo Mills class, recruiters will be out in droves for
Andrews' Shaud Williams, Clarksville's Tyrone Richardson,
Needville's Broderick Williams and Big Spring's Tory Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern Cal pulled off a successful steal of home in its
College World Series title game win with the bases loaded, two outs
and two strikes on the batter, which is exactly why I prefer
college over pro sports. The CWS-record 61 homers are a bit much,
however.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put down Round Rock baseball coach John Langerhans and me in
favor of mandatory best-of-three high school playoffs in Class 5A
in lieu of the coin flip if coaches can't agree on a format. At
baseball clinics, he finds the choice ``almost unanimous'' among 4A
and 5A coaches. His Dragons were eliminated this year in a one-game
playoff with Conroe.
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC and Turner Sports are trying to start up a new pro
football league that will surely die before it starts. Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones doesn't wish bad on the league, saying, ``I'm
here because I like football. I'll be candid with you, anything
promoting football is not a negative.'' Here's an unsolicited tip
for NBC: Trash the new-league concept and offer marquee Sunday
college football games. Because of few quarterbacks and
cookie-cutter offenses, the NFL has stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   _ As for reports that former Texas basketball guard Luke Axtell
might not transfer to Kansas, family attorney Sherry Rasmus said,
``Luke isn't going to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Saw an ESPN report suggesting the major leagues subsidize
college baseball by springing for wood bats at a cost of about
$100,000 a year per team. I've been saying that for years. The move
would help scouts better evaluate college pitchers and hitters and
enhance collegians' development, which would shorten their stay in
the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas assistant hoops coach Ricky Stokes played in a college
all-star game at Portsmouth with an obscure guard out of somewhere
called Gonzaga. ``John Stockton was terrific,'' Stokes recalls. Did
you know Stockton's dad owns a tavern in Spokane?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dallas Cowboys are a might snug with the near-$55 million
salary cap, within about $150,000, but team capologist Stephen
Jones says, ``If we saw a guy to get, we'd go get him.'' He calls
former Texas Christian wideout Jimmy Oliver, a former second-round
pick of San Diego, the team's ``wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If I were Gregg Popovich, I'd pull the trigger and trade David
Robinson for Grant Hill. Spurs need scoring and will not be able to
afford both Robinson and Duncan in two years, and recent playoff
demise reiterates that Robinson _ the ultimate nice guy in sports _
will not lead San Antonio to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Cowboys boss Chan Gailey's offensive playbook at
Pittsburgh was an estimated 200 pages thick. He might even
incorporate a ``Slash,'' a la Kordell Stewart, at Dallas. ``It
might be Deion,'' said Gailey, who needs to be worried that Deion
Sanders will miss some of training camp and not be able to work on
his timing with Troy Aikman. Scrimmages with Oakland in El Paso and
possibly New Orleans in Shreveport will help Gailey not have to
play his regulars so much in the exhibition season.

LOUD RADIOS CREATE UNSOUND WORKPLACE
</HEADLINE>

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: In the facility where I work, there are
no fewer than six or seven individual radios or tape players on at
the same time and playing different selections of music or talk
radio. The level of noise and confusion is irritating and affects
my concentration. The manager feels that this is what the majority
wants and that it is OK. What do you think? M.B.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: What if the majority wanted to bring in their
surround-sound systems and 12-foot speakers? In fact, what if the
majority wanted a one-day workweek? This is not the way to make a
sound managerial decision.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, your work situation is probably going to get
worse. When one employee turns his or her radio or tape player a
little louder, a neighboring employee is almost forced to do
likewise, and this cycle repeats itself until the work area sounds
like a three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   There are many voices extolling the virtues of allowing
employees to bring radios, tape players or headsets to work.
However, no matter what they bring, there can be problems with
employees paying more attention to the music or radio discussions
than to their work. In your situation, not only are the employees
with the radios or tape players distracted, but the noise they
generate is distracting those who share the ambient airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for you and any fellow employees who feel the same
way about the noise to first meet your electronically enhanced
co-workers. If the decibels continue to ring, your next stop is the
manager. His style seems to place major emphasis on being popular.
Be specific in describing the costs associated with the present
racket and let him know that these costs will not make him popular
with senior management.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you deal with a manager who talks all the time? He
thinks he is this great communicator, but he doesn't listen. For me
to get a point across, I have to say it at least five times, and
I'm starting to feel it's just not worth it. What ideas do you
have? R.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Communication is one of the most important managerial
functions, and the one word that does not describe your manager's
communication skills is ``great.'' Great communicators are great
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way for you to go deep into his psyche and reprogram
whatever may be causing him to be in constant verbal overload. All
you can do is try to alter the way he communicates with you.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the day, there are probably times when he
is less talkative, such as in the early afternoon or late in the
day. You should meet with him during one of these quieter periods.
</P>
<P>
   Your approach should be honest and businesslike, and your
comments should be descriptive rather than evaluative. That is,
rather than saying he is too talkative or domineering, describe
specific situations in which more two-way communication was needed.
Be sure he understands the advantages of such communication,
including increased productivity, motivation and departmental
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If you see some signs of improved listening, be sure to give him
positive feedback. But if he still refuses to listen, then it is
time for you to listen to what your better judgment is telling you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any advice on how to survive in a large workplace
that is filled with employees who are constantly trying to get in
good with management? They are rude and bossy, and if you confront
them, they go straight to management. T.I.
</P>
<P>
   A: Being in a workplace with employees who advertise their
adoration for management is not unusual, as many employees expend
at least some effort trying to win points from the topsiders. Can
you honestly say you have never done this?
</P>
<P>
   However, being in a work environment that is laden with rude and
bossy employees is another matter. The first step is to ask
yourself if there is anything you may have done to alienate the
group. If you have tried to deal with your fellow employees in a
fair and open manner, only to be treated rudely in return, the best
approach is for you to continue to try to work positively with
them, while spending time with co-workers who actually know how to
be friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure that the quality and quantity of your work are
excellent, and that management is aware of your solid performance.
Some employees who do not adequately market their achievements to
management can actually resent those who do. You may feel better
about this whole situation if you put a little more effort into
publicizing your successes.

 &HT;    Waco Sports Hall of Fame seeks $2.5 million expansion, more
interactive exhibits.
 &HT;    By J.B. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service Tribune-Herald
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Picture a young sports fan crouching behind home
base while a virtual-reality Nolan Ryan winds up on the mound and
pitches a fastball, which then lands with a thud in the young
catcher's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of hands-on exhibit Texas Sports Hall of Fame
officials think would pull traveling families off Interstate 35 to
visit the Waco museum.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of fame supporters are hoping by 2000 to raise $2.5 million
to almost double the size of the museum and add more interactive
exhibits, educational programs and a sports research library.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide fund-raising campaign for the ``Project 2000''
improvements will begin later this year, with two illustrious
campaign co-chairmen: Former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry and
Houston Astros owner Drayton McLane.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of fame board members say they hope to increase the
visibility and usefulness of the facility, which is the only
comprehensive sports museum in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has the potential to become one of the premier
sports museums in the country,'' said board member Bob Sheehy.
``There's such a love of almost all sports in Texas, plus we have
that natural Texas pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy said the museum has a good track record in its five-year
history in Waco, which should make fund raising an easier sell.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Waco, which funded the $1 million construction of
the original building in 1993, has set aside $100,000 in capital
improvement funds for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   During a presentation last week to the Waco City Council, Sheehy
urged the council to consider pledging $250,000 toward the project.
Council members will consider the request in their budget talks
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 million would allow the Texas Sports Hall of Fame to:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)expand the 15,000-square-foot building to 27,000 square
feet, allowing more exhibit room. Officials say the current hall is
out of room, and many potential exhibits are in storage. For
example, the Waco museum was recently designated the official
repository for Southwest Conference memorabilia and records, but
there's no room for an exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)create a sports research library within the building, with
information on high school, college and professional sports figures
from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)fund a youth education program for use both at the museum
and in schools, involving traveling exhibits and occasional
appearances by hall of fame inductees. The museum would create a
sports history unit to be used in seventh-grade Texas history
classes.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)create interactive exhibits to hold the attention of
children while their parents browse the more static collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that this could become an
educational facility for young people as well as entertainment,''
said Steve Fallon, the hall of fame's executive director. ``That's
why we're interested in having interactive displays.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said visits from schools, summer camps and day cares are
a big part of the reason that the hall of fame's attendance has
steadily increased over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the hall of fame so far this year is up 18 percent
over last spring, and officials are expecting 30,000 visitors by
the end of the year, up from 27,500 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said the admission fee, which is $4 for adults, accounts
for only a small fraction of the museum's revenues. He said the
hall of fame is mostly funded by memberships and donations, much of
it from the Waco community.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he does expect the improvements to increase the
museum's drawing power and boost Waco's tourism potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think attendance certainly will increase,'' he said. ``What
an expansion like this does is allow the city of Waco another
selling point for its conventions.''

DANCE REVIEW: 225 YEARS OF THE ROYAL SWEDISH BALLET  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ As King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of
Sweden rode out from their palace in an open carriage on Saturday
to greet a populace celebrating the king's 25-year reign, the
clouds lifted. The sun shone not only on the plumed helmets of the
king's horse guard, riding with sabers drawn, but also on the
nearby Royal Opera, which, with its ballet company, was founded by
King Gustav III in 1773.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm is awash in anniversaries, not the least of which is
being celebrated in the accurately if oddly titled 225 Years
Jubilee Festival of the Royal Swedish Ballet (1773-1998).
</P>
<P>
   Most companies would choose a bicentennial or a 250-year mark to
offer the kind of historical overview being provided in
performances this week by one of the world's oldest ballet troupes.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Andersen, the Dane who has been the Royal Swedish
Ballet's artistic director for three years, could not wait.
Stockholm was named this year's European Cultural Capital, and the
opera house in which the ballet performs is celebrating its 100th
anniversary this year. Andersen decided that it was time to turn
the international spotlight on a company that has kept itself under
a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the festival's initial mix of old and new, Andersen
reasoned rightly. The productions have been unusual, even
startling, and the intensity of the dancers is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's prime attraction for scores of visiting critics
and theater directors from China, Japan, Europe and America was the
opening bill: four reconstructions of works by Jean Borlin for Les
Ballets Suedois, the notoriously provocative company of expatriates
from the Royal Swedish Ballet based in Paris from 1920 to 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer, who reconstructed the
Nijinsky version of ``Le Sacre du Printemps'' for the Joffrey
Ballet in 1987, have shown their usual erudition and theatricality
in working with Cole Porter's sole ballet score in ``Within the
Quota'' and with Borlin's little-known ``Dervishes.'' But their
spectacular re-creation of Fernand Leger's Cubist decor and
costumes and of Borlin's geometric choreography in ``Skating Rink''
was the program's highlight. ``El Greco,'' the fourth ballet on the
all-Borlin bill, was rechoreographed in an apt Expressionist style
by the Swedish choreographer Ivo Cremer.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to this avant-garde of the 1920s, the festival
recalled the Royal Swedish Ballet's beginnings with performances in
two gemlike royal court theaters outside Stockholm. On Monday night
at the Drottningholm Court Theater, which still uses 18th-century
stage machinery, the company danced two works in a pastoral genre
that Cremer based on 18th-century ballet pantomimes.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of Baroque dance, mixed with 20th-century ballet
technique, prevailed in works by Mary Skeaping (``Return of
Spring'') and by Regina Beck-Friis (``Pygmalion'' and ``Opportunity
Makes the Thief'') on Saturday afternoon at the Confidencen Theater
at Ulriksdal. Kjerstin Dellert, the Swedish soprano who has guided
the renovation of the theater with Princess Christina, the king's
sister, told the audience that when Martha Graham saw it in ruins,
she said one could feel the energy of those who had performed
there. ``She told me, `Recreate the theater,' and I did,'' Ms.
Dellert said.
</P>
<P>
   Restored to its rococo charm, the theater nonetheless recalls
that a golden age in the arts ended with the assassination of
Gustav III at a masked ball in the opera house in 1792. Since then,
the Royal Swedish Ballet has had more than its share of ups and
downs. A renaissance during the Romantic era and in the 1950s has
not concealed the fact that Stockholm, unlike Copenhagen, is not a
ballet capital. Drama, as personified by the director Ingmar
Bergman, and opera take pride of place.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Rolf de Mare (1888-1964), the Swedish
founder of Les Ballets Suedois, and his star and choreographer,
Borlin (1893-1930), would be regarded as provocateurs by a
conservative ballet audience in Stockholm, where they were reviled
by the press.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, they were free to produce a still-startling ballet
like ``Skating Rink,'' which, like all four Borlin re-creations on
view, received an astonishingly intense performance from the
Swedish dancers on Friday and Saturday at the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hodson, an American, and Archer, a Briton, originally
reconstructed ``Skating Rink'' in 1996 for the Zurich Ballet, and
here, as in their first productions of ``Dervishes'' and ``Within
the Quota,'' they bring a forgotten work to life and make us
understand it. How much is Borlin's choreography is debatable, but
as usual this team of scholars has captured the style and spirit of
each ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skating Rink'' (1922) shocks even today by its intensity and
emotional cruelty. Inspired by a 1920 poem by the Italian Futurist
poet Riciotto Canudo, the choreography translates his images of
sexual tensions within a circling group of roller skaters at a
working-class rink. Like Canudo, Borlin made his truly infernal
round a symbol of the maelstrom of life.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography's simulated skating is a marvel as the dancers
step and stop, swing an arm across the stomach and bend a leg back.
The relentless, measured tread is emphasized by a fascinating and
insistent modular score by Arthur Honegger.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Les Patineurs,'' Frederick Ashton's ice skating ballet,
``Skating Rink'' is not charming. Its sketchy plot recalls Kurt
Jooss' ``Big City.'' Here, too, a working-class lad loses his girl
to an outsider in a top hat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Borlin's flattened style is more modernist, and the dancers
themselves become mobile Cubist shapes in bright colors that fuse
miraculously with the abstract forms above them on Leger's
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Within the dissolving patterns, individual characters come into
relief. A sailor rescues a tottering skater and woos her.
Repeatedly the women with marcelled hair and in heels hug men who
look like Jean Gabin wearing a cap. Inspired by the apache dances
of the 1920s, the embraces are tight and become the ballet's
leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble renders the choreography's kaleidoscopic detail
with astonishing precision, and the principals perform with
dramatic intensity. Jan-Erik Wikstrom has a striking deadpan
serenity as the poet who seduces Marie Lindqvist, mesmerizing in
her doll-like simplicity as the heroine. Anders Nordstrom has an
almost unbearable desperation in a fierce portrayal of the lover, a
study in human disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   That the heroine faints or dies while the whirlpool skating
continues at the end adds to a genuine pathos. In all, it is rare
to see dancers give so much of themselves in ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This is true also in the three other ballets. In ``Dervishes''
(1920), Hans Nilsson is riveting, looking positively ecstatic and
spent as he throws his head back as the head dervish in a spinning
solo once danced by Borlin. Ms. Hodson used a film fragment to
create new choreography for 10 men (the ballet once used five):
five dervishes and five soldiers who join them.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Skating Rink'' does in a different way, ``Dervishes''
succeeds through its changing patterns and use of repetition. The
mosque interior, based on Georges Mouveau's original design, and
the Orientalist motifs from Glazunov's ``Danse de Salome'' suggest
more than a pastiche. The other dervishes (Goran Svalberg, Brendan
Collins, Olof Westring and Joakim Stephenson) are impressive in
their concentration.
</P>
<P>
   An equally committed performance comes from Per Sacklen as an
angular tormented figure in a loincloth in ``El Greco'' (1920),
which Cremer rechoreographed in a neo-Expressionist style based on
images that Borlin drew from El Greco's paintings. Desire-Emile
Inghelbrecht, a French conductor, composed a turbulent score that
matches the Mouveau backdrop inspired by two paintings, ``Storm
Over Toledo'' and ``The Burial of the Count of Orgaz.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``El Greco,'' the tale of a Swedish immigrant who sees
America as a dream factory in ``Within the Quota'' (1923) works
chiefly as a historical curiosity. The jazz-tinctured music by a
young Cole Porter is overwhelmed by Charles Koechlin's
orchestration. One can only smile at the satirical parade of
Hollywood types pursued by a Puritan as envisioned in a scenario by
the American expatriate Gerald Murphy, whose tabloid backdrop is
faithfully reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Swedish Ballet has yet to show off its pure classical
technique in the festival. But in ``Quota,'' Carl Inger's acrobatic
immigrant, Collins' elegant black entertainer and Madeleine Onne's
dazzling flapper stand out with a projection that any ballet troupe
would envy.

 &HT;    An Atlanta firm is helping patients apply for insurance
benefits. For hospitals, the side effect is fewer unpaid bills.
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Taylor of Smyrna underwent several operations
last year to improve his blood flow. The problem comes from a
hereditary vascular condition that killed his mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 43, had no health insurance. But the surgeries were
performed at Cobb Hospital, and eventually he gained Medicaid
benefits that paid for most of those costs and subsequent medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had applied for the benefits with the aid of Clarissa
Urrutia of Atlanta-based Chamberlin Edmonds &AMP; Associates. Urrutia
and the firm guided him through the bureaucratic maze that
encumbers the benefits process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would never have occurred to me to sign up, even though I'm
totally disabled,'' Taylor says. Without Chamberlin Edmonds, he
says, ``I would have been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin Edmonds bases its business on a population largely
ignored by the U.S. health care system: the uninsured. It's the
biggest such operation in Georgia. The private company contracts
with Cobb Hospital and 100 other hospitals, 60 of them in Georgia,
helping to convert uninsured patients into Medicaid and Medicare
beneficiaries, and to obtain disability benefits for them. Patients
with bare-bones insurance also can get new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That way, hospitals recoup costs that normally go unpaid -- and
that eventually lead to higher medical charges for insured
patients. Those unpaid bills run into the millions of dollars.
Hospital costs in caring for uninsured patients in the state
totaled $638 million in 1996, or 8 percent of their overall costs,
according to GHA, an association of Georgia hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Government offsets some of those costs. But at the same time,
the number of uninsured has steadily climbed, despite a vibrant
economy. An estimated 1.3 million Georgians, or 20 percent of
residents under age 65, have no health insurance. Nationally, the
estimate is 41 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some remedies are coming. Coverage is being extended to
thousands of children in Georgia -- and millions nationally --
through a new federal-state initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin Edmonds, though, concentrates on disabled adults.
Such disabilities include cancer, AIDS, some cardiac disease and
major mental illness. Overall, Chamberlin Edmonds says it has
helped more than 100,000 patients in 11 states gain benefits. For
hospitals, it has recovered more than $300 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Starkey, owner and chief executive officer, helped found
the company 12 years ago, starting with a single hospital in
Thomasville. Now it has 170 employees and plans to expand further
in the Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most renowned in the Southeast,'' says Cathy
Dougherty of Gwinnett Hospital System, also a client.
</P>
<P>
   In launching the business, Starkey knew how confounding the
health care system could be. And she knew how delinquent medical
bills can devastate a family.
</P>
<P>
   Son John, adopted at 3 months, has autism, and the family dealt
with gaps in its insurance in getting services for him. Later
Starkey worked in health care programs for the state Department of
Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were thousands of people disrupted and disjointed
by medical catastrophe,'' Starkey says. ``It is a terrible
financial and emotional strain for a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm helps hospital patients apply for Supplemental Security
Income, based on financial need and disability, which qualifies
them eventually for the federal-state Medicaid program. They also
can apply for Social Security disability insurance benefits, which
would allow them Medicare coverage. Once benefits are approved, a
hospital's bills can get reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (patients) can't get to the Social Security office or
can't get all the medical evidence together,'' says Fabricio
Barrera, assistant regional commissioner for the Social Security
Administration. The company, he says, ``helps us provide better
service to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's free help for the patient. Chamberlin Edmonds gets a
percentage of what the hospital recoups.
</P>
<P>
   For Grady Memorial Hospital, Starkey's biggest client and a
``safety net'' provider, caring for the uninsured is a primary
mission. About 40 percent of the Atlanta hospital's patients have
no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barbier, CFO for the Grady Health System, says that in 1996,
Grady referred 4,472 patients to Chamberlin Edmonds. Of that
number, 1,901 were approved for benefits, 913 were rejected and the
others are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent deal for Grady,'' said Barbier. Chamberlin
Edmonds, he said, has generated more than $10 million per year for
Grady.
</P>
<P>
   The company is an advocate for patients as well. ``They walk
them through an incredibly bureaucratic process. The patient's
bills get satisfied, and they get benefits that continue.'' The
payoff also has been good for Walter Paterson, 35, of Atlanta. He
was diagnosed with HIV this year as an uninsured Grady patient.
Now, with Medicaid benefits obtained through Chamberlin Edmonds, he
gets coverage for a multidrug cocktail that has improved his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Paterson says, ``did all the paperwork for me.
Thank God for them helping me.''

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: Wireless wizardry
benefits consumers
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago, when BellSouth bought Wireless Cable of
Atlanta and began collecting licenses to offer wireless, it sounded
like a throwback. I remembered television by microwave antenna more
than two decades ago, when many cities looked to that technology as
they waited for cable operators to get around to wiring the urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   It was always a kind of second-class system, a service that
wavered when trees were in leaf and with which the signal was not
the same quality as cable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week BellSouth finally unveiled what it had in mind: a
digital update of the old service that has now leapfrogged what
most cable customers get. Up to 160 channels of entertainment,
nearly a third in pay-per-view channels. Unlike satellite
broadcasting, another cable rival, the new wireless can offer local
channels as well as the full array of cable offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operators are not caught by surprise. In fact, all across
the country some of the fastest steppers in the video business are
phone companies, satellite distribution companies and others that
have been increasing their share of the multichannel television
market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable's share of that market slipped to 87 percent last year,
according to testimony to Congress last October by Decker Anstrom,
president of the National Cable Television Association. Now an
estimated 11.5 million households nationally get a multichannel TV
service, and cable's share has slipped further to about 85.5
percent, according to the NCTA.
</P>
<P>
   Dire as this may seem, cable companies like MediaOne here are in
the middle of upgrading their service to digital and will have
offerings that look very much like the BellSouth service.
</P>
<P>
   But while all the players are racing toward a digital finish
line, BellSouth now has parachuted into the game and could grab
restless cable customers waiting for a change.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jeff Kagan, the media consultant who has tested the
BellSouth service, how he compared the traditional cable service to
the new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture is sharper, you have greater parental control over
when the TV can be on and what channels can be viewed, and the
built-in TV guide is superior,'' Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said he liked the ``near'' television-on-demand, in
which a popular movie will be available at many starting times, so
you don't need to wait hours for a selection of choice.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits to the BellSouth service. For reasons of
geography the line of sight broadcasts cannot reach all households.
Where permissible, some of that gap is being filled in by selective
wiring of certain communities.
</P>
<P>
   Other phone companies, such as Ameritech, are relying upon
wiring or are building competitive digital systems that are mirror
images of the updated cable systems -- in places like Chicago,
Detroit, Cleveland and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth game plan, with its flexibility and mix of
wireless and wired, allows it to move faster and more cheaply to
garner a share of the television market.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that the BellSouth plan does not necessarily
take customers from cable. Logically, it might appeal to customers
who have been using satellite service but always wanted convenient
connections to local TV, or it might appeal to newcomers or people
with no service at all.
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain is that BellSouth is right on time for the
Atlanta consumer who loves the latest, is fascinated by technology
and loves to be first on the block with what's hot.
</P>
<P>
   Will BellSouth capture those customers for all time? Probably
not. Cable has a card to play: It will be able to offer digital
video, phone service and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   But the glory of these developments, and so much else in these
days of exploding technology, is that consumers will have more
choices. The competitive heat is turned up, and the race has picked
up in pace.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Next January, for only the second time in two
decades, someone other than Marion Barry will be sworn in as mayor
of the District of Columbia, the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   What that will mean for Washington is still unclear, but many
observers think it will be a positive development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like turning over a new leaf,'' said Charles Harris,
professor of political science at Howard University in the district
and author of a book examining the relationship between the city
and Congress. ``You have new hopes and you wait and see what is
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One might argue it could hardly be any worse than the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The city's population has dropped from 606,000 in 1990 to
about 529,000 last year, its lowest level since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1987 to 1997, Washington had the highest murder rate
among cities with more than 400,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its schools are a shambles. Washington has the lowest test
scores of any school jurisdiction in the metropolitan region. Last
year, the schools opened three weeks late to system-wide roof
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   _ In recent years, city services were so bad that the overloaded
morgue had to stockpile bodies on gurneys without body bags, the
water system was declared unsafe for three months in a row, and the
city-run nursing home shut down.
</P>
<P>
   _ The city-run prison in nearby Lorton, Va., was run so poorly
and lost so much money that the federal government took it over.
</P>
<P>
   _ City agencies responsible for public housing, foster children
and the mentally ill have been placed in court-ordered
receivership.
</P>
<P>
   _ Washington's potholes are legendary; whole blocks have parking
meters without heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sad that the nation's capital has become a
national joke,'' said Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., chairman of the
Senate subcommittee that sets appropriations for the District.
``The city was in a terrible condition, a catastrophic condition.
You pick the part of the city that was not out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Much, but certainly not all, of the blame for Washington's
problems can be laid at Barry's feet. As Washington's mayor, Barry
controlled a government that performed not only city functions, but
also state functions such as housing prisoners and providing
welfare and Medicaid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry always had a not-so-silent partner just 13 blocks
away: the U.S. Congress, which still holds ultimate power over the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, Congress granted the city home rule
authority, giving it a large degree of autonomy over its own
affairs. In the last few years, Congress has largely taken it away.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, with the city's finances in disarray and
charges of corruption swirling around Barry's associates, the
Republican-led Congress created a control board with authority to
override the city government in slashing the bloated bureaucracy
and imposing fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Congress went even further, stripping Barry's
authority over nine major city departments and giving it to the
control board.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, after Barry appointed a new police chief, Congress
took away his power to fire the chief without the control board's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the board adopted sweeping reforms of city
regulations in such areas as zoning, professional licensing and
issuing environmental permits _ areas traditionally the purview of
a city council.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many residents of the capital of the world's
foremost democracy consider themselves second-class citizens with
less of a voice in their political destiny than the residents of
U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has always viewed this as the nation's capital,
whereas city residents have viewed it as the District of
Columbia,'' said Joseph McCormick, an associate professor of
political science at Howard University.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington had an elected mayor and city council for
half of the 19th century, it was governed by a federal commission
for nearly 100 years until Congress approved home rule for the city
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, in 1978, was the second mayor elected under the home rule
charter, winning again in 1982 and 1986. His bid for a fourth
consecutive term was interrupted by his conviction on drug
possession charges following an FBI sting operation in which he was
videotaped smoking crack cocaine with a woman in a district hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   After six months in prison, Barry won a city council seat in
1992 and then trounced Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly _ the reformer who
couldn't deliver _ in 1994. Last month, he indicated he didn't plan
to run for re-election, although he avoided specifically saying he
wouldn't run again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one reason for his decision is that being mayor of
Washington isn't what it used to be. Nor is it likely to be again,
at least in the near future. Where the mayor once controlled more
than 35,000 employees, he now runs the 400-person recreation
department and some small municipal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who becomes Washington's next mayor _ and there are
already five major candidates _ he or she will have to cope with
the control board and its appointed chief management officer,
Camille C. Barnett, who operates much like a city manager.
</P>
<P>
   The new mayor also will have to work closely with Alice Rivlin,
the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, nominated last
month by President Clinton to be the control board's new chair.
</P>
<P>
   That means two white women will hold the two most powerful
positions in a city whose population is more than 60 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation that set up the control board, it is
supposed to operate until the city has a balanced budget for four
consecutive years. Last year was the first, and this year's budget
also is expected to show surplus.
</P>
<P>
   So the incoming mayor will have to deal with the control board
for at least two more years, assuming the budget remains balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question is whether, in a post-Barry era, Congress
might restore some of the powers of which it stripped the mayor in
the past two years. That will depend on congressional, as well as
city, politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Republican Congress is still there, you're likely to see
powers continuing to be stripped away from the mayor's office,''
said Ron Walters, a professor of African-American studies at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Plotkin, a political commentator on American University's
WAMU radio, said he agreed with Barry's charge that the
Republican-led Congress has been ``mean-spirited'' toward the
district, but said that behavior will be harder to justify after
Barry is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Barry was there, the Republicans had a (reason) to
do anything to punish D.C.,'' Plotkin said. ``Without Barry, it
will be more difficult. The citizens of the district were penalized
for electing Marion Barry.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the Howard University professor, suggested that even if
Republicans retain control, there will be a better relationship
between the city and Congress in a post-Barry era, at least until
the new mayor establishes a track record.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, who has used his chairmanship of the appropriations
subcommittee to dictate policy to the District, is up for
re-election this November. Whether he keeps a hand on the
district's finances will depend on that election, and on whether he
chooses to remain chairman in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Faircloth's view, ``we need to put in place a structure to
prevent the destruction of the city we have seen over the last 20
years.'' For him, that means some form of city manager with closer
oversight by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew F. Brimmer, the control board chairman whose term was
extended for three months when it expired at the end of May, has
suggested that much of the city's governance be transferred
permanently to a trio of professional managers responsible for
management, finances and an independent inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the city will ever return to a strong mayor form of
government _ as it had before Barry's power was stripped _ is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not what he advocates, Walters sees the next mayor
as potentially a transition figure toward a weak-mayor, city
manager form of government which is more beholden to Congress _ a
step back from the home rule era and the heady days when Washington
politicians pressed for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Ross, professor of public administration at American
University, said that although other large cities operate well with
a city manager, many ``yearn for a strong political leader with
brokering skills and coalition-building skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Washington's contentious history, much of which is driven
by racial politics, Ross predicted that a weak-mayor form of
government would be politically unpalatable for the city's
residents, who already view themselves as politically downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gillette Jr., a professor of American civilization at
George Washington University and author of a book on the district's
history, said that regardless of who the next mayor is Washington
will continue having the same structural problems it has had for
nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to clear the air, but the problems are not going to
be over without Barry,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Walters said people have ``wrongly pointed at (Barry) as the
person responsible for all of this. They've gotten it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, Walters and other argue that regardless of who runs
the city government, unless fundamental changes are made in its
relationship with Congress, problems will persist.
</P>
<P>
   Because Washington is a city without a state, it has many of the
same responsibilities that a state performs, but does not have many
of the offsetting revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cities, Washington has seen an explosion of retail and
commercial activity in the suburbs of Maryland and Northern
Virginia. In 1992 and 1993, for example, the District added 29,000
square feet of new retail space, compared to 2.6 million for the
Maryland suburbs and 5.8 million for the Virginia suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But while other cities surrounded by bustling suburbs are able
to recoup much of the retail tax revenues generated outside their
borders through revenue-sharing with their states, solitary
Washington cannot share in any state's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Washington _ unlike, for example Atlanta _ cannot
share with a state in the income taxes generated from city workers
who live in the suburbs. Since it approved home rule, a progression
of Democratic- and Republican-led Congresses have rejected the idea
of a D.C. commuter tax on suburban residents.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban workers account for just over half of the income
generated in the District, according to a study by the Center for
Regional Analysis at George Madison University.
</P>
<P>
   The Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, a Ralph Nader-founded
organization, estimated the District could receive nearly a
half-billion dollars a year if it was allowed to tax suburban
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to the District's difficulties, the city depends
largely on the federal government to determine how much the
government wants to pay in lieu of taxes for the billions of
dollars worth of property it owns in the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal payments run about $660 million a year, but the
Appleseed Foundation suggests that the federal payment should be in
the range of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 1, 2000, marks the bicentennial of Washington becoming the
nation's capital. Gillette thinks the anniversary will spark
renewed efforts among city residents to claim a greater political
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next year and a half there will be a lot of attention
to this form of governance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not likely to happen, Gillette suggests a solution
that regularly surfaces in discussing Washington's future. If
Congress is unwilling to grant it statehood _ it would be 1/28th
the size of Rhode Island _ perhaps there should be a regional
referendum to determine whether the district should be revert back
to Maryland. A precedent for that was set in 1846 when the Virginia
portion of what was plotted for the district reverted back to
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick, the Howard University professor, recalled a sign that
used to greet motorists who drove into Washington from suburban
Maryland. It read: ``Welcome to Washington, D.C., the Last
Colony.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress became increasingly critical of Barry, it treated
Washington more and more like a colony. Reversing that trend will
be the biggest job for the city's next mayor.

TV NOTES: A SUMMER JOB FOR FOX; ABC WEIGHS A 2ND ``60 MINUTES'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to expand on its effort to keep viewers from taking a
vacation from network television in the summer, Fox announced plans
Tuesday to infiltrate the next couple of months with a strategic
assortment of new programs, highlighted by seven original episodes
of its long-running soap opera, ``Melrose Place,'' and its first
attempt at a news magazine since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will also try a new series of stunts related to the Guinness
Book of World Records, a group of original movies and a few other
new episodes of existing Fox shows. In all, Fox said, 42 percent of
its programming will be original this summer, up a modest 2 percent
from last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fox's intent is to continue expanding the new programming
in July and August, when the broadcast networks' offerings have
traditionally been dominated by repeats. This ``see you in
September'' attitude has only encouraged viewers to sample cable
channels. A result has been further erosion of viewers who watch
the networks.
</P>
<P>
   All the networks have agreed that taking off in the summer makes
no sense, and have moved to sprinkle new fare among the repeats.
But Peter Roth, the president for entertainment for Fox, has made
halting the summer viewer exodus something of a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me stubborn,'' he said. ``Each year the number of
original shows should increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Fox's most ambitious effort was a dramatic series
set in fourth-century Ireland called ``Roar.'' It proved a
disappointment. ``We learned some lessons last summer,'' Roth said.
``The reality-based shows do better than new dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he said, he is hoping that ``Guinness World
Records: Prime Time'' will catch on. Various world-record-breaking
stunts will be attempted in the show, which is to be broadcast on
Tuesdays at 9 p.m. starting on July 28. But the new series sure to
draw the most attention is ``Fox Files,'' a news magazine from Fox
News, which thus far has provided only regular programming for the
company's all-news channel.
</P>
<P>
   The news magazine will be anchored by Catherine Crier and Jon
Scott and will be broadcast on Thursdays at 9 p.m. starting on July
16.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Fox summer strategy is ``Melrose Place,''
which will return with new episodes on Mondays at 8 p.m. starting
July 27, picking up on the cliffhanger with which the last season
ended in April. Roth noted that ``Melrose Place'' began its run in
1992 in the summer ``and it proved it can work there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to broadcast seven original episodes of the series
through the end of the summer, building to another cliffhanger on
Sept. 7, with a new season of ``Melrose Place'' beginning the next
Monday, Sept. 14, at 8 p.m., just before the season premiere of
``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Fox did especially well with a miniseries version of
a Dean Koontz best seller, ``Intensity.'' The network will repeat
that on July 1 and 2, and will offer a new movie based on another
Koontz book, ``Hideaway,'' on July 8. Another original film,
``Disaster at the Mall,'' about a robbery at a shopping mall during
a flood, will be broadcast on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines, Magazines
</P>
<P>
   For months people inside and outside CBS News have been poking
and prying and practically listening at keyholes for gossip about
whether a second weekly edition of ``60 Minutes'' will be
authorized. The move is opposed by the producer and correspondents
of the Sunday night program but supported by Leslie Moonves and Mel
Karmazin, the top executives at the network, who hope the clout of
the ``60 Minutes'' name will bring in millions of viewers another
night of the week.
</P>
<P>
   So intense is the media interest that newspapers reported
Tuesday on what was essentially a kaffeeklatsch on Monday between
Karmazin and the ``60 Minutes'' correspondents, along with the
deputy executive producer, Phil Scheffler (Don Hewitt was in Canada
receiving an award at the annual Banff Television Festival). Each
side listened congenially to the other's arguments, and nothing was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While ``60 Minutes'' staff members were lavished with attention,
the other CBS news magazine, ``48 Hours,'' has been quietly revving
into overdrive to produce two nights a week of ``48 Hours,'' at
least until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Zirinsky, the executive producer, calls her show ``the
little engine that could.'' Its latest investigative story, to be
broadcast Thursday night at 10, has new information about the car
crash that killed Britain's Diana, Princess of Wales, and her
companion, Dodi Fayed, last summer. It includes previously secret
testimony to the French police from the bartender who served drinks
to their limousine driver, Henri Paul, before the crash and who now
says that he was told to lie to investigators about Paul's alcohol
consumption.

 &HT;    Samsung stops chip production to raise worldwide prices
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Samsung Austin Semiconductor said its production
would not be affected by a plan by South Korean parent Samsung
Electronics Co. to temporarily stop production on memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of memory chips,
said recently it was stopping production in its factories for a
week to combat a worldwide glut in memory chips that have dropped
prices on the products.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cryer, a spokesman for Samsung Austin, said the company's
$1.3 billion memory production plant in Northeast Austin would not
be part of the work stoppage. ``We're still moving into our second
phase of production and we're ramping up here,'' Cryer said. ``We
will continue that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin plant is scheduled to reach full capacity by late
summer or early fall, he said, producing 64-megabit DRAMs for
customers including Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cryer said some of the chips that are produced in Austin may be
held up at packaging plants in Korea, but that memory chips will be
received by Samsung's clients on time. ``They have made provisions
to make sure that all of our customers will be getting chips on
schedule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung Electronics' announcement came less than a week after
Hyundai Electronics Co., South Korea's second-largest producer of
memory chips, suspended production for seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have cited falling memory prices and
overproduction for their production halts. But while the companies
are counting on cutting back supplies of chips to spur demand,
Bruce Bonner, an analyst at research firm Dataquest, said the
production suspensions may not have the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that happened just about the same time last
year,'' Bonner said. ``They've tried to do this before without
success. In the short term, it looks good because they get higher
prices. But prices will eventually drop and go back to where they
would have been in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dataquest, prices have fallen about 25 to 30
percent in the last five weeks for 16-megabit and 64-megabit DRAMs.
South Korean companies Samsung, Hyundai and LG Semicon account for
about 40 percent of the world's memory chip production. This

 &HT;    Motorola's severace package revealed to Austin employees
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Motorola Inc. gave preliminary details about a
voluntary severance package to employees recently, the first step
in slashing 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, where the company has about 10,000 employees, workers
received an e-mail about the package.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola will make the severance package available to employees
whose age and years of experience at the company add up to 75.
Employees who opt to receive the package will receive a week's pay
for every year of service and other benefits depending on their
length of service.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola spokesman Scott Stevens said the company is asking
eligible employees to decide whether they want to take the package
by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restructuring, Motorola has said it will
consolidate its semiconductor manufacturing and its messaging,
information and media businesses. Poorly performing businesses will
be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed pricing pressures and a weak Asian economy
for slow revenue growth and what it says will be
lower-than-expected earnings this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Hurst, a spokesman for Motorola's Austin operations, said
for the next week and a half, teams at Motorola will meet to
discuss cost cutting. So far, no specific job cuts have been
announced, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's interested in how Austin's going to be impacted,''
he said. ``We don't have all the answers today, but we're putting
together plans to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin is home to Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, one
division of Motorola that was targeted in Thursday's announcement
for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   While cuts are expected in SPS, which employs most of Austin's
Motorola workers, Hurst said the company is still hiring engineers
and focusing on expansion plans for some of its operations.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Free, shareware programs can enhance Net experience
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is truly a wonderful and mysterious
place. Besides offering information on how to do anything from bake
a cake to get rid of fleas, it's also the world's biggest source of
both free and inexpensive computer programs.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few hours, you can get dozens of programs that will
help you use the Internet more efficiently. Even if your current
Internet provider included free Web browsing, e-mail and newsgroup
software, there are still plenty of programs that will save you
time and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with Net.Medic. It gives an accurate reading of your
connection speed. Most folks don't understand that modems
constantly adjust in speed, based on line conditions. So, just
because you logged on at, say, 26k bps, that doesn't mean you'll be
operating at that speed later.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a free demonstration version of this software at
http://www.vitalsigns.com
</P>
<P>
   /product/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Are you still using the e-mail program built into your Web
browser? If you are, you can make sending and receiving e-mail
(especially when files are attached to the e-mail you get) easier
by using Eudora Lite, a free version of Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Just set your browser for http://eudora.qualcomm.com
</P>
<P>
   /freeware/. You'll find versions of this program for both
Windows and Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
   Virus protection is increasingly important. But there's no real
need to buy a commercial anti-virus program. There are excellent
anti-virus programs available free or as shareware (where you
download the program and use it free and only pay if you find it
useful). Payment is on the honor system, and the fee is usually
much less than you'd pay for a program that you'd buy in a store.
</P>
<P>
   You can read about several of these programs -- in a list that
includes both shareware and free programs -- at http://tucows
</P>
<P>
   .pcihost.com/virus95.html.
</P>
<P>
   The next program is one most Internet providers hate. You'll
have to let your conscience be your guide here, so I'll tell you
how the program works and you decide if you'd like to try it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers automatically disconnect you after a
certain number of minutes if you aren't sending e-mail, browsing
the Web or downloading programs. The trouble with that is some
providers also disconnect you when you're actually using the Net
but just not sending or receiving information.
</P>
<P>
   There's software around that fools computers and the provider
into thinking you're actively using the computer. That way, you
don't get disconnected. You can get one of these programs at
http://tucows.pcihost.com
</P>
<P>
   /discon95.html.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems with writing a column like this is knowing
what programs you need and use. Some folks could profit by a better
newsgroup reader; others need to find a new browser or a File
Transfer Protocol program that does a better job of downloading
than when you use a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are sites that offer entire menus of downloads --
almost every program you can imagine for using the Internet. One of
these sites is called Stroud's Consummate Winsock Applications and
can be found at http://cws.internet.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you never download a single program there, you'll learn
a lot about the Internet and the possibilities that it offers by
simply browsing the descriptions of what is available. You may find
just the thing to solve a problem you have.

PROM DATE GETS OFF ON WRONG FOOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prom season has come and gone. The ill-fitting tuxedos have been
returned to the rental shops. The dresses have been dry cleaned and
hung at the back of the closet where terminal clothes go until mom
and dad forget how much they cost. Many pleasant or traumatic
memories will resurface each time the lovely photos are shown to
unsuspecting guests.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all of this leaves me wondering if there is some sort of
connection between this smoke in the sky and all the socks that
disappear from the dryer. Why don't they disappear in pairs anyway?
Could it be some conspiracy by sock manufacturers where one of the
socks is designed to disintegrate after the third washing? Think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, proms have really changed. When I was in high school, we
went to the prom with dates who were driving their parents'
``good'' car. We stayed until the prom was over and then we went to
IHOP and ate pancakes before going home.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Now the dates arrive in stretch limos as long as
your house. They stay at the prom about half an hour, then retire
to hotel suites for the all-night after-party. Just the thought of
that almost makes me want to go back to high school. I say almost
because one of my worst memories of high school involves the prom.
To make a long story short, I got stood up my sophomore year. Well,
maybe that's too short.
</P>
<P>
   It was the junior-senior prom but my boyfriend was a junior so I
was one of a handful of 10th graders planning to attend. The day
before, I had my hair styled into this elaborate beehive. I slept
on my face all night to keep from messing it up. That morning, I
painted my nails crimson red. My mother said that harlots wore that
color, but she wasn't home and it was her polish. Three hours
before the party, I started getting dressed. Every article had been
debated and carefully selected just for that occasion. I was ready
30 minutes early. My parents took pictures of me standing by the
pecan tree in our yard. At 6 o'clock, I went into my room so that I
could make a grand entrance when my boyfriend arrived. Two hours
later, I was still there. That's when my mother finally overruled
me and insisted on calling my date.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember much after that. I don't remember what his
excuse was. I don't remember getting undressed. Nor do I recall
taking all of the bobby pins out of that beehive. Maybe my mother
did it. I can't even recall the guy's name. I only remember crying
until my eyes turned as red as my nails, and I remember the look of
anger on my father's face. That's all; the sound and the fury.
</P>
<P>
   After that, I had huge trust issues, self-esteem issues,
depression and a host of other emotional problems. I didn't recover
until I met this other really neat guy about a week later. In
retrospect, I should have known something was strange about that
prom date of mine. Other guys had dice or air fresheners hanging
from their rearview mirrors; he always had one, clean sock dangling
there. Live and learn, people. Live and learn.

 &HT;    Just for Fun: Printer accepts images from digital camera
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Canon's Digital Printer CD-200, which ships next
month, claims to be the industry's first color printer to accept
and print images directly from a digital camera's Compact Flash
card.
</P>
<P>
   Designed primarily for use with Canon digitals, this printer is
compatible with most digital cameras that use the CF card and that
use JPEG compression.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a virtual ``digital darkroom,'' the CD-200 produces
4-by-6-inch glossy photo prints, without the need for a PC. Each
print costs less than $1 per copy and is delivered in about a
minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Compatible with PCs and Macs, the printer allows users to print
still images from TV programs, camcorders and other video sources.
It also allows images to be displayed on a TV monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-200 has an estimated retail price of $699 and can be seen
at the company's Web site: http://www.ccsi.canon.com.
</P>
<P>
   More than a printer
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp UX-2200CM is a six-in-one color inkjet machine. The
company claims it's the world's first multifunctional device to
have infrared direct print and data transfer capability. That's a
fancy way of saying you can hook it up to your computer wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for the small office/home office market, this
multifunction machine features a plain-paper fax, color printer,
scanner, copier, PC fax and phone in an affordable, compact unit.
</P>
<P>
   The printer produces documents in up to 600 dots per inch, at a
rate of up to three pages per minute. Like other multifunctions,
the real advantages are price and space consumption. The device
sells for a fraction of the cost of buying each unit individually
and takes up a fraction of the space of separate units.
</P>
<P>
   Build your dream home
</P>
<P>
   Bob Vila, America's favorite do-it-yourselfer, has teamed up
with Mindscape and the Learning Company to create a software tool
that will help users conceptualize, plan and build the home of
their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Though designed primarily for new-home builders, the two-CD Bob
Vila's Home Design also offers hundreds of tips for remodeling and
adding to existing homes.
</P>
<P>
   This comprehensive program contains a suite of 2-D/3-D drafting
and drawing tools, an encyclopedia of more than 1,000 home plans,
animated tours, and video and audio tips from Vila. There are also
links to an ``Ask Bob'' Web site, where Vila or his staff will
answer e-mail questions on personal home design projects.
</P>
<P>
   With a library of blueprints, design symbols for interiors and
exteriors, and a roof editor for dormers, chimneys and skylights,
this program, which retails for $40, will help users plan in 2-D
and view in 3-D almost any home up to 30 stories.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, visit the Web site
http://www.learningco.com.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at sound
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmic Shower is the '90s version of the Lava Lamp, only
better. Created for the Sharper Image by electronic artist Joseph
F. Lozowski, the Cosmic Shower is an interactive light sculpture
that responds to your voice, music or other room sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-tall clear tube is zapped electronically to produce a
complex pattern of brilliant green arcs, which descend in
successive waves through multiple levels.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the stereo and watch music become visible, as the light
patterns change with the tempo. Green spirals form and dissolve to
the beat, and twists and ripples of light dance through the tube,
from top to base, then in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Users can vary the speed of the display over a wide range, from
slow for meditation and relaxation to fast for high-energy action,
or alter the light pattern and sound sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for low energy consumption, the Cosmic Shower retails
for $299. To learn more, visit the Web site

 &HT;    Mac News: Bargain program handles personal information well
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A program called Consultant is the best new personal
information manager to hit the Mac market in years -- and it's a
heck of a good deal, too.
</P>
<P>
   For about $50, you get a calendar and electronic card file
largely the equal of programs costing twice as much. And, in some
cases, it's easier to use and more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   What's the catch? You can only buy Consultant over the telephone
or the Internet, which eliminates the cost of expensive packaging,
shipping and marketing. That's why the program is so inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant is representative of a larger trend in software. The
Internet is becoming the distributor of choice for software
developers, who are increasingly trying to entice customers to buy
online rather than in stores.
</P>
<P>
   For Mac developers, this trend is particularly important. Most
stores carry little if any Mac software. Not surprisingly, sales of
Mac software are continuing to fall, and developers are struggling.
They are desperate for ways to cut costs, and the Internet is one
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Consultant is distributed, it would be a good
piece of software. It's sharply rendered and attractive. The
program is also responsive and offers some novel twists on features
common in other personal information managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant, though, does have its weaknesses. For one, the
program won't let you save searches and sorted information. That
means there's no way to save a list of frequently consulted
contacts. This is a standard feature in most personal information
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also has no printed manual. Like a growing number of
programs, it has eliminated a manual to save costs. But Consultant,
unlike many other programs, does have excellent help within the
program. There's even more help available on its Web site and in an
electronic manual, which you can download.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Consultant works like most personal information
managers. It has a calendar with multiple views, a to-do list, an
address book and a memo writer.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you link contacts, notes and documents outside the
program to a to-do or appointment -- all standard stuff today. What
makes Consultant special is some novel twists on these common
features. Take its translate button.
</P>
<P>
   Click the button, type ``meet Bob for lunch at noon Friday'' and
Consultant will turn it into an appointment on that day.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant also offers strong word processing features. You can
keep a daily journal and write memos and notes. Memos can be
formatted like text in any word processor, changing fonts, rulers,
etc. You can also save templates for things such as faxes and

 &HT;    Tech Tools: New computer brings enough pain to share
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm writing this on my new 400-MHz computer, and I'm
not having as much fun as you might think.
</P>
<P>
   I have come to dread new computers. Used to be, getting a
computer was the most exciting thing in the world. I was like a kid
at Christmas. Now I'm like Scrooge. It's more work than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens when a new computer arrives at my house:
</P>
<P>
   I shove my current computer to one side of the desk and set the
new one up on the other side. Nothing is hooked up but keyboard,
mouse and monitor. I've got to get a bunch of stuff from the old
computer onto the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody sent me a gizmo to back up a computer using a VCR. I
haul it out and hook it up. It's complicated, and I think, although
I'm not sure, that I've got the right cables. Unless the VCR is
hooked to a television set, you can't tell what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I set out to back up about 500 megs of files. It's
slow, folks. Takes all evening. At 1 a.m., I rewind and attempt a
playback. Nothing there. Wrong cables, I guess. One entire evening
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening I decide to try another approach. From a dusty
corner of the bookcase, I haul an old copy of LapLink and install
it. The program promptly announces it's too old for this version of
Windows 95 and probably won't run right.
</P>
<P>
   It's right, it won't. But it seems to run fine in DOS. So I hook
the two computers up with the parallel cable provided and start
transferring. It's fast, and things go well. Another evening down
the drain, but with good results.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening, it's time to prepare my old computer to begin
the trickle-down process to my wife. Format the drives, reinstall
Windows 95, shove her current computer to one side of her desk, set
my old one up on the other side and repeat the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is punctured by various alarms over whether she can
find the disks to reinstall this program or that program, whether
all of these files or those files have been successfully
transferred, and so forth. There is much gnashing of teeth and
pulling of hair.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to wipe clean both of the fixed disks on her
old computer and prepare them for the trickle-down to my daughter,
and I suppose I'll have to prepare my daughter's current computer
to trickle down to my granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   In the cobbler's house, you see, everyone wears shoes, but since
the cobbler is an expert on shoes, no one else need even bother to
learn how to tie their laces.
</P>
<P>
   All right, enough with the whining. I'm sure you all want to
know just how wonderful my new 400-MHz Gateway is.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's certainly very nice, but for those of us whose
demands are not great, I believe we have reached the outer limits
of performance.
</P>
<P>
   My old computer was a 200-MHz machine. The new one seems a
little faster on the Internet, but in running the programs I
normally use -- Microsoft Word, for instance -- there's scarcely a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are thinking of buying a new computer, and your needs
are not that great, I wouldn't spring for 400 MHz. I'd think along
the lines of 300, no more. Get 64 megs of RAM -- that'll probably
help more than extra processing speed.
</P>
<P>
   But really, I've hardly gotten to use the thing. I haven't run
any games on it. I haven't put any of the DVD stuff in the DVD
drive, chiefly because none of it interests me, but I will.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, and feel my pain.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Paris court ordered Ralph Lauren to stop selling
knockoffs of Yves Saint Laurent's tuxedo dresses in 1994, the
message was clear: Fashion, at least in France, can be subject to
protection from the scheming scissors of competitors. But here in
the United States, should a simple blue-and-white-striped shirt
enjoy similar sanctuary?
</P>
<P>
   That is what a federal judge in Columbus, Ohio, will have to
decide when he considers a lawsuit filed by Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch,
the clothing store, against its competitor down the mall, American
Eagle Outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, filed on June 2, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch complained
that American Eagle had engaged in a ``deliberate and intentional
pattern of copying the Abercrombie brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Among its examples, Abercrombie said American Eagle's use of the
letters ``AE'' on baseball caps was a direct knockoff of the ``AF''
letters that decorate Abercrombie's hats. It also cited the use of
the word ``performance'' on labels and advertising and the use of
the words ``outdoors'' and ``authentic.'' American Eagle has turned
out copycat versions of everything from Abercrombie's crew shirts
to its striped blouses to T-shirts, the suit argues, and sells them
in a way intended to confuse buyers about who made them.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox in all this, many retail analysts say, is that
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch itself has thrived by offering a middle-class
knockoff of the collection of preppy duds designed by higher-end
companies like Polo Ralph Lauren. And just about every mall store
has aped preppy looks at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dealing with basic merchandise here,'' said Dorothy
Lakner, a retail analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer in New York. ``We see
the same things from American Eagle, Abercrombie, and we would
throw in the Gap while we are at it. And Ralph Lauren is the
epitome of classic looks and merchandise. No one company has a lock
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie doesn't see it that way. In its suit, the retailer,
which was recently spun off by the Limited, claims a proprietary
right over color combinations of red, blue, gray and tan and
striped designs. It also contends that American Eagle has knocked
off its fake college sweatshirts favored by crew teams.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike, say, a Louis Vuitton handbag, most Americans, retail
experts say, would be hard pressed to look at the blue-and-white
striped shirt cited in the exhibits to the lawsuit and immediately
proclaim its designer. And Abercrombie sweatshirts that depict a
pair of lacrosse sticks seem to be little more than brand-name
versions of what is sold in college bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is taking something from the public domain and claiming
trademark rights on them,'' said Kim Landsman, an intellectual
property lawyer for Patterson, Belknap, Webb &AMP; Tyler in New York.
``It is like Harvard doing a crew shirt and Yale imitating it and
then Cornell imitating it, and Yale sues Cornell.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, American Eagle's latest retailing strategy has
worked. Its sales and the price of its stock have taken off in the
last year as the company, which has 326 stores, has captured the
attention of less affluent young people than Abercrombie's target
shopper with its cheaper take on casual clothes. Net income, which
fell to $5.9 million in 1996 from $7.1 million the year before,
rose to $19 million last year. As a result, a stock price that was
a mere $3 at the beginning of 1997 closed Tuesday at $33.875, down
$1.125.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie, with 159 stores and net income of $24.6 million
last year, has been a hot retail stock; Tuesday its shares closed
at $44.4375, up 6.25 cents. American Eagle executives say they were
selling several clothing styles before Abercrombie, and they deny
that they copy the retail chain. ``It's a frivolous suit,'' said
George Kolber, American Eagle's chief operating officer. ``We have
been in this business for 20 years, at which time they were selling
pool tables and pens. So who is copying who?''
</P>
<P>
   American Eagle, which was founded in 1977 and went public in
1994, had been floundering, offering looks that were too young and
edgy for its traditional 20-something shopper who also bought
clothes at Gap and J.C. Penney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, American Eagle hit an all-time low after a terrible
Christmas. The company regrouped and decided to return to its
outdoorsy, casual looks. ``We went for key items,'' said Laura
Weil, chief financial officer at American Eagle. ``Graphic
T-shirts, which we have been doing for years. We have been trying
to build a brand for years.''
</P>
<P>
   American Eagle's use of its own name, initials and other words
on its clothes has become more prevalent in recent years, Ms. Weil
acknowledged. And there is little debate that American Eagle's
merchandise and advertising look very similar to those used by
Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has said that inherently distinctive
elements are protectable,'' said Landsman, the lawyer. ``But they
have left it to the lower courts to figure out exactly what that
means. And what gives Abercrombie a possibility of claiming
trademark rights is that it is a combination of elements and not
just one item.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, knockoffs are a nightmare for almost every design house.
Plenty of companies make their living by taking furious notes from
Paris and New York runway shows and producing much cheaper versions
for mass consumption. Gianni Versace lamented it openly and often
to retailers like Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   But only in rare cases do designers or apparel companies take
their complaints to court. Tahari Ltd., a line of career clothes,
sued Donna Ricco Inc., a dress manufacturer, in 1995, accusing it
of trademark infringement and unfair competition. The case was
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Abercrombie case is likely to be closely watched
by lawyers and all types of retailers. The neon-colored Taco Cabana
restaurant chain, for instance, succeeded in stopping another
Mexican restaurant from using its color and design motif, setting
the stage for contemplation in the courts about what exactly is a
protected use of a color, shape or marketing campaign. But the
challenge is determining where that distinction begins and where
the fair use of something in the public domain _ a crew shirt or
the look of a baseball cap _ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being very pro intellectual property is seen as protecting
art,'' Landsman said. ``But the public domain is important to art,
and it is important to commerce.''

DON'T LET BUG SPRAY BUG YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, June 10) 
 By DAVID GRIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many Manatee County residents, I am worried about this
malathion thing.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials are considering spraying the insecticide
over parts of west Bradenton to kill the few remaining
Mediterranean fruit flies that have not already succumbed to media
hype.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the spray is perfectly safe, as if it were
planning to spray our neighborhoods with a fine mist of Diet Coke.
The trouble is, many of us _ myself included _ know malathion as an
evil-smelling chemical that is sold in lawn and garden stores in
brown plastic bottles with the word WARNING! repeated over and over
in the directions.
</P>
<P>
   It requires homeowners to suit up in goggles, a breathing mask
and a long-sleeved shirt so as to avoid having this perfectly safe
substance come in contact with our skin or any other parts of our
body that we wish to remain functional.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, malathion has a huge image problem that the government
needs to correct if it is to win public support for its spraying
program. First off, the government should probably stop advertising
malathion as the insecticide equivalent of Diet Coke. Some people
don't like Coke, diet or otherwise, and the thought of a cloud of
the stuff swirling through their doors and windows is not likely to
change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers might appreciate malathion more if it were compared
to Mountain Dew, while the baby boomers might be swayed by a
comparison to bottled water or herbal tea.
</P>
<P>
   The government might want to take this one step further and hint
that malathion is not only safe, it has many therapeutic side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Who would not support an aerial spraying program that promised
whiter teeth and clearer skin, not to mention dissolving those
unsightly hand warts? Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of
malathion can help you lose lots of weight fast and also halts the
aging process in the sense that you cease to get any older.
</P>
<P>
   People with breathing disorders may find that their condition
improves with deep inhalation of malathion mist. Clogged or
constricted airways are reamed cleaner than if you had snorted a
handful of Drano.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Drano, how many people know that malathion makes an
excellent dessert topping? Not many, I bet.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficial qualities of malathion need not be limited to
humans. Since it works so well at killing Medflies, who's to say
that malathion would not be equally effective at eroding those
baked-on wads of love-bug carcasses cemented to the grill and
windshield of your car? Residents of West Bradenton could also be
advised to take their good silverware outside on spraying days as
malathion makes an excellent tarnish remover.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seems to be suffering from stress nowadays, so it
might be a good idea to promote the tension-relieving qualities of
malathion. A mere five minutes a day of good, deep inhalation
relaxes the back and neck muscles as if you were being kneaded and
pounded by a gorgeous Swedish massage therapist, gender of your
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gorgeous Swedish massage therapists, the government
might want to start the rumor that the malathion spray they plan to
use contains 20 percent Viagra that can be absorbed directly
through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the claim is false, the sight of thousands of West
Bradentonites running naked around their back yards might be enough
to scare the Medflies to death.
</P>

DWIGHT YOAKAM FINDS HIS WAY `HOME'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prodigal plowboy is back.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Yoakam's new album, ``A Long Way Home,'' is his first
collection of all-new material in three years, and it signals his
return from an eclectic musical pilgrimage that had him mimicking
Sinatra and offering up suicidal Christmas carols.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``A Long Way Home'' is his first album (out of 11
on Reprise dating back to 1986) that includes only self-penned
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight succeeds here where other, like-minded innovators have
inexplicably failed: He has drawn himself back from the jagged
cliffs of lofty experimentation to the rock-solid music that is his
domain. His forays into acting (''Slingblade,'' ``The Newton
Boys'') have not diluted the innovation he brings to his music.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we're reassured that this is really our hangdog,
hip-swaying Bakersfield bard, delivering spirited country music
once again with his deliciously self-affected whine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same Fool'' leads off with an infectious dance beat, echoed by
another cut on down the playlist, ``I Wouldn't Put It Past Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's first single is ``Things Change,'' one of Dwight's
patented mysteries, a voyeuristic glimpse into a crumbling affair.
Lyrically, we know little of what went on before this freeze-frame
scene, only that it's much different now. A guitar throbs as the
scene plays out.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most stylistically interesting songs is ``The Curse,''
which is just that: ``Don't have happy thoughts for a while, don't
you even smile,'' Dwight warns an errant girlfriend, ``These are
the things I wish for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Another is a '50s-style country-pop radio ballad ``Yet to
Succeed,'' complete with staggered, rounded phrasing, and a full
string background with occasional steel guitar stabs. A quivering
bass solo hangs in front of the listener like a mirage on an arid
desert highway.
</P>
<P>
   Along about cut No. 6, ``A Long Way Home'' begins to exhibit its
only flaw _ a midpoint sameness like a stretch of straight road
between two mountain ranges. ``These Arms,'' ``That's Okay'' and
``Only Want You More'' are more variations on a honky-tonk theme,
but they actually serve as filler for meatier stuff toward the end
of the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight's most earnest, least-affected vocal delivery of the
project is ``I'll Just Take These,'' a lovely ballad with the
clarity of a clear summer evening. A fiddle accompanies Dwight's
sorrowful tone, the antithesis of his trademark disaffection.
</P>
<P>
   Want irony? The sultry cowboy has always been a champ at that.
``Listen'' would seem to be a quiet plea for understanding from an
agitated lover, but no, the placating lyrics are delivered
full-throated. He's trying to be heard, he says, ``over the sound
of your fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two cuts, when paired, are crazily eclectic in that
quirky Dwight way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveler's Lantern'' is an old-time mountain ballad,
definitely Dwight digging back to his Appalachian roots with banjo
and fiddle accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the album closer is, of all things, an Elvis sendup.
``Just somethin' I worked up,'' Dwight drawls before all the
hippy-shake stuff starts. ``M-m-maybe you like it, m-m-maybe you
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   We like it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 stars.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting the homeless
</P>
<P>
   Dwight fans also should check out a new CD on his producer Pete
Anderson's own label, Little Dog Records: ``Will Sing for Food: The
Songs of Dwight Yoakam.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a charity offering to benefit the homeless, and it includes
14 cuts of Yoakam's greatest tunes (donated without royalties by
Yoakam) done by a distinguished and eclectic bunch of artists, none
of them superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Best cuts include David Ball's ``This Time,'' Reckless Kelly's
``Please Please Baby,'' Sara Evans' ``The Distance Between You &AMP;
Me'' and Rhonda Vincent's ``I Sang Dixie.'' And the Gillian
Welch-David Rawlings turn on ``Miner's Prayer'' is memorable.

YELTSIN VOWS TO LAUNCH DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO END VIOLENCE IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, seeking to
forestall a NATO military incursion in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, promised on Tuesday to undertake a personal diplomatic
effort with the Serbian leadership in an effort to defuse the
violence there.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a day of talks with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Yeltsin said NATO action would ``destabilize the situation in
the Balkans with unforeseeable consequences for all of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, German officials seem increasingly inclined
toward charting a military course to stop the violence in Kosovo,
where Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, has cracked down
on an independence movement in the province, pitting government
forces against ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more delicately we proceed, the greater are our chances
for a settlement of the conflict,'' Yeltsin said. It was not clear
when his effort would take place or exactly how it would be carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   NATO defense ministers are to meet in Brussels on Thursday to
discuss the fighting in Kosovo, which has inspired deep concerns
here about the likelihood of waves of refugees flooding Western
Europe. Germany took in hundreds of thousands who fled during and
after the Bosnian war and makes no secret of its aversion to
providing shelter for more Balkan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The ``contact group'' on the Balkans _ the United States,
Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Russia _ is to meet at the
foreign ministers' level in London on Friday, along with Japan and
Canada, to discuss Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Ruehe, the German defense minister, said on Tuesday that
it was crucial for the NATO ministers to examine military plans to
augment economic and political pressures on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kohl said at a joint news conference with Yeltsin
that Germany _ Russia's biggest trading partner and creditor _
would offer ``decisive support'' for Moscow as it seeks to contain
an economic crisis and pursues economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures contribute significantly to increasing the
confidence of foreign investors,'' the chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Both German and Russian officials ruled out any further
injection of German money, saying Kohl's backing for Moscow's
reform measures was enough. ``Chancellor Kohl's personal support,
as a major international political figure, is important to
demonstrate that our policies are correct,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is Russia's closest European political ally, and Bonn's
backing is seen as important as Moscow seeks financial support from
the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, Kohl likes to depict
Yeltsin as a personal friend, seeking to base his diplomacy on a
network of personal relationships typified by his longstanding
friendship with Francois Mitterrand, the late French president, and
by the special friendship he has declared with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the personal relationships, though, it is often
difficult to disentangle diplomacy from domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, in particular, faces the nettlesome problem of trying to
win an unparalleled fifth term of office in elections in September.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his Social Democratic electoral opponents
resurrected the criticisms they lodged when Kohl met with Clinton
last month, accusing the chancellor of stage-managing media
coverage, in this case by barring television cameras from a
breakfast Tuesday with Yeltsin and Gerhard Schroeder, Kohl's
opposition challenger, who ranks in opinion surveys as Germany's
most popular politician.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials denied orchestrating the blackout, saying
Russian officials insisted on it to avoid becoming ensnared in
Germany's domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kohl ruled the sound bites with Yeltsin, reflecting
his campaign strategy of building voter support on his reputation
as a statesman _ not only as Europe's longest-serving leader, but
also as the key European interlocutor for the men he likes to call
``my friend Bill'' and ``dear Boris.'' Since the election campaign
has begun, Kohl seems to have let it be known that he sees
friendship as a two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   While not quite so effusive as Clinton was, Yeltsin referred on
Tuesday to the German leader's international stature in remarks
that seemed intended to feed into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl and his Christian Democrats, in office for almost 16 years,
lag behind the Social Democrats in opinion surveys. But in recent
days, Kohl has received some heartening news suggesting that the
vote on Sept. 27 will be closer than was assumed a few weeks ago. &QL;

   AIRPORT-MALLS _ It is not easy to squeeze into a dressing room
with two pieces of carry-on luggage and a laptop to try on a pair
of jeans. And the sight of three airline captains hovering over a
table of pink lingerie at Victoria's Secret still draws a second
glance. But such scenes are quietly becoming as integral to air
travel as jet lag, weather delays and nondairy creamer. A number of
airports, somewhat surreal spaces where travelers were once content
to buy a few magazines and stare nervously at a clock, are starting
to look a lot like malls. By Jennifer Steinhauer.

SAN DIEGO IS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HADDAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Everything was so new, so clean, so easy, it made me
a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a real place? I wondered as we stepped into the
refurbished airport, slipped across the skybridge to our car-rental
bus and were whisked away to pick up our shiny little Chevy, all
within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I really began to wonder after we hit the road. The palm trees
along freshly paved Harbor Drive were so new they looked rented.
More landscaping was going in, still perky from its pots. Traffic
was silky. The road curved along the bay, where unbarnacled boats
bobbed in the pale green water.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I was thinking. ``This couldn't be real. We've landed in
the middle of a giant amusement park. That car-rental guy was
actually a ticket-taker, and now I'm on a ride through a new
megapark called SandiWorld. I'm actually not driving this car; it's
being guided by electrical currents beneath the fake asphalt.
Right?''
</P>
<P>
   Show me a homeless guy sprawled out under one of those palm
trees. Show me somebody pierced. Then I'll believe that San Diego
is a real city.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we were ensconced in our high-rise room at the thoroughly
modern Hyatt (the airport is in the middle of town, making
everything suspiciously convenient). At the hotel, everything was
perfect, extra pillows and all.
</P>
<P>
   We took a stroll next door, through an area called Seaport
Village. About 50 cute little quonset-hut-shaped shops, with names
like The Seasick Giraffe, specialize in such things as refrigerator
magnets, shoes, beachwear, shells, rocks and lots and lots of craft
collections. Is somebody going to stamp my hand so I can come back
tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the dream dispersed, but it took awhile. Surely San
Diego was a real place, I thought. With 2.1 million people, there
were bound to be a few misfits; they just weren't ganged up where
visitors could see them easily.
</P>
<P>
   That's because San Diego has remade itself for tourists,
especially families. With Disney-like determination, it has cleaned
up its harbor, brought in hotels, refashioned a historic area
called the Gaslamp Quarter and made it all easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   All that work has made tourism the No. 3 industry in San Diego.
This city tries harder, if not a little too hard.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Three things put a city high on a family's must-visit list: 1)
It's clean and safe; 2) it's easy to get to and get around in; 3)
it's got something worth seeing.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's tourist areas are as clean as a corporate whistle,
and safety was never a problem on our visit. Getting around was a
snap. And with only three days, we too soon ran out of time to hit
just the high points.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to do central San Diego without a car, but with
a family I wouldn't recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   You can leave the car in the hotel lot for days at a time,
though, if you use the Old Town Trolley. It's a bus system for
tourists. You can get on at any stop, hop off when you want, then
get back on and keep going around. The city's top tourist spots are
on the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you'll have to put up with the jaunty banter and limp
jokes of the tour guide/drivers.
</P>
<P>
   We went across the bay bridge to Coronado Island for a peek at
the Pacific and a look at that Victorian hodgepodge of turrets and
cupolas called the Hotel del Coronado. Said our tour guide, Big Al
Your Pal: ``The hotel has had a lot of famous guests. In fact,
Orville Redenbacher would pop up here occasionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole tour is about two hours, but I doubt that you could
handle that much banter all at once. You'll want to get off and
look around. We hopped off at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   What puts the world-class San Diego Zoo a cut above are the
natural settings of the exhibits: a rain-forest feel in one area,
desert in another. Most of the cages are minimalist. There's a
sense of freedom for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   We took a zoo tour on the double-decker bus _ the place is that
big. Then we doubled back to linger at the spots that interested
us. Eat your Wheaties. There are lots of hills and dales. And
you'll pay a lot for those Wheaties. A cheeseburger, fries and
large lemonade came to $9.37.
</P>
<P>
   Other trolley stops include Balboa Park, where the museums and
gardens are concentrated, and the historic area of Old Town, with
its Spanish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Get another great overview of San Diego by taking a boat trip in
the harbor. The guide with Harbor Excursions was knowledgeable,
especially about all the naval ships docked on both sides of the
water, and didn't try so hard with the jokes. One of the aircraft
carriers we passed was the USS Taraway. It's twice as long as the
tallest building in San Diego, which is the Hyatt, at 40 stories.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We began to break free of the well-traveled tourist routes by
our second day. Gaslamp Quarter is what New York City's Times
Square will be in a few more years, I suppose _ most of the sin has
been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   It's a refurbished section of Victorian houses and businesses
near downtown; serious restaurants, boutiques and art galleries
have moved in. The tattoo parlors are on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   The rain came down that night. A thick, permeating drizzle grew
into real rain, then backed off into mist. It was a refreshing
touch of imperfection. Uncle Walt would have never permitted such a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The weather improved the next day. We drove north up the coast;
here, the towns of northern San Diego County hug the sea-foaming
hills. It's a southern version of the Oregon coast.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first points north is Cabrillo National Monument, a
tribute to the Portuguese discoverer of the area. A lighthouse sits
on a promontory, a most glorious view with the bay on one side and
the ocean on the other. They say the whales can be seen from here.

dietary supplement. Officials at the FDA call it something else: an
illegal, unapproved drug. On June 15, in Salt Lake City, a federal
judge will be asked to determine who is correct. The case is being
watched as a pivotal battle between the food and drug agency, which
is chafing against a 1994 law that left it almost powerless to

industry, which has been growing wildly since the law was passed.

`NOTHING TO FEAR' FROM N. KOREA, S. KOREAN LEADER DECLARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung agreed Tuesday to a gradual, tit-for-tat approach on
improving relations with North Korea, with Kim boldly declaring:
``We have nothing to fear from North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference concluding a day of talks in the Oval
Office, Clinton said Kim did not ask him to lift sanctions _ a
centerpiece of U.S. policy toward the hard-line communist state
since the Korean War ended in stalemate 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton said, Kim asked him to ``support a policy of
reciprocity which would enable us to move forward with the
reconciliation of the North and South. And I said that I would be
prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, a one-time pro-democracy activist who was exiled by the
South's former military government, became president in February.
He said his government would use its military alliance with the
United States as the foundation for its effort to convince North
Korea ``to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim added that he hoped to encourage ``moderate elements'' in
North Korea. Without directly calling for lifting sanctions, Kim
said that should Washington choose to do so, ``we would not oppose
and we would cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither president spelled out what new steps South Korea would
take to soften the high level of brinkmanship that has
characterized relations between the two Koreas since fighting
ceased in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton pledged to fulfill U.S. commitments to provide North
Korea with fuel oil that it had promised as part of the 1994
nuclear freeze agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement obligated North Korea to freeze its nuclear
weapons program in return for replacement of its
plutonium-producing nuclear weapons reactors with safer models
financed by South Korea, Japan and other donor countries. North
Korea has allowed inspections and appears to be complying with the
weapons freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Differences between the two presidents on how to handle North
Korea were more a matter of tone and emphasis. At the news
conference, Clinton suggested his hands were tied because lifting
most elements of the trade embargo would require legislative
action. That is unlikely to happen with Republicans controlling
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton praised Kim for his ``bold vision'' of
improved relations between the two Koreas. ``I'm very hopeful.'' He
also cast South Korea as a model of moderation in Asia, contrasting
its aversion to nuclear armaments with the recent atomic tests
conducted by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Kim focused on North Korea's faltering economy and lack of food,
a situation he termed ``very bad.'' The more desperate it gets, the
more likely North Korea will be tempted to wage war on the South
or, alternatively, collapse and ``fall into our lap.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he said, ``for peace, for stability ... we need to induce
North Korea to open up ... and we have to help it in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kim called the regime of North Korean dictator Kim Jong
Il ``relatively stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president was on the fourth day of a nine-day
state visit to the United States. His primary focus is rescuing his
country's ailing economy, which had been the 11th largest in the
world before the current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's U.S. schedule is built around his effort to boost economic
investment in South Korea. On Monday he visited the New York Stock
Exchange. On Wednesday he is scheduled to speak to the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce. Later this week he will tour of California's Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Kim and his wife Lee Hee-ho were the guests of
honor at a White House state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is muddling through its worst economic crisis since
the Korean War. Its life support is an emergency $57 million cash
infusion from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the downturn ``a bump in the road'' and said
emergency financing guarantees would be available if South Korea
needs it in the future. He said he had called on Commerce Secretary
William Daley to lead a special trade mission to South Korea, which
now is running an $8 billion trade deficit with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Kim, 74, the visit to Washington had a sentimental side as
well. After spending seven years in prison and narrowly escaping
assassination at the hands of South Korean police agents in the
late 1970s, Kim settled in Washington as an exile.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to gain access to the White House, he remained committed
to changing South Korea's dictatorial regime to a democratic one.
He returned to South Korea in 1985, built his opposition party, and
won the election in December.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His visit has energized much of the growing community of Korean
Americans. Supporters interrupted opening ceremonies at the White
House with shouts of Kim's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never felt more proud to be a Korean-born American than
during this visit,'' said Bonnie B.C. Oh, a professor of Korean
studies at Georgetown University who will serve as translator
Wednesday when Kim receives an honorary degree there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his being elected president has (proven) that (South)
Korea's many years as a pseudo-democratic country have passed.''

SAN DIEGO: seen from here. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mission Beach, with its boardwalk full of in-line skaters,
looked like fun. The next town up, Ocean Beach, known to the
natives as Hippie Hollow, has a grittier look, just the opposite of
its northern neighbor La Jolla, the Beverly Hills of San Diego
County.
</P>
<P>
   Bunches of boutiques and restaurants crowd the cliffs here. We
stopped at George's Cafe and Ocean Terrace for lunch, a top-notch
place with tables spread out under an awning and the ocean close
enough to spit into. Don't do that, though. They wouldn't approve.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Our long weekend ended with a fresh-faced dose of corporate
tourism and a clang of reality _ SeaWorld and Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Everything at SeaWorld is slick, scrubbed and well-rehearsed. We
caught the Shamu show, in which the great killer whale jumped for
hand-held treats like a circus dog through hoops. I felt
embarrassed for it.
</P>
<P>
   But the kids loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana is a jarringly different world.
</P>
<P>
   The border is only an hour south by car or trolley. We parked at
one of the many lots on the border and took the bus across, which
will take you to the center of town. Don't try to walk it. It's a
long way.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana was an assault on the senses _ mostly from the barkers
in their trinket stalls along the main drag, Avenida Revolucion,
and from the dirt and the frying meat and the children with
street-stained feet.
</P>
<P>
   You can't walk anywhere without the accosting voices: ``The
price is right! Almost nothing, sir! Nine-nine percent off!''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours in Tijuana was enough. It made clean-cut,
almost-perfect, sometimes-cloying San Diego look good.

 EMPLOYMENT RISES IN GERMANY IN RUN-UP TO ELECTION  (ART ADV:
Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can
make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.) 
(ja) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Three months before the most difficult
election of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's career, some economists say
that he is buying as many new jobs as the German government can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported on Tuesday that the number of unemployed
workers declined by 223,400 in May, one of the biggest monthly
reductions in years. Government leaders called the report evidence
of a turnaround in German joblessness, which edged down to 11.2
percent from 11.3 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after reports last week that the nation's economy grew at
a surprisingly strong annual rate of 3.8 percent in the first three
months of this year, the new statistics are expected to help Kohl's
struggling campaign for re-election in September.
</P>
<P>
   But the economists said the new data probably demonstrated
something quite different: the effect of heavy new public spending
on job-creation programs. Officials have announced plans to pump as
much as $3 billion into these programs, reversing cuts made a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government hopes to take credit for this turnaround, but
the turnaround is something that the government has itself
engineered,'' said Hans-Juergen Meltzer, a senior economist with
Deutsche Bank Research.
</P>
<P>
   German joblessness is by far the biggest threat to the
re-election of Kohl, the leader of a center-right coalition who has
been in office since 1982. In polls, the chancellor consistently
lags behind the Social Democratic Party's candidate, Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and political allies of Kohl have been
chafing to improve their political prospects with evidence of an
economic turnaround. Indeed, a rough summary of the new
unemployment data was leaked last week to Bild, the daily tabloid
with the biggest circulation in Germany. And Kohl touted the
numbers in a speech a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany is looking forward to its second economic miracle,''
asserted Bernd Protzner, general secretary of the Christian Social
Union, the Bavarian sister party to Kohl's center-right Christian
Democrats. Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the data
vindicated the government's policies of stimulating industrial
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the picture is more complicated. While agreeing
that German growth has accelerated, primarily because of higher
exports, they said job creation has remained anemic. The big
difference between this year and last, they say, is in the money
going to job programs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government sharply reduced such spending, as
Germany needed to reduce its budget deficit in order to meet the
fiscal requirements for taking part in the single European currency
to be introduced next January.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists estimate that last year's cutbacks added about
200,000 people to the unemployment rolls. All told, Germany lost
about 420,000 jobs in 1997 and its unemployment rate came close to
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has declined in each of the last three months,
though the overall number of new jobs has changed very little.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the latest statistics, government officials
acknowledged that most of the big decline in joblessness stemmed
from seasonal factors. Job growth always picks up after the winter,
and unusually warm weather this past winter accentuated the normal
effect.
</P>
<P>
   On a seasonally adjusted basis, the government said,
unemployment declined by 60,000, to 4.32 million people _ less
dramatic than the headline figure, but still more than most
economists had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In western Germany, seasonally adjusted unemployment eased to
9.4 percent in May from 9.5 percent in April. In the formerly
Communist east, which remains in deep economic distress, the level
dropped to 18.7 percent in May from 19.1 percent in April. In the
most severely depressed eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where
Kohl's Christian Democrats were trounced in elections last month,
20.3 percent of workers remain unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Hatzius, a Goldman, Sachs economist here, said unemployment
had almost certainly peaked and should be heading slightly downward
even without new job programs.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the evidence points to the important role of
government job programs. Although the full story will not be clear
until later this year, when the government publishes statistics on
May employment, which show the number of people in job-training and
make-work programs, Hatzius said there has yet to be much evidence
of net job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unemployment started falling in January, and it has more or
less kept falling ever since then,'' he said. ``But employment has
not increased, and the difference between those numbers is largely
the people in jobs programs.''
</P>
<P>
   German labor leaders accused Kohl of manipulating unemployment
for political gain. ``The government has obviously spared no effort
to use job-promotion programs as a campaign instrument,'' said
Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy chairman of the German Federation of
Unions.

POLITICIANS RESPOND TO DeLAY CRITICISM BY SUPPORTING UNHINDEREDBy STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Republican and Democratic politicians,
citing recent criticism of federal judges by Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, joined lawyers and legal scholars Tuesday in support of an
unhindered judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's call for the impeachment of ``activist'' judges who
``violate the Constitution and their oath of office'' is part of a
widespread attack on the independence of the judiciary from both
liberals and conservatives, said former Rep. Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla. Edwards assailed DeLay's statements as a threat to all
judges, who he said should be duty-bound to look to the law and not
public opinion before issuing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay made his controversial statement before the House voted
overwhelmingly this spring to pass his proposal, now before the
Senate, to prohibit federal judges from ordering the early release
of convicted felons because of crowding or other unacceptable
conditions. DeLay spokesman Michael Scanlon, responding to Edwards'
comments, said the congressman has not attacked the independence of
the judiciary but merely reiterated the constitutional prerogative
of Congress to hold judges accountable for decisions that encroach
on legislative functions, such as controlling prison population.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, with former Clinton White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler,
chairs Citizens for Independent Courts, an ad hoc group of about 85
political and legal luminaries that seeks to court public opinion
to preserve judicial independence and protect judges from political
intimidation. The bipartisan group unites the oratory of liberal
former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and the salty tongue of
conservative former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, citing the widespread public distaste for O.J. Simpson's
murder acquittal, said people must nevertheless resist the desire
to have judicial decisions made by popular vote rather than by due
process. Voicing his displeasure that ``the poll has become
prince,'' Cuomo added judges must feel free to ignore popular
opinion in deciding cases.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would be much worse off if courts felt
compelled to bend to what the majority wanted, said the former
Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would the Congress of the time have overruled Brown vs. Board
of Education?'' Cuomo asked, referring to the Supreme Court's
landmark 1954 decision outlawing racially segregated schools.
``Almost certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said a judge's ruling, no matter how unpopular, should
not make that jurist a target for impeachment. The former senator
said conservatives and liberals are both to blame for trying to
intimidate judges, particularly when it comes to Senate
confirmation of nominees for the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups that gear up, flare up, smoldering the
nominee between the eyes,'' said Simpson, a member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee that held the bruising confirmation hearings of
failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in 1987 and Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see anybody get `borked' again,'' said
Simpson, noting the intense public relations campaign against the
conservative Bork. ``I was there. They turned him into a
gargoyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, noting ``the line between fair comment and
intimidation,'' said his group does not want to blunt legitimate
criticism of judicial decisions. ``Judges have to be accountable,''
he said. ``Courts have to be accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler, Edwards' co-chairman, said public confidence in judicial
fairness will wane if judges feel compelled to base their decisions
on polling data rather than the law. ``The independence of the
courts is absolutely key'' to the justice system, said Cutler who
also served as White House counsel during Jimmy Carter's
presidency.

NEW LEGAL GROUP CALLS FOR MORE INDEPENDENT JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan group of legal experts and
politicians, including former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, called
Tuesday for an end to choosing judges on the basis of their
popularity and political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, a Democrat, along with former Republican Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming, announced the formation of Citizens for
Independent Courts (CIC). The group, whose 80 members include
former FBI directors and appellate judges as well as several law
school deans, promised to fight the common practice of electing
judges and to urge Congress to stop blocking judicial nominees
because of their political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll has become prince, and now we have a kind of
sanctification of popularity in this country,'' said Cuomo, who was
once mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He said elections force judges to pay more attention to public
opinion than the law when deciding cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine if the Supreme Court went along with public
opinion in the 1950s and ruled the other way on Brown vs. Board of
Education,'' he said, referring to the 1954 decision that struck
down school segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who spoke to the group from Cody, Wyo., also criticized
Congress for failing to fill many judicial vacancies over the past
two years. He blamed Senate gridlock for the lack of action.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 75 federal courts have vacancies. However, of the 42
judicial nominees that President Clinton has sent to the Senate,
only 10 have made it out of the Judiciary Committee and are pending
before the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to lay blame against either Democrats or
Republicans for delays in the nomination and confirmation
process,'' Simpson said. ``But we simply cannot permit qualified
judicial candidates to be held up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Senate should stop judging nominees on whether they
are liberal or conservative and start judging them on whether they
are qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't being asking these guys how they'll vote or
looking into their decisions in the past,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the failed nomination of appellate judge Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court in 1987 as an example of ``partisan fighting
taking over the confirmation process.'' Senate Democrats, he added,
conducted an intense background check of the conservative Bork and
produced material that included information on what movies he
rented, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my eyes they turned him into a gargoyle _ a sexist,
racist invader of the bedroom,,'' Simpson said. ``I don't want to
see anyone get Borked again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo agreed, saying that while he opposed Bork's nomination, he
felt Senate Democrats at the time acted improperly by asking the
former judge how he would rule on hypothetical cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to ask a judge to rule on something before he has
seen the facts of that particular case,'' Cuomo said. ``It's like
asking an umpire in baseball to call a strike or ball before the
pitch has been thrown.''
</P>
<P>
   CIC Co-chair Lloyd Cutler, a former White House counsel, said
that much political wrangling over judicial nominees could be
avoided by using a different system for choosing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested using bipartisan commissions at all levels of
government to consider nominees. The commissions would submit the
names of several qualified candidates to elected officials, who
would make the final choice. He did not address the question of how
Supreme Court nominees would be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges must be able to make decisions based on the law, free
from political pressure,'' Cutler said. ``We should not tolerate
political interference with judicial decisions and with judicial
powers.''

</P>
<P>
   MACHO-MUSIC (Undated) _ One of the fundamental myths of rock was
that it was essentially a man's game, a macho sport that knocked a
generation of unctuous crooning mama's boys out of the batter's box
of popular culture and allowed ``real'' men to step to the
pop-music plate. Girls who sought membership in this boys' club had
better be butch. But even performers like Patti Smith and Joan
Jett, who affected male bravado, were never fully accepted into the
highest reaches of rock's pantheon. The reality behind that myth,
of course, is something quite different. By Stephen Holden.

</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-VINOLY (Undated) _ Even though Rafael Vinoly is the
most elegant architect now practicing in the United States, he
probably doesn't want to hear about it. The elegance of his work is

too big for its acquisition budget. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   KEN-LOACH-MOVIES (London) _ Surprisingly, perhaps, given his
distaste for the prevailing social order, Ken Loach was never an
angry young man. Shy and soft-spoken, he was almost 30 by the time
he set off down the path that three decades later would earn him
recognition in Europe as the dean of leftist movie makers. By Alan
Riding.

<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;  COLTRANE-JAZZ (New York) _ It is a perfect
indicator of jazz's restricted place in American society that Ravi

   ANTIQUES-WODEHOUSE (Undated) _ In 1927, when James H. Heineman
was 10, he demonstrated a bibliographic bent: he began buying first
editions of the novels of his favorite author, the British writer
P.G. Wodehouse, whose works poked fun at bumbling English
aristocrats. Over the next 60 years, Heineman continued to buy the
works of Wodehouse, amassing a collection of some 6,300 items. Next
Sunday, Heineman's entire Wodehouse collection goes on view for the

 10 &HT;    Rodman no stranger to post-season shenanigans
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ If it had not been clear up to this
point, it is now. The Bulls are intent on winning the NBA
championship at any cost, even if they look like flunkies to the
walking annoyance, Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman continues to defy logic and the team. His latest
shenanigans involved eating lunch at Hooters while his team
practiced and later participating in a wrestling ``event'' as
``Rodzilla'' in a Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   For his total disrespect of his team and disregard of the Bulls'
championship run, the NBA fined him $10,000 and the team $5,000.
That $15,000 paled in comparison with the $250,000 he got for
showing up in Auburn Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to do whatever he chooses to do, and no matter how
much we make plans as a team, if Dennis gets something he decides
to do, then he's going to do it,'' Bulls forward Scottie Pippen
said. ``And we just have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The Bulls could suspend him or cut him altogether,
as two Chicago sports columnists wrote in Tuesday's Chicago
Sun-Times and Tribune. The Bulls apparently have not even
entertained dismissing Rodman, the most consistent distraction in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Although he addressed countless questions about Rodman's
behavior, coach Phil Jackson claimed it was not a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk organization and discipline, that's where Dennis
loses it,'' Jackson said. ``He will rebel against everything. You
go back to his junior-high teacher, and they'll say the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went on to ramble about Rodman being a product of
television and society, but he never acknowledged that the Bulls
seem to be a contributor. It's Jackson who allows Rodman to come
late to games and practices. It's Jackson who allows Rodman to stay
in the corridor or locker room during the game instead of on the
bench. It's Jackson who allows Rodman to go in the early-morning
hours during the NBA Finals to Las Vegas. And it's his teammates,
Michael Jordan included, who have been unable to keep Rodman in
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``e's entertainment,'' guard Ron Harper said. ``They paid him
$250,000. The Bulls take $5,000, the league takes $10,000. That's
$235,000 profit. He's a great businessman.''

   Only in Chicago would Rodman's antics exist. Certainly not in
Utah. Jazz center Greg Foster said: ``We don't have the
win-at-all-costs attitude. In Utah, they wouldn't tolerate it. We
believe you can do things the right way and still win. There are
certain values that the people out there have. We've got enough
character to win the championship.''

 10 &HT;    Jazz knows it's do-or-die time
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After suffering a resounding 96-54 loss Sunday, the
Utah Jazz understand what's at stake on Wednesday night, when they
meet the Chicago Bulls in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's do or die,'' Chris Morris said Tuesday. ``The
situation now puts us against the wall. We have to come out ready
and give it all we have; put it on the line like it's the last
game; make our point that we're a team that bounces back, that we
can tie this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's loss was the worst in Finals history, but Morris
recalled that the Jazz turned things around in the seminfinals
after losing Game 3 to San Antonio by 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and played well and won the series,'' Morris said.
``One reason is because we didn't dwell on it. When we lost in that
situation, we didn't think about basketball. Instead, we got
together, went to a mall. We need to do that now.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton says he places no particular importance on
Wednesday's game, because he believes every game should be
approached like a do-or-die situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in thinking of one game at a time, and that game
you're playing is the most important game you'll ever play, then
you play that one, hopefully win it, and do the same the next
game,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah's Shandon Anderson thinks the Bulls have a momentum
that will be hard to stop. Anderson said Chicago's desire to win
the title on Friday in front of their own fans, in what could be
Michael Jordan's last game, is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win this one,'' he said. ``We've got to put the
pressure on them (to have a chance in the series). If we win, we
know we're going back to Salt Lake to play (Game) 6. Then we put
the pressure on them to win Game 5. The series is entirely
different then.''
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Carr said he is having no trouble dealing with Sunday's
whipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I played in Sacramento, remember?'' he said. ``But we
definitely gotta step up. We don't want to go down 3-1. You have to
fight back; show you still have fight. We've got to come out
totally hyped up. Upset. Step up. Tell people this is the Jazz team
you're used to seeing and not the team that played the other
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell promised the people of Utah a Game 6 after the Jazz were
beaten by five points at home. He hasn't changed his tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a Game 6,'' he said. ``We need to come out and
play relaxed tomorrow night, and all the (talk of a a five-game
rout) will disappear.''

 10 &HT;    Bulls know Jazz won't give up in game 4
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They called it the ``We (Stink)'' dinner, a gathering
that ultimately galvanized the Utah Jazz after losing to the San
Antonio Spurs by 22 points in Game 3 of the playoffs' second round.
Greg Ostertag, Jeff Hornacek and John Stockton ate together and
admitted their woes to each other _ and then they came back to whip
the Spurs the next night and take the series in five games.
</P>
<P>
   No such occasion took place after the Bulls thrashed Utah by 42
points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals Sunday night at the United
Center. But the San Antonio experience is a source of comfort for
the Jazz, which hopes to show that the Chicago record-setting
clubbing does not signify Utah's imminent demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a dinner like that,'' Hornacek said. ``In this
case, we know what we have to do. And I know the guys are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for tonight's Game 4 against Chicago that could restore
some order to the series or push the Bulls, leading the series 2-1,
one more victory from their sixth NBA championship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But it'll take a dramatic turnabout for the Jazz to erase the
most anemic offensive display in NBA history in losing 96-54 in
Game 3 Sunday _ fewest points in a game, widest margin of defeat,
fewest points in a quarter-and-half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence is still the same, even though we got beat the
way we did,'' forward Karl Malone said. ``Our attitude is still the
same. Guys expect me to say we're scared to death; well, that's not
even an issue. . . . If you talk to everybody, this series is over
with. But this thing is not over with yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had two days to think about that game,'' coach Jerry
Sloan said, ``and I think we've put it behind us. This team always
bounces back from a poor performance. I'm always pleased with how
the team responds. I feel good that the guys will come ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   They would want to. Chicago dominated so thoroughly in Game 3
that Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Co. spent much of the
fourth quarter on the bench, celebrating the play of the reserves.
And that show of excitement irked the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're taking us seriously at all,'' Malone
said. ``If I had beaten someone by 40, I don't think I would
(outwardly celebrate), even if I wanted to. . . . But when you see
things like that, it makes you want to play a little bit harder.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the Bulls anticipate from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jazz will come out with energy and enthusiasm and fire,''
reserve guard Steve Kerr said. ``They're going to come at us.
They're mad. We just have to withstand their initial run. But the
slightest slip in concentration can spark a big run for them.''

 10 &HT;    NBA Finals Notebook
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn &AMP; Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago _ Given two days off, a basketball player's attention
wanders into other areas, like baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's Shandon Anderson, an Atlanta native, wore a Braves hat to
practice Tuesday and bragged on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six runs in the ninth,'' he said. ``That was sweet. (They hit)
everything out of the infield. I got to confess I gave up on them,
but they came back and (beat Boston 7-6), anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson watched baseball on TV Monday night, but Karl Malone
went to Comiskey Park to watch another big man, Mark McGwire of the
St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Tuesday he could not imagine hitting a baseball as
far as McGwire did in batting practice. ``It's pretty awesome. I
think probably other than _ I think he hit a home run (in his
second at bat) _ that's the only thing I wanted to see, really, was
just batting practice. I left after that.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Media team
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Jayson Williams was the most appreciated player in
the league this season, according to a vote of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Williams received 99 votes for the NBA all-interview team,
joined by Houston's Charles Barkley (88), Utah's Karl Malone (38),
Chicago's Michael Jordan (37) and San Antonio's Avery Johnson.
George Karl of Seattle drew 44 votes to lead coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The second unit consists of Grant Hill, Detroit; Tim Hardaway,
Miami; Dikembe Mutombo, Atlanta; Steve Kerr of Chicago, plus Reggie
Miller of Indiana, David Robinson of San Antonio and Brian Williams
of Detroit, in a tie. Del Harris finished second among coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Missing Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Carr hasn't lived in Atlanta since the Hawks traded him
in February 1990, but the forward known as the ``Big Dawg'' still
has a strong interest in the city and his band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group's called 'Status Quo' and it's doing all right,''
Carr said Tuesday. ``The guys have done some good stuff (rhythm and
blues and jazz), and I've a couple of song-writing contests. It's
something I like to do. We've got 18 songs down. We get a couple
more done, decide what goes on the (first) album and release it.
Hopefully, I'll make millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable Kukoc
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson said the reason Toni Kukoc is playing so well in
this series (12.7 ppg., 6.0 rebounds) is that he feels accepted
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni felt like an outsider coming off the bench,'' Jackson
said. ``Even though he won the Sixth Man Award, and we told him how
much we appreciate his contribution, he wasn't comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed when he became a starter. Toni feels now he's
really a part of the team. It shows on the court because he's a
very unique and skilled player.''
</P>
<P>
   Big helping little
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone has said repeatedly that it's up to Utah's big men
to help the guards. It hasn't happened in this series. ``I still
say we have to step up and do the job,'' Malone repeated Tuesday.
``What a great opportunity this is to help (the guards) out. The
key to the series is for us to help the little guys.''

 &HT;    Financier bringing his skills home
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta native Robert P. Guyton Jr. is returning home
from Silicon Valley to start a venture capital concern that will
specialize in investing in high-tech start-ups in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Called Monarch Capital Partners, the firm plans to raise $20
million to invest. It has raised more than $10 million so far, says
Guyton.
</P>
<P>
   Guyton says he has financial commitments from investors
exceeding $20 million but hasn't decided whether to expand the size
of Monarch Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture capital opportunities in the Southeast are
tremendous,'' says Guyton, a 31-year-old financier. ``There are
lots of innovative ideas coming out of Atlanta. The Silicon Valley
by no means has a monopoly on young technology businesses with
great potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Guyton is focusing on Internet technology
companies. For example, he's looking at a company that provides a
new type of data compression that greatly enhances real-time video
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at any technology that will take the Internet to
the next level,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Guyton returns to Atlanta after a successful stint in Silicon
Valley, where he was a partner at Trilogy Capital Partners, a
venture capital concern.
</P>
<P>
   He co-founded a company called Inktomi, which developed a
powerful Internet search engine and other software.
</P>
<P>
   California-based Inktomi's software is used by America Online,
Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Yahoo! Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to go public sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to California, Guyton was a vice president in the
corporate finance group at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.

 &HT;    Five young friends' dreams evolve into $11 million Interweb
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four years ago they were five young friends crowded
into a Midtown, Atlanta studio apartment, dreaming up big ideas for
a company that would capitalize on the hot new technology of the
day: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that many businesses then barely knew what the
Internet was.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that none of the five had a degree in computer
science, and no venture capitalist would touch their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, their fledgling company, Interweb, was bought by a
New York firm in a deal worth about $11 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Interweb _ now part of an Internet development firm called Think
New Ideas _ has become a national player in a rapidly-evolving
field revolutionizing the way American companies do business, from
tasks as mundane as ordering paper clips to inventory tracking,
sales, marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a history major who had been a stockbroker, an MBA who
had never run a company, and one guy with real world experience
with computers,'' said Will duPont, 30, Interweb's president. ``We
would go to meetings with potential customers and begin by
explaining what the Internet was.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tool, and a toy
</P>
<P>
   Interweb's swift growth and the evolution of the services it
provides mirrors the Internet's explosive development. The computer
network has become a popular play thing for individuals and an
increasingly important tool for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the statistics show huge growth in the use of the Web,''
said Michael Cummins, head of the Georgia Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology. ``It's reached critical mass and
it's going to get faster as we smooth out the bottlenecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research of Boston estimates Web-related services,
sales and development could reach $2 billion this year, and $10
billion by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has become a nexus for Web development firms serving the
Southeast, with more than 150 outfits listed in the Yellow Pages as
providing Internet services. They range from Mindspring, the
fast-growing Internet access provider, to Web development firms
like Interweb, Macquarium and iXL, to small shops that design home
pages for other small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   From an acorn grew a tree
</P>
<P>
   For all its founders' grand ideas, Interweb started small.
</P>
<P>
   The firm was the brainchild of Daniel Davenport and Paul Goggin,
who met through a mutual friend at Georgia Tech, where Goggin was a
graduate student in atmospheric chemistry. Goggin had the technical
know-how. Although not a computer major, he was helping run a
computer-based data system for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He was also playing around a lot on the Internet, which was just
emerging into the public realm from its origins as a tool for the
Defense Department and university researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the opportunities,'' said Goggin, 30. ``It was
really easy to use and yet so powerful. It was a great way for
getting access to information.''
</P>
<P>
   Over beers, Goggin and Davenport _ a philosophy major in college
_ tossed around ideas on how to build a business based around the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport drew in duPont, then a stockbroker who had been his
college roommate at the University of Georgia, and Nick Owen, a
high school friend who earned an MBA at Georgia and was in the
mortgage and real estate business. Gibson Fenning, another Georgia
grad and friend, was tapped, too. He was working in advertising and
was skilled with graphic design.
</P>
<P>
   They drew up a business plan and started shopping around for
capital. Paul Arne, a lawyer with Morris, Manning and Martin, was
one of their early contacts. ``It's a running joke with us now,''
he recalls from his first meeting with the group. ``They were all
young and none of them had any Internet experience at all. Their
technical person was running an air quality lab at Georgia Tech.
And all they wanted was a few hundred thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Humble beginnings
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital was out of the question, but the partners
persevered. Arne put them in touch with an Internet access firm
that made available some of the equipment they needed at prices
they could afford.
</P>
<P>
   The partners hit up family and friends, took out a loan, and
managed to pool $85,000 in capital. Working out of duPont's
one-bedroom apartment, they were off.
</P>
<P>
   It was late 1994, and the Internet was suddenly the talk of the
national media, which promised the Web would revolutionize
everything from shopping and banking to business inventory, sales
and office management.
</P>
<P>
   At Interweb, the beginnings were decidedly less high-flying.
``Our first customer was a small record label that paid us $1,000
to design a Web site and $100 a month to maintain it,'' duPont
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Other small jobs followed, and then their first big break: a
contract with Invesco, the mutual fund firm. Dozens of other Web
design firms had sprouted up around Atlanta, and the contract
brought credibility for the young firm.
</P>
<P>
   Interweb closed out 1995 with $194,000 in revenue. The only
employees were the five partners, who had managed to rent office
space and move out of duPont's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the good times
</P>
<P>
   Their next big break came in 1996. They had done small jobs for
BellSouth Corp., and put in a proposal when the telecommunications
giant wanted better coordination of its many divisions' Web sites.
Interweb's chief competition was an established company based in
California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were only five guys, but we were five guys who were less
than a mile away,'' duPont recalls. ``Our contact knew he could
call us and we'd be at BellSouth within 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract came just as Owen got married _ a big, happy event
for the friends that suddenly became even bigger and happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired our first employee right before the wedding, and by
the time I got back from my honeymoon, they had hired another,''
said Owen, 32. ``It was very exciting, but suddenly when we had
employees, it got a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns dissolved in a haze of marathon work sessions and
constant meetings with BellSouth people. By the end of 1996,
Interweb had revenues of $1.2 million and 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and what companies wanted from it was changing
almost as fast as the tiny company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, it was a big deal for a business just to have a
presence on the Web. A few let customers order products, make
complaints or ask for information. Most simply put out what in
essence were informational brochures.
</P>
<P>
   The Interweb partners knew they had to do more than just design
pretty home pages with colorful graphics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they bought Professional Web Applications, an Atlanta
firm specializing in software applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great fit,'' duPont said. ``They were only four guys
and they didn't have much front-office presence. But they were
writing dynamite software.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Interweb was able to expand its services, targeting a
customer's in-house computer network or ``Intranet,'' helping trim
expenses by making in-house tasks more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is as mundane as ordering paper clips or updating
company software,'' Owen said. ``If you're a company with 5,000
employees and every time you need to update your software you have
to install it on 5,000 machines by hand, you can see the
efficiencies if you can suddenly do it with a few keystrokes on
your computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Interweb also customized an employee locator, a job-line and
employment application-managing system and a conference-room
scheduler for clients. All may seem unexciting, but they are
time-consuming tasks greatly simplified by using an in-house
computer system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Interweb earned $2.7 million in revenues and had 45
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In for the full ride
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Think New Ideas consolidates the vision the partners
had for their firm, which was to remain on the cutting edge of
Internet development and evolution. All five plan to continue
working for the new firm, which has offices in Boston, Seattle, Los
Angeles and New York, as well as an Atlanta operation that will
move into Interweb's building.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is cashing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much fun,'' said Goggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is so young, the opportunity is so huge, we'd be
foolish to get out now,'' adds duPont.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The nation's 12 million small businesses offer the
telecommunications industry a ``tremendous potential for sales in
the coming years,'' according to a national survey released at
SuperComm 98, the telecommunications trade show that opened in
Atlanta Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that small business owners are just now
beginning to adopt new telecommunications technologies. For
instance, the survey of 500 small business owners found only 8
percent of the businesses surveyed had a PBX system. Although 44
percent say they have e-mail at the office, most are not using it
heavily. About half say they send fewer than six e-mail messages a
week and only 13 percent report sending more than 30.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half _ 46 percent _ of small businesses have Internet
access in the office, while only 24 percent have their own Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more established technologies did better. Eight in
10 small businesses have a fax and at least one telephone line
dedicated to fax services. More than half _ 56 percent _ have a fax
modem on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only a third of the small businesses have voice
mail. In half of the offices, telephone messages are still being
taken by a receptionist or a coworker, and only two in 10 small
business owners say their messages are handled by a voice mail
system when they are out of the office.

   The survey was commissioned by the Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA) and the United States Telephone Association
(USTA).

   Hotel room rates are expected to rise slightly this year, even
though occupancy rates will decline slightly, but travelers should
not be lulled into thinking they need not book well in advance.
With the economy still chugging along, rooms will continue to be
hard to come by in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and
other business cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, for example, just added the Hyatt Regency McCormick
Place, a 33-story property. All of its 800 rooms are expected to be
open next month; more than 500 are already open. Even with that
capacity, the hotel already projects that more than 100 nights will
be sold out through the end of June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for business travelers, all rooms have desks, ergonomic
chairs and power strips with grounded outlets. There are also 53
suites, including 5 for entertaining clients. The hotel has an
indoor heated swimming pool with outdoor sun deck and a health club
with sauna and cardiovascular and strength training equipment.

   Poor Skiing in 2050?
</P>
<P>
   A warning for skiers: According to predictions at the recent
World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, climate change caused by
global warming will cause the snow line to withdraw significantly
up the mountains and snow cover can be expected to last for fewer
months. But there is no need to panic just yet, since the effects
are not expected to be felt for 30 to 50 years.

   Cruise Update
</P>
<P>
   Remember when cruise passengers wanted to leave their worldly
cares behind? They still can, but only if they don't turn on the
television in their cabins. More and more ships are offering live
news and sports via satellite, as well as an array of reruns for
children and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises, part of Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam Navigation
Co. of Britain, has CNN and ESPN live, and is adding BBC reruns to
its television schedule. It will also, of course, continue to show
reruns of the ``Love Boat'' series, which was filmed on the
original Sun Princess and two other Princess ships, and ran on ABC
television from 1977 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   As one indication of how the cruise industry has grown,
literally, consider that the Sun Princess was 17,000 tons while the
Island Princess and Pacific Princess were 20,000 tons. By contrast,
the Grand Princess, which made its debut May 26 and is currently
sailing European waters, is 109,000 tons. While in nautical terms a
ton is not a measure of weight _ more formally known as a gross
register ton, it represents 100 cubic feet of internal capacity _
it is worth noting that any of those earlier ships would fit
comfortably in the Horizon Court, the 24-hour restaurant aboard the
Grand Princess.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of huge ships, two days ago Cunard Lines _ recently
bought by Carnival Corp. and a group of Norwegian investors _ said
it was going to build ``the grandest and largest liner ever
built.'' Details will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 days, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines have
begun nonstop service to Japan _ Northwest with two flights a week
connecting Tokyo and Las Vegas, Nev., and Delta with daily nonstops
between Atlanta and Tokyo. On Oct. 2, Japan Airlines will operate
twice-weekly nonstops from Tokyo to Las Vegas. The Northwest and
JAL flights are largely a response to growing Japanese tourism to
Las Vegas, while the Delta flights reflect the growing Japanese
investment in the Southeast, which amounts to almost $14.5 billion,
and the region's exports to Japan, which exceed $5.5 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Air New Zealand and Ansett Australia have agreed to join the
year-old Star Alliance in 1999, bolstering the alliance's access to
the Pacific, especially the South Pacific. The current alliance
members _ United, Air Canada, Lufthansa of Germany, Scandinavian
Airlines System, Thai Airways International and Varig Brazilian
Airlines _ already serve some 650 destinations worldwide, and
alliance flights average a takeoff every 15 seconds around the
clock.

   Alaska Airlines is again offering special summer fares to and
from three of the five cities it serves in the Russian Far East.
Round-trip fares to Vladivostok or Khabarovsk range from $585 from
Anchorage to $635 from Seattle, Reno or the San Francisco Bay area
to $735 from Las Vegas, Phoenix and greater Los Angeles. Round trip
to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is an additional $250 from each of those
American cities. Fares represent savings of 48 percent to 69
percent, and as usual, restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Best Western International and the Arizona Biltmore Resort and
Spa are the newest members of the frequent-flier program of America
West Airlines.

passengers a one-week car rental from Budget Rent-a-Car in Austria
for $163.80 a week, or less than $24 a day, including unlimited
mileage and taxes.

EMPLOYERS USING SIGNING BONUSES TO LURE SCARCE WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., Fla., Iowa, Mont., Md.)  (mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to hire enough teachers, the Dallas school board voted
last month to lure them with $1,500 signing bonuses. Corporate
recruiters paid out much larger bonuses _ averaging $17,500 _ to
Cornell's business school graduates. Even Burger King has got into
the bonus game, offering $5,000 in some cities to hire away
restaurant managers from rival fast-food chains.
</P>
<P>
   The signing bonus is proliferating in America, and growing ever
larger as employers bid for scarce workers. A recruiting tool that
had been limited to upper-level managers, highly skilled
technicians and athletes, it is spreading today to many others,
even civil servants. The Labor Department, for example, is for the
first time offering a bonus of up to $4,000 to attract young
economists.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring bonus appears to be flourishing because employers,
faced with the lowest unemployment rate in a quarter-century, have
shifted some of the bargaining from wages to the less costly
one-time payments. And job applicants, accepting the shift, often
welcome the bonus as a windfall to pay off accumulated debt, or as
a measure of their value _ and status _ in the eyes of their new
employers.
</P>
<P>
   One 30-year-old woman, recently hired as a consultant at Price
Waterhouse, accepted the proffered $85,000 salary without
challenge, but balked at the $5,000 signing bonus. ``I barely had
to say that $5,000 was not enough, and they said, `Fine, would
$10,000 make you happy?' and I got that,'' she said. She declined
to give her name out of concern, she said, that other newly hired
consultants at Price Waterhouse who got smaller bonuses might be
resentful.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring bonus is just the latest tool that companies have
turned to in recent years to hold down wages. The others include
profit sharing, flexible schedules, tuition subsidies, stock
options, health club memberships and ``performance'' bonuses in
lieu of raises for those already on the payroll. While wages are
now rising a bit faster than they have in a decade, hiring bonuses
are ballooning and spreading across the work force _ absorbing some
of the pressure for still-greater income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing bonuses are certainly rising faster than starting
salaries,'' said Stephen Johansson, director of career services at
the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.
``It is much harder to raise the starting salaries because you end
up having to pay people coming in the door more than those who have
been there two or three years and have done well. Most companies
have avoided raising wage scales.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association, in a new survey of its
corporate members, found that 44 percent of the 344 who replied
paid signing bonuses to employees hired in the last year. That was
up from 30 percent last spring, the first time the association even
asked about the practice in its surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our clients offer the base pay up front, and then the
bonus in a second interview as the kicker to get people in the
door,'' said Jamie Hale, an executive at Watson Wyatt, the
management consulting firm. ``The bonuses range from 5 to 15
percent of a year's salary. In some cases, people have to pay them
back if they leave within six months. But if you attach too many
strings, the bonuses are not going to do what they are supposed to
do, which is get people on board.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its growing popularity, the signing bonus is hard for
the federal government to track and is not calculated as part of
the Employment Cost Index, a broad federal measure of worker
compensation. The index converts the various forms of income and
benefits into pay per hour. For the bonus, however, that cannot be
easily done, officials explain, because it has already been paid by
the time a new employee starts working.
</P>
<P>
   That means people have more spending money than the income
statistics suggest, even as labor costs may be putting greater
pressure on companies to raise prices than the Employment Cost
Index now indicates. The Federal Reserve considers the index an
important indicator of whether inflationary pressures are building
up sufficiently to justify an increase in interest rates to slow
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the bonus' popularity is its spread over the last
year to most fast-food companies. ``If you are going to get good
people, you have to take them from a competitor, and the way to get
them is the bonus,'' said Anthony Austin, vice president for human
resources at Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Not that every Burger King employee gets one. Rarely are they
disbursed in Montana, say, or in other places where unemployment is
not so low. But in the tight labor markets of a Milwaukee or a
Tampa, Fla., the company finds itself paying an $8,000 to $10,000
bonus to recruit a $50,000-a-year area manager, and $3,000 to
$5,000 to win someone to a $35,000-a-year job as a restaurant
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone else will pay the bonus if you don't,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   But counter clerks, earning $6 or $7 an hour, are not yet in the
loop. The odds are too great that they would take a $200 bonus and
quit within a week, Austin said. Instead, they get that amount as a
``retention'' bonus if they stay for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a worker shifts to a new employer, the signing
bonus compensates for a benefit lost at the old job. That happened
to Sarah Peters, who joined the Principal Financial Group in Des
Moines last month as a writer in the public relations department,
earning more than $35,000 a year. She shifted from a similar job at
Mid-American Energy, a Des Moines power company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Principal recruited me,'' said Ms. Peters, who is 25, ``but I
have my wedding coming up in October and I hesitated to accept; it
meant giving up the vacation time I had accumulated for my
honeymoon.''
</P>
<P>
   As a signing bonus, Principal granted her a one-time-only extra
week of paid time off, to be taken whenever Ms. Peters wishes.
Normally, an employee at Principal, a big insurance company, earns
one paid day off, to be taken as vacation or sick leave, for each
two months of work. ``Principal is the employer of choice for
anyone in Des Moines,'' Ms. Peters said, ``but without that
vacation bonus, I would have definitely thought twice about taking
the job.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   No one is more a target of the signing bonus than the college
graduate _ not only those receiving an MBA, but even those getting
a simple bachelor's degree. Three of every 10 graduates at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte got bonuses this spring,
up from one in 10 two years ago, according to a school survey. And
at Cornell's management school, which had 260 graduates this
spring, 90 percent of the new MBA's who responded to a survey said
they had received bonuses from their new employers. That was up
from 63 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More striking were the skyrocketing amounts. The $17,500 average
bonus for this year's Cornell MBA class was nearly double the 1996
average of $9,400, and 43 percent above last year's $12,200.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus is spreading, for the first time, to the public
sector. The Labor Department has just started to use it, in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, as has the Census Bureau. An act of
Congress is required to raise civil service pay scales, but bonuses
are legal under a rarely invoked law. In recent months, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics has paid bonuses ranging from $2,000 to $4,000
to nine newly hired employees, seven of them economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hired one guy and there was a competing bonus from another
agency,'' said Michael Allen, a personnel specialist at the bureau.
``The compensation packages were basically equal and he wanted to
work with us, but without the bonus he would not have accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of teachers, the Baltimore Board of Education voted last
month to pay $5,000 to new teachers buying a home within the city.
There are two strings attached: The bonus must be used for the home
purchase and must be paid back if the teacher leaves the job in
less than five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the school boards in Dallas and Fort Worth are engaged
in what amounts to a bonus war. Fort Worth led off earlier this
year with a set of bonuses starting at $500 and rising to $2,000
for applicants who signed contracts by June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas board countered last month. Faced with 900 openings
for the coming school year, the board authorized a flat $1,500 for
each new hire. More than 200 signed up at a job fair on May 30,
including Linda Livingston, a 50-year-old English teacher who had
taught public school before and wanted the $28,500-a-year job to
help put two children through college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bonus is kind of nice,'' she said, ``but that is all; you
can go through the money pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Vicki Parker, a junior-high-school teacher in Lewistown,
Mont., the bonus being offered by Dallas made all the difference in
the world. Hearing of it on a radio news broadcast, she immediately
applied and her papers are being processed. ``I have cousins in
Dallas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Montana has a surplus of teachers and Ms. Parker, who is 40 and
single, has never earned more than $17,000 a year in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a school system is willing to offer a bonus, there is
a need,'' she said. ``The $1,500 isn't so much, but they are
probably willing to do extra things for me, because they need me,
which is not the case here.''

 &HT;     CLINTON DEFENDS TIANANMEN SQUARE VISIT; PUTS SERBS ON NOTICE
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton defended his plans to be received
near Beijing's Tiananmen Square on his state visit to China later
this month, and endorsed South Korea's economic restructuring
efforts Tuesday in a wide-ranging White House news conference with
Korean President Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also put ethnic Serbs on notice for their continuing
repression of ethnic Albanians in the former Yugoslav republic of
Kosovo, warning that he had authorized stepped up NATO contingency
planning as part of a broader effort ``to do all that I can to stop
a repeat of the human carnage in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to boost confidence in the future of South Korea's
flagging economy, Clinton restored lending by the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. (OPIC) _ a government agency that guarantees loans
for private U.S. companies in high-risk countries _ and said that
the Commerce Department would put together a trade and investment
mission to South Korea soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also gave his endorsement to President Kim's
implementation of economic reforms and financial restructuring as
recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what has happened here is a bump in the road,''
Clinton said, referring to last fall's collapse in the South
Korea's currency and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most striking about Tuesday's press conference,
however, were the questions not asked.
</P>
<P>
   In a stark return from scandal to statecraft, Clinton's
appearance marked the first White House press conference in five
months that didn't include a single question about Monica Lewinsky,
the key figure in a purported sex scandal that has rocked Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing viewers might tire of a solid diet of policy
questions, CNN cut away from its live coverage of the press
conference in a dramatic departure from its practice in recent
months, in which the cable company has carried dozens of White
House press events with a heavy focus on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even ABC's White House correspondent Sam Donaldson, known for
his tough questioning, shouted out a foreign policy question _
regarding U.S. intentions in Kosovo _ instead of his usual
across-the-room probes on the latest threads to the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has weathered repeated grillings on the subject
from the podium is far from finished with tough questions
surrounding independent counsel Kenneth Starr's ongoing inquiry
into whether Clinton conducted an Oval Office affair with Lewinsky
then later urged her and others to lie about it under oath _
charges Clinton has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was he completely spared the stain of scandal on Tuesday,
when CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton to explain his decision last
year to allow sophisticated satellite technology transfers to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly briefed on that one, Clinton responded that he had
merely followed the recommendations of his State Department,
National Security Council and the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency in allowing the sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, from my point of view, a pretty routine decision,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At least on Tuesday, however, Clinton was able to get beyond
questions about his alleged sex life and focus on substantive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Kim, who was elected last December after
surviving jail, torture and assassination attempts by dictatorial
regimes in Seoul in his career fight for democracy, Clinton rose to
question after high-brow question about security on the Korean
Peninsula, the future of U.S.-China relations and even Donaldson's
closer about a possible U.S. role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and Britain were near to
proposing a United Nations resolution that would authorize the use
of ``all necessary means'' _ a phrase denoting possible military
action in U.N. parlance _ to end the repression of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, where scores have been killed and more than 20,000
driven from their homes in a campaign by ethnic Serbs against
Albanians who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population of two
million.
</P>
<P>
   Just next door to Bosnia, another former Yugoslav republic that
suffered at the hands of Serb para-military groups after breaking
away from the former Yugoslavia in 1992, Kosovo has long been seen
as a powder keg that could reignite war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years of fighting in the region was brought to an
uneasy cease-fire two-and-a-half years ago, following U.S.-brokered
peace talks in Dayton, Ohio and the deployment of a massive
U.S.-led NATO force still on the ground in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Kosovo, Clinton said, ``I am determined to do all
that I can to stop a repeat of the human carnage in Bosnia and the
ethnic cleansing. And I have authorized, and I am supporting, an
accelerated planning process for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``we do not believe any options should be taken
off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his trip to China, scheduled from June 24 to July 3,
Clinton said U.S. interests in forging an effective relationship
with China outweighed the pleas of human rights activists in this
country that the president forego a scheduled welcoming ceremony in
front of the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   Located adjacent to Tiananmen Square, seat of a democracy
campaign quashed by Chinese troops nine years ago in a bloody
crackdown that killed hundreds of unarmed citizens, the Great Hall
of the People is the public edifice of the Chinese government and
the place where all official state guests are formally welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that, if this is going to be a state visit to
China, and I am going to be the guest of the Chinese, that they
should be designing the terms of the arrival ceremony, not me,''
said Clinton. ``I simply don't accept the proposition that
observing their diplomatic protocol in any way undermines my
capacity to advance the principles of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to press U.S. concerns over China's continuing
human rights abuses in a ``clear and unambiguous,'' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``I think that what Americans should want me
to do is to make sure that I am as effective as possible not only
in advancing our interests, but in standing up for our values. And
I'm going to do what I think is likely, in the short run and over
the long run, to make our country the most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing last months' repeated nuclear weapons tests by India and
Pakistan, Clinton said ``it should be clearer than ever before that
we have a strong national interest in developing a constructive,
positive relationship with China.''

 &HT;     CLINTON DEFENDS TIANANMEN SQUARE VISIT; PUTS SERBS ON NOTICE
 &HT;     By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton defended his plans to be received
near Beijing's Tiananmen Square on his state visit to China later
this month, and endorsed South Korea's economic restructuring
efforts Tuesday in a wide-ranging White House news conference with
Korean President Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also put ethnic Serbs on notice for their continuing
repression of ethnic Albanians in the former Yugoslav republic of
Kosovo, warning that he had authorized stepped up NATO contingency
planning as part of a broader effort ``to do all that I can to stop
a repeat of the human carnage in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to boost confidence in the future of South Korea's
flagging economy, Clinton restored lending by the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. (OPIC) _ a government agency that guarantees loans
for private U.S. companies in high-risk countries _ and said that
the Commerce Department would put together a trade and investment
mission to South Korea soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also gave his endorsement to President Kim's
implementation of economic reforms and financial restructuring as
recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what has happened here is a bump in the road,''
Clinton said, referring to last fall's collapse in the South
Korea's currency and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most striking about Tuesday's press conference,
however, were the questions not asked.
</P>
<P>
   In a stark return from scandal to statecraft, Clinton's
appearance marked the first White House press conference in five
months that didn't include a single question about Monica Lewinsky,
the key figure in a purported sex scandal that has rocked Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing viewers might tire of a solid diet of policy
questions, CNN cut away from its live coverage of the press
conference in a dramatic departure from its practice in recent
months, in which the cable company has carried dozens of White
House press events with a heavy focus on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even ABC's White House correspondent Sam Donaldson, known for
his tough questioning, shouted out a foreign policy question _
regarding U.S. intentions in Kosovo _ instead of his usual
across-the-room probes on the latest threads to the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has weathered repeated grillings on the subject

surrounding independent counsel Kenneth Starr's ongoing inquiry

TAX CRACKDOWN BEGINS WITH ARREST OF GOVERNMENT STATISTICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Yeltsin government began its long-overdue fight
against tax evasion by arresting the nation's top statisticians and
accusing them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the State Committee for Statistics and his top
deputies were arrested in raids Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that more than $1.5 million in cash and
jewelry was seized from the officials' apartments. And Tuesday
night Russian television showed shoeboxes and briefcases full of
confiscated money.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests also raise probing questions about how the
government measures economic performance, an important issue for
jittery investors and for international financial institutions that
distribute aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the scandal is good news. In effect, the officials
are being accused of taking money to deliberately underestimate the
production of Russian enterprises and, thus, to help minimize their
tax obligations.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates that Russia's economy is larger than the
government's statistics suggest. The International Monetary Fund,
for example, has privately estimated that Russia's economic
production is roughly 20 percent greater than official government
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also illustrates the extent to which corruption has
infected the upper ranks of the government. And it undermines the
credibility of official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that we know nothing about the performance of Russian
companies,'' said Mikhail Berger, an economic specialist and the
editor of the newspaper Segodnya. ``We don't know about the Russian
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Committee for Statistics _ otherwise known as
Goskomstat _ has long been a formidable arm of the government
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet days, its reports about the nation's economic
trends could not be made public without the approval of top Soviet
leaders, who insisted that they accent the positive.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has continued to play a critical role following
the breakup of the Soviet Union. The committee gathers production
data from more than 22,000 large enterprises and surveys small
business. Its estimate of the nation's gross domestic product are
generally viewed as a barometer of Russia's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goskomstat, the Russian economy grew by 0.8 percent
last year, reversing long years of decline. Russian officials hoped
it would grow by one or two percent this year until the nation was
hit by a financial crisis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Estimating Russian economic activity has never been easy because
Russian enterprises chronically downplay their production to
minimize taxes.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet times ``to report an increase in the amount of
production was to become a Hero of Socialist Labor,'' Yegor Gaidar,
the former prime minister, observed last year. ``Now it is to get
additional visits from the tax collector.''
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, far from fighting the problem of
underreporting, the statistics committee was a willing accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been under investigation for a long time, and the
timing of the raids seemed designed to advertise the Yeltsin
government's campaign to go after tax delinquents.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, however, has long talked about prosecuting tax
delinquents only to back away in the face of fierce political
pressure from powerful financiers and businessmen. And it remains
to be seen whether the arrests are a sign of a broader crackdown or
merely a token gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the arrests had been
personally approved by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unscrupulous falsification and handling of information
facilitated tax evasion,'' Kiriyenko said during a brief visit to
Minsk. ``The state cannot tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, investigators charged that Yuri Yurkov, the
chairman of the committee, and his aides were minimizing production
in return for bribes.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators charged that committee officials were taking
confidential production data from some enterprises and selling it
to competitors. More than 20 people were alleged to be part of the
ring, including the head of the committee's computer center.
</P>
<P>
   Yurkov pleaded guilty to the charges, according to the
government. He is one of the most senior government officials to be
charged with corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the government, Boris Fyodorov, the new head of the
State Tax Service, announced that he was purging his office of
corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that has caused a political sensation, Fyodorov also
says he will begin by auditing the tax returns of the 1,000 richest
people in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many international economists say they have never taken
Goskomstat's statistics at face value, but relied on them as a
gauge of economic trends.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Central Banks' data on the size of the money
supply and the government's information on federal spending is
considered to generally reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests are likely to lead to new, more encouraging
estimates of the size Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   If Goskomstat's new leadership confirms that production was
understated, the nation's economic growth will be revised upward.
That will make it easier for Russia to meet its goal of keeping its
federal budget deficit to 5 percent or less of the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians and businessmen seemed uncertain Tuesday
night how far the crackdown on tax evasion will go. But many
believe that more arrests are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political circles received the news like a bomb
explosion,'' the newspaper Izvestia said Tuesday night. &QL;

 &HT;      SHUSTER CAUGHT IN TURNPIKE TOLL MESS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 9 -- As President Clinton placed the finishing
touches on legislative wrangling over the $200 billion highway
bill, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and Rep. Bud Shuster
said they reached a settlement over toll-free access to the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, R-Everett, sparked a mini-controversy three weeks ago
when he slid a one-paragraph provision into the highway bill that
allowed for drivers to have free access to the turnpike between
Bedford and Breezewood, in between where the powerful lawmaker's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said
the provision was not designed for his own personal benefit --
although it could lead to $83 a year in savings, or $500 over the
life of the bill, for Shuster, according to a Gannett News Service
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster contended the measure was needed because construction on
Route 30, which runs parallel to the turnpike, will force local
residents, including Shuster, onto the turnpike for a short drive
between Bedford and Breezewood.
</P>
<P>
   But turnpike commission members said the ``trust indenture'' set
up with bondholders forbid having any free access to the road,
regardless of what a powerful lawmaker said. ``We communicated
those concerns to Congressman Shuster's office,'' said Bill Capone,
a turnpike commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For a legislative fix, Shuster got lawmakers to agree to a $3
million reimbursement from Washington to the commission, about the
value of all lost revenue from Everett residents driving for free
on the turnpike for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The reimbursement) in effect would make the whole thing
revenue neutral,'' Capone said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a corrections bill to the massive highway act, the
House approved the $3 million reimbursement last week, but the
Senate stalled on the corrections measure over an unrelated
provision about veterans who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Shuster said it could take several months to resolve
the veteran smoker issue, but eventually the lawmaker will find a
way to ensure the turnpike commission gets its reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, on Oct. 1, the day the highway bill takes affect,
it's a free ride on the turnpike for everyone driving from Bedford
to Breezewood and back -- including Shuster.

A SATISFYING MILESTONE: APPLEBEE'S OPENING RESTAURANT NO. 1,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Florida sun was warm, the ocean waves
gentle, the salt-tinged breeze mild, and Abe Gustin, chairman of
Applebee's International Inc., felt about as good as a man could.
</P>
<P>
   Gustin described his surroundings by telephone in serene sighs
wrapped in an attitude of life is great. It was his preamble to a
look back at the once-scrappy little company he and John Hamra
started 10 years ago that today opens its 1,000th Applebee's
Neighborhood Grill &AMP; Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, you know it's funny. Back when we first started this
thing, John and I wondered if we could ever get it to 100,'' Gustin
said. ``In fact, our goal was 100, and if we were really lucky we'd
get to about 150.''
</P>
<P>
   The Applebee's milepost store opens in Aurora, Colo., and Gustin
plans to be there. Gustin said the 1,000th restaurant was
satisfying on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to sit around and talk about how many people we serve
each year. Last year we touched 300 million people in terms of the
number of guests at our restaurants, and I think that's really
something,'' Gustin said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal, he said, was to make each of the company's
approximately 50 franchisees millionaires, ``and I think we've made
most of them multimillionaires,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they haven't hit some potholes, including self-made
ones over the last year after rolling out a new menu with food
served on white, apple-ringed plates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new food items took more preparation than
anticipated, and the larger, heavier plates took more effort to get
to the table, resulting in slower service and sometimes tepid food.
</P>
<P>
   Applebee's Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Hill said the company
and its employees had been working hard to correct those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it continues to improve, we may have pushed the envelope
a little bit, and that is the result sometimes when you push,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem spot has been the affiliate chain, Rio Bravo
Cantina, which the company bought a few years ago. The thought
behind the acquisition was to give Applebee's franchisees another
vehicle to develop for their territories.
</P>
<P>
   But initial attempts to build the chain found investors getting
a less-than-acceptable return on their investments. This prompted
the company to design a prototype that would be less expensive to
build and operate but would serve the same number of patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hill said, investment returns from the new Rio Bravo
restaurants are more in line with what franchisees expect.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst wishes the company had thought twice about
buying a second concept. He sees restaurant companies do it all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always worry about any company that has a concept that works
looking for a second one,'' said Michael Smith of Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
``I mean, the roadside is littered with the carcasses of companies
that just couldn't stick to doing one thing and doing it over and
over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Smith said, any such company is in danger of
taking its focus off its cash cow and putting it on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's what Hill calls the action of limited resources no matter
how big or good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the rationale for a second concept clearly came as a
demand from our franchise system, some of whom were approaching
(the limit of how many Applebee's could operate) in their
territories,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   As kinks get worked out, Hill said, the growth of the Rio Bravo
chain could go any of several ways, including being developed
mostly by the company.
</P>
<P>
   In another road bump, company officials rang a bell of warning
on Wall Street last week when they notified analysts that May sales
at restaurants open at least one year were lower than the flattish
trends it has been experiencing of late.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, some analysts downgraded their recommendation on
the company's stock, including Michael Fineman of Raymond James &AMP;
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Fineman told Bloomberg News that he downgraded Applebee's from
``accumulate'' to ``neutral'' in part because of the slippage in
same-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including Janice Meyer of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and Smith of Fahnestock, maintained their ratings. Meyer
rates Applebee's as ``market perform'' while Smith rates it
``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Applebee's had never been a same-store-sales driven
company. He explained the strategy that Applebee's calls
``conscious cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   When an Applebee's reaches capacity, which is partly measured by
how long customers have to wait during peak dining hours, it builds
a new restaurant within a specific distance. The new restaurant
draws customers from the one running at capacity, thus the term
``conscious cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has led the company to its 1,000-restaurant
milestone, which makes it by far the largest company in the
casual-dining segment. It's next closest competitor is Red Lobster
with about 700 units.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we continue to be accepted into more
neighborhoods across America,'' Hill said. ``We think we can, to a
great degree, be a proxy for the family dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some analysts have criticized the company for adding
more expensive, upscale items such as steak and salmon to its
menus.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we keep our focus, we'll become an American icon
much like, well, like McDonald's has,'' he said.

PROVIDING THE CHANCE TO ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do so many talented women abandon corporate America?
</P>
<P>
   To stay home with children, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority don't go home,'' said Sheila
Wellington, president of the nonprofit Catalyst. ``They leave
because they can't find a way of balancing work and personal lives;
they go to companies where they think they have a fair chance of
advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Catalyst recently released ``Advancing Women
in Business _ The Catalyst Guide: Best Practices From the Corporate
Leaders.'' The book is the first of a series on women in business
and focuses on recruiting, retaining and advancing women.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies now recognize that a diverse work force makes
economic sense, Wellington said. But they often unwittingly create
conditions that disadvantage women.
</P>
<P>
   The book profiles companies such as Motorola, Deloitte &AMP; Touche
and dozens of others that have succeeded in attracting and
retaining women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book presents real-world success stories,'' Wellington
said. ``You can learn from these examples and adapt it to your own
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the early 1990s Sara Lee decided to develop a
long-range diversity plan.
</P>
<P>
   The program focuses on goals to increase the representation of
women and minorities at management levels. As part of its effort,
the company identifies employees with potential and helps them get
the experience they need to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the chief executive of Deloitte &AMP; Touche decided to
find out why the firm hired so many female candidates but why so
few became partners. The accounting firm spends millions of dollars
a year recruiting and training its staff, so retention is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   A study led to changes that include flexible work arrangements,
career development opportunities and careful tracking of
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Do these policies make a difference?
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche saw a significant drop in turnover after
developing a program to enhance women's career opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Montreal enjoyed four years of record profits after
instituting a corporate strategy makeover that emphasized
attracting women managers and maximizing their potential. From 1991
to 1997, representation of women in executive positions increased
from 9 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds great, but what if your company doesn't have a CEO
who is committed to diversity? Wellington suggested that employees
establish a women's network. Those groups, she said, shouldn't be
negative. They should offer management alternative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   And women's networks are the subject of the next Catalyst book,
due out this fall.

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's been said that our musical preferences are
formed by what we listened to between the ages of 10 and 22.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, look out!
</P>
<P>
   It could explain why everything '70s plays such a part in '90s
pop culture. After all, many of today's entertainment power brokers
were born in 1960 or afterward.
</P>
<P>
   We know the '70s was the tackiest decade of all. Questionable
taste? It was a decade-long celebration of hedonism and
brainlessness personified by leisure suits, the ``happy face'' icon
and the catch phrase ``have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   On TV, ``The Partridge Family'' was one of the most popular
shows of the era. ``I'm OK, You're OK'' was a best seller. Billy
Beer and the Pet Rock were warmly embraced Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   On the radio and in clubs across the country, the disco age was
launched by the Hues Corporation's ``Rock the Boat,'' followed by
hits from the Bee Gees, Donna Summer, the Trammps, Chic, Gloria
Gaynor, and K.C. &AMP; the Sunshine Band.
</P>
<P>
   Before it slipped onto the endangered list and became the
property of vinyl archeologists, disco _ that thumping, syncopated,
stylish blend of funk, soul and Latin _ was the sound of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But it never really went away (more like underground), and now
it's riding a new wave.
</P>
<P>
   Movies such as last year's ``Boogie Nights'' and newcomers such
as ``The Last Days of Disco,'' ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' and
``54'' are drenched in the stuff, while popular groups such as
Geffen Records' Pure Sugar and the acclaimed ``Nuyorican Soul''
collective are busy reviving the sounds of the velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Estefan's top-selling latest disc, ``gloria!'' takes on
the free-flowing party vibe of vintage Miami Sound Machine dance
albums. As Estefan herself puts it, ``disco never really left, it
just changed its name.''
</P>
<P>
   In dance clubs, too, disco is the thing today. From Aftershock
in Studio City to the Gate in West Hollywood, disco nights are
packing them in.
</P>
<P>
   On the top 40, Will Smith's chart-topping ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit
It'' is actually based on the Chic-produced Sister Sledge disco
classic, ``He's the Greatest Dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Tsepelis, music director at local dance-music radio Groove
103.1, which boasts a popular Sunday-night disco program and spins
classic '70s dance cuts throughout the day, says he chuckles to
think the music that got bashed the most stuck around the longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes and goes in phases,'' he said. ``It never really went
away entirely. It just has different names. I mean, like, today's
house music is the disco of the '90s. There's really no difference
except for computer technology. And there's this trend where people
making house and hip-hop records are taking old disco songs and
either remaking them from the ground up or sampling the bass line
and building new songs around that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disco diva Gaynor, whose ``I Will Survive'' was the only winner
of the short-lived ``Best Disco Recording'' Grammy in 1979 and is
considered the most-performed karaoke song ever, says dance music
is still dance music regardless of its name tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disco is an enduring music,'' she said. ``People all over the
world have always loved to dance, and because of that, dance music
will never go away. It will just get called different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor, who still performs around 100 times a year, said she
realized she had a classic with universal appeal on her hands when
she read the lyrics to ``I Will Survive'' for the first time. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It was a lyric that everyone could relate to,'' she recalled.
``In any situation that a person might think was insurmountable,
they'd get the message of survival no matter how hard it got.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick look at this week's dance chart reveals that the disco
sound is not only surviving but thriving. Local act Pure Sugar's
``Delicious,'' a festive disco-fueled jam that borrows from
``Boogie Oogie Oogie'' by A Taste of Honey and is already a club
smash across the country, is zooming upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on disco,'' said Pure Sugar's singer Jennifer Starr,
25, whose image might be dubbed ``Barbarella goes to Studio 54.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr says her mom was dancing to disco when she was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the '80s, we were torn between new wave, goth and
dancing to disco,'' she said. ``So, I grew up on it and so did my
mom. It never really left my house. Once I heard Donna Summer's
`Love to Love You Baby,' that was it for me. I felt my female
hormones push right on through. I mean, I love new wave, but give
me disco!''
</P>
<P>
   Starr says disco provides a ``comfort zone. It's comfortable
music to dance to. Disco is a piller of the dance-music
community.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; It seems the music keeps getting rediscovered. On the latest
pop albums chart, the ``Boogie Nights'' soundtrack and two ``Pure
Disco'' compilations are among the Billboard 200. Selling well in
local stores is the ``Last Days of Disco'' soundtrack, which
includes such '70s classics as Alicia Bridges' ``I Love the
Nightlife (Disco 'Round),'' Evelyn ``Champagne'' King's ``Shame,''
Chic's ``Good Times'' and Diana Ross' ``I'm Coming Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dance queen Estefan, whose chart-climbing new single
``Heaven's What I Feel,'' adds a spicy Latin feel to the disco
sound of her new album, says she tried to duplicate a '70s
ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relatively carefree time before AIDS,'' she said.
``It's been a tough two decades. I wanted to recapture that
optimistic party mode. Disco was the greatest music. It never went
anywhere really.''
</P>
<P>
   We can live with the disco revival. The real test for that age
theory in musical taste will be when producers start sampling
``Billy, Don't Be a Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when we leave the country. &UR;

<P>
   By the book
</P>
<P>
   In the next life, I want the job of the researcher assigned to
uncover the pithy, sartorial quotes for such how-to books as the
new Chic Series' Men's Wardrobe, (Alfred A. Knopf Inc., $25, 223
pages).
</P>
<P>
   Consider the kick digging up the Australian Aboriginal saying:
``The more you know, the less you need.'' It succinctly summarizes
the Chic Simple philosophy that having the right stuff at the right
time has less to do with quantity and more with quality and good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   And from Mark Twain: ``Clothes make the man. Naked people have
little or no influence in society.'' Then, there is ``I grow
old...I grow old.... I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers
rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I
shall wear white trousers, and walk upon the beach.'' From T.S.
Eliot's ``The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the Chic Simple series of books has
included a variety of such subjects as women's makeup, business
casual dressing, women's clothing and business attire.
</P>
<P>
   The genius is not just that they offer basic advice about
dressing well and appropriately without much effort and
interference from fashion trends. But also that the how-to stuff is
interspersed with entertaining cartoons, quotations and colorful
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The latest men's book is produced by Kim Johnson Gross and Jeff
Stone, and written by Woody Hochswender, all formerly or presently
associated with Esquire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It covers such subjects as how many suits you should own _
enough so that they can be effectively rotated and never worn two
days in a row. And what shoes you can wear with shorts _ almost
anything from a leather sandal and Topsiders to athletic shoes and
a polished loafer. The book includes a glossary of terms and list
of sources with web site addresses. It's a must-have manual for
most.
</P>
<P>
   Other notes;
</P>
<P>
   - If you're tired of tie decisions, you could live with one tie,
a black wool knit for all occasions.
</P>
<P>
   - Tradition has it that the bottom button on a vest is left
unfastened thanks to the royal girth of Edward VII who could not
make the garment reach.
</P>
<P>
   - Horn rim glasses will make you look smart, but unglamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Do coupons help?
</P>
<P>
   If you want to dress like a star, save all your money. The July
Marie Claire magazine enumerates what it costs some celebs to dress
the way they do, if and when they pay for their clothes. Ashley
Judd, with Manolo Blahnik shoes and dresses from Armani, Richard
Tyler and John Bartlett, runs up a walloping bill of $35,175.

SHOE MUCH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days women's shoes were decreed with the same force
as, say, skirt lengths, long hair and frosted pink lip colors.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, it would seem, a scroll was unfolded and word on the
look of the moment came down _ ta da! _ pointed toes. Then it was
the chunky shoe, the loafer, Gucci's high-heeled loafer or the
backless mule. And so it went. Not long ago you wouldn't be caught
napping in a canoe in the river without the rounded toe.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can lose that memory. Welcome to the new world of
footwear, where the word choices is, well, a serious
understatement. The list of trends is long, starting with sandals _
enjoying history-making popularity _ clogs, wedges and shapely high
heels that look as if they belong in a modern art museum.
</P>
<P>
   If the fashion magazines seem fond of pointed toes, they are no
more valued than squared toes, flat soft slippers, curvy Sabrina
heels, straps and athletic-inspired sneakers with a status label on
a platform. Choose from fabric shoes, stretch shoes, shoes with
raffia and cork trimmings, even a clear Cinderella high-heeled
evening slipper. And that's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have never before been so many varieties,'' says David
Wolfe, the fashion director for Doneger Group, a New York
consulting service. ``It's a smorgasbord.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the dizzying variety in styles, one common buzzword
permeates the entire shoe industry. It probably falls off
executives' lips over lunchtime salads and haunts secret laboratory
tests. That word is comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we hear again and again as a priority from the
consumer,'' says Cheryl Holland, the vice president for women's
merchandise at Halls, a Kansas City specialty store.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe designer Stuart Weitzman says now when he talks to women in
retail stores, the first thing they invariably say is not how
beautiful a shoe is but ``It is so comfortable.'' A shoe can be
ugly, he says, and still be a best seller if it's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the technology developed by the athletic shoe industry
has been appropriated in the fashion arena. Weitzman, for instance,
has added extra cushioning to his upscale dress shoes this year and
in the future will incorporate the fit-to-foot molding of running
shoes. ``It's all about technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Modern stretch fabrics with spandex offer more comfort because
they hug the foot and hold it in place. Whether it's a covered
molded business pump, a short boot or Walter Steiger's $270 stretch
ankle strap with a plump heel similar to modern chair legs, it is
considered a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pointed-toe pumps, directional for fall and seen on
many evening shoes now, are not the old machete-sharp killers. As
Holland, at Halls, notes, the points are narrowed well beyond the
end of the foot so that the toes are never actually crunched.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling good
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the drive for the C word combined with fashion has
led the movement to the flat, the ``most high-fashion shoe,'' says
Greg Andrews, fashion director for Nordstrom stores in the Central
States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a ballet slipper or menswear oxford, the flat has
made an impressive return in part because it fits well with the
summer fashion of capris and knee pants and very long skirts,
Andrews says. The soft slipper was a regular on the fall fashion
runways with the long skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the comfort mode, the concept of the Euro-walking shoe
is on the rise. Indeed, the sneaker or athletic look is not new,
but the same brands are styled into fashionable sandals and other
shapes as new hits.
</P>
<P>
   For one example, the Aquatali.MDSD/.MDNM/a, a waterproof
platform sandal, is not the prettiest shoe, but it's a runaway best
seller at Halls in Kansas City. Mephisto shoes, at Nordstrom and
Halls, are cushioned walking shoes with phenomenal growth in the
United States in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Mephisto was developed in Europe 35 years ago and introduced in
this country as a walking shoe a little more than eight years ago.
The styling has evolved recently from an athletic look to include
sandals, clogs and men's dress shoes. In the last year the company
has had a 60 percent to 70 percent increase in business, says Dick
Meckfessel, the Mephisto USA president.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by high interest in health and comfort, the feel-good
shoe.MDBO/.MDNM/ concept is the ``fastest-growing shoe category,''
Meckfessel says.
</P>
<P>
   It has at least eliminated a splinter in the fashion aesthetic
of many fashion-minded people offended by working women in New York
and other cities who hiked to the office in their athletic sneakers
with dress pumps in their bags. They no longer have to change.
</P>
<P>
   Show your toes
</P>
<P>
   Certainly sandals of all styles are the news this summer,
whereas five years ago, Weitzman says he couldn't sell sandals.
NBC's Katie Couric has been wearing closed-toe chunky heel sandals
lately. And the rage in quirky colored toenail polishes is giving
women the opportunity to coordinate toe colors with open-toe shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But do you wear open sandals to work? Certainly guidelines of
what to wear and when have blurred. Not long ago few professional
women would have thought of pairing their business suits with shoes
that look fitting for the beach. But some women have no qualms
apparently in the Midwest and the East.
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, the analyst, says that after women stopped feeling
obligated to wear hosiery in the office last summer, it broke down
the final barrier to sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not fond of looking at black toenail polish,''
he complains.
</P>
<P>
   Women who love shoes
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the array of shoes means mostly good news for women
who indeed love shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Watkins, who works in purchasing at Hallmark Inc. in
Kansas City, is delighted. She used to design her own clothing, so
she was very conscious of her shoes. Then a trip to Spain and a
look at the variety of leathers heightened her awareness of shoe
design and she began to appreciate even more the feet and shoes.
Now she may go out and buy up to 15 pairs at one time and estimates
her current collection at 180 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although she wears mostly dress pumps to work, she still is
open-minded. ``I don't believe in having one kind of shoe. I like
platforms, wedges. We are so lucky now. Nothing is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Maria O'Keeffe, who used to crave shoes. The
Hallmark artist loved shoes so much she bought high heels she
couldn't walk in on the streets in San Francisco where she lived at
the time and kept them packed in boxes at her office. She could
slip them on to tromp off across the room to the copy machine, say,
or a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   She loved shoes so much that she once found herself following a
woman through a Kansas City specialty store because she thought her
shoes were great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was debating with myself, `Should I ask where she got them
or not?' Then I realized that I already owned those shoes and had
never worn them.''
</P>
<P>
   These days her priorities have shifted and she no longer
collects footwear, but she still has boxes of stilettos stacked in
her office (``for little children to play with''). And for the
record on this day, she is wearing a gray skirt, gray tights and
chartreuse suede sandals. Is that a shoe person or not?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Douglas Hannant always thought he wanted to be a
painter. But after his first job as a display artist at Swansons,
the Kansas City upscale specialty store, in the 1980s, he never
felt quite the same about it.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to work in display at Macy's Midwest, Filene's
Basement in Boston and, eventually, Barney's in New York, but he
wasn't able to shake the obsessive drive to create clothes that
came upon him that first year in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that kind of environment for the first time, I think I
caught a bug at Swansons,'' the New York designer says now, more
than a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1997, he had a showroom, a partner and retail
customers. His clothes had been showcased in the Fifth Avenue
windows of Bergdorf Goodman, New York's creme de la creme of
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Then his life took an even brighter turn. He picked up the
support and endorsement from designer Geoffrey Beene, considered
one of America's foremost creators. After Beene saw his clothes at
Bergdorf's, he wrote an encouraging note to Hannant and later
called to offer his own showroom for his first press show last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``an unbelievable moment,'' Hannant says, when he
suddenly knew he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Creative urge
</P>
<P>
   Hannant is a dark-haired, handsome man in his 30s with a
straightforward manner, imploring eyes that betray a hopeful
vulnerability and a certain bravado. He grew up in rural Indiana,
about 100 miles north of designer Halston Frowick's home place.
</P>
<P>
   Against the initial protests of his family, he took up painting.
And like other Midwestern-bred designers such as Halston and Bob
Mackie, he admits that the monotony of his surroundings drove him
to creative thinking as a means of escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were always drawn to find something more exciting than
what you had,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately went to art school in Missouri and took a field
trip with a class to Kansas City, where he met couture buyer Ruth
Nan, then with Swansons. She helped him get a job in a display
department, and in a small ironic twist, Nan was in Beene's
showroom last fall for Hannant's first show. Her buy of his line is
bringing him back to Kansas City this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hannant's clothes are priced in couture designer range,
comparable to the Donna Karan Collection or Geoffrey Beene. A
jacket costs $1,200; blouses, $300; cardigans run to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   The styling reflects an elegant ease, a decided sense of luxury
and a newness that, like an early morning dew, hasn't quite settled
in place.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent fall runway show, during New York fashion week,
Hannant's message centered on floor-sweeping wrap skirts trimmed
with leather strips tied to the side and very fluid pants. ``Pants
that fall like a skirt,'' he says. ``Very hip and modern.''
</P>
<P>
   He also introduced a puffy, shimmery new textile of mohair
encased in two layers of silk tulle. ``It's a fine arts approach,
like a sketch with a charcoal drawing,'' he explains. And he has
rights to a dry-cleanable fur that makes the lavish fur trimmings
he uses more feasible.
</P>
<P>
   His clothes are not for everyone, he acknowledges. He leans
toward close-cut silhouettes, and customers are often creative
people. ``Interior designers and architects,'' he says. ``People
who appreciate line.''
</P>
<P>
   That customer ``has to have a sophisticated eye, but then that
woman exists everywhere.... When I lived in Kansas, I dressed the
same way I do now.''
</P>
<P>
   He is confident that he has the right track. ``You have to
listen to your gut,'' he says about the creative process he goes
through tucked away at his isolated country home in Pennsylvania.
``No matter where I am I would design the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   His ideas, he insists, don't come from the streets or museum
exhibitions, and he staunchly resists trends and themes. ``I can't
imagine taking a trip, say to India, and designing a collection
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   He is on a quest for something special that he thinks women
want. He envisions himself working as a fine artist might, pulling
images from within, evolving with his own work, not with the
market.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, it is still a formidable challenge to break
through the fashion establishment, and it's an ongoing struggle for
a newcomer without a wealthy backer to attract stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do good fashion, but when you don't have $80,000 for
an ad in Vogue ...'' it's difficult, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And when his fall collection was small and his runway show
short, the trade journal Women's Wear Daily suggested he was short
on ideas as well.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind. His vision is focused on bigger things. Fashion
is art, he insists. ``Something beyond decorating the body. It's
shape built on the body.''

A PATRIOTIC PAUSE FOR THE PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you never know quite what to do to commemorate Flag Day,
which is today, June 14. Besides flying the flag, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Stand around and recite the Pledge of Allegiance? Sing ``You're
a Grand Old Flag''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this Flag Day marks the 19th annual National
Pause for the Pledge of Allegiance, when people across the country
are asked to stop what they're doing at 6 p.m. (Kansas City time)
and recite the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the first you've heard of the National Pause. Pat
Perluke, a volunteer with the National Flag Day Foundation in
Maryland, is working on that.
</P>
<P>
   Flag Day and the National Pause are big deals at Fort McHenry in
Baltimore harbor, the spot where the Americans turned back the
British in 1814 and Francis Scott Key got the inspiration to write
``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' An all-day celebration is planned.
</P>
<P>
   Perluke and others with the foundation want that energy to
spread throughout the country. They've been working the last few
years with other national organizations to pump up Flag Day and
participation in the National Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for an individual growing up in America to
understand the patriotic symbols of our country,'' Perluke said.
And Flag Day, after all, marks the day in 1777 the Second
Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as the national
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Barbershoppers, to name one group, want to help. At its meeting
in Kansas City in April, the board of the Society for the
Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in
America voted to provide the musical backdrop for the National
Pause.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vote came too late for many barbershop chapters to
get organized this year, they're a patriotic bunch and hope to join
more Flag Day and National Pause events in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right down the heart of our Main Street,'' said Reed
Sampson, spokesman at the society's national office in Kenosha,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Flag Day's big participation problem is its proximity to
Independence Day, a national holiday that practically defines
summertime and patriotism with its cookouts, parades and fireworks.
Little Flag Day hardly stands a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy, said Perluke, is to consider Flag Day the start of
the country's patriotic season and the Fourth of the July its
closing. In fact, the ``Twenty-One Days to Honor America'' _ June
14 to July 4 _ is an idea officially sanctioned by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the simplest way to kick off the season, then, is to
participate in the National Pause. It certainly won't take much
time. Francis Bellamy of Rome, N.Y., gets credit for writing the
original pledge and for keeping it brief.
</P>
<P>
   While campaigning to establish Columbus Day as a national
holiday in the early 1890s, Bellamy described his vision of flags
flying from coast to coast and wrote the words he thought Americans
should use to honor the banners:
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge allegiance to my flag and the Republic for which it
stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledge has been embellished a bit over the years. In 1923
``my flag'' became ``the flag of the United States.'' In 1924 ``of
America'' was added. Congress recognized the pledge in 1942 and in
1954, as America grew worried about godless communism, added
``under God'' to follow ``one nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And so: ``I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation,
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''

CAN'T HARDLY WAIT IS FAR FROM MEMORABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' a comedy, opens today and is rated PG-13
for teen drinking and sexuality and for language. Running time is 1
hour 35 minutes. Two out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Can't Hardly Wait'' is remembered for more than five
minutes after the lights come up it will be for Ethan Embry, a
young actor who combines a pleasant goofiness with an aura of
genuine substance.
</P>
<P>
   Embry _ who was amusing as the nearly mute bass player in Tom
Hanks' ``That Thing You Do!'' _ provides the only genuine moments
in ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' a frantic but not very funny high school
comedy about the big party that unfolds on graduation night.
</P>
<P>
   With the entire class heading off in different directions, it's
the perfect time to end relationships, launch new ones, settle old
scores or initiate a major change in one's life.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anything of importance happens. The screenplay by
co-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (they also wrote ``A
Very Brady Sequel'') gives us a half dozen or so characters and
lets them collide amid much chaotic boozing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The big news on graduation day is that star athlete Mike (Peter
Facinelli) has dumped his girlfriend of four years, the gorgeous
Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Being college bound, the egoistic
Mike figures a full-time steady will be a drag on his dating style.
</P>
<P>
   This is great news for Preston (Embry), the bright but socially
uncool guy who has worshipped Amanda ever since she transferred to
the school in their freshman year. He still has the desperate love
letter he wrote to her way back then; tonight's party will be the
opportunity to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   His plan elicits eye-rolling from his best friend, Denise
(Lauren Ambrose), a cynic whose intolerance of teen idiocy has made
her a perennial outsider. Nonetheless, Preston ventures forth,
determined to declare his everlasting love.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, brainy geek William (Charlie Korsmo) and a couple of
his ``X-Files''-obsessed pals plot a public humiliation of top jock
Mike, who has made their high school years a living hell. And Kenny
(Seth Green), a white kid who ineptly affects a gangsta rap
lifestyle, ventures forth to lose his virginity, only to find
himself locked in a bathroom with the girl he used to pick on.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give Kaplan and Elfont credit for this, at least: they've
cast the film with young actors who look like real kids instead of
``Baywatch'' bimbos or Chippendale's hunks.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting around the fact that ``Can't Hardly
Wait'' is third-rate ``Dazed and Confused'' (or, if you will,
fifth-rate ``American Graffiti'').
</P>
<P>
   The acting is only as good as it needs to be. Hewitt is yet to
land a film role that allows her to do much more than look pretty
and scream (at some point she's going to have to tackle a role
without cleavage); the rest of the players are on so briefly that
they must rely on broad strokes to present their characters. Only
Embry makes it all worthwhile.

SIX DAYS ISN'T ORIGINAL BUT IT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' an adventure romance, is rated PG-13
for language, sensuality and brief violence. Running time is 1 hour
36 minutes. Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's wildly unoriginal. And, no, it hasn't a serious
thought in its head.
</P>
<P>
   But who's complaining? ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' works.
</P>
<P>
   This witty romantic adventure from director Ivan Reitman and
screenwriter Michael Browning is a frothy blend of genres _ mostly
screwball comedy, action film and buddy flick _ that borrows
shamelessly from a dozen other titles (``Romancing the Stone,''
``The African Queen,'' ``Father Goose'' and ``The Flight of the
Phoenix,'' for starters).
</P>
<P>
   But the movie nevertheless seems fresh and invigorating despite
this massive recycling. In fact, it's the perfect summer movie _
lightweight but never dumb.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it also has Harrison Ford in one of his most likable
performances, playing a gin-soaked, sun-baked, island-hopping bush
pilot who never met a drink or a pretty girl he didn't want to know
better.
</P>
<P>
   And let's quickly dispense with the issue prurient minds want to
know _ mainly whether audiences will accept actress Anne Heche, the
significant other of comic Ellen DeGeneres, in a hetero role.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal: The ghost of Ellen lingers over this production
for maybe the first two minutes, max. Heche is a good enough
actress that only the most homophobic viewer will be unable to
accept her in this part, and they'll be denying themselves the
pleasures of a very good comic performance.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is simplicity itself. Big Apple magazine editor Robin
Monroe (Heche) is treated by her fiance, Frank (David Schwimmer of
``Friends''), to a vacation on a tropical isle.
</P>
<P>
   When her boss orders her to a nearby island to oversee a one-day
photo shoot, she charters a flight with a pilot named Quinn (Ford),
a grizzled dropout who likes tinkering with things, whether they're
airplane engines or women.
</P>
<P>
   Robin is at first hesistant to get on board. ``Where's its
mommy?'' she wonders, eying the tiny craft.
</P>
<P>
   Her fears are justified. A storm drives them off course, fries
their radio, and sends them crashing onto the beach of an
unidentified island. The stranded duo bicker, forage for food and
become the object of a manhunt by a boatload of modern-day pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pirates?'' Robin expodes in amazement. ``As in `Aaaargh'?''
</P>
<P>
   They also use their ingenuity to repair the seemingly
irreparable airplane.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention that their relationship evolves from
backbiting to romance?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the resort, Frank goes through the various
stages of grief in about 20 minutes and finds himself being
comforted in a most imtimate fashion by Quinn's girl of the moment,
a dancer named Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors).
</P>
<P>
   It's almost too simple, yet it's all been executed with terrific
aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of very funny lines, but the real spark
comes from the two leads. Ford's wry charm has rarely been more
effective, and with his ability to combine sex appeal with
self-deprecation he's in the same league as Cary Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Heche is the real surprise, proving herself an adept physical
comedian with a polished sense of timing.
</P>
<P>
   And Schwimmer has several priceless moments as the faithless
fiance whose attempts at fidelity are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Director Reitman (``Twins,'' ``Dave'') handles it all with just
the right touch, tossing in plenty of drop-dead scenery and a
nail-biter of a tropical storm. Mostly, though, he lets his two
leads work their magic on the audience.

FASSEL UNHAPPY WITH MILLER'S TARDINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants linebacker Corey Miller arrived
at Giants Stadium for the team's passing camp on Tuesday, one day
later than coach Jim Fassel had been expecting him.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel made sure he told Miller he was not happy. Miller in turn
said he was a little bitter over the pay cut the Giants compelled
him to agree to last week.
</P>
<P>
   The two then said there would be no grudges kept. There was
plenty of evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, for example, said he wants a new contract after the 1998
season _ even though he is already under contract with the Giants
for 1999. And he insisted he wasn't going to give up his starting
job at strongside linebacker _ an assignment the coaches have
indicated could go to Marcus Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, meanwhile, said that as head coach he can't get overly
upset every time a player disappoints him. Then, he added, ``But
you better be ready to keep score.''
</P>
<P>
   So a dispute over attendance at what is a voluntary June workout
was officially defused and yet perpetuated at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he did arrive in New Jersey on Monday as he had told
the Giants he would. His flight from his South Carolina home
arrived at Newark Airport around 3 p.m. Fassel said he had expected
Miller to participate in Monday morning's workout and was
displeased that Miller did not call to say where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the courteous thing to do would have been to call,''
Miller said. ``But I didn't think anything about it because it was
a voluntary camp. You apologize and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had more to say about his newly restructured contract, a
transaction that reduced his 1998 salary from $1.5 million to
$900,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I happy about it?'' Miller said. ``Not at all. I'm not
angry, but I'm a little bitter about it. Not at anyone. But it's
something I think about every day. I'm using it as motivation. I've
got to prove to them my real worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to be viewed by stats, well then I've got to do
what's right for Corey Miller. I'm going to have a big year. And
when it's my turn, I'm going to be very aggressive about my
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And though his Giants contract expires after the 1999 season,
Miller believes he will be in a good bargaining position for a
raise after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a business decision,'' said Miller, who added that
the Giants assured him he would get the opportunity to rush the
passer more this year. ``But so will I.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his starting job, Miller said the competition with
Buckley and the second-year player Ryan Phillips will be good for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm still the starter,'' he said. ``I'm very confident
that my role will be the same as it was last year.''

MUSIC REVIEW: DEVOTION AND VIRTUOSITY IN THE CANTORIAL TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding
of the Cantors Assembly, nearly two dozen cantors from synagogues
across the country took to the stage of Carnegie Hall on Monday
evening and performed classic settings of prayers from the Sabbath
and holiday services. That the concert had a celebratory quality
was not surprising: the assembly's aim was to put its most
virtuosic members in the spotlight and to honor the compositions of
several generations of cantors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few clouds hovered over the event. The organization was
started because its founders believed that the art of cantorial
singing was imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Europe's best cantors died in the Holocaust, and
liturgical compositions that existed only in unpublished
manuscripts were lost or destroyed. Cantors who had immigrated to
the United States early in this century, however, had established a
cantorial tradition here, and the Cantors Assembly has built on
that.
</P>
<P>
   But now cantors face a new challenge: traditional cantorial
singing, with its combination of operatic dramatic style and
melismatic elaboration in Middle Eastern modal scales, is rapidly
falling out of fashion. At many Orthodox and Conservative
synagogues, young congregants object that virtuosic singing shifts
the attention from the text to the cantor. In any case, the current
preference is for the more direct, folksy prayer settings by Rabbi
Shlomo Carlebach and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem surprising that synagogue music is as susceptible to
trends as other musical forms. But the kind of cantorial singing
heard at Carnegie dates back less than 200 years, making it a
recent development by Jewish standards. Still, several of the
compositions on the program captured and evoked the devotional
spirit with an artistry and depth of feeling that the newer style
has not yet matched.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Ganchoff's ``Atoh Yodea'' (``You Know All Mysteries'') and
Pierre Pinchik's ``Rozo d'Shabbos,'' a mystical prayer in Aramaic
about the preparation for the Sabbath, use florid, modal passage
work both as an evocation of antiquity and as a way to touch the
heart. Jacob Ben-Zion Mendelson and Faith Steinsnyder Gurney,
respectively, gave them stunning, emotionally unguarded readings.
The leaps in the melody line of Max Helfman's ``Shema Koleinu''
(``Hear Our Voices'') made for a theatrical setting, but Melvin
Luterman's commanding performance brought the work's more serious
grounding into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the three-hour program included Yossele
Rosenblatt's invitingly elaborate version of ``Uvenucho Yomar''
(``And When the Ark Rested'') sung by Farid Dardashti and Dov Keren
with a cantorial choir, and Louis Lewandowski's choral setting of
Psalm 150, which had an almost Handelian punch. Sol Zim, singing
his own ``Al Shlosh Dvorim'' (``On Three Things'') and David
Propis, singing Joseph Gross' setting of ``Ani Ma'amin'' (``I
Believe With Perfect Faith'') represented a more ebullient, Hasidic
approach to prayer.

NEW RATING FORMULA FOR NCAA FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest attempt to guarantee a true college football national
championship game was unveiled Tuesday by the Bowl Championship
Series, which concocted a complex formula of ratings that might
have been devised by Stephen Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Had the system been in place last season, it would have
guaranteed a match-up between Michigan and Nebraska, which were
undefeated. Instead, Nebraska beat Tennessee to win the Orange Bowl
and was voted national champion in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll.
Michigan won the Rose Bowl, which was not part of the bowl alliance
format, and was voted No. 1 in The Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series is the new name for the Bowl
Alliance, which was created to try to assure a true showdown for
the No. 1 ranking. But only twice in six years did the alliance
produce a national championship game, and the new system is an
attempt to ensure such a game takes place, beginning this season.
</P>
<P>
   The new format creates a point system based on four factors:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average ranking of the AP and USA Today/ESPN polls.
</P>
<P>
   _ A formula based on the average of the computer-generated
rankings produced by The Seattle Times, Jeff Sagarin for USA Today
and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   _ A calculation derived from the cumulative won-lost records of
the team's opponents and those of the the team's opponents'
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   _ The team's record. Each loss adds one point to the total.
</P>
<P>
   The two lowest point totals produces the No. 1 and No. 2 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear-cut, objective and factual,'' said Roy Kramer, the
Southeastern Conference commissioner and coordinator of the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said the series' rankings won't be published in
newspapers until the second week of November each season because
the ``strength of schedules won't be reflective until the teams
have played their seventh or eighth games.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking six months to create the rating formula, which
calls for measures like adjusted deviation of computer rankings and
statistical weighting of opponents' strengths of schedules, Kramer
said it is not overly complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's more complicated than figuring out how a
football writer can choose between a number nine and a number four
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides establishing a national championship game, the system
will also guarantee a bowl game slot for an independent team or a
team from a conference without an automatic bowl selection if that
team ranks in the top six.
</P>
<P>
   If that does not occur, the three non-national championship
bowls need not fill their six slots with the schools ranked third
through eighth in the ratings. They can choose the teams with
geographic, historic or conference ties or ones they think will
fill their stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the bowl games involved in the system _ the Rose,
the Orange, the Fiesta and the Sugar _ will be shown on ABC. The
first national championship game will be at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan.
4.

`TINY ALICE': ONTOLOGICAL BUT FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The play, all too fittingly, is about a
crucifixion of sorts. And when it opened on Broadway late in 1964,
many critics and theatergoers felt they had been handed a
custom-made hammer and set of nails to use on its author. Edward
Albee, at that moment, was still garlanded in the success of 1962's
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' and he had been thrust onto
cultural heights that have not been visited since by an American
playwright. The successor to Williams and Miller, he was being
called; the future of the country's theater.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came ``Tiny Alice,'' and the nasty, protracted
lynching of Albee, which would continue for a good two decades,
began in earnest. What was this self-important, pretentious
gobbledygook that Albee was trying to put over? Even respectful
reviews expressed irritation and puzzlement over the bizarre,
verbally dense and sexually lurid allegory about a man (played by
John Gielgud) in search of God; others went straight for the
jugular in alarmingly personal terms, describing the work with
phrases like ``homosexual nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Albee, never one to explain himself, was nonetheless reduced to
holding a news conference in which he asked if audiences ``really
want as little from the theater as those critics who believe they
reflect its taste would have them believe.'' He even cut his script
in hopes of clarifying the play's themes. People still scratched
their heads and muttered angrily, as they would through most of
Albee's other plays on Broadway, before he became its most eminent
pariah.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to feel slightly nostalgic for an era in which a
play could produce such heated debate as much because of its form
as its content. (Terrence McNally's as yet unseen ``Corpus
Christi'' has been attacked purely on the basis of the latter.)
Still, the dominant sensation in watching Mark Lamos' energetic,
engaging revival of ``Tiny Alice'' at the Hartford Stage Company,
starring Richard Thomas in a role he was born for, is nostalgia of
a different kind: for daring, original new plays as tightly
constructed, elegantly written and (most surprisingly) defiantly
funny as this one proves to be.
</P>
<P>
   For however enigmatic ``Tiny Alice'' may be, it practically
gallops through the story it has to tell, flashing wit like a
shark-toothed smile and reminding you that whatever Albee's faults,
he certainly knows how to hustle an audience's attention all the
way to the final curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Like the excellent Broadway revival of ``A Delicate Balance''
several seasons ago, this production finds the fierce theatrical
vitality with which Albee infuses his philosophical puzzles. Even
considering the unanswerable mysteries of faith and divinity, he is
as much of a showman, in his own literary way, as a Belasco or a
Barnum.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Tiny Alice,'' in coldblooded summary, is
definitely off-putting. Brother Julian (Thomas), a lay secretary to
a Catholic cardinal (Tom Lacy), is enlisted as an intermediary
between the church and the glamorous, Croesus-like Alice (Sharon
Scruggs), who is considering donating a hefty chunk of her millions
to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Julian, who years earlier suffered a nervous breakdown over his
inability to reconcile his idea of God with its earthly
representations, finds himself drawn into the sinister menage of
Alice and her present and former lovers, the unctuous, amoral
attorney known simply as Lawyer (Gerry Bamman) and a droll, breezy
butler called Butler (John Michael Higgins). Alice's castle of a
home becomes Julian's, too, and he falls in love with his hostess
while everyone around him conspires to bring him to the sensational
martyrdom he has, on some level, always sought.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part. ``Tiny Alice'' is packed with enough
symbols to inspire a century's worth of doctoral theses. Albee's
ingenious twist here, however, is to use symbols with dogged
literal-mindedness. The cardinal, for example, is shown in the
play's opening scene to keep pet cardinals in a cage that resembles
a Gothic cathedral. Alice's castle is represented in miniature in
her library (the formidable replica is the cornerstone of John
Arnone's appropriately iconographic sets). Alice herself, it
develops, is only a stand-in for the more universal spirit Julian
has always courted.
</P>
<P>
   Albee carries this idea of symbol versus substance through to
everything from the jousting, pun-filled dialogue to the names of
the characters. What he is doing is portraying the simple-minded
inadequacy of human shorthand for the unknowable, exactly what
Julian has rebelled against and what also finally undoes him. As a
theatergoer, you're sunk if you don't find the levity in this.
Albee's themes are dead serious, but his portrayal of them is
deliberately jokey.
</P>
<P>
   This is appropriate for a playwright who cites both Sophocles
and Noel Coward as his spiritual ancestors. Lamos often emphasizes
the Coward-ish aspect, flavoring the work's semantic volleys with
the lightness and crispness of drawing-room badinage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scruggs flounders a bit in the role created by Irene Worth
(which is understandable once you realize what the part is), and
presenting her, in Constance Hoffman's nouveau riche costumes, as a
Women's Wear Daily-style socialite was not a good idea. But the
others, especially Higgins, find appealingly varied balances of
archness and weary malice that set off the concentrated earnestness
of Thomas' performance.
</P>
<P>
   From his time as a television idol as good old John-Boy Walton,
Thomas has glowed with an aura that mixes passion, anxiety and
innocence, and it's the perfect combination for the doomed,
spiritually questing Julian. Amid the barbed worldliness of the
play's other characters, he remains untouched by irony, as sincere,
worshipful and baffled in his erotic attraction to Alice as he is
in his piety.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas hasn't found the variety and modulation required to sell
his difficult final monologue, a stumbling block in any production
of ``Tiny Alice.'' Otherwise he is nearly flawless, and it's hard
to imagine any actor so suited to the function Albee has said
Julian should serve: ``Brother Julian is in the same position as
the audience. He's an innocent. If you see things through his eyes,
you won't have any trouble at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly not the consensus in 1964. But audiences who
have since sat through television shows like ``Twin Peaks'' and the
conspiracy-theory movies of Oliver Stone have surely grown more
tolerant of sinister ambiguity as a basis for mainstream
entertainment. There's plenty of ontological cud to chew in ``Tiny
Alice.'' But you can just as easily approach it as a chilling
Gothic potboiler with cosmic implications. Perceived on that level,
it's at least as much fun as ``The X-Files.''

WORLD CUP KICKS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH 
c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The planet's premier event sporting or otherwise has the
world's attention focused squarely on France, where the World Cup
soccer championships kick off Wednesday amid fears of mayhem that
imperil this proud land's image and its well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two nations, eight more than ever before, are set to
compete in the 16th edition of the tournament, a
multibillion-dollar affair in which so many side issues from the
threat of terrorism to the pursuit of the almighty franc threaten
to overshadow what occurs on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, devised 70 years ago by Frenchman Jules Rimet
and contested every four years since 1930 (with a 12-year lapse
during and immediately following World War II), also possesses
great unifying power, bringing together the world in ways nothing
else, not even the Olympics, is capable.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 37 billion people from every country on Earth will
tune in to some part of the World Cup over the next month, with
nearly 2 billion watching when the champion is determined July 12
at the futuristic Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a Parisian suburb
where the tournament will begin Wednesday when reigning champion
Brazil takes on Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-million people are expected to trek to France
for the event, which will feature 64 matches in 10 stadiums around
the country, in Bordeaux, Lens, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier,
Nantes, Saint-Etienne, Toulouse and at two venues in Paris, the
Parc des Princes and the Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   The event kicked off Tuesday night with the spectacular ``La
Fete du Football,'' four processions through Paris culminating in a
wild celebration at the Place de Concorde. At its center are four
six-story tall ``giants,'' representing the Americas, Asia, Africa
and Europe, which will meander through the streets of Paris,
accompanied by thousands of dancers, musicians and acrobats in a
five-hour spectacle that will shut down the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The figures' meeting at Concorde signifies the power of the
World Cup, its capacity to unify, to bring the planet together in
celebration of what is known as ``the people's game.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Brazilians, who are seeking an unprecedented fifth
championship, and the host French and Italy and Spain and another
half-dozen serious contenders for the title capture the world's
focus, diverse forces are expected to attempt to divert attention
from the game to other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 police officers, augmented by security forces from
other countries and from the French Foreign Legion, are spread
throughout the country, many watching for terrorist action. More
than 100 Muslin extremists, most with ties to Algeria's
fundamentalist regime, have been arrested in advance of the Cup,
but officials acknowledge that the threat of trouble remains.
</P>
<P>
   More problematic may be transportation strikes that could
cripple the ability of fans to move about from venue to venue. Air
France pilots have been on strike for more than a week, and rail
workers are slated to walk off the job on Wednesday. Subway and bus
strikes, and road shutdowns by truckers have been threatened. Any
such action reflects poorly on the French.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some days, France will be at the center of attention for
the whole world, host to the entire planet,'' French president
Jacques Chirac said last week. ``Our welcome must be exceptional
and perfect, and I hope that everyone will display a spirit of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything less could affect profits. Tournament organizers expect
receipts of $400 million, with advertisers and merchandisers
reaping far more. It is possible to purchase just about anything
with some relationship to the Cup, from condoms to candy to the
usual T-shirts and flags.
</P>
<P>
   What really matters will occur on the fields, the ``pitches,''
in the parlance of the sport. The Brazilians, featuring a potent
lineup starring 21-year-old superstar Ronaldo, are widely
considered favorites, although their form leading up to the Cup has
been spotty. Several other teams, including Yugoslavia and Germany
two of the United States' three first-round opponents also are in
the hunt; the majority, including the Americans, would consider far
less to be success.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. squad, competing in its third successive Cup, opens
Monday against the Germans at Parc des Princes. Only the top two
teams in each of eight groups qualify for the knockout phase, so
the Americans need to overcome either the Germans, who are
three-time champions, or the Yugoslavs (June 25 in Nantes),
possibly the most talented team in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The other U.S. foe promises confrontation of a different sort.
But neither the Yanks nor Iran, who face off June 21 at Stade
Gerland here in Lyon, consider the meeting anything more than a
sporting clash.

U.S. ATTORNEY SAYS TEXAS PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE FACES CRIMINAL PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, Texas _ Federal prosecutors told the U.S. District
Court Tuesday that they are investigating a South Texas district
attorney's office for criminal wrongdoing. It was the first time
authorities have admitted the criminal probe since thousands of
documents were seized from the Webb County courthouse late last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle argued against having to
return the criminal files that FBI agents seized from District
Attorney Joe Rubio's office in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (files) are evidence, in the government's opinion, of
criminal wrongdoing,'' DeGabrielle told Judge John Rainey at a
hearing here.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubio's attorney, Donato Ramos, countered that the seizure
of the files has crippled operations in Rubio's office and has left
state prosecutors unable to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we immediately get these files back, it will be
extremely difficult and nearly impossible for the district
attorney's office to continue to function,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   At Rainey's urging, federal prosecutors agreed to return the
approximately 5,000 criminal case files in increments.
</P>
<P>
   Rubio, who was not called as a witness during the two-hour
hearing, sat quietly beside two lawyers representing him, as an
individual, and the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with the outcome,'' Rubio said outside the
courthouse. ``Hopefully, we will be able to get the office back to
100 percent within two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainey signed a series of still-sealed search warrants used by
FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents to raid Rubio's office, as
well as homes and other offices in Laredo homes, the weekend of May
29.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered both sides to agree on what to do about the
files, which the FBI hauled from Rubio's office in a truck, or he
said he would do so on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an on-going investigation. We have to be sensitive to
both sides concerned,'' Rainey told the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed the FBI would begin returning the files in
increments starting next week and would complete the transfer by
June 26. Some files already have been returned, the court was told.
</P>
<P>
   DeGabrielle said the FBI already had taken steps to accommodate
Rubio and his staff by making some copies available and allowing
Rubio and his staff to assist when the files were seized in the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally don't allow people potentially charged with
criminal offenses to participate in the execution of a search
warrant,'' DeGabrielle told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly very mindful of the disruption of the
execution of this warrant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 142 people in Laredo have been drawn into the federal
probe. Among them are Rubio, his father, a bail bondsman,
prosecutors and investigators in Rubio's office, a justice of the
peace and a former state district judge.
</P>
<P>
   Documents that are a portion of one search warrant, which were
obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, show the federal
prosecutors are looking into the way Rubio's office handled at
least 128 criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the investigation is looking at what Rubio's
office did in dropping charges, agreeing on plea-bargains, and
sending some suspects to pre-trial diversion programs rather than
proceeding to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators apparently are examining possible links between
the way those decisions were made and the personal finances of 14
people, including several in the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents seized personal bank records, check books, income tax
returns, expense accounts and other individual records in addition
to the criminal files.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rubio's lawyers backed away from their earlier
threats to ask Rainey to unseal confidential documents related to
the case and to challenge the basis for the FBI's search.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramos told the judge that Rubio's office needs more time to
consider arguments over unsealing the documents, particularly the
affidavit federal agents used to secure the warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey gave lawyers for Rubio and the San Antonio Express-News,
which also has asked the court to unseal the documents, until
Tuesday to file briefs with him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would decide within two weeks whether to issue
an order or set a hearing on the motions to unseal the information.

BRAZIL LOOKING LIKE ANYTHING BUT FAVORITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There's Ronaldo, of course, the world's premier soccer
player. And there's Roberto Carlos, who may be even better. And
there's Leonardo and Bebeto and Denilson and Edmundo and Dunga and
Cafu and Giovanni ... the list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which takes what it hopes will be the first step toward
a pentacampeon
</P>
<P>
   an unprecedented fifth World Cup championship when it meets
Scotland in the tournament opener this evening at the Stade de
France in Saint-Denis, has as impressive a collection of soccer
genius as might be imagined.
</P>
<P>
   What Brazil doesn't appear to have is a very good team
</P>
<P>
   if all the hype suggests it must be favored to hoist the trophy
come July 12, then few are buying into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pale imitation of the glory days of Brazilian
football ...,'' charged Antonio Pimenta, the managing editor of
Estado e Sao Paulo
</P>
<P>
   . ``There is no collective game, no synchronization. It's every
player for himself, and (Coach Mario) Zagallo has a lot to do with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagallo, who has been a player or coach for each of Brazil's
four titles, has taken the brunt of criticism for his squad's
ragged play leading up to the World Cup. The tenor of the damnation
goes something like this: He is not fit to coach a team of Brazil's
stature ... he lacks the ability to orchestrate the talent at his
disposal ... he hasn't a clue and is clueless about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you will see in France is not real Brazilian football,''
says Carlos Alberto, who captained Brazil's greatest side to the
1970 World Cup crown. ``We have some wonderful players, but Zagallo
will not let them improvise. He has no right to manage the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance
</P>
<P>
   calls him ``incoherent,'' and O Globo
</P>
<P>
   claims he ``doesn't have to conditions to coach anything, much
less the national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's rabid fans lack faith, too. Only 11 percent of them
believe their squad is capable of the title, down from 70 percent
just last month. A series of lackluster performances, in a loss to
Argentina in late April, a draw with Spanish club Athletic Bilbao
last month, even in a romp over Andorra last week, hints that
somewhere, at sometime, this squad will fall.
</P>
<P>
   Even Zagallo's bosses aren't satisfied. They assigned Zico, the
greatest Brazilian player between Pele and Ronaldo, to serve as
``technical director''; it hasn't made much difference yet.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have taken their toll; neither Romario nor Juninho are
with the team (and defenders Aldair and Andre Cruz are out today
with minor ailments), and if what remains Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos
and the like are indeed capable of anything, that includes failure.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is everywhere, and it's been mounting since
February, when a lesser Brazilian side settled for ties with
Jamaica and Guatemala and lost to the United States at the CONCACAF
Gold Cup. Zagallo shrugged off the performances, saying that ``the
real Brazil always shows up when it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   It matters now, and the team hasn't shown up yet. It lacks focus
and leadership, and there have been several disputes in camp, most
involving the mercurial Edmundo, who has fought with Leonardo, been
in a skirmish with Junior Baiano and openly criticized Zagallo's
decision to start Bebeto in Romario's stead.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also all that talent, and it must count for
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brazil loses, it's absurd,'' says Leonardo. ``If we win,
it's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Ronaldo: ``In Brazil it is victory or exile there is
nothing in between. ... I believe in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe,'' Leonardo adds, ``that Brazil will be
champions. But I also know one mistake and it will be over.''

GALAXY ADJUSTS TO WORLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Anyone looking for Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano
this morning won't find him.
</P>
<P>
   Practice is cancelled. And there's a simple reason why . . . The
World Cup has started.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano's message was clear: Don't phone his office or reach
him at home, because he's not sure where he'll be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I know I won't be in the office, there's too much going
on there,'' Zambrano said. ``I don't want to be disturbed with
phone calls and questions while the games are on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching them at home, by myself,'' he said
cautiously. ``Change that, I won't be at home. I'll be at a place
where nobody knows where I'm at. I'll be incognito, a special
place. I just don't want to be bothered, I need to concentrate on
the games.''
</P>
<P>
   All practices aren't cancelled this month, but Zambrano did
decide to give his team a couple of days off this week. The Galaxy
leads the league with a 12-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, which only has four games scheduled during the World
Cup, doesn't play again until June 18, when it plays host to
Colorado at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave the guys a couple of days off this week to relax,''
Zambrano said. ``We've been going full steam since the season
started, and since the World Cup is beginning, I thought they
deserved a day off to enjoy the opening game and get their juices
going again.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Zambrano has changed the entire practice schedule
during the World Cup. Instead of practicing at 9:30 a.m., the team
won't start until 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all should be at home watching the games,''
Zambrano said. ``I don't want to be in practice thinking about the
Brazil score or have the players thinking about a particular
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Zambrano, the World Cup is like a coaching video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a student of the game,'' he said. ``I see the game not so
much from the fans' viewpoint or just to see a good match. I watch
the different strategies used by different coaches. For me, it's
more of an analytical thing. I want to learn more about the games,
that's why I don't want to be disturbed when I'm watching them.''
</P>
<P>
   From a mental standpoint, practice following the games will make
the players more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Zambrano said. ``I think anytime you watch
a sporting event of high caliber, it pumps you up. How many people
go out and play basketball when a game is over?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a Michael Jordan play, it gives you the urge to
go and play hoops yourself. That's what's going to happen. We will
watch the greatest players in the world showcase their skills and
it will give us an energy boost when we get to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Greg Vanney is looking forward to the evening sessions,
but says it won't be fun for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wives might not be too happy about it,'' he said.
``But for us, we'll get more out of it. I think these games will
motivate us and the practices will show that when we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Martin Machon says it will certainly change his
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be waking up early in the morning,'' he said. ``All the
things I'm used to doing will change during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the better though. This is a time when you can
actually enjoy the best soccer in the world. In the end, it will be
good for everyone because it will be a full month where our days
consist of soccer all day long.''

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (Phoenix) - She wanted him to die that night. For
nearly four years, Betty DellaCorte Ryan had endured her husband's
slaps, kicks and punches, often leaving her in a bloody mess and
heading for the emergency room. Tonight, she could tell, was going
to be another bad one by the way he was ranting and screaming at
her. She poisoned his beer with valium that night, but he survived.
Ryan is a domestic violence survivor and founder of Faith House,
one of the first domestic violence shelters in the nation. By JULIE

TRIBAL JUSTICE (Phoenix) - Waylon Nacho was 3 years old when he
watched his mother being stabbed to death as she held him. The
little boy will be 5 when his mother's killer walks out of jail.
The sentence Neva Catha's killer received last month from a judge
on the Gila River Indian Reservation has compounded the grief of
the woman's family and highlighted the inadequacies of tribal
justice. Tracy Laws, 27, was sentenced on May 11 to the maximum
jail term allowed under tribal law: one year for criminal homicide
and a second year for assault. By JUDI VILLA. Story will move in

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SANCARLOS STANDOFF (Phoenix) - The standoff at the San Carlos
Apache Indian Reservation has ended in dramatic fashion with the
formal arrest of formal tribal chairman Raymond Stanley on theft
and assault charges. According to a police spokesperson, Stanley
was apprehended at his home on Monday afternoon after a court order
was issued, charging him with six counts of wrongdoing. Stanley's

COLORADO-QUEST (Undated) - The path chosen by Doug Carithers is a

the Internet. Carithers is on a quest. He believes there's an error
in recorded history, and he thinks it should be fixed. The object

   CEO belives mergers driven by rapid advances By Chris Burritt
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although he dismissed the latest speculation British
Telecom might target his own company, Bell Atlantic Corp., the
chief executive of the biggest Baby Bell predicted further
consolidation in the global telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said Tuesday that
rapid advances in information technology are driving mergers and
acquisitions. The result: Giant companies are selling bundles of
services ranging from Internet access to local telephone service,
to consumers and to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The trend would accelerate, Seidenberg said, if the U.S.
government eased regulations over emerging technologies such as the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The single best thing regulators could do to jump-start
investment in new technologies is to move out of the way faster,
leaving pricing and investment decisions to the marketplace, where
they belong,'' Seidenberg said in luncheon remarks at SuperComm,
the communications conference at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg didn't specify which companies he thought might be
ripe for acquisition. But the big trade show, which runs through
Thursday, is abuzz with talk of the big deals of recent months _
and of others that could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   With its acquisition last year of Nynex Corp., Bell Atlantic is
the biggest Baby Bell _ for now. San Antonio-based SBC
Communications Inc. is set to become the biggest, with its proposal
to buy Ameritech. It acquired Pacific Bell last year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. has talked to potential partners,
but so far is flying solo amid the spate of mergers that has
companies now dwarfing BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Emory University marketing professor Jagdish Sheth
told a gathering of industry executives that British Telecom, which
lost out to WorldCom Inc. in the bidding for long-distance carrier
MCI Communications Corp., might now seek a merger with Bell
Atlantic of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sheth reasoned that both companies would benefit from the
massive flow of online information between New York and London,
where British Telecom is based.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Seidenberg told reporters, ''I do not see that as
realistic. But you never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pursue acquisitions, Bell Atlantic is expanding its
high-speed data services, such as the Internet, to attract more
customers. At the same time, Seidenberg said, the company will seek
alliances with providers of other services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not think you need to merge to become global,''
Seidenberg said. ''We think you need to improve your brand to
become global.''

 &HT;    New NCAA bowl procedure not perfect, but better
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new system for selecting the two teams for college
football's national championship game is not perfect. But it's
certainly better than the methods used in the past, SEC
Commissioner Roy Kramer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who also is the coordinator of the Bowl Championship
Series, unveiled a rating system that will include four components
to create what will be known as the BCS Standings. The top two
teams in the standings will advance to the national championship
game, which this season will be the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS is comprised of six major conferences and four major
bowls _ Fiesta, Sugar, Orange, and Rose. Each of the six conference
champs is guaranteed a slot in one of the bowls, with the top two
teams playing in a ``national championship'' game, which rotates to
a different bowl each year.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years the bowls have used only the two major polls _
which included the votes of sportswriters and coaches _ to pick the
teams for the national championship game. This new system
interjects more scientific information into the process, not unlike
the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) used to help determine the field
for the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Problems still will exist. If there are three undefeated teams,
the BCS Standings would be used to leave one team out of the big
game. The same goes if there is only one unbeaten team and several
with one loss. The numbers will make the decision, and somebody is
not going to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply felt that the time had come to get as much good
information into the process as we logically could,'' Kramer said.
``Like the polls, this system will have its flaws, and people will
argue about it. But it is an honest attempt to give the public what
it wants, and that's a true national championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   These standings, however, will determine the matchup for the
national championship game only. The other bowls will make their
selections from the remaining conference champions or at-large
teams that qualify by finishing in the top six of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in the final regular-season polls a year ago _
Michigan, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Florida State _ were the also
the top four under the BCS formula.
</P>
<P>
   Had the current system been in effect a year ago, Nebraska and
Michigan would have played for the national championship. But
Michigan was locked in to the Rose Bowl, where it beat Washington
State and eventually shared the national title with Nebraska, which
beat Tennessee in the Orange Bowl.

   FARMINGTON, Utah _ Here in the heart of the nation's herbal and
vitamin industry, a stainless steel contraption was hard at work on
a recent morning, spitting out clear plastic capsules at the rate
of 90,000 an hour. Each contained precisely 600 milligrams of a
fine, brick-colored powder that federal health officials are trying
to ban.
</P>
<P>
   The powder, a pulverized strain of rice called red yeast, is
imported from China, where it has been consumed for 2,000 years,
both as an herbal remedy (it was thought to improve blood flow) and
a food (it spices up tofu and makes a tasty marinade for duck and
pork.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, William McGlashan Jr., a young California
venture capitalist, learned that scientists in Beijing were
studying the rice for another reason: it seemed to lower
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McGlashan's company, Pharmanex, sells the encapsulated
red powder under the trade name Cholestin in 37,000 American
stores, from health food outlets to the giant Wal-Mart chain.
McGlashan calls Cholestin a dietary supplement. Officials at the
Food and Drug Administration call it something else: an illegal,
unapproved drug.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, in the gray stone federal courthouse in Salt Lake
City, U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball will be asked to
determine who is correct. The case is being watched as a pivotal
battle between the FDA, which is chafing against a 1994 law that
left it almost powerless to regulate vitamins and herbal products,
and the dietary supplement industry, which has been growing wildly
since the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is not whether Cholestin is dangerous; no one argues
that it is. Rather, the FDA contends that Cholestin has crossed the
increasingly murky boundary that separates dietary supplements from
drugs, because it contains an ingredient, lovastatin, that is the
key component of a cholesterol-lowering drug. Pharmanex says the
lovastatin occurs naturally and that Cholestin is more akin to a
food than a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case could affect the medicine and kitchen
cabinets of millions of American consumers, including many doctors
and scientists, who have come to believe that herbs like ginkgo,
echinacea and St. John's wort are as important to good health as
aspirin and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the turf battle between the supplement industry and
regulators, the dispute raises crucial questions: What is the
distinction between these herbal products, which may contain
naturally occurring chemicals as potent as those in any drug, and
drugs themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Must products like Cholestin be subjected to the rigorous
testing that drugs undergo?
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more and more dietary supplements sold right next to
over-the-counter drugs,'' said William Schultz, the FDA's deputy
commissioner for policy. ``There is a risk that the line will
blur.''
</P>
<P>
   It is already blurry. ``Foods are medicines; medicines are
foods,'' said Loren Israelson, executive director of the Utah
Natural Products Alliance, a trade group based in Salt Lake City.
``If you drink coffee in the morning, why are you drinking coffee?
You're looking for the caffeine, a stimulant. That same caffeine is
sold over the counter as No-Doz. That's a drug when it's in a pill
form, and it's a food when it's in coffee. Why is that?''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA struggled with such questions for decades. But with the
passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
the law under which the Cholestin case will be decided, the
agency's task grew even more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   The new law took dietary supplements out of the underground and
into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the
long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs,
even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy. If the
products were safe, companies could say what they wished, so long
as they did not claim their products could prevent, treat or cure
disease. Thus, McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin ``promotes
healthy cholesterol,'' but not that it ``prevents heart attack or
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' he said, ``we can educate the American
consumer about what the product does. We don't have to rely on a
person in a health food store to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, the FDA has received about 2,300
notifications from manufacturers intending to make claims about
their products, and has objected to about 150 of them. It has also
proposed a rule that would restrict, but not eliminate, the
manufacturer's ability to use the herbal stimulant ephedra, which
has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But these actions, says former Food and Drugs Commissioner David
Kessler, are hardly enough to make a dent in the rampant
proliferation of herbal remedies that he says are ineffective at
best and unsafe at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walk into your pharmacy; it's out of control,'' said
Kessler, who waged a bitter, unsuccessful battle against the 1994
law as commissioner. ``Efficacy is now defined as what sells off
the shelves. The agency is powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   While the law was a disaster for regulators, it was a windfall
for businesses that sell herbs and vitamins. Indeed, after the act
was adopted, annual sales of dietary supplements in the United
States skyrocketed, jumping from more than $8 billion in 1994 to
nearly $12 billion last year, according to the Nutrition Business
Journal, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   So furious has the growth been that one analyst, Matthew Patsky
of the Boston-based investment banking firm of Adams, Harkness &AMP;
Hill, said some of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies
are now planning to introduce their own lines of herbal products.
</P>
<P>
   That worries Schultz, the FDA deputy commissioner for policy.
``If companies that would have tested their products and sold them
as drugs are now going to not test them and sell them as dietary
supplements,'' he said, ``then we have lost information about the
safety and efficacy of those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the law's beneficiaries was McGlashan, a 34-year-old
Stanford University business school graduate who studied Chinese
history as an undergraduate. With the baby boomers growing older,
McGlashan sensed a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese
have used for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to
apply ``pharmaceutical rigors'' to the dietary supplement industry,
using research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked.
In early 1994, he Dr. Michael Chang, a medical chemist and former
pharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a manufacturing
plant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products and
identified 5,000; together, he and McGlashan narrowed the list to
30. By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi
Valley, Calif. Red yeast rice, called Hong Qu, was one of the most
promising projects on its list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Hong Qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know
why it lowers cholesterol,'' Chang said. ``We need to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law, McGlashan said, made it worth investing in
science. The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after
nearly three years of study. Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr.
David Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of
Cholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol
levels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for
three months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos.
Heber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the
supplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.
</P>
<P>
   Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug;
instead he calls it ``a functional food.'' The same
cholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in
even higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in
Asian cooking. And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology
at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current
distinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on
semantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully
regulated. ``If there is a biologically active component in the
supplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will
have a similar effect,'' he said. Companies like Pharmanex, he
added, ``want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the
drug is medically beneficial'' without doing rigorous research drug
companies must do to obtain approval.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of science, McGlashan admits, would cost far too much
for a small company like his. Yet with a decent body of research
behind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself
becoming the FDA's poster boy for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he received a visit from FDA investigators in April of
last year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin
contained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck &AMP; Co,
the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Mevacor, the
cholestorol-lowering drug that contains the same ingredient as
Cholestin.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, federal authorities impounded 10 tons of red
yeast rice that had come into the Port of Los Angeles from China;
the shipment is now sitting in a storage facility in Mexico. Then
on May 20, the FDA notified McGlashan that it considered Cholestin
illegal, a move that prompted the company to ask for a hearing
before Kimball of the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan contends that, at its root, the dispute is an economic
one. Cholestin, he said, is sold to people who are too healthy for
Mevacor, the Merck drug. Merck, he contends, is making a power grab
for that market by trying to push Cholestin off the shelves _ a
charge denied by Jan Weiner, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
   While the court case is pending, McGlashan said, sales of
Cholestin are booming. One woman recently wrote him to say she had
purchased eight months' worth of the capsules. Even his mother
called, he said, asking, ``How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, McGlashan has no answer. Standing outside the
low-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a
lab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a
little wistful. The fine red powder being packed into the capsules,
he said, was the last of his supply.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PARIS _ They stood on lush grass under a bright Southern California
sun four years ago, hugging one another and taking turns kissing
what is probably the most cherished trophy in sports.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their place in world soccer was secure. Their superiority was
unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was king.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hold the World Cup in your hands,'' Brazilian striker
Bebeto said, ``it's like touching heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   No team has been more divine in the World Cup's 68-year history
than Brazil, which has won an unprecedented four championships and
redefined the game with a style and creativity all its own.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry in motion is not a clich for this marvelous team. It is
an edict from the millions of Brazilian fans every time the storied
yellow jerseys take the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For Brazilians, the game is not a game but a drama, in which the
actors need no introduction _ or surnames. Bebeto, Ronaldo, Dunga.
Every Brazilian knows those names well, and they know what to
expect of them.
</P>
<P>
   Victories are not a matter of how, or even how many, but, ``Was
it beautiful enough?'' Was it stylish moves and perfectly placed
one-touch passes? Was it dribbling through two defenders and
spinning heads with quickness? Was it curving passes to the only
spot on the field where a speeding yellow-shirted striker could
fire a shot? Was it attack, attack, attack and impossible skill
leading to impossible plays?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the faces? Could the drama be told with one
glimpse at a Brazilian player's face? Did he sufficiently writhe in
agony when the ball bounced off the crossbar? Was enough sweat
pouring off his brow? Did he bleed for the sake of the game? And
when he scored, did he sprint across the field flailing his arms,
pulling off his jersey and screaming an ear-piercing wail? Was it
the face of a king?
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Brazil still has the look.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous contenders for the ultimate prize, and
intriguing questions abound when it comes to Brazil's greatness.
Beginning today, 32 teams will play 64 games in hopes of winning
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 1998 World Cup tournament opens today at the Stade de
France in Saint-Denis with Brazil facing Scotland, Brazil seems
most capable of drinking from the Cup again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Brazilian) team we played in 1990 was great, the one in
1994 was great, but this one is better,'' said Scotland goalkeeper
Jim Leighton, who drew the unenviable task of trying to stop the
yellow and blue today, in a game expected to be seen by hundreds of
millions of people. ``They have more pressure on them than any team
in the world, but they seem to be at their best when the games mean
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Brazil whipped through the tournament, actually
playing its poorest game in the final against Italy but winning the
Cup on penalty kicks. Brazil also is the only nation to have
appeared in every World Cup tournament and since 1958 only twice
has failed to reach at least the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, the acknowledged greatest soccer player in
history, Pel, was Brazilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaching the finals of the World Cup always is in the back of
your mind,'' Brazilian striker Ronaldo said. ``When you are a kid,
when you play for the clubs, in Europe, you always think about
coming to the World Cup and winning it for Brazil. It's what you
have to do or you shouldn't go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent outings have had Brazil's partying legion of fans
feeling less than festive about prospects for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game, while expected to be a Brazil victory, is
considered huge. It could serve as an indication for which
Brazilian team came to France, the one that has won all but three
international games since 1993, or the one that has lacked its
familiar flair and confidence in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, the team could do no better than a 1-1 draw with
a professional club team from Spain, Athletico Bilbao. Earlier, the
Brazilians lost a pair of international exhibition matches against
Argentina and the United States. It also pulled out a sluggish 1-0
exhibition win over Paris club team Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Even today's opposing coach, Scotland's Craig Brown, said of the
Brazilians: ``In recent games, they have not played as a team. It
is one thing for a team to have excellent players, and Brazil
surely does. But they are not really playing as a unified team at
the moment. It is in moments like these that any team, including
Brazil, can be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent efforts were so out of character for the Brazilians
that headlines such as, ``They looked like a flock of sheep,''
blared across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a national poll regarding Brazil's World Cup prospects _
yes, they really had a national poll about this _ indicated 57
percent of the population was ``terrified'' Brazil would not win
the Cup. Some 31 percent said they were ``pessimistic,'' and only
11 percent predicted victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not winning is the unthinkable,'' Ronaldo said. ``We have to
come together, and we will. Really, we have only been together with
this full team for a few days. When we start playing for the Cup,
it will flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason things have not flowed is the reason the
nation is concerned. Romario, the marvelous scorer of 1994, will
not play in the tournament after injuring a calf last month.
</P>
<P>
   Romario, who was expected to be an explosive veteran leader to
complement the talented Ronaldo, 21, will be replaced by 1994
veteran Bebeto, whom many consider past his prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had plans for this World Cup, but now they won't happen,''
Ronaldo said. ``Romario is a great player, the sort who makes the
difference and can decide a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sad, but this does not mean that we shouldn't be
favorites. It doesn't mean we won't prove that Brazil is still
Brazil when we play Scotland. We can still win the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   They can still put on the face of kings, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, after all, seems capable of carrying this side.
</P>
<P>
   But what might prove the best weapon for this team is defense.
The keeper, Taffarel, is a 1994 veteran and proven stopper. And
defensive star Roberto Carlos was runner-up to Ronaldo for the
European Player of the Year last season.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil has played its best, it often has been Roberto
Carlos starting some thrilling length-of-the-field attacks with his
array of moves and dribbles up the field.
</P>
<P>
   And when it hasn't been Roberto Carlos, it has been midfield
veteran Dunga, another longtime national-team member, starting the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that the current team is more talented than the
teams I have been on before, but it is not yet better
emotionally,'' Dunga said. ``When we start playing more intensive,
with more humility and less inconsistency, you'll see the Brazil
you want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The kings want to keep their crown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 80,000 fans at Stade de France and fans across
much of the world will get their first glimpse of the defending
champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we will win, but we can win,'' Bebeto said.
``Brazil always can win. It's up to God and luck to decide if we
will do it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not easy to squeeze into a dressing room with two pieces
of carry-on luggage and a laptop to try on a pair of jeans. And the
sight of three airline captains hovering over a table of pink
lingerie at Victoria's Secret still draws a second glance.
</P>
<P>
   But such scenes are quietly becoming as integral to air travel
as jet lag, weather delays and nondairy creamer. A number of
airports, somewhat surreal spaces where travelers were once content
to buy a few magazines and stare nervously at a clock, are starting
to look a lot like malls.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, dozens of national retailers have opened
airport shops, invading what has long been the domain of
newsstands, duty-free shops and the occasional live lobster stand
by establishing small outposts of the Gap, Victoria's Secret and
the like. At least one store, Altitunes, operates only in airports.
Such stores are joined by a full array of food chains, including
Starbucks and Legal Sea Foods.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy makes some sense. Many retailers have saturated the
nation's malls and downtowns, and are desperate for new places to
set up shop. And with both business and leisure travel at a
decade-long high, a lot of airports are scurrying to freshen up
their terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Running a business in an airport, though, can be a logistical
nightmare. In no mall in America, for instance, are food merchants
forced to take a dozen heads of lettuce through security. Many
workers balk at commuting to an airport. And customers often breeze
by shops in rushing to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the headaches, airport stores can be profitable:
Sales per square foot are often three or four times as high as
those for stores in other locations, even though prices are the
same as at malls. And ubiquitous delays coupled with the increased
security measures that force travelers to get to airports earlier
these days means these shoppers-in-motion often have more spare
time on their hands. Managers at Ronald Reagan Washington National
Airport say annual sales average $950 a square foot, more than
three times the business in an average mall store, where the figure
tends to be closer to $250 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Airports from Heathrow, outside London, to Pittsburgh
International to La Guardia in New York to National have undergone
major renovations in recent years in which the addition of new
stores has played a key role. Others, like Chicago's O'Hare, are
following suit.
</P>
<P>
   While most American retailers have mall life down to a science,
though, they are finding that running a shop in an airport is
another story entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, airport rents are at least 20 percent higher,
usually paid out as a percentage of sales. And shoppers are likely
to spend only moments browsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airport retail is a tough business operationally,'' said
Judith Byrd, a principal with Unison Consulting Group, an airport
consultant in Chicago. ``The hours are longer, the rents are
higher. And you have to have an understanding of the market and
airline passenger flows.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retailing problems are unique to airports, like how to get
merchandise through customs and security and onto a selling floor
that is at most half the size of a company's average store.
</P>
<P>
   But others are similar to what every retailer faces, with some
twists. Location is usually the most important factor in a
retailer's success, but with airport shops, location has as much to
do with which airline a shop is parked next to as with what city
the airport is in and which department store is nearby.
</P>
<P>
   People who study airport retailing say the best-performing
strips are in hub airports, where lots of passengers are changing
planes and are thus forced to linger. Heavy international traffic
is a big plus. And it is always better to have the shops located
after the security point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in a rush to get to the airport,'' said Michael
Bell, president of BAA PLC's American unit, which manages the shops
at Pittsburgh airport, one of the first American airports to entice
major retailers. ``Then they go through a number of hurdles. Check
in. Security. The sight of the gate is when they are at ease. That
is the moment when they have time to spend. So being closest to the
gate is the prime location.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pittsburgh, most stores are past security, in an area every
passenger passes through.
</P>
<P>
   But National in many ways provides a textbook example of an
airport that is good for passengers but bad for merchants. The
terminal, which was renovated in July, is full of escalators that
lead right from the check-in areas on the upper level to the gates
and baggage claim on lower levels. So passengers can easily bypass
all the stores, which are mostly located before the security point.
On top of that, most airline traffic at National is domestic, with
few people changing planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nine West Group, which operates a variety of shoe stores,
said it had done far better with its new Nine West fashion shoes
store at the Pittsburgh airport than it has with its Easy Spirit
comfort shoes shop in Washington, where three employees lingered
recently in an otherwise empty store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic in that store is average,'' said Jodi Fisher, a
company spokeswoman. ``It is not like the huge amount that we are
experiencing in Pittsburgh. If we go into another airport, it will
have to have a centralized shopping area.''
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers echoed a disappointment with National. ``Is that
terminal beautiful?'' asked one retailer who has stores in several
airports and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Absolutely.
But it is poorly laid out. People are in and out, they are not
there early, they have no time to hang out. We are not doing as
well as anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Johnson, the regional manager of Westfield Corp., which
manages the retail leases there, said he was pleased with their
performance. ``So far we are meeting our projections,'' he said.
``As in any retail environment, you have some retailers that don't
do as well as you'd like.''

GRAND QUEST SEEKS COLORADO RIVER'S FIRST BOATER

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTTONWOOD, Ariz. _ The path chosen by Doug Carithers is a
lonely one. It takes him into lost places and sites only a few will
ever visit as it winds through canyons and libraries, old books and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Carithers is on a quest. He believes there's an error in
recorded history, and he thinks it should be fixed. So he has
devoted a substantial portion of the past 25 years hiking into
canyons, searching through history books, interviewing people,
poring over maps and looking for support.
</P>
<P>
   The object of this passion is one Denis Julien, a French trapper
and explorer who worked the canyons and rivers of Utah in the early
1800s. Julien's name appears infrequently in writings about that
time because he was associated with Meriwether Lewis for a while
and was involved in the Louisiana Purchase as a government agent.
</P>
<P>
   But Carithers maintains that Julien earned a niche in history
that is currently occupied by Maj. John Wesley Powell, the
geologist and anthropologist who became a national hero after
exploring the West. Powell's most famous journey began in Green
River, Wyo., in May 1869. It lasted three months, covered 900 miles
and didn't end until his group passed safely through the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Carithers has no disagreement with most of that. But one little
segment pushes him onward. It's the theory that during the epic
journey, Powell and his fellow travelers became the first White men
to traverse the Green and Colorado rivers in southeastern Utah.
Carithers maintains that Julien boated into the area years before.
And that he carved his name into the sandstone canyon walls to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Julien wrote his full name, followed by a date. Other
times, it was ``D. Julien'' or simply his initials, but always
dated. The years were all around 1836.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are eight known inscriptions carved into rock that tell
me Julien was there long before Powell,'' Carithers said while
tracing Julien's alleged route on a huge map hanging from the wall
of his home in Cottonwood. ``I've seen five of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the inscriptions are near the confluence of the Green
and Colorado Rivers in Cataract Canyon, in Canyonlands National
Park in southeastern Utah. Carithers spent part of his formative
years in the area. His father was a National Park Service ranger at
Canyonlands and at Navajo National Monument in northeastern
Arizona, and he followed in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   He was a riverboat operator on the Green River for eight years,
three of them as a Canyonlands ranger like his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a car salesman in Cottonwood, but his search goes on,
most of it from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a couple of trips back since leaving there in
1976,'' he said, ``but now I do most of my research here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has three notebooks filled with his personal observations
from his time on the river and interviews with anyone he can find
who might know anything about Denis Julien. He has them arranged in
book form and is looking for a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to detract from John Wesley Powell,'' he said.
``I only want to add to the legacy of Denis Julien. I want to get
his story out and put it in history books.''
</P>
<P>
   Carithers and early historians say the inscriptions prove that
Julien was in the canyons formed by the two rivers more than 30
years before Powell. But such claims are debunked by Powell
supporters, he says, because ``they sort of regard Julien as just a
greasy old fur trapper.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell biographers acknowledge the inscriptions but have
inferred that Julien didn't float down the rivers. Their contention
is that he trapped and hunted the riverbanks but never actually put
boat into water. They support that, Carithers said, by noting that
most of the inscriptions are on the same side of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carithers says at least one of the ancient pieces of
graffiti is across the water from the others and that there were
probably several others that have been eroded by time or washed
away by rising water.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the average, somebody discovers a Julien signature once
every 20 to 25 years,'' he said. ``The total is probably in the
dozens, but they're lost, disputed or not authenticated. Julien's
signature on a rock is the most sought-after inscription in the
West. It's the Holy Grail for people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the search, little scraps of information become milestones.
Carithers hauled out copies of the July 1933 ``Utah Historical
Quarterly,'' which contained an article titled ``The Mysterious D.
Julien.'' In it, the author quotes Frederick S. Dellenbaugh,
historian of Powell's two expeditions, who wrote in 1872:
</P>
<P>
   ``After about seven miles the trend of the canyon became more
easterly, and we saw the mouth of the Grand, the junction (of the
Green with the Grand) that hidden mystery which, unless we count D.
Julien, only nine White men, the Major's first party, had ever seen
before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The article also observes that a survey party later found the
name ``D. Julien'' carved into the rock in five different places,
all with the date of 1836.
</P>
<P>
   Carithers also scans the Internet for additional snippets of
information and has established contact with some supporters;
anyone interested in joining his search may contact him at
kemosabe(at)cybertrails.com via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julien wasn't just a smelly old trapper,'' Carithers insisted.
``He deserves a place in history. I want to give him that.'' &QL;

   Another issue for airport retailers is a shortage of good labor.
This problem bedevils the entire retail industry, of course, but
enticing employees to travel to far-flung, traffic-strewn locations
can be particularly rough. What is more, employee parking areas are
often 20 minutes from the airport, adding unpaid travel time to a
worker's day.
</P>
<P>
   Airport retailers also need staff on hand for much longer days,
because many airport companies, like BAA, insist that all stores be
open from the minute the first flight lands _ usually around 6 a.m.
_ to the time the last one pulls out, about 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver is miles and miles from civilization, and they are
having staffing problems,'' said Bruce Van Kleeck, director of
member services for the National Retail Federation in Washington.
``And other airports are having real problems.'' Retailers said
they were being forced to add at least $1 an hour to employees'
wages to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is inventory. Bringing it into the airport can be
tricky because of security issues and because airplanes take up the
space where a truck bay would be at a shopping center. Since the
stores themselves are so tiny, there is little space to stock
items.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has dealt with the problem by creating a
sophisticated _ and costly _ system in which inventory travels from
a stock room down the service road, through the airport on
underground carts and pops up inside the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``At older airports you have to lug that inventory right through
security,'' said Ms. Byrd of Unison Consulting. ``The worst is when
you have a food vendor carting lettuce through a security
checkpoint, which is fundamentally unsightly.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people are in a hurry to get in and out of shopping
malls these days, the average time spent in an airport store can
literally be seconds, so efficiency is everything.
</P>
<P>
   At Tie Rack stores, for example, solid ties are bunched
together, so shoppers can go right to what they want, said Mary
Calder-Ricci, the company's senior regional manager. And chatter is
cut short. At a Main Street or mall shop, an employee might give
fashion advice, but ``in an airport you just want to help them get
out of the store,'' she said, adding that shoppers rarely wait for
gift wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Airport shoppers tend to want one of two things: something they
forgot to pack or a last-minute gift for a child or spouse left
behind on a business trip. Shops _ like the PGA Golf Stores and the
Discovery Channel or Smithsonian stores _ selling items that make
good, fast gifts tend to do well, said the experts. So do stores
with well-known names selling belts, scented soap or simple shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you pack at the last minute, and so it is great
that they have basics here,'' said Gina Sataro, 29, who lives in
Hartford and who recently flew into National to visit her sister in
Washington. ``I blow past the souvenir shops. I'm not interested in
those.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course it has to fit in a suitcase. Victoria's Secret did
not do well with cushy robes, Johnson, the airport retail manager,
said, faring far better with filmy nightgowns.
</P>
<P>
   Airport stores have such limited space that they try to carry
only their best-selling items. The general rule is that retailers
will stock these shops with the 20 percent of their merchandise
that generates 80 percent of their sales. The Gap store at
National, for instance, has a smattering of basic sweaters, a few
cute baby outfits and a relatively small selection of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours spent at National seemed to underscore that shoppers
like to spend time in stores they know best. The Gap and Bath and
Body Works were relatively busy, while the National Zoo store was
fairly quiet. ``It seemed the stores have catered to where your
mind is when you're here,'' said Linwood Robinson, who lives in
Atlanta and was cruising the Gap after dropping his wife off.
``That's what makes it great. It has things you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the best customers tend to be people who work in
airports. At the Victoria's Secret store at National, for instance,
blue stockings, purchased by flight attendants, accounted for 18
percent of total sales this winter.
</P>
<P>
   At Altitunes Partners LP, a chain of airport-based music stores,
20 percent of the business comes from employees. Amy Nye Wolf, who
founded the company when she realized she was always getting tired
of the music she brought on long trips, said she has started
offering special discount programs to airport employees, and keeps
her stores well stocked with reggae, rap and heavy metal music.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers are cagey about their airport strategy.
Spokeswomen for Gap Inc. and Intimate Brands, the unit of Limited
Inc. that operates Bath and Body Works and Victoria's Secret,
refused to comment on their smattering of stores or future plans.
</P>
<P>
   But many retail and real estate experts expect that more and
more retailers will try to move into airports. ``It does represent
a profitable new store strategy,'' said Jeffrey Green, president of
the Green Group, a real estate consultant in Detroit. ``But you
need the large number of connecting visitors to make it work
well.''

   CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen appear to be on the
brink of winning their sixth championship together (despite the
nitwit antics of Dennis Rodman), which would be the same number of
rings Bill Russell won with Bob Cousy.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is universally acclaimed as the best player ever, and
Pippen is a card-carrying member of the 1992 Dream Team and the
NBA's All-Time Top 50 Social Register.
</P>
<P>
   So what about it? Are Michael and Scottie the best tandem in the
history of the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're the best two guys to play together,''
said Red Auerbach, the only individual who has been part of the NBA
since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's an answer. With Cousy and Russell, you
got the break and got the ball. It was the same with Jabbar and
Magic. With Jordan and Pippen, you've got movement, defense, and
everything else, but you're not sure you got the ball. It's hard to
make a comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have Cousy and Russell than Jordan and Pippen.
Who's gonna get you the ball? You can't go anywhere without the
ball. Also, it would be very difficult for me to pick Jordan and
Pippen ahead of Jabbar and Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Ramsay, who won a world championship coaching the
Portland Trail Blazers, said, ``There's several ways of looking at
it. I think of a tandem as guys who feed off each other, and I'd
have to say Karl Malone and John Stockton do that more than any two
players I've seen. But as for the most talented duo, I'd have to go
with Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other perfect-pair candidates. Larry Bird, Kevin
McHale, and Robert Parish played alongside one another for 12
seasons and certainly stand as the greatest trio in NBA history.
Reduced to a pair, Bird and McHale are the obvious twosome, but
they never really fed off one another. Theirs was a Ruth-Gehrig
dynamic: two all-time greats with totally different personalities
and approaches to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The West-Baylor tandem ruled the NBA for more than a decade, and
when they retired, they were viewed as the best ever at their
respective positions. Then along came Magic Johnson, who reinvented
the guard position and got to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
for 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This correspondent won't forget a scene from Logan Airport
during the 1984 Finals. Those were the days of commercial air
travel for teams, and when the Lakers arrived in steamy Boston for
Game 5, there was tremendous traffic (what a surprise) and few
cabs. Kareem and Magic shared a taxi, which provoked an apoplectic
Bob Ryan to exclaim, ``How can they put them both in the same cab?
That's like letting the president and vice president ride in the
same aircraft!''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Pippen have been through it all together. They are
megatalents, made better by the presence of each other. Granted,
Pippen needs Jordan more than Michael needs Scottie, but Mike might
not have all those rings without the contributions of his sidekick.
Pippen's talents were masked in his early seasons, but Bird's eyes
were opened when he teamed with Pippen in Barcelona (conversely,
the Olympic experience somewhat diminished the reputation of the
estimable Malone). Pippen has proven to be something more than Ed
McMahon. And how often can a coach claim that his two top scorers
are also his best two defenders?
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pippen, Jordan said, ``It's like playing with a twin
brother. It takes a lot of pressure off me offensively and
defensively. Defensively, it's nice to have another player out
there who works as hard as I do. Offensively, I think the best
thing that happened for Scottie was when I stepped away for two
years. Now his confidence is just as strong as mine. And his
competitiveness is just as strong as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said, ``With Michael and myself, you have two guys out
there who are a total threat and who have all-around ability to
play hard on both ends of the court because it makes you more
dominant as a team. When Michael is not out there, I look to be
more aggressive on the offensive end. When he is out there, I look
to be more aggressive defensively because I feel that I can create
things on the defensive end that he can do on the offensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz certainly experienced that Sunday when Pippen played
like an All-Pro strong safety, making the veteran Jazz look like a
high school junior varsity squad as the Bulls romped to a record
96-54 victory in Game 3 of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In head-to-head competition, Pippen and Jordan look for all the
world like a better twosome than Malone and Stockton. Historians
will have to decide the rest, but in a mythical game of two-on-two,
whom would you take over Scottie and Michael?

MAIN MEDICARE ALTERNATIVES AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Older Americans and some disabled people will soon have more
health insurance options. Here are the main alternatives authorized
by Congress. Different options will be available in different parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ORIGINAL MEDICARE: Beneficiaries can use any hospital and can go
to any doctor who accepts Medicare patients. The government
regulates doctors' fees and most other aspects of the program.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION: Patients must use doctors,
hospitals and suppliers approved by the HMO. But the plan may pay
for prescription drugs and other items not covered by the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   HMO WITH POINT-OF-SERVICE OPTION: Patients meet most of their
medical needs by using doctors and hospitals on an approved list.
But they may go outside the network if they are willing to pay
extra.
</P>
<P>
   PREFERRED-PROVIDER ORGANIZATION: Beneficiaries may use any
doctors or hospitals, but are charged less if they use those on an
approved list.
</P>
<P>
   PROVIDER-SPONSORED ORGANIZATION: This plan is owned and operated
by the doctors and hospitals that provide most of the services to
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE FEE-FOR-SERVICE PLAN: Patients may go to any doctor or
hospital, but there may be substantial costs for beneficiaries
because the federal government does not limit the premiums that may
be charged. The plan gets a fixed amount of federal money for each
beneficiary. Doctors are paid a separate fee for each service.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT: Beneficiaries choose a private
insurance policy with a high deductible to cover catastrophic
expenses. Medicare pays the premium and deposits money in a savings
account, which is used to pay routine medical expenses. Patients
may have to use their money to pay medical bills if the savings
account is insufficient.

 &HT;    Patent infringement case leaks into bankruptcy court
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest damage claims filed by Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Kimberly-Clark against Paragon Trade Brands might be likened to
attacking a mosquito with a howitzer.
</P>
<P>
   How else compare claims of up to $8.7 billion against a company
whose market value is just shy of $47 million, whose 1997 sales
totaled $562 million, and whose stock closed at $3.93 3/4 Tuesday,
down 50 cents?
</P>
<P>
   It's diaper warfare between Norcross-based Paragon, which makes
store-brand versions, and two giants that together own 74 percent
of the $3.6 billion disposable diapers market.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble makes Pampers and Luvs diapers. Kimberly-Clark
makes Huggies.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy court filing by Paragon is part of a long-running
patent-infringement case over leak-proof diapers.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court ruled in December that Paragon infringed two
Procter &AMP; Gamble patents. In self-defense, Paragon shortly
afterward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Kimberly-Clark has filed a similar suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Abraham, chief executive of the Norcross company, called
the action by the bigger companies ``an obvious effort to grossly
over-inflate their claims in order to force a settlement without
regard to the underlying value of the claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither company could be reached for comment, but some analysts
agree with Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a major private label supplier, Paragon is of great concern
to premium-brand companies,'' said Fred Allvine, a professor of
management at Georgia Tech. ``Private label companies are a major
source of price competition to P&AMP;G and Kimberly-Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragen MacKenzie analyst Daniel F. Nelson said he takes Abraham's
comment at face value. ``These guys are probably trying to bully
the company (Paragon) into some sort of settlement, or make it look
so bleak some of its customers will give up,''
</P>
<P>
   If that's their motive, it isn't working, according to Alan J.
Cyron, chief financial officer. ``The court actions have not
affected our day-to-day operations. Our customers have been very
supportive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back him up so far. Paragon reported revenue of
$138.3 million for the first quarter ended March 27, up from $135.7
million a year earlier and $136.4 million in the fourth quarter.
The company posted a profit of $6 million, or 50 cents per share,
in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Abraham said the company is working with the
creditors' committee, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark ``to
reach a reasonable business resolution as quickly as possible which
protects the interests of all our stakeholders.''

   DALLY-SENTENCE (Ventura, Calif.) _ Michael Dally is set to be
sentenced to life in prison this morning for the 1996 kidnapping
and murder of his wife, Sherri Dally. The jury voted 7-5 in favor
of a death sentence _ short of the unanimous vote that is required
for a death sentence. Prosecutors declined to retry the penalty
phase, meaning Dally will be automatically sentenced to life in
prison without parole. Last week his attorney requested a new trial
because of trial errors and alleged prosecutorial misconduct. The
judge is to rule on those issues before the sentencing. By Michael

MEDICARE RECIPIENTS TO GET NEW HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: See sidebar, MEDICARE-OPTIONS.) 
(th) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty-eight million Medicare beneficiaries will
soon be flooded with information about new health insurance
options, and most of them are likely to be thoroughly confused,
according to consumer advocates, members of Congress and Medicare
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The new options were created by Congress last year to give
beneficiaries a wider variety of choices, like those available to
many workers in private industry who receive insurance coverage
from their employers.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Federal Health
Care Financing Administration, who is supervising the new program,
said that ``many beneficiaries do not understand the basics of the
original Medicare program,'' much less the exotic variations of
managed health care devised by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans an extensive education and publicity
campaign and will soon send a new Medicare handbook, with a
detailed description of all the options, to every Medicare
beneficiary's household.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they had tested the materials in ``focus
groups'' of beneficiaries, and said the results were not
encouraging. Beneficiaries are often overwhelmed by the number of
choices, Hash said, and ``even well-educated beneficiaries have
difficulty understanding them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Illene Gordon, a caseworker for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., predicted that congressional offices would ``be
flooded with calls'' from constituents baffled by the Medicare
options, which include not only health maintenance organizations,
but also preferred-provider organizations, provider-sponsored
organizations, medical savings accounts and private fee-for-service
plans.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, director of legislation and public policy at the
American Association of Retired Persons, said, ``Most beneficiaries
will have a hard time sorting through the new choices because of
their complexity, and because the Medicare population has very
little experience with managed care. It's not what they had when
they were working. We can anticipate a high level of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The new options, most of which will become available late this
year, offer the possibility of extra benefits, including
prescription drugs and other items not covered by the standard
Medicare program, the national health care plan for the elderly.
But they may also expose beneficiaries to higher costs and more
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, the new options represent a great national
experiment in health policy, enabling private health plans to
compete with Medicare's government-run insurance program. Consumers
will decide which model works best.
</P>
<P>
   Different options will be available in different parts of the
country, and no one knows for sure how many private health plans
will enter the potentially lucrative Medicare market. If
beneficiaries are satisfied with the way they get health care now,
they do not have to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   Six million beneficiaries are in an HMO or other type of managed
care today. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the
number will soar to 17 million by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., a psychiatrist, said, ``I am really
worried that when 38 million beneficiaries _ 26 million households
_ get the new Medicare handbook, confusion will reign. Our casework
staff will be inundated with questions just before the November
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the Ways and
Means subcommittee on health, said the handbook was ``a waste of
$40 million.'' In fact, he said, ``it could actually be worse than
a waste of money because of the confusion it will create for
seniors and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from the handbook reads: ``If you had a supplemental
policy and dropped it to enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, or
Medicare Select policy for the first time, and you choose to
disenroll from the Medicare health plan or Medicare Select policy
within 12 months of enrolling, then you can go back to the Medigap
policy you had before joining the Medicare health plan, if it is
still offered, or purchase Medigap policies A, B, C or F. This
protection is only available during the 63 days after leaving the
health plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Berenson, director of Medicare's Center for Health
Plans and Providers, said he doubted that his 85-year-old mother
would fully understand the new options, even though she used to
work in a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hibbard, a professor of health policy at the University
of Oregon in Eugene, said, ``Some of these options are so new and
so complex, it's very difficult for anyone to know what is best, or
even what questions to ask. It's uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a trustee of the Medicare trust fund, said that at
least 20 percent of beneficiaries had Alzheimer's disease, memory
problems or other mental impairments that would make it difficult
for them to understand the new options. And that does not include
people with low literacy skills or very poor eyesight, said Ms.
Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide surveys by the Education Department have found that
40 percent of the elderly have very limited ability to read and use
printed materials.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many older people are active and alert, well
versed in the complexities of medical care and money management.
Younger beneficiaries may have had some experience with managed
care in their working years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the health plans will become available late this year.
But they may begin enrolling Medicare beneficiaries sooner, if they
have signed contracts with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the new plans will receive a fixed amount of
federal money for each beneficiary, regardless of how much care the
person requires. By contrast, under the original Medicare program,
doctors receive a separate fee for each service they perform and
hospitals are paid an additional amount each time a patient is
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in Medicare have profound implications for thousands
of employers who provide health benefits to retirees, supplementing
Medicare. Stephen Parahus of Segal Co. in New York, a consulting
concern that specializes in employee benefits, said, ``Many
Medicare-eligible retirees will find the new array of choices
bewildering.'' Accordingly, he said, employers ``should brace
themselves for a torrent of questions and requests for
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government will answer questions about the new program on a
toll-free telephone line. But the toll-free service will not be
immediately available in all states, and consumer advocates predict
that callers will face long waiting times because Medicare has not
hired enough operators.
</P>
<P>
   Hash estimated that the government would need more than 2,000
people to answer calls at the busiest times of day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Medicare handbook will contain detailed information
comparing the cost, benefits and performance of HMOs and other
health plans. There will be more than 500 different versions of
this section of the handbook, each tailored to a specific local
market, Hash said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Medicare official, Jean LeMasurier, said, ``It's really
an absolutely overwhelming project'' to compile such data, produce
the handbooks and mail them to consumers. Rep. Bill Thomas,
R-Calif., said, ``We are very concerned about whether this
old-fashioned government bureaucracy can change in time to do the
job of consumer education.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries will also receive mail solicitations and
brochures directly from HMOs and other health plans that want them
to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   But William Scanlon, director of health care issues at the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said
the marketing materials often omitted important information and
could mislead consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said it was extremely difficult to
compare the costs and benefits of private health plans being
offered to Medicare beneficiaries because their brochures did not
use a standard format or terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for example, a health plan that offers to pay for $1,300 a
year in prescription drugs might seem more attractive than a plan
that covers only $1,000. But, Scanlon said, the plans typically
measure drug usage in different ways. Some use retail price, some
use wholesale price and some use a discounted version of the
wholesale price. &QL;

COMMENTARY: BOB HOPE LIVES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to published reports, the Internet didn't kill Bob
Hope. The real culprit was Congress, whose members took to
eulogizing the still-living comic from the floor last Friday on the
basis of an advance obituary accidentally posted on an Associated
Press web site. Had anyone in the House actually looked at the
computer printout that cued the funeral oratory, he would have seen
a patently dummy news story shot through with long strings of
xxxxxxxxx as space holders. But why let the facts ruin a touching
impromptu memorial service being beamed by C-Span to the voters
back home?
</P>
<P>
   All the way around, it was human error, not computer error, that
led to this gallows comedy of errors. And there may have been no
one who enjoyed the farce more than Matt Drudge, the Internet's
self-styled Walter Winchell and every commentator's favorite poster
boy (me included) for journalistic impropriety in the new media
age. On his site, Drudge made fun of ABC News, which had broadcast
Hope's ``death'' on its radio network. ``In January,'' Drudge wrote
with deadpan irony, ``ABC News Nightline devoted a show to the
perils of speed Internet reporting and the danger of false
information being circulated online without fact-checkers and
editors.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's gaffe hardly clears Drudge of his own egregious errors,
one of which has led to a ferocious libel suit. But about at least
one thing, one big thing, he has been right, and he was right long
before most of the rest of us recognized it: The Internet, speed
and all, is shaking up the coverage and dissemination of news as
has nothing else in the half-century since the proliferation of
television. It may one day even eclipse TV, much as TV long ago
downsized radio.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pew survey released on Monday talks in very
unpollster-like language of the ``astonishing rate'' of increase in
the Internet news audience. In 1995, only 14 percent of Americans
surfed the net for news; now, just three years later, 36 percent
do. In recent years the audience for print journalism has remained
stable while the number of Americans who rely exclusively on TV's
nightly broadcast news has fallen from 30 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey also showed that most Americans cite accuracy as
by far the most important component of news, and that they
distinguish clearly between credible brands like The Wall Street
Journal (which 81 percent rate as largely accurate) and the
National Enquirer (which only 7 percent do). Would these news
consumers be turning to Internet news sources if they believed them
to be intrinsically inaccurate? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, you could argue _ as Drudge slyly did when
addressing Washington's National Press Club last week _ that it is
the non-Internet media that have made the most notorious
journalistic errors of late: the bogus eyewitness account of a
Monica-Clinton tryst, the incrimination of Richard Jewell, the
digital capping of Bobbi McCaughey's teeth, the serial publication
of plagiarized and fictional stories in The New Republic and, just
three days after the Drudge speech, Bob Hope's ``death.'' It's past
time to retire the Internet as a scapegoat for journalistic ills;
it's a medium, not a message, and it can be used as irresponsibly
or as honorably as a printing press or a TV network can.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will surely distinguish between credible and tabloid
news on the net just as they do in other media. When Matt Drudge
runs an inaccurate, unsubstantiated story, he pays _ if not in
court, then in how his audience perceives him. His undeniably
entertaining site could end up as widely read as the Enquirer _ and
just as widely disbelieved. Or he could turn himself with
unassailable scoops into the net's Horace Greeley. At this
embryonic moment in Internet news history, Media Metrix, a company
that counts web-site visitors, reports that msnbc.com (rated
(NU)5), an aggressive and rarely inaccurate chronicler of Clinton
scandals, dwarfs drudgereport.com ((NU)228) by twelvefold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going to save the news business,'' Drudge
declared at the Press Club. It's hard to fault him for striking
back with such hyperbole at his critics within the journalistic
establishment. Their reports that he and his new medium would kill
the news business have proved as inaccurate as those of the death
of Hope.

NAVY SAYS IT'S TOO RISKY TO TAKE USS CONSTITUTION TO SEA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD AND CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a dream almost too good to be true, that the nation
could dust off a 200-year-old ship, suit it up in a back brace and
new sails, then venture forth from one celebration to another as
sailing proof that a nation's youth is eternal and time can be
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it turned out to be just that _ too good to be
true. Tuesday, the Navy announced that the USS Constition will not
be visiting coastal ports this summer or anytime in the future. In
fact, they say the ship may never sail again to ensure it survives
for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``After weighing the benefits and associated risks of taking
this priceless national treasure back to the sea, I decided that
the nation is best served by conducting any future operation of Old
Ironsides in ... the sheltered waters of Massachusetts Bay,''
Admiral Jay L. Johnson, chief of naval operations, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while it is feasible that the ship may sail again,
``there are no plans to participate in any such events,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The ship passed its $250,000 stress test three weeks ago, but
the whims of the weather would be too chancy, according to the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as a total surprise to officials in Gloucester,
which was counting on a visit from the ship in early August to help
the city celebrate its 375th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't heard anything from the Navy, so I can't
really find the right words at the moment,'' said Michael Costello,
executive director of the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce. He said
that just three weeks ago, a Navy official had sat in on an
organizational meeting as city officials detailed plans to shuttle
hundreds of school children out to the ship for an Aug. 4-7 visit.
But that's off as of Tuesday, leaving more than a few people in the
lurch.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bill Cunningham, owner of Captain Bill's Whale
Watching and Deep Sea Fishing in Gloucester, said he has turned
down several bookings for a 75-foot vessel so he could make the
boat available for transportation to Old Ironsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working with the Navy since last summer. This will
be costing me some money. The Navy has a strange way of doing
things because I had every indication three weeks ago that Old
Ironsides was coming for sure,'' Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Portsmouth, N.H., was slated to be the second port of call, but
Robin Comstock, president of that city's Chamber of Commerce, said
Portsmouth ``always knew there was uncertainty in the visit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's decision undoubtedly will disappoint organizers of
the OpSail event in New York City, who had proposed the
Constitution lead the parade of tall ships expected there two years
hence.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said the ship will not venture beyond about eight miles
of Deer Island so it can scoot for home in threatening weather. The
ship will leave its berth at the Charlestown Naval Shipyard for the
annual turnarounds _ Bunker Hill Day next Friday, and Independence
Day. Old Ironsides is also scheduled for a harbor tour under tow
July 23 to salute naval vessels from five nations, visiting Boston
to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the ship's first sail.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Johnson's announcement ends an intense debate between
those who wanted to protect the ship and those who wanted to
showcase the powerful Navy symbol in sails up and down the Eastern
Seaboard. Washington lawmakers received strong indications that the
Navy had decided to keep the ship close to its Boston berth a week
ago, but no official announcement was made until WGME-TV in
Portland broke the story Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican, and John Chafee, a
Rhode Island Republican and former Navy Secretary who wanted the
ship to make a stop in Newport, expressed disappointment but
supported the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has made its decision in order to protect the best
interests of the Constitution and this nation,'' said Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts officials were delighted. Senator Edward M.
Kennedy said, ``Old Ironsides has been saved once again. The Navy
is obviously right to give the very highest priority to
safeguarding the ship against any possible danger. No vessel more
clearly symbolizes the ideals, the heritage and the history of our
country than Boston's own USS Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who is in Ireland and has made a cause
celebre of keeping the ship home, said ``I'm grateful the US Navy
has exercised sound judgment on this issue. Over one million people
visit the ship annually in Charlestown, which is where she should
stay, safe and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Another satisfied customer is US Navy Cmdr. (Ret.) Robert
Gillen, a former Constitution captain who led a public relations
campaign with more than a dozen other former captains to keep the
ship clear of a potential sea cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very commendable,'' said Gillen. ``The Navy did
the right thing.''

VERNON JORDAN RETURNS TO GRAND JURY; LEWINSKY LAWYERS SEEK
IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Vernon Jordan Jr., the presidential adviser,
returned to testify before a federal grand jury on Tuesday, Monica
Lewinsky's new lawyers met again with prosecutors in the
independent counsel's office to begin discussions about a possible
immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The brief meeting was described Tuesday as ``just the
beginning'' of what could be lengthy negotiations between
prosecutors in the independent counsel's office and Ms. Lewinsky's
new lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, who are trying to head
off an indictment of their client. The negotiations have been
renewed since last week, when Ms. Lewinsky dismissed her primary
lawyer, William Ginsburg, who failed to secure a deal for immunity
from prosecution months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging early on Tuesday afternoon from the courthouse after
his fifth appearance before the grand jury, Jordan said he did not
anticipate being called again. Jordan, a close friend of President
Clinton, repeated that he had been asked by the grand jury about
what efforts he had undertaken on behalf of Ms. Lewinsky to find
her a job and a lawyer at a time when lawyers for Paula Corbin
Jones were seeking information from Ms. Lewinsky about her
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In early March, I said I helped Ms. Lewinsky get a lawyer, I
helped her get a job, I had assurances that there was no sexual
relationship and I did not tell her to lie,'' Jordan said. ``That
was the truth then, and that is the truth now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of the lawyer found by Jordan, Ms. Lewinsky
ultimately filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit in which she
denied having a sexual relationship with Clinton. But her affidavit
is contradicted by comments she made in secretly recorded
conversations with a former colleague, Linda Tripp, according to
lawyers and others who have heard the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawsuit was dismissed two months ago by a federal
judge in Arkansas. Tuesday her lawyers asked a federal appeals
panel to extend the deadline for court filings to July 22 from June
22. The lawyers said they sought the delay because the Supreme
Court will soon decide a different sexual harassment case that
could have legal implications for the Jones suit.

DEADLINES SET IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again making it clear that he does not intend
to let the Microsoft antitrust case grow out of control, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson Tuesday set a series of
deadlines and limits on government and company attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson appeared to suggest that he believes the case of U.S.
vs. Microsoft should last about three weeks. He said he has set
aside the month of September for the trial, which is scheduled to
begin Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he plans to allow each side to present no more
than 12 witnesses. The witnesses must be questioned in writing
prior to the trial, so that only cross-examination will be
conducted at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, as well as attorneys on both sides, is clearly
mindful of the government's previous antitrust cases against IBM
and AT&AMP;T. The IBM case is now considered a model for judicial
inefficiency _ it stretched on for more than a decade, consuming
untold dollars and hours, before finally being dropped by the
government. And even the AT&AMP;T case involved scores of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is quickly setting a no-nonsense tone for this
proceeding, which is shaping up to be the most closely watched
anti-trust battle of the decade and a test of the judiciary's
ability to keep pace with technology.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the attorneys general of 20 states
and the District of Columbia are accusing Microsoft of illegally
seeking to expand a monopoly on computer operating systems into the
market for World Wide Web browsers. Microsoft denies that it has
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   During a status hearing Tuesday, Jackson forbade the parties
from communicating with him except by formal motion, threatened to
appoint a special master if they get into spats over how to conduct
depositions, and refused to excuse Microsoft from filing a motion
it had tried to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to ``the high caliber of counsel we have in this
case,'' Jackson made it clear he expects the attorneys for the
company and the government to work together to make sure that each
side gets the information it needs to be ready for an on-time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The goodwill between the sides seems somewhat limited, though.
At Tuesday's hearing Microsoft suggested the government should show
restraint in gathering evidence this summer because it has already
conducted a two-year investigation of the company. That prompted
the Justice Department's special trial counsel, David Boies,
alluding to the company's phenomenal wealth, to say ``I think
Microsoft clearly has the resources to respond to some discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, appeared sympathetic to Microsoft, telling
Boies ``don't plow ground that you don't need to plow again.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides proclaimed themselves pleased with the hearing. Boies
said the government is pleased by the judge's commitment to hold an
unusually early and speedy trial, while Microsoft vice president
William Neukom said, ``We are pleased with the results of today's
hearing, and are looking forward to an opportunity to dispose of
this matter as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, Microsoft filed a motion in court urging the
judge to keep under seal certain exhibits and other documents that
were filed by the government as part of its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft documents in question detail Microsoft's
development and marketing plans for various Internet-related
technologies,'' Microsoft said in a motion. ``Unfettered disclosure
of such confidential documents to Netscape, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems and other Microsoft competitors would seriously
compromise Microsoft's important business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The government disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a strong presumption in favor of public access to
judicial proceedings,'' the Justice Department and the states wrote
in a joint brief. ``This (appeals court) circuit has stated that
`the courts are public institutions that best serve the public when
they do their business openly and in full view', and it recognizes
the importance of making court records accessible to the public,
especially when the government is a party to the lawsuit and
objects to the sealing of the records.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The procedural logjam that threatened passage of a
comprehensive tobacco bill appeared to break late Tuesday, raising
the possibility of final Senate action as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ which would boost cigarette prices $1.10 a pack,
raise $516 billion over 25 years and supersede state settlements
such as those already reached in Florida and Texas with cigarette
makers _ still faces an uncertain future in the House, which has
been waiting for Senate action before taking up the contentious
issue.

   Late Tuesday, the Senate voted 52-46 for an amendment by Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., to earmark $16 billion over the next five
years for drug-fighting efforts, including increased interdiction
efforts and new drug awareness and drug testing programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money would double the drug interdiction budget for the
Coast Guard, Customs Service, and Defense Department, and provide
$10 million a year in grants to states that instituted voluntary
drug testing for teen drivers license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Action on Coverdell's amendment came as senators appeared to be
closing in on an agreement to consider the most contentious issue
yet facing the bill _ whether and by how much to reduce the
so-called marriage tax on some couples to offset the impact of the
higher cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a proposal by Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to use a portion of the tobacco tax revenues
to reduce the ``marriage penalty,'' or the higher income taxes most
couples pay because they file joint rather than individual returns.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's original proposal would have earmarked $52 billion in
tax reductions over five years. Late Tuesday that amount appeared
to have been scaled back to $16 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had fiercely resisted Gramm's amendment as too great a
raid on their plans to use the tobacco money for anti-smoking
efforts, but a Democratic spokesman said Tuesday night ``there is
going to be a tax (reduction) amendment in this bill that is not
viewed as a killer amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Movement on the drug amendment and the marriage tax amendment
appeared to breathe new life into the measure, which Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had threatened to pull earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of the death of this legislation are premature,'' said
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the bill's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though things are not bubbling over with excitement on
the floor itself, I think there is some quiet progress being made
in meetings behind the scenes,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the
Democratic floor leader on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton also sounded optimistic
about the tobacco bill's fate, telling reporters, ``I do believe
that the possibility of getting a comprehensive bill out of the
Senate is greater now than it was this morning. There are still
problems, to be sure, but we're getting closer to, I think, a
principled compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a Democratic attempt to limit debate on the
bill and force a final vote failed 42-56 along largely party lines.
But a Democratic staffer said later that the vote to invoke cloture
may have convinced Republicans that they would not be able to evade
the tobacco issue because Democrats would seek to bring it up
regardless of what bill was pending on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's debate focused on Coverdell's amendment and a
Democratic alternative that was offered late in the day, but failed
on a 53-45 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's amendment would take about $16 billion over five
years from money generated by the tobacco bill and spend it on
drug-fighting programs. The Democratic alternative would have
authorized spending about $10 billion on anti-drug efforts, but the
money would have come from general revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's amendment also contained provisions that would allow
students victimized by drug violence to be transferred at federal
expense to another school, including a private school. Democrats
argued that such a proposal was tantamount to a federal school
voucher program, which they have repeatedly blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell called the Senate vote ``a powerful statement that the
nation has to pull itself together and have the will to confront
this'' drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Coverdell said drug abuse is ``the number one
problem. The cost to American society is as great on the drug side
as it is on the tobacco side, and in the perception of parents and
families and teenagers, it is a far greater problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats objected that Coverdell's amendment would siphon
billions of dollars a year from anti-smoking program in the tobacco
bill. They argued that attacking smoking was a significant step in
fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gateway drug to substance abuse is smoking,'' said Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The correlation is powerful, it's
compelling and it's convincing.''

PRESIDENT MEETS KOREAN LEADER, DEFENDS CHINA'S WELCOMING PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday defended his decision
to participate in an arrival ceremony in Bejing's Tiananmen Square
when he goes to China this month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that being welcomed at the Great Hall of the
People, on the edge of the site of the killings of prodemocracy
protesters in June 1989, would not undermine his ability to press
China on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the US House apparently disagreed Tuesday, voting 305-116
for a nonbinding resolution urging Clinton not to participate in
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   `My own view is that if this is going to be a state visit to
China and I am going to be the guest of the Chinese, that they
should be designing the terms of the arrival ceremony, not me,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't accept the proposition that observing their
diplomatic protocol in any way undermines my capacity to advance
the principles of the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his remarks about his state visit to China from
June 25 to July 3 at a joint news conference with South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung. Kim, a longtime political dissident who
spent seven years in prison, is on his first state visit to the
United States and was welcomed Tuesday at an eleborate White House
ceremony, complete with a 21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   During the welcoming ceremony, Clinton paid tribute to Kim's
heroic rise from political prisoner to president, comparing him to
Lech Walesa of Poland, Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, and Nelson
Mandela of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is trying to persuade the United States to loosen sanctions
on North Korea, a step the Clinton administration says should be
contingent on North Korea living up to an agreement to shun nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the news conference, said the South Korean leader
``did not ask me to lift sanctions. What he asked me to do was to
work with him to support a policy of reciprocity which would enable
us to move forward with the reconciliation of the North and the
South. And I said that I would be prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim acknowledged that ``based on our experience, it's very
difficult to say that you can trust a communist,'' but said it is
important to negotiate with North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-il
to avert economic collapse in that country and head off possible
military provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to persuade North Korea to make it feel safe in
opening up and so that it can resuscitate itself,'' Kim said. He
pointed to China and Vietnam as models of communist governments
that have opened markets for trade.
</P>
<P>
   Kim did not mention Clinton's trip to China, but Clinton said
they had discussed it during their day of meetings, although he did
not give any specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the recent economic events in Asia and the nuclear
tests on the Indian subcontinent, it should be clearer than ever
before that we have a strong national interest in developing a
constructive, positive relationship with China,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I think that what Americans should want me to do is
to make sure that I am as effective as possible not only in
advancing our interests, but in standing up for our values.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton defended his decision to approve a new
permit for Loral Space and Communications Ltd. to launch its
satellites on Chinese rockets, despite Justice Department
objections.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is examining whether Clinton was influenced by hundreds
of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions and whether Loral
gave China sensitive information about rocket guidance systems that
could improve the accuracy of China's military missiles, a charge
the company has denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't resist the advice of the Justice Department,''
Clinton said Tuesday. ``I took the advice of the National Security
Council, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, from my point of view, a pretty routine decision,'' he
said. ``I thought, on balance, if all those agencies felt that it
was the right thing to do and furthered our national interest, that
I would do so.''

ADVERTISING: HOW MERCHANTS REGISTER A MIDDLING `GODZILLA'
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With ``Godzilla'' turning out to be more of a limping
lizard than a leaping lizard at the box office, the scores of
promotional, licensing and merchandising partners that anticipated
the film would be a summer blockbuster must now hope that size
won't matter after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla,'' which opened on May 20, had been promoted
relentlessly for more than a year with a breathless teaser campaign
insisting that ``Size does matter.'' And though the movie,
distributed by the Tristar unit of Sony Pictures Entertainment, has
already sold $114-million worth of tickets to American filmgoers
through Sunday, it is widely being perceived as a disappointment
because all that sizable pre-release boasting led industry analysts
to expect spectacular results.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many size queens are already decrying how
``Godzilla'' is faring is indicative of the huge risks that
marketers take when they seek to take part in and capitalize on the
hoopla and hyperbole of Hollywood. Companies that are more familiar
with selling toys, soft drinks or T-shirts must try forecasting far
in advance which films may capture the fancy of an increasingly
fickle public and then place what amount to multimillion-dollar
bets on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Godzilla,'' declines in ticket sales in the
second and third weekends of 59 percent and 46 percent,
respectively, have made it difficult to meet the ambitious goal of
Sony executives for a $200 million American box office bonanza. But
does that necessarily mean shoppers will shy from all the
``Godzilla'' products seeking to benefit from what was supposed to
be a monstrous blast of star power?
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out,'' James Mammarella, editor of License
magazine, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers won't mark down merchandise instantaneously because
the box office drops off,'' Mammarella said in an interview from
the Jacobs K. Javits Center in midtown Manhattan, where he was
attending the opening of the Licensing '98 International trade
show, ``and kids don't read Variety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have a life of its own at retail,'' he added, ``even
if there's a cloud over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers say they benefited from the pre-opening blitz
orchestrated by Sony, cushioning them from potential subsequent
shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to tie in with the hype of the movie, which was
touted as the biggest thing out there,'' said Steve Lunceford, a
spokesman for the Sprint Corp. in Kansas City, Mo., which chose
``Godzilla'' as one of three films for a ``Summer Movie
Spectacular'' ticket giveaway for long-distance customers.
</P>
<P>
   Another promotional partner, the Taco Bell fast-food chain owned
by Tricon Global Restaurants, is reporting signs of life at its
7,000 stores after spending an estimated $60 million before the
release date to peddle ``Godzilla'' merchandise like cups and cup
holders and a ``Find Godzilla and Win'' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the results,'' said Vada Hill, chief
marketing officer at Taco Bell in Irvine, Calif. ``We have gotten
our strongest sales numbers of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason, he added, is that the company strives in
developing film tie-ins to ``create a world in our restaurants that
leverages `the sweet spot,' the intersection of the movie and the
Taco Bell brand.'' He said, ``And if the world we create is
compelling, it takes on a life of its own, disconnected from the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A humorous television commercial centered on the ``Godzilla''
promotion _ which features the Taco Bell Chihuahua crying ``Here,
lizard, lizard'' and setting out a tiny trap for the elusive
creature _ has drawn widespread praise. Mammarella even suggested
that the Taco Bell spot could serve ``as a shot in the arm for the
merchandising'' of the ``Godzilla'' licensed products in stores
like toys and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said: ``What the ad depends on is a knowledge of
`Godzilla.' It doesn't depend on you seeing `Godzilla' or seeing
`Godzilla' half a dozen times. If you have that knowledge, you will
get the joke.'' The commercial was created by the TBWA Chiat/Day
unit of Omnicom Group in Venice, Calif.; the promotion was created
by the Irvine office of Wunderman Cato Johnson, a unit of Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hershey Foods Corp., which is selling candy with
``Godzilla'' themes, ``it's probably a little too soon to receive
feedback from retailers or sales reps in the field,'' said Mike
Kinney, a spokesman in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had an excellent buy-in,'' he added, referring to the
advance sale of the candy to stores before the film was released,
``so at this point it's a very successful tie-in for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershey too was aware that movie-themed products need to stand
on their own legs if, as it appears, the legs of a giant lizard are
not strong enough for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our products are fun and visually appealing in and of
themselves,'' Kinney said, ``even if you don't have a chance to see
the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Products more directly related to ``Godzilla,'' like toy
likenesses of the beast, may prove more problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making calls to licensees and while it's a little early,
the patterns are clear that it will not be a booming success,''
said Martin Brochstein, executive editor at The Licensing Letter
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare at best when a movie does not do well and the
ancillary products did,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Godzilla'' producers and Sony executives pursued an
unconventional strategy to help generate interest in the licensed
merchandise: They insisted that nothing revealing the lizard's full
appearance be placed on sale before the movie opened. Usually, such
products flood stores before a film's premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secrecy seems to be backfiring on them,'' said George
Papaioannou, an entertainment industries analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York. ``It's a lesson learned, in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   However ``Godzilla'' ultimately performs, marketers are already
looking ahead to other summer films with a panoply of promotional
partners, including ``The X-Files,'' which has deals with companies
including the Oldsmobile division of the General Motors Corp.,
``Armageddon,'' with links to advertisers like Nestle Chocolate and
Confection, and ``Small Soldiers,'' with a line of _ yes, small
soldiers, from Hasbro Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond the summer, there will be elaborate merchandising and
licensing programs involving the home video release of ``Titanic,''
scheduled on Sept. 1, with Sprint as a participant, and the
introduction next year of the first of three ``prequels'' in the
``Star Wars'' series of films, with Taco Bell as a participant.

MARKETPLACE: PRIVATE FIRM, PUBLIC AMBITION  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the partners of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. debate
whether to turn Wall Street's premier private investment bank into
a public company, they might mull this paradox: They are earning
record profits advising clients to do deals they themselves would
never do.
</P>
<P>
   As a partnership, Goldman does not issue stock, the basic
currency of big mergers and acquisitions. So while it helped link
Daimler AG to Chrysler Corp. and brought BankAmerica together with
Nationsbank, two of the biggest deals in the global rush to
consolidate, Goldman has husbanded its partners' capital and
shunned the risky mergers game.
</P>
<P>
   All that may change, some Goldman insiders say, if the partners
back a plan to go public at the firm's annual meeting on Friday.
Going public would help Goldman buy other firms to expand at home
and abroad. It would level the playing field with its fast-growing
rivals, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Salomon Smith Barney, all of which are publicly owned.
</P>
<P>
   Some outside bankers say that public ownership might make
Goldman a target for big commercial banks, though few expect
Goldman would agree to any deal that could compromise its fiercely
independent culture.
</P>
<P>
   How aggressive Goldman becomes depends on how partners react to
the firm's strategic plan, a study of options drawn up under the
leadership of Henry Paulson Jr., Goldman's co-chief executive.
People familiar with the broad outlines say it explores ways that
Goldman, as a public company, could rapidly expand in areas in
which it considers itself small or weak.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most likely acquisition targets: a major American or
European asset management company or a Japanese brokerage house.
Goldman in the past has sought close ties with T. Rowe Price, a
Baltimore-based mutual fund manager with about $100 billion in
assets. Some Goldman bankers say the firm should also consider an
alliance with Daiwa Securities, Japan's second-largest broker after
Nomura and the only leader there that has yet to find a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman wants to add to the mutual funds and other assets its
manages so that it can rely more on recurring fees and less on
volatile trading and underwriting revenues. Nearly all major
American brokers have tried to grab a bigger share of Japan's
securities market, especially since that country's long recession
has reduced the cost and barriers to entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how to expand more quickly,'' said a Goldman
partner who will participate in Friday's debate and declined to be
identified. ``No one wants to radically remake the firm. But there
is some frustration that we are not a part of all the deal
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Any shopping spree by Goldman would add to the financial world's
consolidation frenzy, especially if the respected banking house
puts its seal of approval on the recent trend of combining
insurance, commercial banking and investment banking. It would also
be a sign that in the race to become global players, even the most
successful banks and fund managers need a public currency _ stock _
to make transactions.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, Goldman has fallen behind leading rivals. It
manages $160 billion in assets, well under Merrill Lynch's $450
billion. Goldman's elite client list is the envy of Wall Street.
But Morgan Stanley has combined its blue-chip corporate business
with a retail brokerage network selling stocks to main street
investors, earning the steady fees and high margins those accounts
bring.
</P>
<P>
   A Goldman spokesman said on Monday that even if the partners
decided to take the firm public, that did not mean Goldman would
abandon its strategy of growing internally rather than through
acquisitions. He rejected as ``rumors'' the idea that Goldman had
an informal shopping list of companies it would like to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman agreed that to have stock to make purchases was a
factor in the debate over issue shares, but added, ``I don't think
it's a primary factor.'' He added, ``It's a factor in the sense
that you don't know what the world will be like, and this gives you
more options.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has considered and rejected the idea of selling shares
as part of an expansion plan half a dozen times in recent years,
and it might decide to pass this time as well. Profits, after all,
are running at a record level, with the firm set to earn more than
$2 billion in this year's first half, compared with about $3
billion all of last year. Most of those profits come from the
firm's bread-and-butter business of trading, underwriting and
providing client advice.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Goldman could tap public capital markets instead of
relying primarily on partners' capital, it would not necessarily
follow the path blazed by other Wall Street financiers, like
Sanford Weill of the Travelers Group. Weill recently agreed to
merge his company with Citicorp, the largest financial deal in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the idea of being part of Citibank would
send shivers up and down the spine of every person at Goldman,''
said one retired partner, who asked not to be named. ``On the other
hand, the firm has to have the currency to make strategic
acquisitions. It now has its hands tied.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the firm has tended to grow internally, making only
small acquisitions. When Goldman wanted to break into the European
asset management fund business, it bought the small British pension
fund manager Cinman, a deal valued at the time at less than $100
million. When publicly traded Merrill Lynch pursued a similar
vision last year, it snapped up the leading European player,
Mercury Asset Management, paying $5.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, several American investment banks have scrambled to
expand their presence in Japan. Goldman has performed well there
but has fallen behind rivals like Merrill and Salomon in striking
alliances. Salomon earlier this month spent $1.6 billion for a 25
percent stake in Nikko Securities. To date, Goldman has followed a
more conservative strategy in Japan, finding partners to help
distribute its mutual funds but avoiding major capital commitments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A small number of current and retired Goldman executives at
least loosely entertain the idea of much bigger deals. One
possibility is a merger with a commercial bank eager for Goldman's
investment banking expertise. Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan and
BankAmerica, three of the largest American banks, would make the
most logical fits, some bankers say.
</P>
<P>
   All of those banks have stock market values so far above even
the highest values placed on a public offering by Goldman that they
could swallow the Wall Street firm with little trouble. All have
strong traditional banking businesses but lag far behind Goldman in
investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   If the firm decides to issue stock priced at $20 a share, ``then
Chase offers us $25 a share, we would at least have to consider
it,'' said one current Goldman partner. ``My own feeling is that
the way to unlock Goldman's true value is through a merger'' rather
than a public offering of stock, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But such alliances remain long shots. Even if Goldman decides to
go public, it seems unlikely to risk diluting the tightly
integrated, highly motivated culture it has nurtured over recent
decades by blending itself with a large outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Goldman is not only one of Wall Street's most
profitable creations, it is also one of its most egocentric.
Bankers there say they would never agree to be dominated by a
commercial bank, with its eight-hour days and fatter management
structure. Thus, Goldman would insist on a difficult reverse merger
in any linkup with a big commercial bank, putting its own
executives in control of a combined entity.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Goldman will probably need all its in-house mergers
and acquisitions expertise if it decides to go public. ``I wonder
if they know the kind of pressure they will be under if they
actually pull the trigger,'' said one outside banker.

DID HE LOVE HER? OH, YES! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (JT)  
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the early scenes of ``The Thorn Birds,'' when Father
Ralph de Bricassart was too young and dashing for his own good,
it's hard to believe that Richard Chamberlain was 48 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed young a remarkably long time and then fell apart,''
Chamberlain, 63, says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in ``The Thorn Birds,'' physical beauty sometimes
appears to be an annoyance anyway. Poor Father Ralph can't go
anywhere, it seems, without rich dowagers trying to seduce him or
strangers coming up to tell him how beautiful he is. Chamberlain,
who probably began having the same problems when he was the star of
NBC's ``Dr. Kildare'' (1961-66), was at the height of his reign as
king of the mini-series (it was three years after ``Shogun'') when
``The Thorn Birds'' appeared on ABC in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who now describes himself as ``a Hawaiian beach bum
who paints and occasionally acts'' (he has lived full time on the
island of Oahu, outside Honolulu, for eight years), says he hasn't
watched the mini-series _ all 10 hours of it _ in several years but
remembers it as pretty fabulous and even praises Rachel Ward's
performance. (The latter opinion was not shared by many critics at
the time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that romantic love is the most interesting topic in
the world,'' Chamberlain says by way of explaining the story's
popularity. ``And the more obstacles there are between the lovers,
the more interesting the story gets.  &UR; God &LR;  was between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Every reader of Colleen McCullough's 1977 novel knows that
Meggie Cleary truly loves Father Ralph all her life, but does he
truly love her back? Chamberlain's simple answer: yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real soul-mate relationship,'' he says. ``They were
utterly, absolutely meant for each other.'' And were it not for
Ralph's committed relationship with God, and his being a little
``dazzled by the power of the church,'' Chamberlain adds, ``they
would have been extremely happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a fictional Roman Catholic priest like the one on
ABC's series ``Nothing Sacred'' can be persecuted by conservative
groups just for being open-minded, it's strange to consider that in
1983 there was no uproar over the story of a priest's affair with a
married woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some objections, but it was nothing earthshaking,
as I recall,'' Chamberlain says. ``I think the thing that disturbed
the Church was not that he slipped once, but that he sort of kept
up the relationship.'' (On at least one subsequent visit to
Drogheda, a silver-haired Father Ralph spends the night in Meggie's
bed.) The United States Catholic Conference's only publicly stated
objection, however, was that the mini-series ran during Holy Week.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chamberlain hasn't been hiding out completely. He
appeared on Broadway most recently as Henry Higgins in a revival of
``My Fair Lady,'' in late 1993 and early 1994. There was even a
``Thorn Birds'' sequel (``The Missing Years'') in 1996, best
forgotten. But the entertainment industry has changed since 1983,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has just gotten too tough for me,'' Chamberlain
says. So mostly he paints.

ANALYSIS: HAS THE WEST LEARNED FROM MISTAKES IN BOSNIA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ind., Neb., Okla.)  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last war in the Balkans lasted four years and
took more than 200,000 lives before President Clinton and NATO
finally intervened. With the impetus of severe NATO air strikes,
the United States and its envoy, Richard Holbrooke, brought the
warring Bosnians together at Dayton, Ohio, and hammered out a
peace, enforced by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   But now another part of the Balkans is aflame, a small province
in Serbia called Kosovo, and once again world powers are
floundering in an effort to devise a coherent policy to put
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and contain the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Holbrooke have already been criticized for
conceding too much to Milosevic in order to get him to talk, for
the first time, with Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the Kosovo
Albanians, who is seeking a nonviolent road to independence.
</P>
<P>
   After Holbrooke met Milosevic last month, the United States
persuaded the Europeans to delay imposing sanctions on the Serbs.
But Milosevic used what was supposed to be a period of dialogue to
crack down on the Kosovo Liberation Army and its civilian
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Europeans and the United States belatedly
imposed some sanctions on Milosevic and talked about
``accelerating'' NATO planning for air strikes. But there is little
agreement about how to achieve a peaceful end to the fighting _
especially since the West does not support independence for Kosovo,
but ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and elsewhere are willing in
increasing numbers to fight for it.
</P>
<P>
   Independence for Kosovo is unthinkable to Milosevic and the
Serbs, given the centrality of the province to Serbian history,
religion and culture, said Warren Zimmermann, the American
ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bosnia was an adventure for Milosevic and the world
recognized its independence,'' Zimmermann said, ``it's much harder
for Milosevic to make concessions in Kosovo, which is recognized as
part of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   With the crackdown, the level of support in Kosovo for Rugova
and his nonviolent approach is slipping. ``Washington is still
hoping there can be a political process and dialogue to be had, but
the prospects are gloomy and fading,'' a senior Western diplomat
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To Carl Bildt, once the European Union's senior representative
in Bosnia, the lack of decisive action by the West is ``deja vu in
Kosovo.'' To Marshall Freeman Harris, a former State Department
official who quit over American inaction in Bosnia, ``the West is
screwing it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kosovo presents different problems, Harris said, ``it's
the similarities that count _ you have the same protagonist,
Milosevic, and the same goal, which is to drive out non-Serbs and
kill them if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just build a firewall around the problem,'' he said,
``which is what I fear the U.S. wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke argued in a recent interview that in Kosovo, unlike in
Bosnia, both the United States and NATO have become involved early,
and that Washington and the Europeans are working closely together,
showing that ``the main lessons'' of the Bosnian horrors have been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is a strategy, Holbrooke argued. The
Milosevic-Rugova dialogue is vital to a solution, he said, and the
selective use of sanctions, as carrot and stick, is vital to
getting Milosevic to talk substantively. The third tier, of
potential NATO military action and air strikes, is vital to
deterring Milosevic from violence against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke goes silent when asked if Washington now, unlike
in the early days in Bosnia, has found the balance between
diplomacy and force. ``It's too early to tell,'' he said finally.
</P>
<P>
   While the West has learned lessons since Bosnia, ``has Slobodan
Milosevic learned anything?'' asked Holbrooke, who probably knows
him better than any Westerner and whom Milosevic insists on dealing
with. ``That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Harris and Zimmermann, suggest that what Milosevic
has learned is how to manipulate the hesitation of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmermann says Kosovo poses greater dangers of regional
instability than Bosnia did. ``I feel more sympathy for the
administration's dilemma,'' he says. ``But you don't get out of it
by coddling Milosevic, and we've done too much of that over the
last two to three years. The man doesn't take well to coddling _ he
just absorbs it and then does whatever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a theme being taken up more consistently by Republicans
in Congress, beginning with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and including moderates like Sen. Dick Lugar of
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I detect a shift on the Republican side on this,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee. ``The reality is, when you start dissecting this, we're
probably going to have to put NATO troops in there. The longer we
wait, the worse it'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments from legislators normally eager to get American
troops out of Bosnia has taken the White House by surprise, and
contributed to a toughening of language.
</P>
<P>
   It was President George Bush who, in 1992, first warned
Milosevic of military action if he moved against Kosovo, a message
repeated by Clinton in 1993, but heard little since. Bush's warning
was cited Tuesday by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Kosovo on Tuesday, Clinton said the United States
favors the use of ``all necessary means to try to avoid `ethnic
cleansing' and the loss of human life,'' and said: ``The main thing
is, I am determined to do all I can to stop a repeat of the human
carnage in Bosnia and the `ethnic cleansing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is little appetite for new military commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping Serbian violence in Kosovo, however it might be
managed, could only raise the ambitions of the Kosovar guerrillas
and would do little to help Rugova, who also favors independence.
It is far from clear that the West can force a negotiated solution
of autonomy because both the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians already
think the time for serious talking is past. &QL;

NORTH KOREA REBUKES JAPAN BY CANCELING WOMEN'S VISIT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea on Tuesday called off a planned visit by
Japanese-born women to Japan, in a sign of steadily worsening
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's announcement, along with a series of denunciations
of the ``Japanese reactionaries'' and their ``despicable smear
campaign'' against the Communist government in the North,
apparently marked a suspension of a program begun last November to
allow 1,800 Japanese-born women living in North Korea to return to
their homeland for visits. Most of the women married ethnic Korean
men in Japan and moved with their husbands to North Korea in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the announcement Tuesday seemed to mark at least a
temporary setback in the process of building ties between North
Korea and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is crucial to any effort to draw North Korea into the
international economy, and the plan to allow the Japanese-born
women to visit Japan had been regarded as a major step in building
trust between the two countries. But Japanese officials said they
did not know precisely what to make of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement came all of a sudden, and we find it
regrettable,'' said Sadaaki Numata, the chief Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the visits
were called off because of ``artificial hurdles'' and ``inhuman
acts on the Japanese side.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea did not specify what these were, but the suspension
came after Japanese officials again raised the case of at least 10
Japanese who officials in Tokyo say were probably kidnapped by
North Korean agents and taken to North Korea over the years. The
Japanese public has been embittered by the reports that Japanese
were abducted and smuggled to North Korea to serve as
Japanese-language teachers or to allow their identities be taken
over by North Korean spies.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she vanished from
the Japanese coast in November 1977, has particularly moved the
Japanese public and created a major obstacle to any effort to
improve relations. A defector from North Korea has said Miss Yokota
was abducted and has been living in the North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea announced a few days ago that it had conducted an
exhaustive search for these 10 Japanese, checking birthdates and
other information, but had found no sign of them. Yet instead of
laying the issue to rest, as the North perhaps hoped, the
investigation was immediately rejected by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to obtain some clues to this problem,'' Deputy Foreign
Minister Shunji Yanai said on Monday, adding that Japan probably
would not resume talks with North Korea until there were some
progress in finding the missing people.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea responded to Yanai Tuesday with a series of blasts
and, apparently, with the suspension of the visits by the Japanese
wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese reactionaries' sustained talk about `suspected
abduction' will only betray the miserable plight of Japan and
invite public condemnation for Japan's playing into hands of the
South Korean puppets,'' the English-language service of the Korean
Central News Agency declared on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency added that ``Japan is a war criminal state which
plunged Asia into disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet earlier on Tuesday, in a sign of its willingness to improve
relations in other areas, North Korea agreed to restore a channel
of communication between its army and the United States-led forces
at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. The
resumption of military talks is not expected to lead to any
breakthroughs, but it could help resolve any crisis that erupted in
the tense border area.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had pulled out of the earlier military talks in 1991
when a South Korean general was put in charge instead of American
officers. A long stalemate developed, but this year South Korea
agreed to put an American general in charge again, in the interests
of boosting dialogue between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   No date was set for the resumption of military talks.

CLINTON REJECTS PLEAS TO AVOID TIANANMEN CEREMONY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton rejected appeals Tuesday that he
avoid an official welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square in Beijing
when he visits China this month, saying that he could not dictate
to China's leaders how he should be received in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a news conference with South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung, Clinton said that his planned appearance at Tiananmen
Square, the scene of a deadly crackdown on democratic protesters
nine years ago this month, did not signal that he was endorsing
Beijing's suppression of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the House voted, 305-116, to approve a nonbinding
resolution demanding that the president avoid the plaza on his trip
to China, which is to begin June 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view,'' Clinton said Tuesday, ``is that if this is
going to be a state visit to China and I am going to be the guest
of the Chinese that they should be designing the terms of the
arrival ceremony, not me. And I simply don't accept the proposition
that observing their diplomatic protocol in any way undermines my
capacity to advance the principles of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing another issue that has generated opposition to his
policy toward China, the president said his approval this year of
China's launching a U.S. satellite over the objections of the
Justice Department was ``a pretty routine decision'' made on the
recommendation of other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Clinton has addressed questions
from the press on the satellite deal, which is the subject of a
congressional investigation. Lawmakers are seeking to learn whether
U.S. national security was harmed by the decision and whether the
president was influenced by large campaign contributions from
Bernard Schwartz, chief executive of the satellite maker, Loral
Space and Communications Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has rejected a call from 152 members of Congress
that Clinton postpone his China trip until questions about the
satellite have been resolved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Korea, Clinton rebuffed gentle pressure from Kim to ease U.S.
economic sanctions against communist North Korea. Kim has argued
publicly and privately that the U.S. sanctions are
counterproductive, driving the fearful North Korean leadership
further into isolation and alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said reconciliation between the Koreas and an improvement in
U.S.- North Korea relations ``should be promoted in harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Kim had not directly asked him to lift the
sanctions, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``What he asked me to do was to work with him to support a
policy of reciprocity, which would enable us to move forward with
the reconciliation of the North and the South. And I said that I
would be prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said easing sanctions would require congressional approval,
but did not pledge to seek such changes. He hinted at some
``executive flexibility'' in some categories of economic punishment
of the North, but did not promise to exercise his authority. ``What
I told President Kim I would do is to work with him,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced the resumption, after seven years
of support by the Overseas Private Investment Corp. for U.S.
companies doing business in Korea, saying improved conditions for
workers warranted the lifting of restrictions on the loan
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he and Kim had discussed a bilateral
investment treaty, an ``open skies'' agreement for unrestricted
airplane service between the United States and South Korea and
South Korea's recent decision to order $1 billion worth of Boeing
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion between the two concerned South Korea's
economic crisis, both a symptom and a cause of the financial panic
gripping much of East Asia. Last year, the International Monetary
Fund arranged a $58 billion rescue package for South Korea, helping
stabilize exchange rates and slowing the downward slide of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Kim's nine-day visit here is devoted to rebuilding
investor confidence. Monday in New York he visited the New York
Stock Exchange and addressed U.S. business leaders, reassuring them
that South Korea was undertaking a sweeping reorganization of the
economy, rooting out decades of corruption and featherbedding.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's visit to the United States is his first since he became
president in February, after a lifetime in opposition to what had
for decades been a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   At an elaborate arrival ceremony at the White House on Tuesday
morning, Kim, who 17 years ago was under a death sentence from
Seoul, was met by a 21-gun salute and warm praise from Clinton. He
compared Kim to former protesters and political prisoners who rose
to the leadership like Lech Walesa of Poland, Vaclav Havel of the
Czech Republic and Nelson Mandela of South Africa. They are all
heroes who changed the world by their individual courage, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president added, ``Standing with me today is living proof,
Kim Dae-jung, a human rights pioneer, a courageous survivor and
America's partner in building a better future for the world.''

BRAZIL FEELS THE HEAT FROM ARDENT FANS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ The World Cup is starting Wednesday and
Brazil is like a pot ready to boil over, a Brazilian journalist
breathlessly told Coach Mario Zagallo Tuesday. Could he offer some
reassuring words to the people back home, something that would turn
the heat down to simmer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say the system that works the fastest is the nervous
system, but I can assure you that Brazil will overcome that,'' said
Zagallo, who, at 66, has been a coach, assistant coach or player on
all four of Brazil's World Cup champion teams. ``They can have
trust in us to overcome the anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of unsatisfying results, worrisome injury and
recent inner turmoil, Brazil sets out to defend its World Cup title
against Scotland. What remains unanswered is whether Brazil can
play to the same samba beat that its fans will display in the
80,000-seat Stade France here in the northern Paris suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   From Pele, to the roiling Brazilian news media, to the nervous
fans on the streets of Rio and Sao Paolo, everyone is concerned
that while Brazil has the best players in the world, it may not
have the best team.
</P>
<P>
   Losses to the United States and Argentina have exposed
weaknesses. A leg injury has cost Brazil the services of Romario,
the most valuable player of the 1994 World Cup. The former star
Zico has been brought in to perch on Zagallo's shoulder as an
assistant. Some believe that the players have become fatigued
touring the world in the service of their corporate sponsor, Nike.
All of Brazil hopes for the best, but fears the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the national team for 10 years and it is always
the same,'' the midfielder Leonardo said. ``But I think all of this
is good. It's the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo is currently at the center of an uproar about a fight
he supposedly got into recently with his volatile teammate,
Edmundo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' Leonardo said. ``People talk, and it gets
blown up into this big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo also sent the news media into a frenzy with a radio
interview stating that he was more fit and talented than Bebeto and
should be starting at forward alongside Ronaldo, who is considered
the world's best player. Zagallo has chosen Bebeto against a
Scottish team that surrendered only three goals during qualifying,
and he seems completely nonplussed by the turmoil that surrounds
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is under pressure just like it was in 1958 and 1962,''
he said. ``There is no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other teams in Brazil's group, Morocco and Norway, will
also play Wednesday night in Montpellier, France. The 32-team
tournament will be played at 10 sites around the country and will
conclude with the final here on July 12. The Americans open on
Sunday against Germany in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the United States won by 4-0 in a closed-door scrimmage
against a French second-division team, Gueugnon. Coach Steve
Sampson, seeking to build depth in case one of his players gets the
red card under a new rule prohibiting tackling from behind, played
a number of his players out of position and received goals from
Brian McBride, Cobi Jones, Brian Maisonneuve and Ernie Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans hope to advance to the second round. For Brazil,
there is only one acceptable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must win,'' Leonardo said. ``Second place is not enough.'' &QL;

DAUGHTER OF NIGERIAN ELECTION WINNER LEADS A PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a student at Harvard, Hafsat Abiola worked and
prayed for the day when General Sani Abacha, the dictator who
controlled Nigeria, would leave power. Only then, Abiola concluded,
would her father and other political prisoners be freed.
</P>
<P>
   With Abacha dead of an apparent heart attack, only to be
replaced by another army general, Abiola, 23, did not know whether
to feel hopeful or glum Tuesday. It was too early to tell whether
the day-old regime of General Abdusalam Abubakar would be a
transition to democracy or simply the continuation of the Abacha
era's brutal corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Tuesday, Abiola joined two dozen other protesters
outside the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, calling for the
military to turn over power to the legitimate, elected president.
That man is Abiola's father _ Moshood K.O. Abiola, imprisoned after
winning the 1993 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters did not believe that Nigeria will honor its
promise to restore a civilian government to power in October. They
said Abiola should start serving his four-year term immediately _
all except Hafsat and her young-er sister, Khafila, 19. The sisters
are focusing first on the release of all Nigerian political
prisoners, including hundreds of labor leaders, environmentalists,
journalists, students, and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nigerian military is weakened, but they want to go about
business as usual,'' Hafsat Abiola said over the din of the crowd.
``We have to seize this opportunity. We have to resist, to free the
political prisoners, to demand a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Abiola managed to graduate from Harvard last year with honors
despite tragedies in her home country. For most of the time she was
studying in Cambridge, her father was in solitary confinement in
the capital, Abuja, unable to receive medicine for his high blood
pressure, unable to see his family or his lawyers. And two years
ago this month, Hafsat's mother was shot dead in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged with the crime, and the Abacha regime
has refused to investigate. The Abiolas are from the southern
Yuroba people, and they hold little sway with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating, Abiola has cared for her sister and three
younger brothers. She also has become an unofficial spokeswoman for
the exile community, speaking at forums of Amnesty International
and to college audiences. In February, after Abiola made a moving
speech, the New York City Council named the intersection of Second
Avenue and 43d Street in Manhattan Kudirat Abiola Corner, after her
mother. That way, the employees of the nearby Nigerian Consulate
are reminded of the killing every day they go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hafsat is an incredible lady,'' said Dapo Olorunyomi, a former
political prisoner who attended the embassy protest Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to sources in Abuja, Abiola recently learned that her
father had been transferred to solitary confinement in Aso Rock,
the presidential compound. The Abiola children think their father,
a millionaire publisher and entrepreneur, was being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   General Abacha, 54, died before dawn Monday. Soon after, the
Abiolas heard that their father had been whisked away from the
presidential compound by armed guards. Tuesday, despite repeated
calls to Abuja, they were unable to learn his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have already lost my mom,'' Abiola said. ``The idea that I
might lose my dad as well is frightening.''

 &HT;    Death row inmate to receive new sentencing trial
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A condemned man on Georgia's death row for 24 years
deserves a new sentencing trial because his lawyer called no
witnesses and offered no evidence to spare his client from the
electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling issued Tuesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said if a jury could hear all the evidence on behalf of
Wilburn Wiley Dobbs, ``a reasonable probability exists'' that he
would not have been sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling was written by Judge Joseph Hatchett, a
President Carter appointee, and joined by two Republican
appointees, Judges Gerald Tjoflat and Stanley Birch.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, now 49, was sentenced to death in May 1974 for the
shotgun killing of Roy Sizemore, a 67-year-old Chickamauga, Ga.
grocer, during an armed robbery. Dobbs also fired and missed a
milkman who entered the store during the holdup and fractured the
skull of a 62-year-old woman with the butt of his shotgun as he
fled the store. According to Justice Department records, there are
fewer than 10 others in the country who have been on death row
longer than Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dobbs case has been denounced by human rights groups that
have accused his lawyer, Donald Bennett of Chattanooga, Tenn., of
being so racially biased he did not effectively represent Dobbs,
who is black. Bennett has also admitted in court testimony to using
racial slurs and believing that blacks ``in general are inferior to
whites morally and intellectually.''
</P>
<P>
   But the federal appeals court, one step below the U.S. Supreme
Court, did not address any racial allegations. Instead, it
summarily criticized Bennett's performance. While Bennett produced
no mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial,
witnesses could have testified that Dobbs's mother ``would often
not allow him to stay in the same house with her, and when she
(did), she ran a brothel where she exposed him to sexual
promiscuity, alcohol and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   While the aggravating factors in the case are ``deplorable,''
Hatchett wrote, they ``do not rise to such a level as to overshadow
the significant mitigating evidence that Dobbs's jury had no
occasion to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wiley is very relieved and extremely grateful,'' one of his
lawyers, Michael McIntyre, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs's appeal, which had been rejected by numerous courts,
appeared futile until McIntyre found the stenotype tapes, long
thought to be lost, of Bennett's closing argument in the death
penalty phase of the case. When the U.S. Supreme Court learned in
1993 of their existence, it ordered that the tapes be reviewed.
These tapes produced a transcript that showed Bennett did not even
ask the jury for mercy or to spare his client's life.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett not only failed to produce any mitigating evidence, he
read extensively from a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court opinion that
invalidated the death penalty. Bennett said that while the high
court had reinstated the penalty, it was likely to overturn it
again, leading jurors ``to believe that a death sentence would not
result in Dobbs's execution,'' Hatchett's ruling said.

 &HT;    More plants at risk for shutdown
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Another General Motors Corp. truck assembly plant
plant fell idle Tuesday from the United Auto Workers strike in
Flint, Mich., raising fears of not if, but when more plants will
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike will shut down the whole company, no doubt about
it,'' said Jim Harbour of Harbour and Associates in Troy, Mich.,
publisher of an annual report on the automotive manufacturing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 18 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and
Mexico could be crippled for lack of parts within days or weeks _ a
repeat of the paralysis caused by a 1996 strike at two GM brake
plants in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   A truck assembly plant in Flint ceased operations Tuesday. It
joins the Moraine, Ohio truck assembly plant and five other
assembly or parts plants in Auburn Hills, Buick City and Orion
Twp., Mich., and Oshawa, Ontario, that have shut down since workers
at GM's Flint Metal Center walked off the job last week. The Flint
Metal Center produces fenders, hoods, doors and other stamped sheet
metal parts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than 16,000 North American GM workers were
idle as the strike entered its sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Flint strike is settled, it will take at least two or
three days before the Moraine plant will see any new parts and can
resume production of GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Blazer and Oldsmobile
Bravada sport utility vehicles, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers and officials at GM's local Delphi Chassis
Systems plants said their jobs could be next, as the strike's
effect ripples through the world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a truck plant is not making trucks, they're not going to
need our suspension components,'' said Keith Bailey, vice president
of the International Union of Electronics Workers Local 755, which
represents about 2,600 salaried employees at the Delphi Kettering
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the Kettering plant could be shut as early as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike lingers, businesses beyond GM also would feel the
sting. Mayo Industries in Dayton, for example, would be forced to
layoff at least four of its 35 employees should the GM brake plant
close, said Jim Reidenbach, operations manager. Mayo supplies
returnable plastic trays for the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to workers' anxiety is the uncertainty whether the state
will award unemployment benefits to idled local GM workers. A
spokesman for the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services said officials
are still mulling the decision.
</P>
<P>
   For GM and its workers, bad news is building like storm clouds.
GM faces a second threatened walkout Thursday at its Delphi
Automotive Systems' East parts factory in Flint. The plant and an
adjoining Delco facility employ about 5,800 members of UAW Local
651. The plant makes speedometers, tachometers and other instrument
panel parts for nearly all of GM's cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that (strike) happens, nobody will be working in any GM
plant,'' predicted one local union official, who declined to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Union walkouts cost GM $1.2 billion after tax in 1996 _ most of
that as a result from a 17-day strike at GM's Dayton brake plants _
and $330 million last year. The automaker has had a more troubled
relationship with the UAW than rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., in part because GM is cutting its U.S. hourly work force of
about 225,000 by 5 percent annually. Ford and Chrysler have added
workers or maintained employment levels.
</P>
<P>
   Economic observers speculated that GM could take advantage of
the labor woes to hasten the closure or sale of some of its
troubled plants, including two Delphi brake plant operations in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really on the border line with some of our GM plants and
their alleged lack of profitability,'' said professor Robert
Premus, chairman of the economics department at Wright State
University. ``The longer the strike carries out, GM may feel
pressure to close their more marginal plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Premus cited two Delphi brake plants. Combined, the plants have
lost more than $40 million in the past two years and projections
show they could lose as much as $262 million in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that the company welcomes labor strife,'' Premus
added. ``But I think they'll take advantage of it and hasten some
of the structural changes they're trying to bring about ...
including outsourcing and moving operations overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Flint's metal center is a poster child of inefficiency,
according to the 1997 Harbour Report, an annual automotive
manufacturing study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the center's 101 ``pieces per worker'' ranked the plant
33rd of 38 plants in North America, compared with 437 pieces per
worker at Toyota Motor Corp.'s Georgetown, Ky., complex and 754
pieces per hour at Honda Motor Company's East Liberty plant.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,400 workers are employed at GM's Flint center. The
strike is the seventh at a GM plant in the United States since
early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Flint union leaders said GM reneged on some of the $300 million
investment planned for the their plant. They also object to what
they say are GM's plans to cut 191 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   GM maintains the union has not cooperated with changes to make
the plant more competitive. The company insists it has made a
significant portion of the planned investment, though officials
will not say how much.

 &HT;    Vets demand truth on nerve gas report
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The largest Vietnam veterans' group in the nation is
calling for a congressional investigation into whether the U.S.
military used poison gas to kill American deserters during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered the Pentagon on
Monday to investigate allegations in a CNN/Time magazine news story
that U.S. special forces used sarin nerve gas during a 1970 raid
into Laos to kill American deserters. A Pentagon report is due
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   But the 53,000-member Vietnam Veterans of America wants an
independent probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got the people involved investigating themselves,'' said
Joe Sternburg, acting executive director of the group.
</P>
<P>
   No member of Congress has requested an investigation, but Rep.
David Skaggs (D-Colo.), a member of the House intelligence
committee who was a Marine in Vietnam, said he asked the committee
staff to see what the CIA knew.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sternburg said, any such raid would have been
conducted by a special operating group (SOG), which often didn't
work within regular military structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to find SOG was outside the lines,'' Sternburg
said Tuesday. ``Investigating traditional military sources will not
get the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shared by journalist Seymour Hersh, who won
the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for breaking the story of the My Lai
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to see documents,'' Hersh said. ``That's like
seeing documents saying John F. Kennedy authorized the
assassination of Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon says it has found no information to
substantiate the allegations, Defense Department officials insist
they will conduct a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a vested interest in finding out what the truth is,''
Pentagon spokesman Bill Darley said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird said Monday that the U.S.
military shipped a ``small amount'' of sarin to Vietnam in 1967 but
never used it. Laird also expressed skepticism about the
allegations. ``I have no recollection of any operation like that,''
Laird told The Associated Press. ``It doesn't seem logical to me.
And I never approved it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to CNN and Time, the 1970 raid into Laos was called
Operation Tailwind.
</P>
<P>
   Darley confirmed that a Sept. 11, 1970, raid into Laos was
dubbed Operation Tailwind. But the Pentagon spokesman said the
three-day operation by 16 U.S. Army special forces soldiers,
commonly known as Green Berets, and 110 Montagnard troops was
carried out as a ``diversionary attack,'' not to hunt down American
deserters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to create chaos and confusion and relieve pressure off
an ongoing CIA operation,'' Darley said.
</P>
<P>
   Darley said he did not know the nature of that CIA operation.
Central Intelligence Agency spokeswoman Anya Guilsher declined to
comment, referring all questions to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Olchovik, a former 30-year Green Beret who directed
long-term reconnaissance operations into North Vietnam, said
Tuesday he was not aware of any attempts to kill American deserters
nor did he know about any use of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Olchovik said, special operating groups worked under
tightly compartmentalized conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said he knew that American military officials were
concerned about deserters but he never heard about any organized
assassination missions. He said he did find out, though, about an
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I interviewed somebody two years ago who was an assassin,''
Hersh said. ``There was some kid who they thought was sabotaging
helicopters, so he took him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans say they doubt that deserters were targeted for
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been no reason to kill most deserters, said
Phil Budahn of the American Legion. ``By and large a defector is
not a threat. A defector is a private. A defector is a corporal. He
does not know anything of military importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, said Steve Bramham, a national board member for
Vietnam Veterans of America, no deserters should have been killed.
``Personally, not speaking for the VVA, I believe that even if they
were defectors, they should have been brought to trial,'' he said.

 &HT;    Auction of suspected bomber's items fetches sizeable crowd, sum
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURPHY, N.C. _Notoriety does have some advantages for Eric
Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina man accused of the fatal bombing
of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Items he left behind brought top dollar at an auction Tuesday
that attracted a sizeable crowd and several professional
collectors, and much of the money would go to Rudolph if he chose
to show up and claim it.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of storage unit 91, mostly assorted household junk
and handtools abandoned in January when Rudolph fled arrest, were
auctioned to cover unpaid rent.
</P>
<P>
   A mini-storage auction normally attracts only a handful of
buyers and brings a few hundred dollars, said Cal Stiles, owner of
Cal's Mini Storage. But Rudolph's stuff drew almost 100 people,
with 80 items selling for $2,639, mostly to collectors and dealers
of memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Last seen in Murphy the day after the Jan. 29 Birmingham
bombing, Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. A $1 million
reward awaits anyone who provides information that leads to his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to figure that in 20 years we'll be reading about him
in the history books,'' said Mark Rowan, a Marietta collectibles
dealer who purchased a number of items, including a a metal foot
locker for $100. ``I wouldn't have given you $10 for it without it
being connected with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several items, most notably a desk lamp and a metal locker, were
still covered with black fingerprint powder.
</P>
<P>
   The items that attracted the most aggressive bidding and highest
prices were four search warrants, two originals and two facsimiles
sent to owner Stiles demanding that federal agents be allowed to
look through Rudolph's storage locker. The warrants were executed
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   One original warrant brought $370, while the other sold for
$260. The fax copies went for $250 and $225.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an auctioneer myself and I plan to auction it,'' said Jan
Weeks who bid the $370 for one of the warrants. ``It's a gamble,
but I think I can make money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms had already confiscated a number of items from the locker,
auctioneer Bob Grove told the crowd. Earlier reports said
authorities had found evidence in the locker of dynamite and nails
of the same type used in the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have questioned merchants in western North
Carolina about whether Rudolph had bought wiring like that used in
the Birmingham bomb and in bombs used in three bombings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a box of wires... no comment,'' joked Grove, as he held
up a cardboard box filled with wires and household electrical
switches.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders paid as much as $30 each for several bags containing
hundreds of re-load cartridges of various calibers for both rifles
and pistols. Such cartridges are commonly used by veteran hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rudolph's notoriety focused the spotlight on the auction,
Stiles said such public sales are routine. ``If an account is
delinquent,'' he said, ``we auction the contents to clear the
unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, Stiles explained, he is entitled to $235 of
unpaid rent on the 10-foot by 10-foot unit, plus the auction
expenses. The remaining amount will be handed over to the Cherokee
County Clerk of Court to be held in an escrow account for Rudolph
in case he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph is also wanted for questioning for possible involvement
in a string of nail-bomb attacks that terrorized Atlanta in 1996
and 1997, including the fatal bombing at Centennial Olympic Park
during the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most intensive manhunts ever in the South, scores
of agents have combed the mountainous area around Murphy over the
past four months. About 75 agents are continuing to work in the
area, doggedly seeking any clues of Rudolph's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that when he is arrested, (the items) will skyrocket
in value,'' said Grove. ``A lot of these dealers are hoping to make
a big profit.''

 &HT;    Georgia man gets new libel trial
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An Austell, Ga. man Time magazine misidentified as an
alleged international terrorist has won the opportunity to present
his libel case against the magazine again.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schafer, 44, lost his federal case in an April 1996 jury
trial against Time, but on Tuesday the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that Schafer deserved a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the court upheld what we thought was right,'' Schafer
said after learning about the decision. ``Just how wrong the
magazine was in publishing that story is going to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   In its April 27, 1992, cover story on the 1988 bombing of Pan
American Flight 103, Time reported that Iranian terrorists had
downed the plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, because it was carrying
a U.S. anti-terrorist team. The crash killed all 259 aboard and 11
people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the article was a photograph of a man identified as
David Lovejoy, a reported double agent for the United States and
Iran who allegedly told terrorists which plane to destroy. But
Schafer was the man in the picture, and he sued the magazine for
libel.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating a few hours, an eight-person jury found that
Time should pay no damages to Schafer, a commercial floor cleaner
and former international news cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Tuesday, the federal appeals court said that U.S.
District Judge Willis Hunt correctly instructed the jury on the law
governing libel cases. But the the applicable law is ``confusing,''
said the opinion, written by Judge Stanley Birch.
</P>
<P>
   When instructing jurors, Hunt said that to prove libel, Schafer
had to show that Time acted negligently and deliberately tried to
injure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything that comes from the pen of a writer who harbors
a deep and personal hostility toward the subject need be of a type
calculated to injure,'' Birch wrote in a unanimous opinion for a
three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Webb, Schafer's attorney, expressed satisfaction with the
ruling, saying that if the court had not reconciled the conflict
between having to prove both negligence and deliberate
maliciousness, ``there would be no more libel cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb said Schafer will return to court against Time unless the
magazine offers an acceptable settlement. ``We're not in this thing
for fun,'' he said. ``We're on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Canfield, Time's attorney, said the magazine will ask the
full court to reconsider the decision.

A MARINE-THEMED WORLD'S FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 14.)  
 (JT)  
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ Ever since Britain and France began holding
universal exhibitions in the late 19th century to boast of their
power and prowess, world's fairs have had a political agenda. So
Portugal can be forgiven for looking beyond education and
entertainment in organizing its first international fair, Expo '98,
which opened in Lisbon on May 22 and runs through Sept. 30. Quite
simply, it wants the world to take note that Portugal, a tiny
backward dictatorship 25 years ago, is now a modern, self-confident
democracy. And it wants to remind us that this country, too, has a
glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it needed an excuse. For that, its Spanish neighbors
conveniently pointed the way. Six years ago, Spain organized its
own coming-out party, Expo '92 in Seville, around the quincentenary
of Columbus's first trip to the New World, and chose ``The Age of
Discoveries'' as its theme. Portugal has used this year's 500th
anniversary of Vasco da Gama's opening of the sea route from Europe
to India to justify its show. And echoing its own 15th-, 16th- and
17th-century history as a great seafaring nation, its Expo theme is
``The Oceans: A Heritage for the Future.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the oceans, past, present and future, is recounted
in six thematic pavilions, while 146 participating nations
(including landlocked countries like Switzerland and Bolivia) have
created pavilions that also deal with water, rivers, seas and
oceans. Their messages are many: with oceans covering 70 percent of
the world's surface, Planet Earth should really be called Planet
Water; the oceans that gave birth to life are now being polluted to
death; the oceans, the first highway of communication between
distant civilizations, remain the last unexplored frontier; and,
yes, if Portugal's empire once stretched from Brazil to Angola and
Mozambique as far as Goa, Macao and East Timor, it was thanks to
its intrepid navigators.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $2 billion spent on the show would be a stiff price
to pay were Expo '98 no more than public relations. But, for all
their new national pride, the Portuguese remain a pragmatic lot.
Thus, Expo '98 has become the occasion for restoring historic
buildings and improving Lisbon's thoroughfares and public
transportation. Further, by situating the fair on a former
industrial wasteland, the government has set in motion a vast
program of urban renewal that includes construction of the stunning
10-mile-long Vasco da Gama Bridge across the Tagus River and of a
new Oriente railroad station designed by the Spanish architect
Santiago Calatrava.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has also learned the lessons of Seville: Expo '92
involved construction of scores of buildings _ most of which now
stand empty. So, rather than inviting participating countries to
compete with fancy designs, Portugal has provided temporary
quarters for each national pavilion. As a result, this fair is less
visually spectacular and covers only 150 acres, compared with
Seville's 540-acre site. But since most permanent buildings have
been assigned a post-Expo function, the area is unlikely to slide
back into decay, not least because the Pavilion of Portugal will
become the seat of the Portuguese government.
</P>
<P>
   The fair's projected 10 million visitors may well find all this
irrelevant, yet it goes some way toward answering the question of
why anyone still bothers to hold a world's fair. It may have made
sense to bring the world to a single city before air travel,
television and the Internet placed the world within easy reach. But
a world's fair is probably only justified today if it leaves a
significant legacy for the city where it is held.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least for the visitor, the effort is justified by the
great variety of experiences on offer. In this case, the theme
itself could not be more universal. And where else is it possible
to travel from country to country as simply as wandering around a
small town? The site and the pavilions open at 10 a.m. daily, with
all but one of the pavilions closing at 8 p.m. (the Pavilion of
Virtual Reality stays open until midnight). After that, there is a
rich program of music, dance, theater and other entertainment,
climaxing nightly at 11:45 p.m. with ``Acqua Matrix,'' a light,
sound and fireworks extravaganza at the Olivais Dock. And to keep
visitors going until the site closes at 3 a.m., there are a host of
restaurants, fast-food outlets and stand-up snack bars.
</P>
<P>
   But where to start? The length of the lines is one variable. The
length of the planned visit is another, because one day will not
suffice to ``do'' all of Expo '98. On the other hand, while it is
not necessary to see everything, there are some ``musts.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular building is already the $70 million Ocean
Pavilion, which is in fact a new kind of aquarium called an
Oceanarium. Designed by the American architect Peter Chermayeff,
who has built five other aquariums around the world, it is inspired
by the idea that the world's oceans constitute a single body of
water. Its principal feature is a large central swimming tank that
contains fish from all oceans and rocks, corals and flora from
different marine environments. Large windows on two floors give
visitors the impression they are scuba-diving. Then, on each corner
of the building, which is itself surrounded by the water of the
Olivais Dock, the sea life of the Antarctic, the Atlantic, the
California Pacific and the Indian Ocean have their own sections.
The Oceanarium will continue to operate after Expo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pavilion of Portugal, designed by the renowned local
architect Alvaro de Siza Vieira, the aim is to recall Portugal's
own seafaring past. This is done through a multiscreen re-enactment
of the arrival of Portuguese navigators in Japan in 1543 in which
special effects bring alive ancient Japanese screen paintings
recording the event. For Expo '98, the Portuguese government also
financed excavation of a 17th-century Portuguese ship that sank at
the entrance to the Tagus River as it returned from the East.
Spices, pottery and bronze recovered from the ship are on display
beside a large video screen presenting a computer simulation of
their discovery.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most distinctive building on the site is the bulbous
Utopia Pavilion, which is in fact an indoor stadium with a capacity
for 15,000 destined to become Lisbon's first multipurpose arena.
For the moment, it is being used six times a day to present a
24-minute multimedia theater show recreating the dreams and myths
inspired by the oceans. In contrast, the Knowledge of the Seas
Pavilion and the Pavilion of the Future aspire to be more
educational: the first covers the history of ocean travel and
exploration, culminating with what appears to be a 130-foot boat
under construction; the other focuses more on the threat to the
world's oceans posed by pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But word is already out that the Pavilion of Virtual Reality
promises the most fun. Indeed, in the hope of discouraging
inevitable crowds, it is the only pavilion for which an extra
ticket is required. In groups of 40, visitors climb aboard a marine
shuttle (on a mobile platform) to visit underwater ruins, a trip
they experience through a virtual reality movie. The shuttle then
suffers an accident, and visitors must take refuge in a deep-sea
research center, with fish swimming by the portholes. After two
more adventures, a special elevator, with video screens on floor
and ceiling, finally takes the travelers back to safety.
</P>
<P>
   If this high-tech pavilion's problem is not to be overrun by
crowds, the challenge for the national pavilions is to draw as many
people as possible. And it is here that the crucial variables of
money and imagination come into play. In the main, poor countries
have fairly modest pavilions, offering films and posters promoting
investment and tourism along with stands selling local handicraft.
A few have tried harder: Peru is displaying breathtaking
pre-Hispanic gold objects belonging to the so-called Lord of Sipan
and excavated barely a decade ago, while Lebanon has built a small
wooden copy of a Phoenician sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparent, though, that most tourists prefer an experience
to information, which is why several pavilions have come up with
clever gimmicks to insure they are noticed. Sweden, for instance,
invites visitors to walk through four egg-shaped forms _ created by
artists and scientists with humor and poetic license _ to
experience Stockholm's climate at different times of the year, from
rainy spring through scorching summer and chilly fall to frozen
winter. Finland's pavilion has placed an ice rink beside a huge
model of the prow of an ice-breaking ship. On the bridge, tourists
can try their hand at steering an ice-breaker, thanks to a
simulator similar to one used for training.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has taken up the theme of marine exploration by creating
an imaginary research station 300 feet below the waves, reachable
by an elevator equipped with video screens that serve as
``windows'' into the imaginary deep. Visitors then walk through
various control rooms, packed with interactive screens, ships
models and state-of-the-art marine machinery, finally climbing
aboard a so-called Expo-jet for a space ride through time from
Lisbon's Expo '98 to the next world's fair, Expo 2000, to be held
in the German city of Hanover. In contrast, Argentina takes people
back through time, with a sound-and-light walk among remnants and
models of dinosaurs found in northwest Argentina. More topically,
six times a day, this pavilion also offers a 12-minute exhibition
of live tango dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Most countries keep close to the oceans theme, and few have more
experience taming the seas than the Netherlands. In its pavilion,
visitors walk up a ramp, which resembles a large dike and, through
a film and myriad models, are then taken on a tour of the country's
land reclamation projects, busy ports and new generation of
windmills. Italy has offered a collection of model vessels, from
14th-century Venetian rowing boats to the cruise ships and oil rigs
of today. Even more stunning is Greece's 25-foot-long model of the
Athena, a 130-foot-long warship dating from 650 B.C. that had no
fewer than 174 oarsmen on board.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. pavilion, one of the largest at Expo '98, does a fair
job of mixing education and entertainment. Its basic message,
though, is promotional: that the United States is at the vanguard
of marine science and technology. For children, there is a chance
to handle sea slugs used in neurological research, to touch an
iceberg and to follow a whale-tagging exercise through a satellite
connection to the north Atlantic. For adults, there is a copy of
the United States Navy's Deep Sea Rover, a small submarine that
explores the seabed. For everyone, there is a remarkable
eight-minute film of deep-sea life filmed by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. Near the pavilion, the United States is
also sponsoring a sculpture, ``The Luso-American Wave,'' which will
carry the names of prominent Portuguese who migrated to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, part of the fun _ and exhaustion _ of a world's fair
is not knowing quite where you are. Certainly I was unsure of what
I was looking for much of the time. But this does make for
surprises. Monaco? The principality is hardly a world naval power
(despite a marina crammed with luxury yachts), yet it has one of
Europe's oldest aquariums, while its well-designed pavilion reminds
us of its role in protecting the Mediterranean. Israel likes to
claim it has four coastlines _ on the Mediterranean, the Dead Sea,
the Sea of Galilee and the Red Sea. Its pavilion combines a display
of copies of ancient maps and a model of a boat from the time of
Jesus found at the Sea of Galilee with a photo exhibition marking
Israel's 50th anniversary. Poland decided to exhibit and promote
amber in its pavilion. Switzerland's water theme is built around
the four great rivers that have their source in the Swiss Alps.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the energy expected of visitors that
countries invariably calculate a minimum time for visiting their
pavilions. Some, like Germany, which estimates a 40-minute visit,
evidently do not expect people to see all of the fair in a day.
Those that organize groups of tourists to pass through a series of
films or exhibits also make escape more difficult if the show grows
tiresome. Spain, for example, offers four movies about the oceans
and their problems lasting a total of 20 minutes, with the
pavilion's most interesting section _ a minimuseum of 16th- and
17th-century tapestries and paintings _ only accessible after the
films. With a good many pavilions, though, it is possible to take a
peek and, if nothing entices, to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: no two days are alike at Expo '98. Every
country has its national day when it is expected to do something
special (the American national day here is June 14). Fifteen
open-air stages offer a variety of music every evening, from
Portuguese fado songs to jazz. Visitors also have a chance to
dance. A more unusual form of entertainment is provided by
allegorical carts, representing sea monsters called olharapos,
which put on shows across the site. One of the high points will be
the visit of some 120 tall ships, which will put into Lisbon
between July 31 and Aug. 3 as part of the Cutty Sark Tall Ships'
Race.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the end, perhaps that is Expo's principal appeal: that
no matter how much you plan, no matter how carefully you study your
map and guidebook, there is always an unexpected event and a
surprise discovery. And remember, in the world of Expo, there are
people from myriad countries and cultures who speak English and are
eager to make friends. So it is possible to measure Expo '98 by the
number of pavilions visited. But it is also possible to gauge
pleasure by the number of addresses exchanged with people from
distant lands. In that sense, a world's fair can also be a true
world's crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   NAVIGATING A WORLD'S FAIR
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   The Expo '98 site, along the Tagus River close to the airport,
can be reached from downtown Lisbon by car, taxi, bus, subway,
train and even boat. A parking area is linked by shuttle bus to the
North Entrance. Taxis, buses, subways and trains all arrive at the
new Oriente railroad station, with direct access to the site
through the Sun Entrance. A river taxi, which leaves from the
Terreiro do Paco in Lisbon, drops visitors at the Tagus Entrance
(with an Expo ticket the ride is free).
</P>
<P>
   The Basics
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for one day and night (10 a.m. to 3 a.m.) cost $30; half
price for seniors and children (children under 5 enter free).
Evening tickets (8 p.m. to 3 a.m.) cost $12. Tickets for three days
cost $74; half price for seniors and children. Tickets for the
Pavilion of Virtual Reality cost $4.85; $3 for seniors and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Information: (351-1) 891-9898. For tickets, it is best to
contact your travel agent or purchase them upon arrival. Web site:
www.expo98.pt.
</P>
<P>
   Sea breezes should take some of the sting out of the summer
heat, and most of the pavilions are air-conditioned. But it is wise
to be armed with hat or parasol _ as well as comfortable shoes _
because walking in the sun is unavoidable and there is little shade
at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of minibuses linking the main entrances will carry
passengers free from one end of the site to the other.
</P>
<P>
   A cable car ($3) offers a panoramic view of the fair as well as
the river and the new Vasco da Gama Bridge. A similar view is
possible from the Vasco da Gama Tower (admission: $3) near the
North Entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of eating choices includes 50 kiosks selling
baguette sandwiches, crepes, pizzas and the like, as well as seven
fast-foot outlets a la McDonalds. Five self-service restaurants
also offer traditional Portuguese dishes at modest prices ($10 to
$15 a person for a main dish, desert and soda). Some pavilions also
have stands selling local delicacies (the French pavilion has an
oyster bar, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Quality restaurants are also available. The Vasco da Gama Tower
has a good one 250 feet above the ground, while the menu at the
restaurant in Portugal's Pavilion is well described by its name, A
Viagem dos Sabores (A Journey of Tastes), aimed at introducing
visitors to Portuguese gastronomy. Unsurprisingly, the local
cuisine leans heavily on fish and seafood, with sea bass and crabs
particularly popular, although there is nothing more Portuguese
than a dish involving dried cod, or bacalhau. Lunch or dinner for
two, including wine (and definitely try Portuguese wine), runs to
about $80 at these establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Among a score of other sit-down restaurants, the Brazilian-run
Chimarrao, overlooking the Olivais Dock, has a wonderful salad bar,
while waiters circulate with a variety of meats and sausages, which
are cut at each table; $40 for two with wine or beer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the world's fair also offers a tour of the world's food,
with the United States, Germany, the Philippines, Venezuela,
Mexico, Turkey, Uruguay, Finland and Spain all operating
restaurants outside their pavilions. Prices vary between $40 and
$80 for two with wine.

ROUSSEAU BEGINS SECOND SEASON WITH SPARKS
</HEADLINE>

By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are plans and then there are Master plans. Julie Rousseau
is riding the wave of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual coach of the Los Angeles Sparks owes her lofty job
to a Higher Source. In hindsight, she can track the sequence of
events that prepared her for this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I an overnight success? No,'' Rousseau answered her own
question emphatically. ``For nine years I've worked on perfecting
my craft. It's not perfect, no where near perfect. I'm constantly
learning, but that's the whole beauty of the game is that you're
constantly learning. I had no idea that the Lord was actually
preparing me for this role.''
</P>
<P>
   At 33, she is the youngest coach in the WNBA. Rousseau was
promoted from assistant to interim head coach to replace Linda
Sharp after the Sparks begin the inaugural WNBA season 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   The change was swift and abrupt and the results were immediate.
The Sparks finished the rest of the season 10-7, one victory shy of
the Western Conference title and a playoff berth. But that was just
one of the effects that surfaced. Clearly, the most apparent change
came in the players attitude. They stopped making excuses for their
obvious lack of intensity to being invigorated by Rousseau's aura.
</P>
<P>
   Management was pleased and offered the Los Angeles native a
three-year contract. By all accounts it was a good move by the
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was really tough,'' guard Tamecka Dixon said.
``Julie did a great job of coming in and instilling confidence that
was lost. She pumped us up every time, even when we did something
wrong she was there pumping up the good thing that we did, maybe
the play before or whatever. I think that really, really helped us.
The level of respect that the players have for her; she's a
motivator, and people want to play for her. They want to go out and
make the big play so that they can look on the sideline and see her
smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Her motivational skills are highly regarded, guard Penny Toler
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing at this level is what coach can motivate
their players the most,'' said Toler, an All-American from Long
Beach State. ``You can be talented, but still if you don't have the
motivation from the bench, the confidence; when you look over to
the side and you have the confidence in your coach it makes a
difference. I know me, as a player, I feel confident with Julie.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until a couple of years ago there were no women pro leagues
in the United States (now there are two), so Rousseau never
visualized herself in this position. But through the Say No
Classic, the brainchild of Sparks general manager Rhonda Windham,
and other summer league tournaments, Rousseau had the opportunity
to coach both college and pro athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been quote unquote kind of grooming her,''
said Windham, who has known Rousseau since 1989. ``Anytime I had
any type of pro, all-star or any type of game, I always had Julie
coach a team for me. Because she's good, she's knowledgeable, the
players respected her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a hard worker. She would do everything in her power
to prepare herself which would in turn prepare the players. She's
committed to basketball, she has a passion for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau dreamt of becoming a college coach one day, but when
opportunity arose, her ``heart and focus'' was committed to
Washington Prep High where she coached since 1989 and won three
L.A. City championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this opportunity came as an assistant coach, I just
wanted to learn and go back to my high school kids and teach them
some new stuff and try to win a state championship,'' Rousseau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's committed to winning a WNBA championship. She spent
the offseason studying and researching on how to execute her job.
But it's not work with Rousseau, it's a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a lot of fun. I love it. I really do. Every day's a
challenge,'' Rousseau said. ``At night I'm dreaming of things,
really, literally. I go through the day's practice in my head and
I'm like, `Yeh, we need to do this, we need to do that tomorrow.'
This team is a constant, not battle, but reflection every day.
Reflecting on what we've done and what we need to do. It's all
apart of being in tune, even in the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   A day after returning from the World Championships in Germany,
Lisa Leslie
</P>
<P>
   and Haixia Zheng
</P>
<P>
   practiced with the team before repacking to leave today for
Thursday's opener at Utah. KLAC/570 will broadcast all 30 games for
the Sparks with Larry Burnett
</P>
<P>
   as the play-by-play announcer and former Sparks assistant coach
Wanda Szeremeta
</P>
<P>
   , as the color analyst. ... All 10 WNBA rosters will be
finalized today.

CANCER GROUP REFUSES DONATION LINKED TO PHILIP MORRIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Carolyn Aldige, president of the Cancer Research
Foundation of America, said she was pleased to hear last month that
her organization would receive money from Dresses for Humanity, a
traveling charity exhibition of designer gowns worn by Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   But her excitement did not last long.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Ms. Aldige said, she was shocked that a tobacco
company had joined the list of benefactors _ a fact she learned
only upon seeing a banner at a news conference that listed the
Philip Morris Cos. as a sponsor of a gala banquet set for Thursday
to kick off the tour of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aldige said that if she had known of Philip Morris'
involvement, her organization would not have accepted an offer of
money last month from the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, based in Tampa, Fla., was set up after Diana's
death last summer and is sponsoring a tour of the exhibition in 20
cities to raise $100 million for causes supported by Diana. The
foundation was established by Maureen Rorech, who bought at auction
the 14 dresses that will be shown at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Aldige's organization will not receive any money directly
from Philip Morris, said officials at People's Princess Charitable
Foundation. But Philip Morris has reserved a table at $25,000 at
the gala, whose proceeds are to be donated to the Boys and Girls
Club of America.
</P>
<P>
   Ganzi Productions, the tour's promoter, defended the
contributions, saying, ``The foundation is not in the political
business, nor will we judge any legitimate source of money that
will help others.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Aldige said the Cancer Research Foundation of America,
based in Alexandria, Va., was ``categorically opposed to receiving
money from any tobacco-related industry'' and was assessing its
future association to the People's Princess Charitable Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Cheney, the chief operating officer of the People's
Princess Charitable Foundation, said donations would be made to
local charities in the 20 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the commitment of the foundation to raise as much money
as we can,'' Ms. Cheney said, ``and give back to the cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the controversy, she said: ``It is unfortunate that this
scenario has put anyone in an awkward position. And by no means was
it intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her organization should have let the cancer foundation
know of Philip Morris' involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that a faux pas on our part?'' she said. ``Absolutely.''

AT LEAST TWO DIE IN MONTREAL EXPLOSION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A powerful explosion ripped apart a homeless shelter
Tuesday in this city's historic Old Quarter, killing at least two
people and seriously wounding 20. Another victim was believed to
have been buried in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion was one of two deadly blasts Tuesday, both
apparently accidental, that rocked cities in eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Saint John, New Brunswick, an explosion followed by a huge
fireball engulfed gasoline-making facilities at Canada's largest
oil refinery. One person was killed and two were injured.
</P>
<P>
   After the Montreal blast, fire department rescuers and search
dogs burrowed through the debris of the Accueil Bonneau shelter in
search of one or more victims who were thought to have been buried.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion forced police to close much of the city's heavily
touristed Old Quarter to pedestrians and motor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic nun who worked at the mission was reported
missing after the blast, and there was a possibility that others
might have been trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no precise information, but we believe there is at
least one shelter worker, maybe more, still under the debris,''
said Alain Michaud, a spokesman for the Montreal Fire Department.
``We are trying to get complete quiet so we can listen for
groans.''
</P>
<P>
   The blast, which went off shortly after noon, followed the
accidental cutting of a natural gas pipe in the building by a
contractor hired to repair meters, according to fire officials and
the gas company.
</P>
<P>
   A warning was given minutes before the explosion, and witnesses
said people were rushing into the street when the blast blew out
the front of the three-story structure, crushing cars and
shattering the windows of nearby tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a strong smell of gas, then a terrible noise, and
then everything was ruins and smoke,'' said a shelter worker whose
blouse and skirt were drenched with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of strollers were in the vicinity of the explosion,
although there were no reports of injuries to tourists or other
bystanders in one of Canada's most-visited historic districts. At
least 20 people, all workers or homeless people at the shelter,
were rushed to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, both reportedly female volunteers from the shelter,
died of their injuries. Another five were reported to be in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless shelter is attached to the Chapel
Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, whose statue of the Virgin Mary with arms
outstretched to the St. Lawrence River is a Montreal landmark made
famous as ``Our Lady of the Harbor'' in the Leonard Cohen song
``Suzanne.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlantic province of New Brunswick, meanwhile, one oil
worker was killed and two suffered injuries after a blast touched
off a major fire at the mammoth Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.
</P>
<P>
   Billows of smoke rose over the city as firefighters worked to
contain flames at the refinery. Hundreds were evacuated around the
refinery in the east end of the city.
</P>

<P>
   LONDON _ Time moves slowly at Westminster Abbey, a church of
high Anglican solemnity whose first inhabitant, King Edward the
Confessor, has been resting in his tomb there for 900 years.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Very Rev. Wesley Carr took over as dean in February
1997, it was as if a high-speed cheetah had careered into a field
of stately, shuffling sheep. Quickly putting into place changes
that had been discussed for some time, Carr embarked on a program
called ``Recovering the Calm,'' which sought to control the abbey's
increasingly unruly crowds of tourists but which threw the church
into an un-calm tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   While the church began charging non-worshipers an $8 entrance
fee, the new dean supervised the installation of closed-circuit
television cameras; decreed that tour groups could have no more
than 26 tourists, down from 50; and helped set up a one-way system
to prod visitors into proceeding in an orderly fashion. And, in a
move that reportedly left some elderly people in tears, he told the
church's volunteers that starting next year, they would have to
retire at 75.
</P>
<P>
   But it was when Carr made his next move _ to suspend and then
dismiss Martin Neary, the abbey's popular, distinguished and
impeccably well-connected organist and master of the choristers _
that he set in motion a dispute that has reverberated far beyond
the church walls.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale straight out of an Anthony Trollope novel, but with
all the elements of a timeless power struggle: charges of financial
impropriety, accusations of bullying and jealous high-handedness,
even appeals to royalty.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is the dean, who, with his four canons, runs perhaps
the highest-profile church in England. Styled a ``Royal Peculiar''
because it is directly under the queen's jurisdiction, the abbey is
the church where monarchs are crowned; where the funeral of Diana,
the Princess of Wales, was held; and where Dickens, Chaucer,
Tennyson and others are buried.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, is Neary, internationally known musician,
two-time president of the Royal College of Organists and, since
1988, holder of a position once occupied by Henry Purcell. Neary's
fight to get his job back is being supported by an extraordinary
group of establishment figures, including former Prime Minister
Edward Heath; the composer John Tavener; a number of members of the
House of Lords; John Gummer, a former Cabinet minister, and Frank
Field, the minister for welfare reform, who was recently moved to
declare that the dean was ``nothing but a bully'' who had left
Neary ``dangling on a meat wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Churches have often been sniping, intrigue-ridden fiefs, and
organists and deans through the ages have fallen out over issues
like what sort of music to use and where power really resides
(temporal power, that is). Purcell himself was disciplined by the
abbey when he sold tickets for coveted seats at the 1689
coronation.
</P>
<P>
   Money was behind the current dispute, too, which has at its
heart a company established by Neary and his wife, Penny, the
concerts secretary, to handle the church choir's contracts and
tours. The Nearys said that they had set up the company on the
advice of accountants, that it had saved the abbey money and that
they had never tried to hide its existence. But Carr _ backed by
the abbey's canons _ said that the company represented a conflict
of interest and that it had unethically paid Mrs. Neary a $2,400
``fixing fee'' for organizing tours and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the amounts of money that matter, but the lack of
openness and the loss of trust,'' Carr told The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   So the dean dismissed the Nearys on the Thursday before Easter
Sunday, reportedly rebuffing the services of a number of
high-placed would-be mediators, including Lord Weatherill, former
speaker of the House of Commons, and forcing the summary
cancellation of the abbey's Easter concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Nearys denied all the charges _ ``It's like suggesting
Mother Teresa had run off with the community chest,'' one of their
supporters said _ and they appealed the decision. In a sign of the
gravity of the matter, the case is to be heard by the lord
chancellor himself, Britain's top legal official. And if the Nearys
should be reinstated, the dean might feel little choice but to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The dean, 56 and previously the dean of Bristol Cathedral, is no
longer speaking to reporters. ``He is trying to maintain a
dignified silence,'' said Emma St. John-Smith, a spokeswoman for
the abbey. ``This whole business has just become so personal. Quite
clearly, Dr. Neary has friends in high places, and there are
certain elements who seem to have their knives out for the dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Neary's supporters have deluged The Times of London with furious
letters; organized a fund that has raised more than $80,000 to help
pay the Nearys' legal expenses; and told anyone who will listen
that Carr has a history of high-handed behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Carr's critics mutter, he was suffused with
jealousy when Neary was made a lieutenant of something called the
Royal Victorian Order by the queen after Diana's funeral, while the
dean was not made anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's narcissistic and he has a need to put his finger in every
single pie there is,'' said Alan Taylor, who was recently dismissed
from his non-paying position at the abbey when, he said, he
criticized the dean to reporters. ``The man sees himself as God's
adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dean is a virtual dictator,'' said Sir Bryan Thwaites, a
retired mathematics professor who has been friends with Neary for
more than 30 years, and who convenes the Martin Neary Support
Group. ``For reasons which are totally unfathomable, he decided to
sack Martin Neary. I am a man of very considerable experience in
high management affairs, and it struck me as being absolutely
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss St. John-Smith said the Nearys' supporters were being
unfair. ``They keep talking about the `dreadful dean,' which he
isn't,'' she said. ``He's not a bully. He's a very direct person,
very humorous _ perhaps quite a decisive person. Some people
perhaps find his style a bit sharp. But I've been here 12 years,
and I get on with him very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a straight employment dispute,'' she added. ``The dean
and chapter followed to the letter the requirements of this
country's employment legislation. Had this been any other
organization, chances are this would have been a two-day wonder.''

   Baptist define marriage as non-equity union
</P>
<P>
   By Gayle White
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY, Utah _ Southern Baptists on Tuesday adopted a
clear definition of marriage and called on wives to be submissive
to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,300 messengers, or eligible voting members, attending the
annual convention here in the Salt Palace, added language to the
denominational statement of faith that describes marriage as ''the
uniting of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a
lifetime'' and says ''a wife is to submit herself graciously to the
servant leadership of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also says that a husband ''is to love his wife as
Christ loved the church'' and that ''children, from the moment of
conception, are a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are saying to the culture this is God's plan for family
life,'' said Anthony Jordan, exedutive director of the Baptist
Convention of Oklahoma, who chaired the committee that drafted the
statement. ''It is not only a better way, it's the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   An effort by the Rev. Tim Owings, pastor of First Baptist Church
in Augusta, Ga., to call for mutual submission of husband and wife
failed, as did a motion by a Huntsville, Ala., pastor to add
language specifying that widowed or single men and women could be
considered a family.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following the vote, some committee members
said some of their wording--especially as it applies to women-- is
frequently misinterpreted by people who do not understand the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Submission is not a negative word,'' said Mary Mohler, a
housewife married to Albert Mohler, president of Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville. ''It may not be a politically
correct word or a popular word, but it is a biblical word.''
</P>
<P>
   And committee member Dorothy Patterson, an educator married to
newly elected Southern Baptist Convention president Paige
Patterson, said that along with a husband's leadership ''comes
responsibility for providing for the household and protecting the
household.''
</P>
<P>
   After his election Tuesday, Paige Patterson, president of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, said the statement on
the family ''represents what Baptists have believed over the
years'' and added, ''I don't see it as being a negative statement
about anybody or anything.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's
largest Protestant denomination and an increasingly conservative
force among American religious organizations, amended its essential
statement of beliefs Tuesday to include a declaration that a woman
should ``submit herself graciously'' to her husband's leadership
and a husband should ``provide for, protect and lead his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, a 250-word declaration on family life, was
adopted by a show of hands vote at the Baptists' annual meeting
here as an addition to the denomination's basic theological
statement of beliefs, the Baptist Faith and Message Statement. The
vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the amendment and an attempt to
soften the language was soundly turned back.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment ranks as among the most prominent statements on
family life by a major religious organization in recent years. The
Southern Baptist denomination claims nearly 16 million members,
among them President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   While it says that husband and wife have ``equal worth'' before
God, the choice of words about marital relations also makes it one
of the most conservative of such statements. The amendment relies
on such biblical passages as Ephesians 5:22-33, which compares the
husband-wife relationship to that of Christ ruling the church, but
which is today seldom interpreted so literally among mainline
Protestants and Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   For example, U.S. Roman Catholic bishops, in a pastoral message
on family life four years ago, said that marital roles, although
different, should be characterized by ``mutual submission'' of a
husband and wife to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, a seminary president from North Carolina who
was elected Tuesday as the denomination's president, said the
amendment was a response to ``a time of growing crisis in the
family.'' He also said that people who found the language of the
amendment provocative are those ``who happen not to be real
familiar with the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Albert Mohler, Jr. president of Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., said the amendment was based on a
Southern Baptist belief in the literal interpretation of scripture.
He said the submission of wives to their husbands is ``not a modern
idea'' but ``is clearly revealed in scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of amendment, he said ``the secular world may hear it
as strange, but it is, we believe, God's pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Southern Baptist Convention is a creedless
organization, no Baptist is required to agree with the Faith and
Message Statement or the current amendment. But the statement is
nonetheless important on two grounds. It stands as a central
theological proclamation for the denomination, and Southern Baptist
employees, seminary professors and often ministers are expected to
agree with it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One who criticized the amendment was Robert Parham, executive
director of the independent Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville,
Tenn. ``They hope to make June Cleaver the biblical model for
motherhood, despite numerous biblical references to women who
worked outside the home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent Baptist conventions have passed resolutions that express
a sense of the denomination on social issues such as opposition to
abortion, but have said relatively little about the family. The
Faith and Message Statement is a broad theological statement
dealing with God and church and until now has not included social
stands. Until Tuesday, the message statement had been amended only
once, in 1963, when a section on higher education was added.
</P>
<P>
   Amending the statement represents a triumph for the
denomination's conservative leadership, which came to power in 1979
and has gradually shifted Southern Baptist agencies and seminaries
to the right. Theological moderates have remained within the
denomination, but many have started their own seminaries and other
institutions, and they have also largely quit coming to the annual
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote helps reinforce the image of Southern Baptists as
staking out some of the most conservative positions among
evangelical Protestants, a growing group who account for about a
quarter of the American population, according to recent polls. A
year ago, Southern Baptists called for a boycott of the Walt Disney
Co., alleging that the entertainment giant condoned homosexuality.
In 1996, the annual convention voted to appoint a missionary
specifically to evangelize Jews, a move that provoked outrage among
Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   The family life amendment is ``different from the kind of
mainstream evangelical position,'' said Nancy Ammerman, a professor
of the sociology of religion at Hartford Seminary, who has written
extensively on the Southern Baptists. Many evangelicals, she said,
have moved toward a practical understanding of male ``headship''
within family life that ``includes a strong dose of men and women
consulting with each other, and engaging in mutual discernment of
God's will for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   But random interviews among women attending the convention,
conducted before the vote, suggested that the amendment was seen as
consistent with Baptist teachings. ``I think Christ intended the
man to be head of the home,'' said Bea Wallace, 71, of Blackfoot,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Conrad, 55, of Pine Bluff, Ark., said that if a husband
``is the Christian leader he should be,'' then a wife would
willingly follow his lead. To that, Mary Hilburn, 57, of Little
Rock added that that did not mean a man could be a ``dictator'' in
his home. ``But the husband is to be the umbrella and we are to be
under that,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Faith and Message Statement was originally written in 1925,
in the midst of an intense controversy within Protestantism between
liberals and fundamentalists over how to interpret the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The current amendment was drafted by a seven-member committee
drawn from among the denomination's top leaders or their relatives.
One of the two women on the committee was Dorothy Patterson, Paige
Patterson's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment states that the family is the ``foundational
institution'' of society, and is composed of people related by
``marriage, blood or adoption.'' It implicitly rejects divorce, the
validity of homosexual unions and abortion. It says a husband
should love his wife as Christ loves the church, and a woman should
submit to her husband's ``servant leadership'' as ``the church
willingly submits to the headship of Christ.'' Servant leadership
means leading with humility. The wife, the amendment says, ``has
the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as
his `helper' in managing their household and nurturing the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote to adopt the amendment may also have had a geographic
significance as well. This week's convention is the first Southern
Baptists have ever held in Salt Lake City, headquarters of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard, dean of Wake Forest Divinity School and a
historian of the Southern Baptist Convention, said that a
conservative approach to family issues was ``the high ground that
the Mormons have claimed.'' He added: ``The one place that Baptists
had to admit that Mormons had something was in the strength of
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the meeting, the Southern Baptists' domestic missionary
agency, the North American Mission Board, printed and distributed
pamphlets critical of Mormon theology and offering guidelines on
how to evangelize Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Friday, many hundreds of Southern Baptist volunteers
have held rallies, block parties and other events, as well as gone
knocking on doors seeking to persuade local residents, Mormon and
non-Mormon alike, to convert.

   EXCERPT FROM BAPTIST STATEMENT ON FAMILY LIFE
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Following is an excerpt from a 250-word
declaration on family life adopted Tuesday by the Southern Baptist
Convention:
</P>
<P>
   The husband and wife are of equal worth before God. Both bear
God's image but each in differing ways. The marriage relationship
models the way God relates to His people. A husband is to love his
wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given
responsibility to provide for, to protect and to lead his family. A
wife is to submit graciously to the servant leadership of her
husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of
Christ. She, being ``in the image of God'' as is her husband and
thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her
husband and to serve as his ``helper'' in managing their household
and nurturing the next generation.

TOBACCO MEASURE MAY SURVIVE SENATE, AMENDMENTS GET CONSIDERATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton intervening to salvage his
antitobacco initiative, Senate leaders agreed last night to keep
the bill from drifting into limbo by permitting votes on several
disputed amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, declared
the $516 billion plan ``dead in the water,'' the Senate voted 52-46
for a GOP proposal to use $16 billion of the tobacco money to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Every Democrat opposed the five-year plan, which would increase
drug interdiction funding, ban needle-exchange programs and provide
vouchers for students who have been victims of drug-related crimes
to change schools. The only Republicans who voted against the
measure were Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then rejected a less costly Democratic alternative to
the Repubican plan by a vote of 53-45.
</P>
<P>
   But the voting results were seen as far less crucial than the
fact the votes occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In their struggle to change the way cigarettes are sold and
marketed in the United States, proponents of the antitobacco
measure said their prime goal is to push some form of legislation
through the Senate and the House so a joint conference committee
and the White House can produce a final plan.
</P>
<P>
   Without the votes last night, the initiative was in serious
jeopardy of dying before reaching a final vote in the Senate. The
House has yet to act.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement permitting the votes followed lengthy negotations
among several key senators and last-ditch phone calls yesterday
from Clinton to Lott and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working hard to get this thing back on track and get
into a position where a good comprehensive bill can pass the
Senate,'' Clinton said at a news conference with South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's chief sponsor, Senator John McCain, an Arizona
Republican who earlier had raised the possibility he would withdraw
the legislation because of unyielding opposition from a small group
of GOP conservatives seeking a major tax cut in the measure,
expressed cautious optimism after the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the words of the late Mark Twain, the reports of the death
of this legislation are premature,'' McCain said. ``However, we
certainly by no means have total confidence we will reach a
successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The logjam broke in part when the conservative group, led by
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, agreed to scale back his
plan to tap tobacco revenues to offset reductions in the so-called
marriage tax penalty. After negotiations with McCain and Senator
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic point man on the
bill, Gramm reduced the amount of tobacco money he will propose
using to offset the tax cut from $50 billion over five years to
$16.8 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote Wednesday on Gramm's plan and a
Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to break out and start moving now,'' Kerry
said in an interview. ``This is a very important development.''
</P>
<P>
   The progress followed a midday vote on a motion by Daschle to
end debate on the antitobacco measure and force a final vote. The
motion, which required 60 votes to pass, was defeated 56-42, 18
votes shy.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican voted against the Daschle motion, as did two
Democrats from tobacco-farming states, Senators Wendell H. Ford of
Kentucky and Charles S. Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle had vowed to force additional votes daily on
shutting off the debate, hoping to increase public pressure for
passing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a leading proponent of cracking down
on the tobacco industry, said Daschle's strategy paid off. ``It
sent a very powerful message,'' he said, ``and the Republicans
blinked.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said a final vote on the measure could follow debate on
several other amendments, including measures aimed at aiding
tobacco farmers and capping the fees lawyers receive for suing
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House majority leader Richard Armey said the House
would not consider such sweeping legislation. Instead, the House
will focus on a narrow bill to reduce youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Armey also said the House would not use revenues from the bill
to reduce the marriage penalty. ``We're not going to use the
tobacco settlement as a cash cow for any purpose,'' he said.

COMPANY TARGETS COFFEE SALES TO CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMNER, Wash. _ With a slogan whose theme dates back to a 1960
speech by Barry Goldwater _ ``The coffee that's taking America
back!'' _ a Sumner, Wash.-based coffee company is targeting its
sales to right-thinking Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Original Conservative Coffee Company is marketing roasts
with names that will warm the hearts of Clinton enemies. The blends
may be light, but the humor runs to heavy name-calling and
innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   A Yasser Are-A-Rat Blend mocks the Palestinian leader. ``It's a
darker roast,'' explained co-founder Michael Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species: The Spotted N.O.W. Blend takes aim at
environmentalists as well as feminists. The company's decaf roast
is called Gore's Blend. A lighter blend is entitled Say Hey: Paula
and Monica. The biggest seller is An American Hero Blend, a coffee
that celebrates Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to a politically conservative market, people
who espouse the Judeo-Christian heritage on which our country was
founded,'' Wilson explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking back'' has been a slogan of the right for nearly four
decades, since Goldwater told conservatives they could ``take back
this party'' in a richly blended speech to the 1960 Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan told conservative activists in the 1970s that it
was their duty to ``take back America.''
</P>
<P>
   But coffee?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the morning drink that helped wake up Seattle's national
image has long been associated with liberals and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., where Wilson worked as a lobbyist, a pair
of coffee houses _ Politics and Prose, and Kramer's Books and
Afterwards _ long have been spots where civil libertarians,
consumerists and environmentalists gather to plot.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has no greater center of intellectual brew than the
basement of the Elliott Bay Cafe, where book readings provide a
nucleus for gatherings of feminists, conservationists, poets and
aging followers of liberal politicians like Warren Magnuson and Al
Rosellini.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilson's view, however, the coffee market is shifting to the
right. ``We are going to make sure it shifts properly,'' Wilson
said. ``For the three months we have been up and running, we are
running ahead of expections. Conservatives are coming out of their
closets, or I should say out of their shells.''
</P>
<P>
   The Original Conservative Coffee Company is, for the moment,
catering to individualism. ``Everything we do is mail order,''
Wilson said. ``We do not have a store. We do not provide coffee to
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is taking orders over the phone (1-888-RIGHT-81) and
via its webside, http://www.toccc.com.
</P>
<P>
   As with environment-oriented businesses at the other end of the
political spectrum, The Original Conservative Coffee Company
donates a portion of every month's profits to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The current recipient of its largesse is Focus on the Family,
the Colorado-based radio program of the Rev. James Dobson. Dobson
has been in the news for threatening that Christian conservatives
will abandon the Republican Party if it does press their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Its blends were recently featured in a Wall Street Journal
article. Its web site features endorsements from KVI talk show
hosts Kirby Wilbur and Michael Medved. To sell itself, the company
is using the us-against-them language prized by conservative direct
mail specialists: ``Liberals have labeled us the most controversial
coffee company in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sumner-based conservatives have yet to deliver any evil
empire jokes about Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting, however, that the chairman of its giant
competitor, Howard Schultz, is a Democratic contributor much in
evidence during President Clinton's Seattle fundraising visit last
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who drink coffee in the United States, who are coffee
savvy, understand that Puget Sound is the coffee capital of
America,'' Wilson said. ``Not only are we (in a) liberal area, but
we are up against the heavies. We have our niche. We are out to
sell coffee to people who have the same political views that we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Original Conservative Coffee Company is seeking to
take advantage of a national brouhaha with major local
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Its newest blend, which went on sale June 1, is entitled
American Entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Justice Department attempts to strong-arm companies
such as Microsoft, we believe that it is time to wake up America to
this coming threat,'' explained a company release.

INDONESIANS REPORT WIDESPREAD RAPES OF CHINESE IN RIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Human rights and women's aid groups have
begun to document what they say appears to have been an organized
campaign of assaults, gang rapes and killings of ethnic Chinese
women during three days of rioting in Jakarta last month.
</P>
<P>
   The aid workers say they have talked with dozens of victims or
relatives of victims, and they estimated on Tuesday that more than
100 women and girls may have been attacked and raped in Jakarta
alone as their neighborhoods were burning between May 13 and 15.
There were reports of similar attacks during riots in other cities
that preceded the fall of President Suharto on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   One worker at a women's aid center, Sita Kayam, said she
believed that hundreds of women were receiving physical or
psychological help at hospitals here.
</P>
<P>
   Other aid workers said most of the victims remained too
traumatized to talk about their experiences and too terrified of
reprisals to report their ordeals to officials or even to
unofficial rape centers. The police said no reports of rape had
been brought to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Another worker at the women's aid center, Ita Nadia, said some
women had committed suicide after their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   The reported attacks ranged from the degrading and humiliating
to the horrific; from women who were made to strip and perform
calisthenics in public to women who were repeatedly raped and then
thrown into the flames of burning buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The reports involve girls and women ranging in age from 10 to
55, the aid workers said. Some were gang-raped in front of a crowd
in the Chinese commercial district of Glodok, said Rita Kolibonso,
executive director of the women's group Mitra Perempuan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the rapers said, `You must be raped because you are
Chinese and non-Muslim,''' said Ms. Ita, who works at a crisis
center called Kalyana Mitra. Ethnic Chinese citizens, who control
much of the country's commerce, have been targets of violence in
Indonesia for years.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among human rights workers and rape counselors is
that the attacks were mostly organized by unknown groups, in the
same way that increasing evidence suggests that organized groups
were involved in instigating attacks of arson and vandalism aimed
largely at ethnic Chinese neighborhoods during the rioting. This
evidence is based on reports that groups of men arrived
simultaneously at various targets in the city with gasoline bombs
and other weapons and initiated the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Hasibuan, a member of the National Commission on Human
Rights, said human rights workers had talked with a participant in
the riots who said he had been recruited, briefed, paid and
transported by unidentified men, who provided him and others with
stones and gasoline bombs. The commission is the official
government human-rights monitoring agency, but since its formation
in 1996 has often been critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the organized nature of many of the reported assaults
and because of some physical descriptions of the attackers, the aid
workers said they suspected that some elements of the armed forces
might have been involved. Some witnesses said they observed men
with muscular builds and military haircuts, and one victim said she
was raped by men who had a military uniform in their car.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have reported similar suspicions about
reported instigators of the looting and arson, who traveled in
groups through the city in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hasibuan's group reported last week that at least 1,188 people
had died in the rioting in Jakarta and that 40 large shopping
centers, 4,083 shops and 1,026 private homes had been attacked,
burned or looted.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Iman Haryatna, the Central Jakarta police chief, told
reporters that victims were welcome to come forward but that the
police had so far received no reports of assaults on women during
the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a widespread mistrust of security forces both among
the victims and human-rights workers, the reports of rapes are
being gathered instead by two prominent women's crisis centers and
three well-established human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two aid workers said they had received telephone threats warning
them to stop their investigations and their aid to victims. One of
these, a Catholic priest named Father Sandiyawan who works at the
private Jakarta Social Institute, said someone had sent him a hand
grenade in the mail as a warning.
</P>
<P>
   The other said she received a telephone call on Saturday in
which a man said: ``Do you know that a week ago we sent a grenade
to Father Sandiyawan? Do you want more than the grenade we sent to
Father Sandiyawan?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ita said that three weeks after the riots it is still very
difficult to approach the victims of rapes and harassment ``because
their trauma is very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for myself, I will tell you that it is really emotionally
difficult because I have to confront the experiences of the
victims,'' she said. ``It is really very, very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and painfully, she and other counselors have compiled
accounts like the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ A student was abducted at a bus stop, taken to a swamp near
the airport and raped by four men in a car. There was a green
uniform in the car and she asked her abductors if they were police
officers. ``If you are police, you have to save me,'' she told
them, according to Ms. Ita. One of them answered: ``No, I have to
give you a lesson. You are a woman and you are beautiful and you
are part of the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In the midst of the riot, a group of men stopped a city bus
and forced out all the non-Chinese women. ``Then they chose the
beautiful women among the Chinese and raped them inside the bus,''
Sandiyawan said. ``The victims of that incident are really
depressive. They are in the hospital with their families. They are
trying to hide themselves from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A 10-year-old girl returning from school discovered that the
shop-house where her family lived and worked had been burned. As
she went in search of her parents, she was seized by two men and
raped in front of her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   _ One woman, a bank officer, told a local reporter that she was
seized from the back of a motorcycle in the middle of the riot and
thrown to the ground by a group of men. ``She told me she was so
hysterical and she was so panicked that she does not remember what
happened,'' the reporter said. ``But she showed me a lot of bruises
on her body, especially on her legs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In an incident of public humiliation, a group of about 15 men
entered a bank where 10 ethnic Chinese employees were taking refuge
from the riot. The men locked the door, made the women take off
their clothes and ordered them to dance. In a similar incident
during a riot in the city of Medan on May 4, 20 female students at
a teachers' training college were stopped by police officers when
they tried to flee the violence on their campus. The officers
forced them to take off their clothes and perform calisthenics. In
both cases, the women reported that they were fondled but not
raped. In another incident of harassment during the riot in
Jakarta, a number of ethnic Chinese women were reportedly stripped
and made to swim in a pond.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ms. Ita told of an ethnic Chinese woman who hid in her house
with her two younger sisters as the rioters approached. About 10
men came into the house and found the sisters on the third floor.
They made the two younger women take off their clothes and told the
older sister to stand in a corner, ``because you are too old for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, arsonists entered the lower floors and set fire to
the building. ``After they had raped her two sisters, the two men
said to her, `We are finished and we are satisfied and because you
are too old and ugly we weren't interested in you.' So they took
her two sisters and pushed them to the ground floor where there was
already fire, and they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When her mother heard the news, she had a heart attack and
died,'' Ms. Ita said. ``So now this woman is in a psychiatric
hospital. Sometimes she cries when she tells the story and
sometimes she is normal again. That is one of the stories we have
confirmed.''

PRIVATE VOUCHER PLAN FOR 50,000 CHILDREN IS ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of business leaders pledged Tuesday to raise $200
million for a national voucher program that would permit at least
50,000 inner-city public-school children to attend parochial and
other private schools over the next four years. The businessmen
said they were trying to prod failing public schools into improving
by subjecting them to market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Imitating similar programs begun last year in New York City and
Washington, the organizers of the venture, known as the Children's
Scholarship Fund, said they had already secured commitments of $140
million, including $50 million each from two founding board
members. They are Theodore Forstmann, a senior partner in Forstmann
Little &AMP; Co., an investment firm, and the chairman of Gulfstream
Aerospace, and John Walton, a director of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
a son of Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort is one of the largest private investments on behalf
of schoolchildren, second only to the $500 million that Walter
Annenberg, the philanthropist, committed to public-education reform
over five years, beginning in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The program announced Tuesday, if fully financed, would also
dwarf all of the private voucher programs that have sprouted in
more than three dozen cities and towns in recent years, most of
them in response to long-smoldering discontent among parents and
businesses with the quality of public education.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive of those efforts is in San Antonio,
Texas, where a local physician and a foundation that endorses
vouchers have committed to sending every interested public-school
student living below the poverty level to private or parochial
school, beginning next fall, through the end of high school. The
cost of that program, which is being offered to more than 13,000
schoolchildren, is estimated at $50 million over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the voucher program Tuesday morning inside the New
York Public Library, Forstmann and Walton were joined by Michael
Ovitz, a major investor in Livent, an entertainment company, and
the former president of Walt Disney Co., and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a graduate of the city's Catholic schools. He inspired a
group of Wall Street executives to create the New York program last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann said that the extraordinary demand for the New York
program _ more than 40,000 applications for just 2,200 scholarships
for the current school year and the next one _ was all the evidence
necessary to convince him that inner-city students craved
alternatives to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the national voucher program would provide an
outlet for businesses that are searching for new ways to invest in
education and are frustrated that their financial commitments to
many public schools have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in public schools,'' said Forstmann, who attended
only private schools, the Greenwich Country Day School in
Greenwich, Conn., and later Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
``But they're not working right in a lot of places. Money's not
going to fix them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to motivate public schools to improve is to
threaten them with the loss of their students, Forstmann said,
echoing the philosophy of the voucher movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition makes you better,'' he said. ``If you have a
totally free marketplace in anything, and you don't compete, you go
broke. If you do compete, you prosper.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the voucher program in New York City, the new foundation
expects to award its scholarships to low-income students by
lottery, in as many as 50 cities. But unlike the New York group,
which offers scholarships to students entering first through sixth
grades, the new foundation will accept applications from low-income
students in all grades.
</P>
<P>
   While the New York organization, known as the School Choice
Scholarship Foundation, has provided students with up to $1,400
annually, in some cases covering full tuition, the national
foundation will ask parents to cover at least 25 percent of tuition
and sometimes as much as 60 percent, depending on their means,
Forstmann said. ``They should own this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The national organization specified no limit on the amounts of
individual awards, but estimated that the average tuition was
$1,995 a year at private schools participating in existing voucher
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann said that the organization was seeking corporate and
individual partners in large and small cities to match the $100
million that he and Walton had put up. He said the organization had
commitments from patrons to raise $5 million or more in Los
Angeles, New York, Chicago and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, officials at the School Choice Scholarship
Foundation, which has awarded $11 million in three-year
scholarships over the last two years, said Tuesday that they were
considering a partnership with Forstmann's group. In Jersey City,
N.J., Mayor Bret Schundler said he would personally contribute
$25,000 in an effort to raise $400,000, to be matched by the new
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking to gain widespread acceptance for both privately
and publicly financed vouchers embraced Tuesday's announcement as a
validation of their movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge boost,'' said Clint Bolick, litigation director
of the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that
defends school voucher programs nationwide. ``Both because it shows
that business people are growing impatient over the glacial pace of
education reform and because it will give more low-income families
a taste of what is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But the response was more measured from those who fear the
encroachment of such efforts on public-education spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are wealthy people, and if this is where they want to
put their money, who am I to argue,'' said Sandra Feldman, the
president of the American Federation of Teachers. Like many
educators, she opposes vouchers, contending that they siphon money
from public schools. ``I would much prefer to have seen a
contribution like that made to the public schools, the way Walter
Annenberg did,'' she said.

ROCK KINGS, DRAG QUEENS: A COMMON STRUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that rock-and-roll, symbolized by the
primitive, strutting, priapic dance of a surly young man and his
guitar, seemed to be an entrenched staple of American culture. In
the 1970s and '80s, heyday of the hard-rock ``hair band,'' it was
easy to imagine an endless stream of sinewy guitar heroes with
flowing tresses and bulging crotches passing the Dionysian torch
from generation to generation until civilization finally exploded
in an apocalyptic blitz of screeching feedback. An immersion in the
arena-rock experience, with its beer-guzzling, drug-taking and
gladiatorial rowdiness, was a rite of passage for every red-blooded
American teen-age boy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fundamental myths of rock was that it was essentially
a man's game, a macho sport that knocked a generation of unctuous
crooning mama's boys out of the batter's box of popular culture and
allowed ``real'' men to step to the pop-music plate. Girls who
sought membership in this boys' club had better be butch. But even
performers like Patti Smith and Joan Jett, who affected male
bravado, were never fully accepted into the highest reaches of
rock's pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind that myth, of course, is something quite
different. The Beatles, when they arrived, were cuddly,
nonthreatening teddy bears. As early as the mid-1960s, male rockers
like Mick Jagger were toying with images of androgyny and sexual
role reversal. But full-scale deconstruction of the myth of the
rock hero didn't begin in earnest until the early 1970s, when that
cadaverous, chilly-voiced English rocker and (at the time)
self-proclaimed bisexual David Bowie began parading sexually
subversive alter egos on the rock stage. The most notorious was a
space alien with flaming hair named Ziggy Stardust (he
metamorphosed into Aladdin Sane and later into the Thin White Duke)
who parodied oral sex with his lead guitarist on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie's theatricality subverted the notion of the rock star as
an authentic populist hero by suggesting that all rock preening and
strutting was really just a pose. He paved the way for the
gender-bending performances of Lou Reed and the New York Dolls, as
well as a ``glitter rock'' movement in England.
</P>
<P>
   The ideas about rock, androgyny and sexual fluidity popularized
by Bowie and his glitter-rock peers have recently been carried to
the next step by the witty Off Broadway show ``Hedwig and the Angry
Inch.'' This surreal musical fantasy written by John Cameron
Mitchell, who stars as its title character, Hedwig Schmidt, an East
German transsexual rock performer who becomes lost in America,
emphasizes the point that rock-and-roll stardom of the flamboyant
sort has always shared profound similarities with drag performance.
When striding across the stage in high drag, exhibiting the ironic
hauteur of a rock-era Marlene Dietrich, Hedwig is a charismatic,
larger-than-life rock-and-roll vamp. When she removes her wig
extensions, her charisma begins to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Hedwig'' illustrates, the macho strut of the rock-and-roll
star is the same exaggerated pantomime as the strut of a drag
queen. It doesn't matter whether the image being promoted is
supermacho or ultra-femme. From behind the facade of the Dionysian
superstud or the voracious vamp, the performer commands the same
godlike erotic power.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's most telling jokes is that Hedwig has had a
botched sex-change operation that left an inch of her penis
attached. This despised reminder of her past has inspired the name
of her band, the Angry Inch. The mocking joke is a clever swipe at
the phallocentric myth of rock machismo as symbolized by the
overstuffed crotch that many hard-rock singers and guitarists
affected during the heyday of the hair band, from Led Zeppelin to
Aerosmith to Poison.
</P>
<P>
   As Hedwig recounts her life in song and narration, she tells the
unhappy story of growing up a miserable, lonely ``girlyboy'' named
Hansel in East Germany and of escaping her past by marrying an
American soldier who insisted she have the operation before their
wedding. They move to America, and Hedwig ends up in Kansas,
divorced and earning her living as a prostitute. Resuming her
childhood hobby of music, she becomes the mentor, songwriting
collaborator and lover of a gangling, pimply teen-age boy whom she
christens Tommy Gnosis.
</P>
<P>
   But once Tommy becomes a star, he denies her existence. While
Hedwig relates this sad story, she periodically opens a side door
of the seedy hotel nightclub in which she is appearing to let in
blasts of music from a huge outdoor concert that Tommy is giving
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with its mentions of the Berlin wall as an artificial
dividing line, the show is rife with images of the divided self and
the artificially separated masculine and feminine sides of rock.
The show suggests that Hedwig and Tommy are actually two aspects of
the same person who are lost without each other.
</P>
<P>
   That fantasy resonates powerfully in rock-and-roll history.
Consider Elvis Presley, the king himself, who ascended from the
working class in Mississippi by reinventing himself as a swiveling,
hiccuping, country-blues version of Dean Martin. When Elvis burst
onto the pop scene in 1956, he seemed as weirdly androgynous in his
way as Bowie's space alien did 16 years later. Initially, Elvis'
gyrations, pouty sneer, bedroom eyes and Marilyn Monroe-like body
language were interpreted by America's straight-arrow culture
mavens as effeminate.
</P>
<P>
   Until his death in 1977, Elvis remained as flamboyant a showman
as any pop diva or diva impersonator. Is there really any
difference between today's legions of Elvis imitators wiggling and
sneering in white-studded jumpsuits and today's legions of
be-wigged drag queens lip-synching to the recordings of Judy
Garland, Barbra Streisand or Cher? Not much, aside from the fact
that Elvis imitators belong to an ostensibly straight culture and
the drag queens to a gay-oriented one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Drag, like Elvis-style rock stardom, is all about emerging from
nowhere as a self-invented phenomenon. Although drag in the era of
performance art has assumed many shadings, the drag queen has
traditionally been a gay man who dons female garb to savor the
power of being a female star and uses that alter ego to vent
larger-than-life ``unmanly'' emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming yourself from a nondescript gay man into a
glamorous facsimile of a female star or into your own original drag
persona also theoretically opens up a world of erotic possibility
in which heterosexual men unavailable to you in your drab everyday
persona become potential conquests. In that sense, the drag queen's
parody of a diva has an attitude toward women of wishful envy.
</P>
<P>
   Because such parodies often involve a comic caricature of a
woman as a sexually voracious Gorgon, they have often been
misperceived as misogynistic. What the drag queen is burlesquing,
by turning the tables, is really the macho mystique and the male
objectification of women as sex objects. At the same time, the drag
queen's imperious assumption of the female role is a fierce
assertion of power by a member of one of the most persecuted of all
groups: effeminate gay men.
</P>
<P>
   The standard myth of the rock-and-roll hero, be he Elvis or
Bruce Springsteen, is quite similar. He is a lonely outsider from
the wrong side of the tracks who in a sustained feat of
self-transcendence transforms himself into an icon, inflating his
rags-to-riches story into a pop myth.
</P>
<P>
   But since the 1950s, that story has been repeated so many times
and on so many levels that the only way mass culture has been able
to refresh the myth has been to eviscerate it. In that sense,
rock-and-roll history and the search for novelty _ new variations
on a standard theme _ has been a mass market exercise in cultural
deconstruction. By the time Bowie became an international star in
1972, rock culture, in order to advance, required the kind of
self-conscious exploration of rock-star iconography that he
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie wasn't the only early-'70s rocker whose concerts were
theatrical spectacles. Alice Cooper and successors like the band
Kiss and most recently Marilyn Manson have treated rock performance
as cartoonish Grand Guignol. With the rise of the music video,
Michael Jackson, the Artist formerly known as Prince, Culture Club,
Madonna and others have gone deeper by portraying stardom itself as
a continuously evolving performance piece in which the borders
between their public and private selves blur until image and music
are indivisible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all rock culture follows this model. The folk
movement and the rock music it produced belongs to a more
puritanical literary tradition. Or at least it pretends to in its
trusting in the authenticity and consistency of the artist's voice.
But you could argue that authenticity itself is a pose.
</P>
<P>
   Who would Bob Dylan be if little Bobby Zimmerman from Hibbing,
Minn., hadn't adopted the surname of a charismatic Welsh poet
famous for his hypnotically lyrical recitations? From the beginning
of his career, Dylan cultivated the chameleon image of elusive
genius trickster, vagabond troubadour and prophet of hip. During
his mid-'70s Rolling Thunder Revue, he theatricalized that image,
appearing on stage in white-face.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade later, when Springsteen posed in front of an
American flag in T-shirt and jeans for the album ``Born in the
U.S.A.,'' it was an iconographic coup that established him as
``authentic'' working-class beefcake. Today's male country music
stars in their tight jeans and western regalia are the studly
Nashville-schooled cousins of the hair-band rockers. Authenticity,
sincerity and country ``roots'' are essential ingredients to the
package being marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of ``Hedwig,'' with its endless joking references
to '70s pop culture, is an indication of the degree to which that
culture has been absorbed by millions of people over the last four
decades. It may well be that more Americans under 55 are better
acquainted with the history of rock than with any other history
they have been taught. But once something is known and assimilated
to the degree that rock culture has been, its mystery, its ``art,''
if you will, begins to fade. Once it belongs to everyone, it is
just a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedwig'' suggests that the strutting rock-and-roll hero, if
he's to survive as a cultural icon, may have to be reinvented. Or
maybe he is already being reinvented as a bad girl. First Madonna,
then Courtney Love have sent real shock waves through the culture
by flaunting rebellious images unapologetically. To a be a bad boy
nowadays means being a gangsta rapper, and even that outlaw image
is becoming stale. Women still have more latitude.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of unlimited freedom of expression that the snarling
rock-and-roll hero augured in the conformist 1950s is taken for
granted 40 years later. But that freedom hasn't been just a license
for men to make rowdy macho noise and thrust out their groins. From
the very beginning, the freedom promised by rock was also the
freedom of men and women (and blacks and whites) to play and
exchange roles, to dress up and be sexy in ways that were almost
unthinkable half a century ago. Whether it's Elvis unconsciously
imitating Marilyn Monroe or Mick Jagger consciously copying Tina
Turner or Patti Smith aping Jimi Hendrix, this dialogue has been
going on for a long time, and it has made everyone aware of an
erotic potential in human life that was once barely discernible. It
takes a proud man in drag to remind us of how far we've come.

PHILADELPHIA MAYOR ACCEPTS CHALLENGE TO TEST ENFORCEMENT OF GUN
LAWS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pushing his figurative poker chips into the pot,
Mayor Edward Rendell called the National Rifle Association's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the NRA's 127th annual convention, which concluded
here Tuesday, the group's leaders campaigned for a new approach to
reducing gun-related violence in big cities. They said they wanted
full cooperation of federal and local authorities in one city to
test the theory that strict enforcement of existing gun laws and
intensive gun-use education in public schools would dramatically
cut the incidence of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with much of what they stand for,'' Rendell
said. ``But if they put the resources behind it, I'd be more than
willing for the city to serve as a prototype for their idea. No
question it could help.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks just after his election as NRA president on Monday,
the actor Charlton Heston made a plea for the chance to try the
approach and suggested that Philadelphia, which has an unusually
high rate of violent crime, would make an ideal proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who was not invited to attend the convention, said in
an interview on Monday night that he would welcome any strategy
that would drive down the number of homicides in Philadelphia,
where more than 400 people have died of gun shots every year since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell warned that the NRA's approach was too naive, given
the complexities of fighting crime in a metropolis. The largest
obstacle, he said, is the millions of dollars that would be needed
to build more prisons and detention centers, hire additional
prosecutors and expand the number of judges hearing criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   And he disputed the NRA's contention that cities like
Philadelphia were not aggressive enough in prosecuting criminals. A
former prosecutor himself, Rendell said that Pennsylvania's prison
population increased by 30 percent over the last four years, to
34,000 inmates from 26,000, and that a typical sentence was ``twice
as long as it was in the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing exactly what the gun advocates want,'' he said.
``But their ideas can never work alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the NRA, Rendell and other big-city mayors have been
searching for innovative ways to stem violent crime. In
Philadelphia, stolen guns and the multiple purchases of guns have
been a particular problem.
</P>
<P>
   But while the NRA argues that stronger law enforcement would
deter criminals, Rendell said that, as a practical matter, tracking
the illegal sale of guns through record-keeping and background
checks _ which the NRA opposes _ would do more to help the police
and prosecutors build stronger cases and focus their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said that ``personalizing guns'' through new
computer-chip technology would also go a long way toward ending the
kind of recent schoolyard shootings that killed and injured
students and teachers in places like West Paducah, Ky., Jonesboro,
Ark., and Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   As the NRA was electing Heston on Monday, Rendell and officials
for a dozen other cities were meeting with gun makers to share
ideas on how to reduce the risk of unauthorized and illegal uses of
guns. The group formed a committee to develop ideas over the next
four to six months.
</P>
<P>
   But Rendell said nothing intrigued him more than technology that
would prevent anyone but the registered owner of a gun from firing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in Philadelphia, 30 percent of the police officers shot
are shot by their own guns,'' he said. ``If we can stop that from
happening to police officers, why not for every purchaser? It's not
the only answer, but it would go a long way toward keeping guns in
the hands of their legitimate owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over implementing such technology has raged for
several years, and generally, the NRA and manufacturers have
objected, arguing that personalizing guns is a form of restriction
and that the technology would drive up the cost of the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said the same kinds of objections were raised by car
manufacturers decades ago when air bags were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said of the car makers, ``they're putting side air
bags in the doors. And they're doing it voluntarily.''

THREE-DAY RALLY IN STOCKS FIZZLES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A three-day rally in stocks fizzled on Tuesday and
left major market indexes mixed, illustrating Wall Street's renewed
concerns about the corporate earnings outlook and some wariness
about the near-term prospect for interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But a rally among some Internet-related shares pushed technology
stocks higher, as the Nasdaq composite index closed above 1,800 for
the first time since May 22. Falling energy prices pushed up
transportation stocks, and news concerning prescription drugs
continued to buoy pharmaceutical shares.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip issues bore the brunt of the declines, with the Dow
Jones industrial average falling 19.68 points, to 9,049.92.
Financial services companies like American Express, J.P. Morgan)
and Wells Fargo, as well as some multinational companies such as
McDonald's, which had been higher in recent days, had some of the
largest retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Wednesday's congressional testimony of the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, also helped weaken
blue-chip issues, analysts said, as investors expressed some
concern that the Fed could still raise interest rates sometime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consensus seems to be that rates will not be going
higher,'' said Charles Johnson, a managing director and head equity
trader at Blaylock &AMP; Partners. ``But there is that nervousness in
the marketplace that maybe the Fed sees something that we don't,''
which would justify an interest rate increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing flow of earnings warnings from companies is keeping
investors worried about the outlook for corporate profits, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Billing Concepts, a billing agent for the
telecommunications industry, warned that earnings could fall below
expectations in its third and fourth quarters due to a decline in
demand. Arrow International, a maker of disposable medical
products, said fiscal third-quarter sales are likely to increase
less than expected because of slowing international orders.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in oil prices pushed the stocks of companies like
Chevron and Exxon lower after the Paris-based International Energy
Agency forecast a decline in Asian demand for oil. However, the
oil-price drop lifted stocks of transportation companies,
particularly airlines. Gains in such carriers as Alaska Air Group
and US Airways Group lifted the Amex airline index 4.1 percent and
the Dow Jones transportation average 3.11 percent, its biggest
one-day gain this year.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a 4-point rise in Pfizer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
inched up 2.69 points to 1,118.41. Pfizer soared to 112 7/16 on
news that the Food and Drug Administration said the company's
impotence-treatment drug, Viagra, did not directly cause the deaths
of 16 users.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index gained 12.99 points to 1,800.76,
pulled higher by a broad rally in Internet stocks on news of a deal
between General Electric's NBC and the struggling web service Cnet,
which shot up 12[, or 37 percent, to 45[. Lycos, Yahoo, America
Online, Netscape Communications and Earthlink Network all rose.
Lycos also gained after receiving a patent for its ``spider''
search technology.
</P>
<P>
   But some Internet-related shares that had caught investor
attention in recent weeks are now languishing. K-Tel International,
which soared to 33 15/16 after the company announced in April that
it would sell music on the Internet, fell 33/64, to 11\.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent losses Tuesday included Chromatics Color
Sciences International shares, which fell about 49 percent before
partly recovering to close at 6{, down 2 5/16. The company develops
technologies to scientifically measure skin color in order to
detect jaundice in infants.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio &AMP; Co., a firm which bets that stocks will go down,
recommended selling the stock on Tuesday. Asensio said that
Chromatics' principal product has no sales and licensing potential
and that irregular trading activity may have occurred in the stock
among owners, including two Dreyfus micro-cap mutual funds that
have sizable holdings in Chromatics.
</P>
<P>
   A Dreyfus spokesman called the allegations ``unsubstantiated.''
And Darby Macfarlane, the chief executive of Chromatics, said the
company was ``working diligently to put out a detailed report'' to
counter the Asensio claims.

TRYING TO KILL SPOUSE WAS TURNING POINT FOR SHELTER FOUNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - She wanted him to die that night.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, Betty DellaCorte Ryan had endured her
husband's slaps, kicks and punches. They often left her in a bloody
mess and heading for the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   She could tell this night was going to be another bad one by the
way he was ranting and screaming at her. Lately, he had been
threatening to pull out his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're shacking up with men,'' Ryan recalls him yelling at
her. Then, he shouted for another beer. That was her cue.
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the kitchen, pulled out a fistful of valiums,
got a beer from the refrigerator and began dropping the capsules
into the can. She was amazed at how calm and natural it all seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven. That should do it,'' she says she thought and added: ``I
slept so good that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband passed out before he could finish the beer, but
survived.
</P>
<P>
   That night in 1971 was a turning point for Ryan. It pushed her
to become a pioneer in the battle against domestic violence. Ryan
founded Faith House in 1974, one of the first domestic abuse
shelters in Arizona and the country. Six years later, she opened a
Faith House in Prescott to help victims in less urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her legacy has grown. There are eight licensed shelters
in Maricopa County, with a little more than 200 beds for domestic
abuse victims. Other agencies, such as homeless shelters, also
provide beds to domestic violence victims.
</P>
<P>
   In July, she expects to break ground on a five-acre
domestic-violence center with services that will include plastic
surgery to fix wounds, counseling for batterers and victims, crisis
housing for victims and job training. The shelter, she says, will
be called Prospect Park, after a place in Brooklyn where she sought
refuge from an abusive home.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her patio office last week, Ryan looks back on her 65
years of life. So much of it, she says, seems like such a distant
nightmare. &UR; Nights she spent crouched in her front-yard bushes to
escape the beatings. All the bruises she tried to cover with
makeup. A broken nose. And the time she woke up with a gun to her
head and he pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was empty that time. And she vowed there would be no
next time. She filed for divorce the next day.
</P>
<P>
   She was already attending Al-Anon classes, a 12-step program for
families of alcoholics. It helped her understand why she stayed
with her abuser and how she could break the cycle of violence she
kept repeating and repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Turning and looking out the window, Ryan says life had always
been a violent one. She recounts a childhood memory.
</P>
<P>
   She is four years old and in the kitchen of her Brooklyn home,
clinging to the front of her mother's legs. Her mother has her arms
wrapped around her, trying to block the blows to the child's back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her father continues to beat her until she slides down
her mother's apron, catches her two front teeth on it and they rip
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were loose already,'' said Ryan. ``See, even to this day
I tend to minimalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimalizing and rationalizing was how Ryan says she made it
through life.
</P>
<P>
   First, she did it for her father. Later, it was for her first
and second husband.
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband also had been abusive. Ryan says he was very
controlling and criticized everything she would do. By the time she
divorced him in 1963, after 11 years of marriages and the birth of
two daughters, she says she had little self esteem left and fell
victim to a physically abusive second husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all I knew,'' confesses Ryan, who divorced her second
husband after three-and-a-half years. ``I didn't know there was any
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Anon, Ryan says, helped her realize she had choices. It also
got her started in the domestic violence business. From her Al-Anon
meetings, Ryan had met other women who were being beaten by their
husbands. She began offering them and their children shelter in her
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wake up in the morning and see these women and
children asleep in our living room,'' recalls Lisa Gebhardt, Ryan's
38-year-old daughter. ``At first, I really resented it. I wanted
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lisa and her sister, Robin Burke, are part of the Faith
House team. Robin runs the Prescott shelter and Lisa manages the
alternative programs in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of taking domestic violence victims into her
home, Ryan decided to convert her residence officially into the
first domestic abuse shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the shelter ran only with volunteers and
donations. Later, bingo games helped fund the programs and build
the Prescott facility.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ryan would do practically everything. Her right-hand
assistant was _ and still is _ Flo Mills, another domestic-abuse
survivor. The two women would take the victims to Al-Anon meetings
and counseling sessions and wipe away their tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we would cry with them,'' says Ryan, who today
mostly handles chief executive duties, such as securing funding,
and lobbies for stricter laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how her life has changed, Ryan wants to provide
hope to other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me. People told me it couldn't be done. They told me
what I had was a dream and they couldn't invest in a dream,'' says
Ryan. ``That's why we call it Faith House, because it was built on
faith.''

COMMENTARY: FEATHERED AND TARRED  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky's glamour shots in Vanity Fair are
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Not because she poses like a fan dancer with bare shoulders,
fuchsia feathers, a huge diamond rock and scarlet lipstick and nail
polish. Not because she rolls around in grass, as in ``Leaves of,''
aping Marilyn in a snug gingham shirt and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   No, these glossies of Monica in Malibu are pornography because
of what they tell us about our dizzy society, that in pursuit of a
moment of fame, people take leave of their senses. There's
something sickening about a young woman who vamps with an American
flag, mocking her role as the silent center of a case that could
bring down a president.
</P>
<P>
   Getting your own photo shoot in Vanity Fair has become the
premier achievement in our celebrity-mad culture. (Ms. Lewinsky's
first choice for a photographer was Annie Leibovitz, but she had to
settle for another iconographer of glitz, Herb Ritts.) She was so
eager to get her scandal trophy that she didn't stop to consider
that these photographs shriek ``I'm not a serious person'' and brag
``I was the president's sex kitten.''
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing about the shot of Monica clutching the feathers
is that it's not sultry. It's saddening. Stubby and white, her hand
looks disturbingly childlike. Her short nails are painted red, like
a little girl who has put on her mother's polish. Shades of
JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   And when you see it, you wonder all over again what the
president of the United States could have been thinking when,
focusing only on himself, he decided to overload all the circuits
in the brain of a 21-year-old White House intern who idolized him
and is still, according to Newsweek, infatuated.
</P>
<P>
   We know William Ginsburg was dumb and dumber, a starstruck L.A.
malpractice lawyer suffering from Judge Ito disease, TV poisoning.
But his most bonehead move was signing the Vanity Fair release, and
happily hanging out on the Malibu beach _ near where ``Baywatch''
is filmed _ as the alleged victim in his care was tarted up by
Ritts.
</P>
<P>
   When they brought out the Belle Watling outfits, couldn't
somebody have asked for a nice navy blue Armani pantsuit? More
Jamie Tarses, less Gypsy Rose Lee?
</P>
<P>
   The layout followed months of Ginsburg's painting the
24-year-old former intern as a vulnerable, tortured young ``girl,''
caught in a vendetta between two powerful men. He told reporters
she needed to do it to assuage her ego and her ``libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Monica's father, Bernard, also attended some of the
beach sessions where they troweled makeup onto his daughter's
pretty face. Sources in the Lewinsky camp say Lewinsky ``freaked
out'' about only one thing _ Monica's cavorting with the flag. But
then, what else would one expect of a man who went on Barbara
Walters and defended the president who turned his daughter into a
plaything?
</P>
<P>
   The caption that goes with a photograph of Monica barefoot in a
backless black chiffon cocktail dress feeds her warped fantasy that
she and Bill Clinton, pudgy teen-agers, were destined for a
transforming romance that turned her into ``the prom queen'' and
him into ``the beefy quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that there's one thing Monica has immunity from:
brains. Her new lawyers and public relations advisers have been
frantically spinning, trying to counteract the effects of the
exhibitionist photos and graft on a new, more sober persona. No
more Material Girl. No more Beverly Hills mallrat. The new Monica
is deep. Her team told U.S. News &AMP; World Report that she loves
``antique bookstores,'' is a ``fanatic'' for Shakespeare, and
treated herself to a complete set of Dickens. In a real stunner,
the news magazine reports, ``Sources close to Monica reveal that
she has even taken up knitting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also a new working-girl resume for Marcia Lewis, the
glam mom who coached her daughter in the ways of the world. We
learn from U.S. News that Monica's divorced parents were the
children of ``struggling immigrants'' and that the young couple
once lived in a ``gritty'' section of Los Angeles. Glamour begone:
Early in her marriage, it turns out, Ms. Lewis worked at the Los
Angeles County sewer department.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Monica's in feathers and diamonds, it is clear: You
can take the girl out of Beverly Hills, but you can't take Beverly
Hills out of the girl.

SMALL NATIONS DECRY SCOURGE OF DRUGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Palau's president describes his nation as an
island paradise, with the world's best scuba diving in pristine
South Pacific waters, abundant seafood, safe streets and a growing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One might think that our paradise is free of drug problems,''
President Kuniwo Nakamura said in a statement to the General
Assembly's special session on illegal drugs. But an imported form
of methamphetamine _ nicknamed ``ice'' _ has begun to entice users
as young as 13 and 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our law enforcement is well trained and respected, we
lack the technology to effectively combat this terrible problem,''
said the president's statement, which was delivered to a largely
empty chamber by Palau's representative Hersey Kyota on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Oratory from big nations like the United States dominated the
opening of the special session on Monday. But the full scope of the
drug problem has unfolded in sometimes poignant testimony by
smaller and poorer countries like Palau, the United Nations' newest
member. They have lined up to recount how drug trafficking and
consumption have corrupted their struggling economies and societies
and why they are hard pressed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been more candor than characterizes most General
Assembly sessions. Former Soviet republics have complained of
rising drug use in the wake of the heady arrival of democracy.
Caribbean nations have recounted the dangers of being overrun by
drug smugglers. Many countries have asked for financial and
technical assistance and a greater effort by developed countries to
reduce the demand for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Kubanychbek Jumaliyev of Kyrgyzstan said Tuesday
that ``while two or three years ago people in Kyrgyzstan had only a
theoretical idea of what heroin is, nowadays it has become one of
the main drugs on the illegal market.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Armenia found itself on the drug trafficking route from
Central Asia, its Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said, local drug
seizures had risen by 30 times since 1993 and narcotics-related
crime in Armenia was up by 150 percent. New-found democratic
freedoms left many Armenians vulnerable to drugs, Oskanian said,
``not just of personal use but for quick and easy financial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago said that
his island nation's proximity to South America made it vulnerable
to cocaine trafficking. The result, he said, was a rise in serious
crime, the recruitment of unemployed people as drug traffickers and
users, and a dramatic escalation in addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia's Prime Minister Guntars Krasts said that 80 percent of
Latvian high school students surveyed have tried drugs at least
once, and that drug abuse had claimed the lives of an increasing
number of young Latvians. Deputy Prime Minister Josef Kalman of
Slovakia agreed, ``We have noticed an increasing number of
consumers coming from lower and lower age levels.''
</P>
<P>
   No nation has proposed legalizing drugs. The Danish Health
Minister Carsten Koch said that law enforcement works when combined
with primary drug prevention and social intervention. ``No
government should jeopardize this situation by considering to
legalize narcotic drugs for other purposes than medical and
scientific ones,'' Koch said.

IMPASSE ON ANTI-SMOKING BILL MAY BE BROKEN  
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Signs developed Tuesday that the Senate's
weeks-long impasse on anti-smoking legislation might be broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted, 52-46, for a Republican amendment to use some
of the money that would be raised from higher cigarette prices on
drug abuse programs. The vote was the first on the legislation in
three weeks, and plans were made to vote on Wednesday on proposals
to use other money from the tobacco legislation for income-tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved was prepared to assert that the bill was out of
the woods. But in a brief interview, Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Republican leader, said, ``If we're going to start
having some votes, then something might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a different tack from the one Lott took on Monday, when
he said the bill was such bad legislation that it should be
withdrawn. Approval of anti-drug measures and tax cuts ``does
change the mix,'' he said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation just before President Clinton's news
conference Tuesday afternoon, Lott told the president of the
progress. When he was asked about the legislation, the president
said: ``I do believe that the possibility of getting a
comprehensive bill out of the Senate is greater now than it was
this morning. There are still problems, to be sure. But we are
getting closer to, I think, a principled compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chief sponsor of the bill,
agreed. ``Reports of the death of this legislation were
premature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain quickly added that ``a lot of difficult hurdles''
remained before the bill could be brought to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The basic bill, meant to discourage teen-age smoking, would
raise the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack over five
years, expand federal regulation of tobacco marketing and
advertising, and require the cigarette makers to pay stiff
penalties if youth smoking did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats have argued that it is the most important public
health measure to come before Congress in years. Republicans have
countered that the legislation is a futile effort to deal with a
public health problem by raising taxes and creating new government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to be considered on Wednesday would give tax breaks
to couples filing joint returns and to self-employed workers who
must pay for their own medical insurance. That and the anti-drug
measure approved tonight give Republicans the opportunity to argue
that they have turned the legislation into one that fits Republican
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House are still unenthusiastic about
the direction the legislation in the Senate is taking. Rep.Dick
Armey of Texas, the majority leader, told reporters Tuesday that
his associates were working on a stripped-down bill that would not
raise the price of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional elections this fall are a motif that
influences the entire debate. Democrats have made clear that if
strong anti-smoking legislation does not pass, they will accuse
Republicans of doing the bidding of the tobacco companies. But
Democrats have been forced into supporting income-tax cuts to keep
the Republicans themselves from having a strong campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The logjam in the Senate came unstuck Tuesday during a series of
private meetings that followed an unsuccessful Democratic move to
cut off debate on the legislation. The Democratic effort, called
cloture, was rejected, 56-42, 18 votes shy of the 60 needed for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republicans who voted, even such anti-smoking stalwarts
as John Chafee of Rhode Island and McCain himself, opposed stopping
the debate, treating the matter as a challenge to the Republican
leadership. All the Democratic senators who voted were in favor of
cloture except for two from tobacco states, Wendell Ford of
Kentucky and Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed that the cloture vote had caused senators to
focus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Democrats had become willing to compromise because
``they saw we wouldn't crack on cloture.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had a different explanation. They said Lott's hand had
been forced because he knew he could not keep Republicans who favor
tobacco legislation in line on future votes to cut off debate. New
cloture votes are set for Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ardent opponents of the tobacco legislation,
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Tuesday night that the changes being
made might swing him around. ``This is a step in the right
direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican amendment approved Tuesday night would spend part
of the money raised from higher cigarette prices to beef up federal
efforts to stop drug trafficking and to give vouchers to children
who were victims of drug-related crimes so they could attend
private or parochial schools. The amendment would also prohibit
federal money from being used for needle-exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   After approving the Republican amendment, the Senate rejected,
53-45, a Democratic alternative that would also have put more money
into drug interdiction programs. The Democratic proposal would not
have included vouchers for schoolchildren and would have limited
the moratorium on needle exchanges to one year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that beyond the drug and income-tax issues, only a
few contentious topics remained. One involves the kind of
assistance that would be given to tobacco farmers and to
communities whose economy is dependent on tobacco farming and
cigarette manufacturing.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Nigeria's new military leader said
Tuesday he would turn over power to an elected civilian government
by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the new head of state, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, also
hinted Tuesday that they were were preparing to release some of the
country's vast pool of political prisoners as a gesture of
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's is the same timetable previously announced by Gen.
Sani Abacha, the dictator who died Monday. But Abacha was the sole
candidate for president in August elections, and the new leadership
did not make clear whether that date was firm and whether it would
allow genuine opposition candidates to run.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian opposition groups Tuesday stepped up the pressure on
the new government, renewing calls for a large pro-democracy
demonstration on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar's brief speech Tuesday night left unresolved crucial
questions about Nigeria's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar pleaded for ``constructive engagement'' and not
isolation from the international community, and urged exiles to
adopt a spirit of national reconciliation, saying: ``We remain
fully committed to the social-political transition program of Gen.
Sani Abacha's administration. We will do everything to ensure its
full and successful implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a senior military spokesman explained that
this commitment meant ``abiding by the Oct. 1 handover date'' set
by Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats and Nigerian political analysts said the
announcement appeared to be the first strong indication that top
officers who want the army to loosen its direct political control
are gaining power after Abacha's death.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar appears to belong to that faction. Among the group of
potential successors to Abacha, he is known to have chafed at the
Nigerian army's corruption and political maneuvering to keep power.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and Nigerian military analysts note that other
generals until recently pointed to the Indonesian dictatorship of
former President Suharto as a political model for Nigeria, Africa's
most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's large opposition is giving little credit to the
military after more than a decade of hearing government promises of
democracy that went unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this announcement will change anything,'' said
Asaze Lanrwe Chunwa, an official with the Civil Liberties
Organization. ``There is still no freedom of expression. The
military wants to pull off a highly regimented transition. And even
if we had elections, there would still be the unresolved question
of June 12.''
</P>
<P>
   June 12 is the date of the 1993 elections, Nigeria's most
democratic ever, in which businessman Moshood Abiola was widely
believed to be winning convincingly until the military suspended
vote counting, setting the stage for Abacha's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Abiola, who has remained in prison since 1994,
has been a touchstone for the opposition to military rule,
especially in Nigeria's south, where he is from. Friday is the
fourth anniversary of the canceled election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether Abubakar, a self-conscious professional who has avoided
overtly political roles such as state governorships and ministerial
appointments, can muster the political savvy and support needed to
pull off a credible election is only one of the challenges facing
the new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian opposition will be looking for signs that the
military is prepared to let political parties field their own
candidates and campaign free of manipulation by the army.
</P>
<P>
   One of these signs would be the release of Abiola, along with
the former President Olusegun Obasanjo, the only general in the
country's history to surrender power to an elected government.
Doing so would win praises from the international community, but
the enthusiasm unleashed in Nigeria could snowball into a popular
movement against the military that would be difficult to contain.
</P>
<P>
   The new leader served as the military commander in northern city
of Kano, and as chief of military intelligence under Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida, whose government ended in 1993. The two men come from
the same northern town of Minna and used to be neighbors. But
Abubakar was not known to have much influence in Abacha's inner
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha did assign him two difficult tasks: to announce a coup
that critics say was really a pretext to arrest Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   In the military, those who have urged that the generals end
their direct involvement in politics include Maj. Gen. Ishaiya
Bamayi, the new defense chief of staff who is an ally of Abubakar,
and Babangida, one of Abacha's predecessors as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five years of carefully kept silence under Abacha,
Babangida began making statements a couple of weeks ago that were
unambiguous signals about the need to bring military rule in
Nigeria to an end,'' said one Western diplomat with longtime
experience in the country. ``These seemed very unusual at the time,
but in retrospect, it seems that they may have expressed a powerful
tide that was already moving against Abacha, and aimed to sweep him
away, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still dissidents are wary about Babangida's association with
Abubakar. Babangida is nicknamed Maradona, after the Argentine
soccer star, for his deft improvisation as he repeatedly broke
transition promises.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, even many of the Nigerians who are prepared to give
Abubakar some benefit of the doubt are asking themselves whether he
could ever muster the strength to organize a transition that makes
a clean break with the military-dominated rule of the past?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not known for the forcefulness of his character, and he
has no real constituency among the security forces,'' said one
senior Nigerian officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``There are several men who rose up as confidants of Abacha who
have much more direct links to the troops or who know how Abacha
amassed his fortune and presumably now want their chance to do the
same, and how he manages to out-maneuver them is far from clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha had allowed five political parties to operate but
carefully vetted their candidates all the way down to local
elective offices. And as the Aug. 1 date for the vote approached,
with a planned Oct. 1 handover, his military coerced each of the
parties, included two that briefly resisted, into adopting the
president as the sole candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, an official military spokesman spoke of ``some problems
in the dates for the presidential election,'' seemingly overlooking
the fact that the only approved presidential candidate, Abacha, had
just died. &QL;

AGOSTINO CASAROLI, 83, LED VATICAN TO DETENTE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, second-in-command to Pope
John Paul II during the most active and turbulent times of his
papacy and the architect of reconciliation with the communist
world, died Tuesday in Rome. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was of an infection after minor surgery,
according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
</P>
<P>
   The highpoint of Casaroli's career came in 1989, a year before
his retirement, when he helped arrange the historic meeting between
the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II at the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in a condolence message, the pope described the
cardinal as ``an impassioned weaver of peaceful relations between
individuals and nations, carrying out courageous and meaningful
steps with fine diplomatic sensitivity _ in particular to improve
the situation of the church in Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he was appointed secretary of state in April 1979,
Casaroli's efforts to restore diplomatic ties with the Soviet bloc
had earned him the sobriquet ``the pope's Henry Kissinger.'' In the
1960s and '70s he was the principal architect of the Vatican's
policy of cautious reconciliation with communist governments, which
began under Pope John XXIII and which sought to improve conditions
for the Catholic clergy behind the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, as an archbishop, he was the first Vatican official to
visit the Soviet Union since 1924. Three years later he was the
first to visit Cuba under Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Even earlier, he had brokered an easing of relations between the
church and state in Poland. After one visit there in 1967, the
Polish government agreed to allow the elevation of Karol Wojtyla,
archbishop of Krakow, to cardinal. Karol Wojtyla later became Pope
John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the pope was elected, he appointed Casaroli
secretary of state, a position equivalent to prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a Polish pope was fraught with potential
difficulties, including a worsening of Polish-Russian and
Catholic-Orthodox relations. The pope calculated that Casaroli's
experience in the diplomacy of detente could ease those tensions,
and soon after his appointment Casaroli met with the Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was on his way to New York to receive an honorary
doctorate from St. John's University when the pope was shot in
1981. Two hours after his plane landed, Casaroli boarded a return
flight to Rome, telling reporters, ``My duty is to be with the Holy
Father.'' He ran the Vatican while the pope recuperated.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning of their relationship, the pope, a fierce
anti-Communist, did not always agreed with his more cautious
deputy, preferring a more uncompromising stance. But those
differences were soon smoothed out and the two men worked closely
to help sustain the driving force, especially in Poland, behind the
democratic changes that swept one Eastern-bloc country after
another in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Agostino Casaroli was born in Castel San Giovanni, in Piacenza,
in northern Italy, on Nov. 24, 1914. The son of a tailor, he had an
uncle who was a bishop and another who was a rector of a seminary,
and he began studying for the priesthood at 16. He was ordained in
1937 and entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome the
same year.
</P>
<P>
   Affable and courtly, but reserved, Casaroli joined the office of
the secretary of state as an archivist in 1940, during the reign of
Pope Pius XII. He taught protocol and ``diplomatic style'' at the
Pontifical Academy from 1956 to 1961, the year he was recruited by
Pope John XXIII to serve as an undersecretary in the Department of
Extraordinary Affairs, where he dealt with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   It was as a protege of the next pontiff, Pope Paul VI, who was
elected in 1963, that Casaroli's policy of closer ties began paying
off in Eastern Europe. He made frequent fact-finding trips to
Soviet-controlled countries, often traveling incognito in civilian
clothes. In 1964, he signed a partial accord between the Vatican
and Hungary, the first such agreement of the Cold War, and
negotiated the restoration of full relations with Yugoslavia in
1970. He often cited a remark of John XXIII: ``There are enemies of
the church, but the church has no enemies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cardinal, who spoke Spanish, French, English, German and
Portuguese, and studied Polish, Russian and Chinese, was tactful in
them all.
</P>
<P>
   His diplomatic finesse was put to good use in 1972, when Juan
Peron, the former Argentine dictator, who was on his way back to
Buenos Aires, stopped in Rome to seek an audience with the pope.
Even though it was clear that Peron would return to power, the
Vatican wanted to avoid the appearance of giving him its blessing.
Casaroli met with Peron for 90 minutes in his hotel and emerged to
announce, ``Mr. Peron has himself considered it opportune to forgo
seeking an audience with the pontiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Often portrayed as a skillful seeker of compromise, the cardinal
could also hew a tougher line. He was credited with helping to
draft the unstinting language on human rights and religious freedom
in the declaration signed at the 1975 Helsinki Conference on
European Security and Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   He was named a cardinal by John Paul II in June 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Under his tenure as secretary of state, the Vatican's
relationship to the Italian government also changed dramatically.
Cardinal Casaroli signed a concordat in 1984 under which Roman
Catholicism ceased to be the state religion of Italy. But he
insured that the state would still help the Vatican, notably in
maintaining churches and preserving religious art.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Vatican bank, the Institute for Religious Works,
was found to have financial ties to Banco Ambrosiano and became
embroiled in the scandal surrounding Ambrosiano's collapse in 1982,
Casaroli was instrumental in deflecting the disgrace. He directed
the Vatican to negotiate a settlement with Ambrosiano's creditors
worth $244 million. He also supervised the rewriting of Vatican
rules to limit its financial activities at commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal submitted his resignation in 1989 when he turned
75, but the pope asked him to stay on. When he finally left office
in 1990, and was replaced by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the pope
explained that he delayed the retirement because ``I considered
that I could not immediately deprive myself of such a wise and
expert collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral is scheduled for Friday morning in St. Peter's
Basilica.

 &HT;    Supreme Court puts 'hold' on
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Ga. _ The U.S. Supreme Court, just minutes before the
scheduled 7 p.m. execution of David Cargill on Tuesday night, asked
state officials to ``hold'' _ but did not issue a stay _ to delay
the execution of the convicted double murderer.
</P>
<P>
   The day was marked by a series of court challenges and pleas for
mercy from the state Board of Pardons and Paroles and Butts, (Ga.)
County Superior Court Judge Arch McGarity. But no one who could
stop the execution for the 1985 murders agreed with Cargill's
attorneys and his family, who argued that the 39-year-old man no
longer deserved to die.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill and his younger brother, Tommy, both of Phenix City,
Ala., were convicted of a winter night armed robbery of the Premium
Oil Station in Columbus, Ga. and the execution-style slaying of
Cheryl and Danny Williams, which orphaned four boys ages 2 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses worked days at a now-closed textile mill near
Columbus. Cheryl Williams worked at the service station to earn
extra money for the family. Her husband often stopped by to help
her close.
</P>
<P>
   During the robbery, $482.79 was taken.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was forced to lie face down on the floor of the
service station. Each was shot twice in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill's death sentence was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, 26 at the time, was sentenced to death for shooting the
two parents in the back of the head while his brother, then 21, was
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Cargill was in a cell at Smith State Prison at Glenville,
Ga. as his brother prepared to go to the electric chair at the
Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison.
</P>
<P>
   David Cargill spent the day with his aging, ailing mother, a
sister, a niece and a chaplain. After they left at 3:30 p.m.,
Cargill had his last meal of steak, baked potato, salad and vanilla
ice cream. Then his head and a leg were shaved to prepare for the
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill was to be the 23rd man to be executed in Georgia since
1983. But unlike his predecessors, the day he was scheduled to die
came with virtually no notice from the world outside the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the boys who were orphaned _ three of them now adults
and one 15 _ made a fuss, unlike the surviviors of murder victims
in previous executions.
</P>
<P>
   There were no television trucks parked outside the Georgia
Diagnostic and Classification Prison equipped for live reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight death penalty opponents and a half dozen supporters
of executions gathered for the moment Cargill, 39, was scheduled to
sit in the state's electric chair.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A black man was recently dragged to his death from the
back of a pickup truck in a rural section of Texas known for racist
and Klan activity, and on Tuesday three white men were charged with
the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The broken body of James Byrd Jr., 49, was discovered on Sunday
morning by residents of an area just outside the East Texas town of
Jasper, population 8,000. As he walked home from his parents' house
Saturday night, Byrd was apparently picked up by the men sometime
after midnight and taken to a wooded area, where he was beaten,
then chained to the truck and dragged for two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray called the
killing ``probably the most brutal I've ever seen'' in 20 years as
a prosecutor. Byrd's torso was found at the edge of a paved road,
his head and an arm in a ditch about a mile away, according to an
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Police charged Shawn Berry, 23, Lawrence Brewer, 31, and John
King, 23, with murder. According to the district attorney, Brewer
and King had racist tattoos and were Ku Klux Klan supporters,
leading investigators to believe the killing was racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were apparently roommates in a Jasper apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Mayor R.C. Horn said the victim came from a ``beautiful
family.'' Byrd's sisters said he had been on disability and did not
have a car but often accepted rides from acquaintances or walked
around Jasper, where the number of blacks almost equals that of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said there have been no unusual racial problems in the
town, built on the timber industry. ``Jasper is a city that has a
strong bind together, both black and white,'' said Horn, who is
black.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Bledsoe, president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the eastern
part of Texas, which includes Jasper, has been considered a problem
area and a hotbed of Klan activity for years.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to problems in 1993 integrating a housing project in
nearby Vidor, for decades an all-white town, where an avowed white
supremacist threatened the first black residents, and teen-agers
dressed in sheets confronted black newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe called for adding kidnapping charges, making the killing
a capital crime. He said that he planned to go to Jasper to help
authorities with the investigation and that the NAACP wanted to
help organize a community response, such as a march or rally.
</P>
<P>
   Horn said local church leaders were planning a prayer meeting at
the courthouse square for this Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police affidavit, items left in the woods and
along the dirt logging road where Byrd was first dragged led the
authorities to the suspects. One item was a cigarette lighter
inscribed with a Klan symbol that police said they believed
belonged to a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Berry told police he had been riding around with the other
suspects when he saw Byrd walking and offered him a ride, according
to the affidavit. Byrd and Berry might have known each other
because they had the same parole officer, according to The
Associated Press. Byrd served six years in prison for theft and
violating parole. All three suspects have criminal records for
offenses from burglary to drug possession and served jail time
together.
</P>
<P>
   After Byrd was picked up, King became upset and began cursing,
Berry is quoted as saying in the affidavit. The men stopped at a
convenience store, and then King drove to the dirt road, saying he
was about to scare Byrd. The other suspects began to beat the
victim, Berry told police.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI may seek to charge the suspects with violating the
victim's civil rights, said Al Tribble, an FBI special agent in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The national NAACP is also watching the case, said Jean
Hitchcock, acting chief operating officer for the organization.
``We call upon all Americans to stand up and be counted and to
condemn this for the heinous crime that it is.''

NBC BUYING A PORTAL TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Venturing into the most competitive area of the
Internet, NBC said on Tuesday that it had agreed to buy a
controlling stake in Snap, an upstart search and directory service
from its creator, Cnet Inc. The television network said it was also
buying a 4.9 percent stake in Cnet itself.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, a unit of the General Electric Co., is endorsing the view
that Internet directory companies, or search engines, like Yahoo
and Excite, are emerging as the cornerstones of profitable on-line
ventures. Such portals, as the directory sites have come to be
called, have started charging large fees from World Wide Web sites
to which they direct Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, portal sites, taking a page from the success of
America Online, are beginning to offer their own versions of
services like electronic mail and chat rooms as a way of engaging
users of Web pages on which the portals sell advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could total $39 million by the time it is
completed, represents the first time a broadcast network has
entered the Internet portal market, although all the networks have
built or acquired various sites that offer content like news,
sports or entertainment. NBC, for example, is already a co-owner
with the Microsoft Corp. of the MSNBC network, which is available
on both cable and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a range of companies, including the Netscape
Communications Corp. and Microsoft, are building their own portal
services. And big companies including Walt Disney and Time Warner
have been exploring buying part or all of the various directory
services.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of these are Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos and
Alta Vista, a Digital Equipment Corp. unit _ each of which is among
the most frequented sites on the Web. Yahoo is consistently the
Internet's most popular site, according to Relevant Knowledge, a
company that measures Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media companies now realize that the Internet is important and
that they have to be there,'' said Brian Oakes, an analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   For Cnet, the deal vindicates its decision to build Snap, which
has been widely criticized by investors. Cnet's first business,
television programs and Internet sites about computers, has been
the most successful original programming on the Internet. But many
saw Snap, which ultimately cost the company $25 million to build,
as an expensive distraction that was far too late to catch up with
the likes of Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet's stock has floundered over the last year, rising only 15
percent through Monday, a period in which Yahoo's stock quintupled.
But on Tuesday, Cnet's shares surged nearly 37 percent to close at
$45.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has saved Cnet's bacon,'' said David Simons, managing
director of Digital Video Investments, a research firm. ``Snap was
not gaining the sponsorship or the franchise it had anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC said it was not deterred by Snap's low ratings. ``Snap is a
first-class service that is ready to handle millions of users,''
Robert Wright, the president of NBC, said at a news conference.
``It is not as well known as it could be, and our job is to make it
more well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NBC's strategy appears to have been to buy the least
successful of the portal sites and build it through constant
promotion on the television network. The aim is to build Snap's
name recognition among the 80 percent of U.S. residents who are not
yet using the Internet, so that when they venture into cyberspace
it will already be familiar to them.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has agreed to pay $5.9 million for 19.9 percent of Snap and
has a three-year option to buy a further 40.1 percent of the
service for $32 million. The rest of Snap will be owned by Cnet.
From the start, a majority of Snap's board will be NBC executives,
although Halsey Minor, Cnet's chief executive, will stay on in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Cnet has purchased 4.99 percent of Cnet's stock for
$26 million, or $32 a share.
</P>
<P>
   To turn a $25 million investment into a company valued at $60
million would be a good return in any other industry, but it is
hardly the magic multiplication that many Internet companies have
come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the most positive aspect of the deal for Cnet
was that it would no longer be responsible for Snap's continuing
losses, which have been running at $1.2 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most important moment in the life of an Internet
company is when it starts to make money, said Keith Benjamin, an
analyst with BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, long a fan of Cnet's
stock. ``This will let them turn a profit in the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, the deal offers a relatively inexpensive way to enter
the Internet portal business. The publicly owned search companies
range in value from $850 million for Infoseek to $5.5 billion for
Yahoo. Of course, all those companies have far greater audiences
than Snap does. But that was integral to NBC's bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the enormous valuations these other companies have, it's
hard to structure a deal,'' said Tom Rogers, president of NBC's
cable and Internet group. ``Snap didn't have all the traffic yet
that creates the valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   While NBC expects to build Snap's audience through extensive
promotion on its television programs, network executives declined
to specify the amount of air time they would give such promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will miss the fact, regardless of what day part you
look at, that there's something out there called Snap as a key
starting point to the Internet,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they had not decided whether to use the NBC
brand name on the Snap service.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives said that the company's goal was to run Snap as a
stand-alone business, not to use it mainly to promote its other
television and Internet programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The venture will be kept at arm's length from MSNBC, which
network executives said would probably provide news to both Snap
and Microsoft's new portal service, Start. Meanwhile, Snap will be
free to draw content both from other NBC affiliates and other
competing sources of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Cnet will continue to produce programs for the USA
and Sci-Fi cable networks, although it may explore television
ventures with NBC in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, NBC and Snap executives said they would consider
selling part of Snap to the public in a stock offering. Having
publicly traded shares, at the high prices Internet companies now
fetch, would make it easier for Snap to acquire related Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   News of NBC's acquisition helped buoy the stock on Tuesday of
most other Internet portal companies, which have lagged in recent
weeks. Yahoo's shares, for example, jumped $8.50 to close at
$117.875.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argued that NBC's deep pockets and vast reach
could turn Snap into a potent competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have the infinite-sum, unlimited-possibility
syndrome,'' said Simons of Digital Video Investments. ``What they
miss is that the promotion costs for everyone will go up. This is
the beginning of the great Internet marketing wars.''
</P>
<P>
   While such pressure may press the portal companies and other big
media corporations to explore more such deals, analysts said they
might be frightened off by the market valuation of the top portals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snap was the safest play for a traditional company because it
is the weakest player,'' said Mr. Oakes of Lehman. ``The other
companies may not be bought until one of them stumbles,'' he said.

FINANCIER DONATES $1 MILLION FOR VIAGRA FOR THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alan Greenberg bettered his own life by becoming rich
on Wall Street, and Tuesday he gave away $1 million of that money
to better the lives of other aging men in a very specific way: He
will pay for Viagra prescriptions for people who cannot afford
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I'm kind of into basics,'' said
Greenberg, 70, the chairman of Bear, Stearns Cos., who received a
$20 million bonus last year. ``And I think it's something that will
give a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan,
which will oversee Greenberg's gift, seemed dizzily baffled by the
unsolicited donation, as were other health and philanthropic
officials. They said they had rarely heard of gifts aimed at
dispensing medicine for a specific illness, and never for the
much-discussed impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with Greenberg, an aggressive financier and
philanthropist who cultivates an air of unconventionality, might
not be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   He once had a cameo in a Hollywood movie involving medical
students and cows. He once posted a memo saying that envelopes for
in-house mail could be reused several times if the sender only
partly licked the flaps. Several years ago, he donated money to the
Israel Museum in Jerusalem to replace their bathrooms, and
commemorated the gift by installing a plaque there in honor of his
brother, Maynard, who is retired and lives in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people came back and said, `We couldn't figure out if you
liked your brother or hated him,''' Greenberg said. ``I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said he decided on the gift only several days ago
after reading articles about how some insurance companies and state
health programs are denying Viagra or limiting treatment because of
the cost, about $8 to $10 a pill. Both he and John Ahearn, co-chief
executive at the Hospital for Special Surgery, said they had not
yet determined how to give away the pills, except that it would be
for older men under medical treatment for impotence who could not
afford Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Ahearn said the hospital still had to work out the details of
the $1 million endowment, and that the pills could be dispensed
through urologists or centers for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking with some physicians, they are obviously sympathetic
to it,'' he said. ``They have said this is an area where there is a
need here and it is underserved and no one has paid attention to
it. It is really a compassionate thing for someone to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he decided to start such a foundation, Greenberg
responded with a few jokes: ``I own stock in Pfizer,'' he said,
referring to the drug's manufacturer. ``So it's not altruistic. You
can quote me on that.'' He added, ``If you ask me how long I've
been interested in the subject, I guess you can say I've been
interested in it since I was 13 or 14.''
</P>
<P>
   On the indelicate question of whether he used Viagra himself, he
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not answering that,'' he said.

JAVITS CENTER EXPANSION PLAN CLASHES WITH STADIUM PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State officials are scrambling to salvage a $750
million plan to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the
West Side of Manhattan, which has collided with the Giuliani
administration's proposal to build a stadium for the New York
Yankees and a developer's efforts to erect a sprawling apartment
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The state, which controls the Javits Center, had hoped to double
the center's exhibition space to 1.5 million square feet by
extending the convention hall from 38th Street to 42nd Street, a
plan that officials and hoteliers said would let New York compete
with other cities for tens of millions of dollars in convention
business and anchor the western end of a rejuvenated Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But discussions between executives at the convention center and
the developer, Larry Silverstein, who owns a key parcel of land
needed for the expansion project, collapsed recently when the
Giuliani administration failed to support the state's plans. Any
state project north of the convention center would require city
assistance to close streets and redirect traffic.

   Real estate executives and state officials say Silverstein
concluded that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would not approve expansion
plans that did not include a baseball stadium just south of the
Javits Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing happening with the expansion of the convention
center on 42nd Street,'' Silverstein said. ``So we're going forward
with our project. To sit and wait makes no sense at all. I couldn't
afford to delay this any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives and state officials said the Javits
expansion was only the latest example of how the debate over a
future home for the Yankees was overshadowing everything from the
city budget to a new location for the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
   Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New
York University, said he was surprised that the mayor had been
concentrating so heavily on the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are sucking up all the oxygen at City Hall,'' Moss
said. ``It's shocking to think that a baseball stadium is more
important than a convention center or stock exchange. New York's
future lies in tourism, finance, communications and entertainment,
not in professional baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has revived a plan to build a billion-dollar stadium on
the West Side of Manhattan that he said would prevent the Yankees
from leaving New York and generate $1 billion a year in economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has commissioned several studies and recently
set up a delegation of nine officials to visit new ball parks in
other cities to assess their economic impact. On May 28, the group
led by Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, and
Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corp.,
visited Baltimore and Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that says something when folks come out of New York to
see how others do it,'' said Charles Graves, the director of city
planning in Baltimore, who met with the delegation. ``We talked
about design, siting, political and economic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wait for the Javits expansion, Silverstein plans to
build two residential towers with 1,800 apartments on the block
along 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues. The apartment
complex would form an insurmountable roadblock to what state
officials said was the best route for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, state officials were urging Silverstein to
reconsider. At the same time, the officials are reluctant to press
the mayor because they want to avoid an open battle with him during
Gov. George Pataki's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years have proven how vital the Javits Center
can be to New York,'' said convention center chairman Robert Boyle.
``We intend to build on that record. But in light of Silverstein's
plans, we would have to consider less desirable options for
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives and state officials say privately that
the problems with the Javits expansion are the latest example of
the Giuliani administration's almost single-minded effort to
resolve the future of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the mayor vetoed nearly $5 million from the budget that
the City Council had allocated for itself, surprising Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, who is in a dispute with the mayor over the
stadium.

HOUSE SET TO VOTE ON MAJOR OVERHAUL OF BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass., Conn., Fla., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House is preparing to vote Wednesday on the
first major overhaul of the bankruptcy system in two decades,
legislation that could allow the credit and banking industries to
reap billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time when credit-card lending is among the most
profitable sectors of an intensely competitive banking industry
that has little room for growth, the legislation has prompted the
credit card and banking businesses to spend millions of dollars to
push the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of the measure, sponsored in the House by Rep. George
Gekas, R-Pa., is that thousands of people are shucking their
responsibilities, driving up their debts and then declaring
themselves insolvent under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which
forgives most debts. The legislation would make it more difficult
for consumers to use Chapter 7 while giving banks, credit card
companies, department stores and other lenders more authority to
recoup what they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   The industry estimates that of the 1.37 million people who filed
for bankruptcy last year, between 15 percent and 25 percent had the
means to pay their debts. It says that the debts of these dishonest
people are passed on to consumers in higher prices and higher
interest rates that cost every American household about $400 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry estimates that by reducing the number of people who
file under Chapter 7 and putting others on a more rigorous
repayment schedule, it could recoup $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in Congress and consumer advocates have
criticized the bill as a billion-dollar bouquet to the credit-card
industry. They say that while companies complain about people not
paying their debts, they also send out more than 2 billion
``pre-approved'' credit-card solicitations _ 12 for each person in
America annually. Critics say this can tempt vulnerable people to
borrow more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could easily see a billion a year in windfall profits
from this legislation,'' Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard
Law School and strong critic of the bill, said of the credit-card
industry. ``They will do it by squeezing hard-pressed families out
of the bankruptcy system and continuing to collect from them $50
here and $50 there.'' She said that could add up to billions.
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate is to take up a more lenient version of the bill
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions would apply only to those people filing for
bankruptcy whose incomes are above the national median of $50,000 a
year for a family of four. Those earning less could still file
under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy law, which eliminates all debts,
or under Chapter 13, which allows a judge to set a repayment
scheudle.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, debtors who are deemed able to repay 20
pecent of their debt over five years would not be allowed to file
under Chapter 7. The Senate version gives the bankruptcy judge more
leeway in setting a repayment plan.
</P>
<P>
   If committee votes are any indication, both the House and Senate
will pass their versions of the bill, and will have to reconcile
them later.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said that it opposes the House
bill in its present form. In a May 21 letter to Congress, Jacob
Lew, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget,
objected to a provision that would impose what he described as ``a
rigid and arbitrary'' income test to determine who could file for
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
have also expressed concern that the legislation would force
debtors to pay back credit card companies before making alimony and
child-support payments.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill is a clear priority for the industry. Last year
alone, more than 100 financial-services companies spent more than
$40 million to push this bill and other banking legislation through
Congress, according to lobbying-disclosure records. Much of that
money rained down on Washington's K Street corridor of professional
lobbying firms. The records do not include the undoubtedly higher
amounts spent so far this year, when scores of lawyers and industry
lobbyists swarmed over the House and Senate Judiciary Committees as
they gaveled the 177-page bankruptcy bill to approval.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy issue has been cooking along behind the scenes on
Capitol Hill for a couple of years. But even as it has drawn closer
to the floor, it has been overshadowed by tobacco legislation and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., described the bankruptcy bill as
``a freight train going 90 miles an hour.'' Referrring to the
hordes of financial-services lobbyists who have been packing the
Capitol corridors, Dodd added: ``It's hard to find someone on K
Street who hasn't been called in to work on this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually anyone who is owed money has spent money lobbying for
the bill. Included are department stores like J.C. Penney, which
spent $500,000 on banking legislation last year, and Sears Roebuck,
which spent $240,000, according to records on file with Congress.
The International Council of Shopping Centers devoted $360,000. The
reports for the first six months of 1998 are not due until August.
</P>
<P>
   Especially eager to see this legislation are the credit card
companies and other money lenders. Visa spent $1.3 million last
year on lobbying, according to records, and MasterCard
International spent $390,000. The Money Store, a financial services
company based in Union, N.J., with a loan portfolio of $10 billion,
spent $1.2 million on lobbying last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many interested parties turned to experienced K Street lobbyists
to push the issue. The American Financial Services Association, the
main trade group that provides credit to consumers, paid $600,000
to the firm of Barbour Griffith &AMP; Rogers. Haley Barbour, the former
chairman of the Republican National Committee, is a senior partner
in the firm. The association also helped organize fund-raisers for
Reps. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., and Bill Jenkins, R-Tenn., who
co-sponsored the legislation.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the industry has boosted its campaign contributions
to members of both houses of Congress who are playing key roles.
Under the banner of the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition, the
industry has given $1.6 million to House and Senate candidates so
far in the 1997-98 election cycle, according to an analysis by the
Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Markell, a bankruptcy specialist at Indiana University Law
School, said the bill was such a priority for lenders because
credit cards were so profitable. Three-fourths of all households
have at least one credit card, and three-fourths of those carry
debt from month to month at 18 percent. The prime audience for
credit cards, he said, is women between 25 and 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make money on being able to target those people who incur
debt and can barely pay it off,'' Markell said, noting the
widespread opportunities to use credit cards these days to buy
everything from gas to food. At the end of 1997, Americans owed
$422 billion in credit-card loans, twice as much as at the end of
1993.

   BLUE-CHIP RALLY FADES, BUT INTERNET SHARES GAIN
</P>
<P>
   A three-day rally in blue-chip stocks lost stamina, leaving
major market gauges mixed. The stumble illustrated some renewed
concerns about the corporate earnings outlook and the prospect for
interest rate changes ahead of congressional testimony Wednesday by
Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
19.68 points, to 9,049.92. But sharp gains among some
Internet-related shares pushed technology stocks higher, and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 12.99 points, to 1,800.76, its fourth
straight gain and first close above 1,800 since May 22. Drug and
transportation shares also gained. Treasury prices were little
changed, as investors awaited Wednesday's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING TO CUT 747 PRODUCTION
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it would cut production of 747 aircraft in 1999,
because of slow growth in Asia. The company also said it would
reduce more jobs than the 12,000 previously announced beginning in
mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
   LENDERS BACK BANKRUPTCY OVERHAUL
</P>
<P>
   The credit card and banking businesses are spending millions of
dollars to push for the first big overhaul of the bankruptcy system
in two decades. The House is preparing to vote Wednesday on the
bill, which would make it tougher for consumers to escape their
debts. Lenders could recoup some $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   KEY COURT TEST: HERB OR DRUG?
</P>
<P>
   A case to be heard in Federal court in Salt Lake City next
Monday is being closely watched as a pivotal battle between the
Food and Drug Administration and the wildly growing dietary
supplement industry. At issue is Chinese red yeast sold here by
Pharmanex under the name Cholestin to lower cholesterol. The FDA
calls it an unapproved drug.
</P>
<P>
   MERGER FORMS OPTIONS RIVAL
</P>
<P>
   The American and Philadelphia stock exchanges agreed to merge,
creating a powerful options trading rival to the dominant Chicago
Board Options Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-SMOKING IMPASSE MAY END
</P>
<P>
   The first signs developed that the impasse in the Senate on
anti-smoking legislation might be broken, as The Senate voted,
52-46, for a Republican amendment to use some of the money raised
from higher cigarette prices on drug abuse programs.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED SOUGHT IN MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge said that he would limit to six to 12 each the
number of witnesses either Microsoft or the government may call
during the September trial of the antitrust suits filed by the
Justice Department and 20 states. The goal is to avert a lengthy
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   COURT ALLOWS KEATING NEW TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   Charles Keating, the former savings and loan executive who
became a symbol of the 1980's savings and loan scandals after the
$3.4 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings, is entitled to a new
trial on Federal securities charges because jurors improperly
learned of state convictions on similar charges, an appeals court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY'S UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS
</P>
<P>
   The number of unemployed workers in Germany fell by 223,400 in
May, sending the jobless rate down one-tenth of a point, to 11.2
percent. That and last week's report of strong economic growth are
expected to help Chancellor Helmut Kohl's struggling campaign for
re-election in September.
</P>
<P>
   OXFORD NAMES FISCAL CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Oxford Health Plans named Yon Yoon Jorden as chief
financial officer. She is now the chief financial officer at an
energy joint venture and was previously the fiscal head of
Wellpoint Health Networks.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN STATISTICIANS ARRESTED
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government arrested the head of the State Committee
for Statistics, Yuri Yurkov, and his top deputies and accused them
of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes. The
arrests bring into question how the government measures economic
performance.

 10 &HT;    Modest donations fuel Gingrich PAC
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When political pros talk about Speaker Newt
Gingrich as a possible presidential candidate, they often cite his
ability to raise money _ lots of it and in small contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's political action committee, which he uses to help
other GOP congressional candidates and fund his own political
operation, is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the latest month for which figures are available, the
Monday Morning PAC raised $125,000, of which $96,000, or more than
three quarters of the total, came in small donations.
</P>
<P>
   That unusually high percentage of contributions of under $200
comes from the PAC's aggressive use of direct mail solicitations,
said Mike Shields, Gingrich's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's political aides have employed the same strategy for
his own campaign fund-raising committee. Since January 1997,
Friends of Newt Gingrich has received $3.8 million in
contributions. Individuals contributed $2.5 million, two-thirds of
the total, in donations of less than $200, according to an analysis
of Gingrich's contributions by the nonprofit Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 threshold is significant because campaigns must report
the name of their contributors, addresses and amounts of larger
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the center's executive director, said smaller
contributions, which are not itemized, are often ``cleaner''
because they do not have the taint of special interest money.
``That's money that usually is coming from an individual who likes
what you have to say'' without any expectation of access or
influence, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is one of the more aggressive users of direct mailings
in Congress, and has the added advantage of a national travel
schedule to attract contributors. Another top House Republican,
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, also has a large percentage of
small givers. Of the $1.5 million he has raised since January 1997,
$800,000, or more than half, came in contributions of less than
$200, according to the center's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
reported that just $300,000 of the $3.1 million he has raised in
the past 18 months was in sums of less than $200.

 10 &HT;    Senate action on tobacco bill could come to quick conclusion
 &HT;    By Larry Lipman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The procedural logjam that threatened passage of a
comprehensive tobacco bill appeared to break late Tuesday, raising
the possibility of final Senate action as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation _ which would boost cigarette prices $1.10 a
pack, raise $516 billion over 25 years and supersede settlements
made between some states and cigarette makers _ still faces an
uncertain future in the House, which has been waiting for Senate
action before taking up the contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Senate voted 52-46 along party lines for an
amendment by Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) to earmark $16 billion
over the next five years to boost the nation's drug interdiction
efforts, register convicted drug dealers, restrict federally backed
loans for students convicted of drug possession and ban federal
financing of needle exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money would double the drug interdiction budget for the
Coast Guard, Customs Service, and Defense Department, and provide
$10 million a year in grants to states that institute voluntary
drug testing for teen drivers license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote today on a Republican proposal to
use a portion of the tobacco tax revenues to enable reduction of
the ``marriage penalty'' _ higher income taxes paid by many couples
because they file joint rather than individual returns _ as well as
help the self-employed pay for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The original proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) would have
earmarked $52 billion in tax reductions over five years. Late
Tuesday that amount appeared to have been scaled back to $16
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Movement on the drug amendment and the marriage tax amendment
appeared to breathe new life into the tobacco measure, which Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) had threatened to pull earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of the death of this legislation are premature,'' said
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the bill's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton also sounded optimistic
about the tobacco bill's fate, telling reporters, ``There are still
problems, to be sure, but we're getting closer to, I think, a
principled compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked by phone with Senate leaders of both parties
during the day and dispatched top aides to participate in
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders signaled they were ready to accept the proposals as
part of the cost of clearing a major anti-teen-smoking measure.

AMERICAN AND PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGES AGREE TO MERGE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange
agreed to a merger late on Tuesday that would create an options
trading powerhouse to rival the giant Chicago Board Options
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the American Exchange, Richard Syron; the
chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Frank
Zarb, and the acting chief of the Philadelphia exchange, John
Wallace, announced the deal after the market closed. Terms were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The merger must be approved by two-thirds of the seat holders on
both exchanges and by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a merger began to take shape over the last few
months in conjunction with the pending merger of the NASD, the
parent of the Nasdaq stock market, and the American Exchange. A
combined American and Philadelphia exchange would trade about 40
percent of all equity options in the nation based on volume. Until
now, the Chicago exchange has dominated this lucrative market,
trading about 42 percent of equity options.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending that seat holders accept the deal, the board of
the Philadelphia exchange is rejecting a merger proposal from the
Chicago exchange. The offer from the American Exchange may have had
more appeal because it would keep the Philadelphia trading
operations in place for up to five years. The Chicago exchange's
offer required the Philadelphia options traders to move their
businesses to Chicago within two years. The deal also grants
Philadelphia seat holders 12-year transferable permits to trade
existing Philadelphia products and new securities. The Chicago deal
offered options traders the right to trade in Chicago for a minimum
of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could address some concerns among big brokerage firms
that executions on the Philadelphia exchange were not as fast as
those on other exchanges. Outdated systems contributed to slow
confirmations of trades, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Syron said: ``The power across the entire
American economy is shifting from the producer of goods to the
consumer. This merger confirms that the shape of the industry going
forward will be dictated by investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia exchange was founded in 1790 as the first
organized stock exchange in the nation. It trades options on 800
stocks, 13 indexes and 100 foreign currency contracts, which trade
in pairs. It also executes trades on shares listed on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 505 seats on the Philadelphia exchange, 400 give the
holder the right to trade options. A single exchange seat with
options rights sold for a record $280,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most lucrative part of the Philadelphia exchange's business
is its trading of equity options on the shares of the Dell Computer
Corp. Volume in Dell options make it the second-biggest option
contract traded in the United States, behind the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, management turmoil rocked the Philadelphia exchange
when its longtime chairman, Nicholas Giordano, was ousted and
Wallace took over. Through companies they own, Wallace and members
of his family own 30 seats.

operation, is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the latest month for which figures are available, the
Monday Morning PAC raised $125,000, of which $96,000, or more than
three quarters of the total, came in small donations.
</P>
<P>
   That unusually high percentage of contributions of under $200
comes from the PAC's aggressive use of direct mail solicitations,
said Mike Shields, Gingrich's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's political aides have employed the same strategy for
his own campaign fund-raising committee. Since January 1997,
Friends of Newt Gingrich has received $3.8 million in
contributions. Individuals contributed $2.5 million, two-thirds of
the total, in donations of less than $200, according to an analysis
of Gingrich's contributions by the nonprofit Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 threshold is significant because campaigns must report
the name of their contributors, addresses and amounts of larger
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the center's executive director, said smaller
contributions, which are not itemized, are often ``cleaner''
because they do not have the taint of special interest money.
``That's money that usually is coming from an individual who likes
what you have to say'' without any expectation of access or
influence, Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is one of the more aggressive users of direct mailings
in Congress, and has the added advantage of a national travel
schedule to attract contributors. Another top House Republican,
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, also has a large percentage of
small givers. Of the $1.5 million he has raised since January 1997,
$800,000, or more than half, came in contributions of less than
$200, according to the center's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
reported that just $300,000 of the $3.1 million he has raised in
the past 18 months was in sums of less than $200.

 10 &HT;    Senate action on tobacco bill could come to quick conclusion
 &HT;    By Larry Lipman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The procedural logjam that threatened passage of a
comprehensive tobacco bill appeared to break late Tuesday, raising
the possibility of final Senate action as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation _ which would boost cigarette prices $1.10 a
pack, raise $516 billion over 25 years and supersede settlements
made between some states and cigarette makers _ still faces an
uncertain future in the House, which has been waiting for Senate
action before taking up the contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the Senate voted 52-46 along party lines for an
amendment by Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) to earmark $16 billion
over the next five years to boost the nation's drug interdiction
efforts, register convicted drug dealers, restrict federally backed
loans for students convicted of drug possession and ban federal
financing of needle exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money would double the drug interdiction budget for the
Coast Guard, Customs Service, and Defense Department, and provide
$10 million a year in grants to states that institute voluntary
drug testing for teen drivers license applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote today on a Republican proposal to
use a portion of the tobacco tax revenues to enable reduction of
the ``marriage penalty'' _ higher income taxes paid by many couples
because they file joint rather than individual returns _ as well as
help the self-employed pay for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The original proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) would have
earmarked $52 billion in tax reductions over five years. Late
Tuesday that amount appeared to have been scaled back to $16
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Movement on the drug amendment and the marriage tax amendment
appeared to breathe new life into the tobacco measure, which Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) had threatened to pull earlier
in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of the death of this legislation are premature,'' said
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the bill's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton also sounded optimistic
about the tobacco bill's fate, telling reporters, ``There are still
problems, to be sure, but we're getting closer to, I think, a
principled compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked by phone with Senate leaders of both parties
during the day and dispatched top aides to participate in
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders signaled they were ready to accept the proposals as
part of the cost of clearing a major anti-teen-smoking measure.

COMMENTARY: CASH SQUEEZE MAKES IT HARD TO SAVE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Perez's pulse quickens when the phone rings
inside his storefront office at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer
Ambulance Corps. The adrenaline rush psyches him up to respond to a
cardiac call or some other code-red emergency. It also fuels his
response to the corps' lingering code green, a lack of funds that
has left these trailblazers having to perform triage on their
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going belly up,'' Perez said. ``Every other call is
someone calling for money. Our copy machine, they want to take it
out of here. Everybody is suing us.''
</P>
<P>
   And not for malpractice. Since Perez and Rocky Robinson founded
the corps 10 years ago, it has helped cut the area's ambulance
response time from half an hour to minutes. Some of its ``vollies''
have gone on to take pre-med courses or advanced training to become
nurses and paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   Cutbacks in state and city financing since the mid-1990s
resulted in the elimination of two emergency medical technician
training programs that took young people off the streets and
welfare recipients off the dole.
</P>
<P>
   The cash crunch has forced the Brooklyn corps to ground three of
its four ambulances because they are too expensive to maintain,
resulting in fewer runs and less income from insurance
reimbursements. Even a city-owned lot where it parks its ambulances
and storage trailer was endangered, since Robinson learned last
month that the property was on a list of sites under review for
possible auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be losing everything,'' Robinson said. ``If we had
the lot, we would have a place we could call our own, even if we
don't have money to insure the ambulances. We could go back to
running to calls on foot like in the beginning. We're not too
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Muldowney, a spokesman for the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services, insisted that it was all a
``misunderstanding'' and that no one intends to sell the lot.
``Somebody got a letter and misunderstood it,'' he said.
``Regardless, they will be taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps avoided eviction by auction a few years ago, when its
supporters lobbied to remove the lot from the list of available
properties. Community advocates said that to consider returning it
to the auction block would typify an outdated land-use policy that
usually mandates that city-owned properties be auctioned, rather
than sold directly to any group. ``There is no program that really
reviews disposition with any rational approach,'' said one borough
official advising the corps. ``It's chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of mayhem on the streets when the corps came
into being 10 years ago. Robinson thinks his group has enough of a
track record saving and changing lives that their efforts should be
recognized as having as much value as any purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, this city was going through a
revolution,'' he said. ``A lot of people don't realize it, but on a
regular basis, we had to hit the ground in our trailer because of
gunfire. In this neighborhood, we went through a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   While corps leaders try to acquire the lot, they have been
cheered by some victories, including $200,000 in state funds to
train people in advanced life support. Offered together with the
Downstate Medical Center, the course would place its graduates on
the way to becoming emergency medical technicians. Stephen Villano,
Downstate's vice president for planning and institutional
advancement, said he hoped that the contract would spur others into
supporting the corps. He was especially concerned about foundations
that make one-shot gifts and some of Brooklyn's successful native
sons who have yet to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a liberal, fuzzy program, but a conservative
program that takes people on welfare and gives them a marketable
skill,'' he said. ``We need to raise the awareness of foundations
that this is a long-term commitment. This is a 24-hour-a-day,
7-days-a-week operation, and one contribution doesn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the corps looks for new ways to raise money.
Last summer, corps members tried running a restaurant in the
trailer they have parked on the lot. It failed. Robinson, on leave
from the city's Fire Department because of an aneurysm, recently
tried to go back on active duty as an emergency medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing doing,'' he lamented. ``My blood pressure is 220 over
150. My aneurysm might pop any day. I'm broke. The corps' broke. If
I don't have money coming in, I can't even help myself.''

HORNACEK AIMS TO UNLEASH (AND HIT) JUMP SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jeff Hornacek has the look of a minivan dad who would
blend into the suburbs if not for an extraordinary shooter's touch.
The Utah Jazz is relying on this accounting major's soft jumper to
help crack the Bulls' defense in Game 4 of the NBA finals Wednesday
night at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hornacek missed his first four shots in the first quarter
of Game 3, he became hesitant, which caused a trickle-down effect.
</P>
<P>
   Not sensing an offensive threat, Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen felt free to roam and create chaos in the second quarter,
and that is when the 96-54 debacle began. While Hornacek was not
taking credit away from the Bulls, he was not cowering in the face
of their defense either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't overadjust to what they did,'' Hornacek said Tuesday.
``You can't change an offense. We looked at the tape and saw the
things that they were doing weren't that big a deal. We just didn't
make shots. I think we overemphasized how they did it. We got the
shots we wanted. We just didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek is a key to keeping the Bulls' defense honest. If the
Bulls disrupt the pick-and-roll, someone is usually open. Often,
that is Hornacek. But thus far in this National Basketball
Association championship series, Hornacek has been unusually
inconsistent, going from a 2-for-10 night in Game 1 to a 7-for-11
effort in Game 2. Part of this unreliability is because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek needed seven stitches after a ladder from his garage
fell on his head just before the series began. Then, in Game 1, he
was seen limping on an injured Achilles' heel. Jordan preyed on him
to a point, but with help on defense, Hornacek has managed to keep
himself in the games.
</P>
<P>
   The longer he lingers on the perimeter, the more dangerous he is
to the Bulls' defensive formula, if he can make his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a lot of it comes down to,'' Hornacek said. ``If
you make them, it puts a different spin on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   HANDLING MALONE IS A CINCH
</P>
<P>
   The player is Dennis Rodman. The subject is basketball, for
once. Rodman has played Karl Malone well in this series, often
irritating and nudging the Jazz superstar away from the post and
out of position. It's a snap, if you ask Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl can't beat me off the dribble, so that's one thing,''
Rodman said. ``He's basically an awkward player. He's just an
average player to me. Once he's inside, he tries to bully you and
get a cheap foul. If the referees let me play, I can play Karl
Malone every day of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S HARD TO STAY MAD AT PIPPEN
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Chicago have chosen to handle Scottie Pippen's
imperfections with amnesia. He has been forgiven by most when he
refused to go into a 1994 game against the Knicks. With 1.8 seconds
to go, Pippen chose to sit and sulk if the ball was not going to be
in his hands for the game-winning shot. Toni Kukoc took the shot
and won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they forget it or not,'' said Pippen, who will
be a free agent July 1. ``I think I've had a great career here.
I've had a great career over all as a basketball player. And I
think I will be remembered here forever. How they remember me, that
just depends on who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   MALONE TAKES IN BATTING PRACTICE
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone spent Monday night escaping the stress of the finals
by watching Mark McGwire take batting practice before the Cardinals
played the White Sox at Comiskey Park. The burly Malone, who tried
out for his high school baseball team only to leave after watching
a pitch zip by his face, was awestruck at McGwire's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can imagine myself hitting one like that,''
said Malone, who watched McGwire belt his 29th homer before heading
back to the hotel. ``Really, the only thing I wanted to see was
batting practice. That was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   CAPTIVE HOME VIEWERS
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 of the finals on NBC produced a 16.2 Nielsen rating, 14
percent above last year, and the second-highest rated Game 3 in
history. Through three games, NBC's 17.0 rating is the highest in
history, 5 percent above the 16.2 for the first three games of the
1993 finals. In Chicago, the game earned a 44.8 rating and a 66
share, while the Salt Lake City market produced a 41.1 rating and a
66 share.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point equals 980,000 television households. Share is
the percentage of televisions in use at a particular time.

SENATE BACKS TAX CUT, DRUG AMENDMENT FOR NEW ANTI-SMOKING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After limping along for weeks, the Senate made
modest progress Tuesday on anti-smoking legislation, as GOP
lawmakers reached agreement on a tax cut and anti-drug provisions
they insist must be part of the overall package.
</P>
<P>
   The drug measure would increase funding for drug fighting
efforts _ $16 billion over five years _ while authorizing the use
of federal funds to pay for school vouchers for students who are
victims of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the drug amendment, 52-46, with all but two
Republicans voting for it and all the Democrats opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GOP leaders announced they had reached agreement on a
tax-cut plan to eliminate the marriage penalty for couples making
under $50,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut would be paid for from revenues generated from
raising cigarette prices by $1.10 a pack. The amendment, sponsored
by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is expected to be voted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of action came as Democrats had expressed growing
impatience with the pace of debate. The Senate is now in its third
week of consideration of a bill that would impose broad federal
regulation of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   They have forced a series of votes this week to prod Republicans
into voting on the complete bill and to halt the offering of
numerous amendments they contend are intended to weaken the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-42 vote Tuesday against ending debate was largely along
party lines, with a handful of tobacco state Democrats joining
Republicans in opposing the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies have to be cheering after that vote,''
said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who with his Democratic
colleagues has grown increasingly pessimistic that the Senate will
agree on anti-tobacco legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
has suggested that the measure may be dead if Democrats continued
to balk at GOP proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's sponsor, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voiced
optimism that the Senate will be able to complete work on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   His position was echoed by President Clinton, who suggested that
Senate leaders were working out differences over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still problems, but we are getting closer,'' said
Clinton during a news conference with Korean President Kim
Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers believed they had made progress paring down the
tax-cut proposal, which initially would have cost $17 billion over
five years and $30 billion over 10 years. The new plan would cost
$16 billion over five years and $30 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, who fear that the Gramm plan would drain money
earmarked for public health programs, plan to offer a more modest
tax cut proposal that includes a health care tax break for the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   The drug amendment offered by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., drew
Democratic criticism largely because it included a school voucher
plan for victims of drug-related violence. The plan calls for use
of federal funds to pay for students to transfer to other public,
parochial, or private schools. Local school officials would
determine who would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Coverdell amendment would also ban taxpayer funding of
needle exchange programs, which are supported by public health
officials as a way of reducing the chances of drug users
contracting the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The drug bill would restrict loans for students convicted of
drug possession and trafficking and give states incentive grants if
they institute voluntary drug testing for teen driver's license
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats offered a scaled-back amendment that would have
placed a one-year moratorium on funding for needle exchange
programs and allow students who are victims of violence to be
transferred to other public schools but not private or parochial
schools. It lost 53-45.

TRIBAL LEADERS SEEK U.S. HELP IN FIGHT OVER GAMBLING IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an intensifying battle against the governor of
California and the gambling industry of Nevada, more than 100
Native American tribal leaders have traveled here this week to try
to halt what they call a threat to their casinos and even their
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The political and legal disputes center on a gambling compact
that Gov. Pete Wilson made with one tribe in March. Other tribes
contend that without trying to negotiate statewide, Wilson has
demanded that they either sign the restrictive, far less profitable
compact or shut down their casinos, which the governor says are
operating illegally.
</P>
<P>
   So far, all but a few of the 38 tribes that operate casinos in
the state have refused to accept either option, and the federal
attorneys there have initiated court proceedings to seize some
14,000 slot machines from those tribes' casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, the former special counsel to President Clinton who
has been enlisted by the tribes, said that the leaders in
Washington want to convince Congress and Attorney General Janet
Reno that Wilson's refusal to negotiate with the Indians unless
they first shut down their casinos is a violation of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in Washington to ask the U.S. government to fulfill its
historic, legal and moral obligation to act as our trustees in
requiring the governor to come to the negotiating table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal leaders say the battle is more than an economic and
political issue, and is one they are willing to fight for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to head off a potential powder keg,'' said Mary
Ann Andreas, tribal chairman of the Morongo Band of Mission
Indians, which operates a casino just outside Palm Springs, and has
refused to accept the governor's terms. The Morongo tribe, like
others, Ms. Andreas said, is fearful not only of losing most of the
economic gains that they have realized from operating casinos for
the past several years, but also of losing some of the sovereign
rights granted them through treaties with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is our survival,'' she said. ``This could mean
devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although states are required to negotiate casino gambling
compacts with tribes under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act _ a
federal law passed in 1988 _ Wilson had refused to do so because he
said that the existing casinos were already operating illegally and
he would only negotiate with them if they first ceased their
operations. Wilson signed what he called a model compact with the
Pala band of Mission Indians, a tribe that has never had casino
gambling on its reservation in northern San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a tribe was permitted to operate illegal gaming until such
time that they entered into a compact with the state, then they
would never have an incentive to conclude a compact negotiation,''
said Dan Kolkey, Wilson's secretary of legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos have proliferated into a statewide industry that now
employs about 15,000 people and earns what some industry experts
believe is more than $500 million in revenues. The Pala compact
stipulates regulations such as mandatory age requirements for
gamblers, and state laws regarding hiring, worker's compensation
and collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   But what the tribes say would cause them to lose about 85
percent of their revenues is the compact's limitation of the type
and total number of slot machines that they can use. With the slot
machines that are currently in use by the tribes, customers receive
predetermined jackpot amounts, and the casino takes a percentage of
everything that goes into the machines _ like the machines used in
places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J. However, California
law only allows for the use of what is known as ``lottery'' style
slot machines, which pays winners based on the machine's proceeds
and divides the jackpot among the players and the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson won the support of the Justice Department, who agreed
with the governor that the tribes were violating federal law by
operating without compacts, and began seeking court approval to
seize machines that don't function in adherence to the Pala
compact.
</P>
<P>
   To hold off the changes being imposed by Wilson, the tribes have
filed a lawsuit in state superior court contending that the
governor lacked the authority to sign the Pala compact because he
did so without prior approval from the state legislature. A hearing
in that case is scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits filed by the U.S. attorneys trying to seize the
machines are also being contested by the tribes. Meanwhile, voters
in the state are being asked to vote on a ballot initiative in
November that would supersede the Pala compact and award the tribes
with a compact allowing them more control over their casinos and
the machines that they use.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative is expected to attract millions of dollars
from both the Indian casinos as well as gambling interests in Las
Vegas, where the Indian casinos are viewed as a threat. Industry
experts estimate that as much as 30 percent of Nevada's casino
customers come from California, and a newly formed group, The
Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which includes Nevada
casino interests, has vowed to defeat the ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians like Governor Wilson are robbing the tribes and
Vegas interests are providing the ammunition,'' said Daniel Tucker,
president of the California Nations Indian Gaming Association.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, where Indians are either seeking compacts or
negotiating the renewal of existing compacts, the standoff in
California is being watched closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening in California, if not stopped, will
establish dangerous precedents, reaching across the nation and far
into the future,'' Mark Macarro, chairman of the Pechanga Band of
Luiseno Indians, said in a hearing that was attended by members of
California's congressional delegation here on Tuesday. The Pechanga
tribe's casino is located in the Central Valley of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's ability to use his political clout, U.S.
attorneys and courts to maneuver the tribes into a no-win position,
with a compact designed to ultimately make tribal government gaming
unprofitable, will become the standard model used by other states,
recalcitrant governors and foes of Indian gaming,'' Macarro
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal leaders have warned that the government's current
hard-line position and its ongoing effort to remove the machines
could lead to an armed standoff or violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have here is the state of California coming in and
cannibalizing tribal soil,'' said Anthony Pico, chairman of the
Viejas band of Kumeyaay Indians, who operate a casino 35 miles east
of San Diego and said he signed the compact under duress. ``We
can't have that. We would die first.''

JUDGE PLANS TO LIMIT WITNESSES IN MICROSOFT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to avert a lengthy proceeding, a federal
judge said on Tuesday that he planned to limit the number of
witnesses the Microsoft Corp. and the government may call during
the September trial for the antitrust suits filed by the Justice
Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting privately with lawyers for both sides just before
a court hearing on Tuesday morning, District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson said: ``It is my expectation to enter an order
limiting the number of witnesses to between 6 and 12 each.''
Further, the judge added, direct testimony should be submitted in
writing in advance and court testimony limited to cross
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If good cause is shown,'' the judge added, he would consider
expanding the number of allowed witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft lawyers nor the government officials objected
to the proposal, because it would bear equally on each side.
Microsoft had suggested that it might call numerous witnesses from
the computer industry, apparently leading Jackson to worry that the
trial, which opens Sept. 8, might stretch through the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to devote the month of September to this
trial,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits charge Microsoft, the world's largest software
company, with leveraging its monopoly in personal-computer
operating systems to win control of other major products in the
software industry, particularly the browsers used to gain access to
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and the government lawyers have noted that they
will have to rush to prepare for trial in just three months. The
judge said he planned to call the two sides back to court for
progress reports through the summer.

HILLTOP CASTLES GUARD PORTUGAL'S PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14.)  
 (JT)  
 By MITCHEL LEVITAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portugal's age of glory is written on water. Its 15th- and
16th-century explorers, trained at King Henry the Navigator's
school at Sagres, carried the flag of the tiny kingdom across
uncharted oceans to places as distant as Mozambique and Macao,
Greenland, Brazil, Australia and India. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the toll of defending a global empire proved too high even
for a superpower. Soon, with squandered wealth spreading decadence
at home, Portugal fell from the pinnacle of greatness with a crash.
By 1578, when King Sabastiao and his nobles were slain in a
reckless war with Morocco, the House of Aviz was near collapse. It
was easy for Spain to invade and conquer its neighbor, a
humiliation that still smolders, despite a war of independence won
by Portugal 330 years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as Lisbon is polished and renewed for Expo '98,
Portugal remains the most reluctant country in Europe when it comes
to embracing modernization. Change is held at arm's length. ``The
future for the Portuguese,'' observe the art historians Hellmut and
Alice Wohl, in their book ``Portugal'' (Scala Books), ``is
`saudade': the longing for a retrieval of past greatness rendered
irretrievable by fear of an unknown, nonexistent punishment, and by
guilt over what one has not done.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But why settle for memories of billowing sails and sunken
caravels? Monumental evidence of even earlier glory remains vividly
alive behind the walls of tiny hilltop villages like Monsanto,
Marvao and Monsaraz, and in fortified towns like Castelo de Vide
and Elvas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lined up like sentinels along Portugal's mountainous eastern
border with Spain, medieval castles glisten in the evening fog,
lighted from below by the golden hue of powerful lamps. The castles
look as if Hamlet himself is about to prowl the dark corridors or
shout his revenge from the ramparts. Still standing are the
crenelated walls, arched entries, slender guardhouses and massive
keeps, moats, towers, dungeons, cisterns, churches and palaces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six and seven hundred years after defying waves of invaders,
there are dozens of castles remaining in remarkably good shape or
carefully restored. Not until 1297, when the kingdom was solidly
established more or less along its present boundaries, did
Portugal's castles come to embody a virtually sacred role. They
still do, combining religion, history and patriotism into a
profound sense of national meaning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a two-week trip to Portugal in January, my wife, Gloria, and
I visited a dozen of these remarkable medieval hill towns.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The steep, cobbled streets, houses of gray granite blocks and
gigantic weathered boulders of Monsanto's castle _ Mons Sanctus, it
was called _ is where such history begins. Not for nothing did the
government name it Portugal's ``most typical village'' as long ago
as 1939. In any other country, the honor would have brought instant
ruin: souvenir shops and sidewalk vendors, clamoring guides and bad
restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet as far as we could tell, Monsanto has but one cafe, where
the chief sport seems to be sipping the terrific espresso while
watching tourists scrape their fenders on the narrow stone walls as
they try to climb the corkscrew turns into the castle _ after
missing the sign (if there was one) that warns drivers to park
below and walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,100 villagers live outside the walls. Inside,
there are no guides, no restaurants, almost no rooms to rent and
one hotel, a comfortable 10-room government-owned pousada, part of
the extensive and luxurious national hotel chain in historic
buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's castle walls, carved out of the same living quarry
that shaped the town, look as if they had grown mysteriously out of
the ground: huge craggy rocks and weathered boulders big as a
whale's back or small as a hippopotamus. From a height of 2,500
feet, the village looms over a vast plain of corn and plantations
of cork oaks and olive trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Climbing to the summit along a twisting path bordered by mottled
green lichens and ferns, we suddenly came upon a pair of pigs in a
grassy enclosure curiously venturing from a round stone hut that
may have housed animals since Roman times. The fiercely protective
castle now suggests an image of domesticity and impregnable
grandeur.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop, Castelo de Vide, is about 85 miles away, in a
loop to the south. It's not a hard drive because most of it is
along a modern four-lane divided highway; the secondary roads are
paved, as they are throughout the country, and are usually well
maintained and not heavily traveled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Castelo de Vide is just west of the Spanish border and displays
a cheerful architectural harmony of whitewashed houses on narrow
streets. Doorways are filled with plants and potted flowers, and
the town's beautifully proportioned main square, shaped roughly
like a trapezoid, is lined with small shops and two-story
buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not much remains of Castelo de Vide's 14th-century castle,
except five impressive towers and the massive, rambling walls that
enclose part of the town and hug the landscape. A prosperous
agricultural town that once had the largest Jewish population in
Portugal, Castelo de Vide seems unchanged from centuries past. Even
the stone pillory post in front of the medieval town hall
(virtually every Portuguese town has a carved pelourinho topped by
protruding arms of wrought iron from which the unfortunate accused
was whipped and tortured, frequently as a precursor to death by
hanging) does its part to preserve symbolically a sense of
Portugal's strong traditional values, if not the punishment that
enforces them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has changed here for 800 years,'' we are told by Joao
Miguel Goncalves Maroc, a 30-year-old pilot who trained in Dallas,
now lives in Lisbon and is visiting his grandfather, an 86-year-old
man sharing drinks with his cronies at a small crowded cafe just
off the square. ``On Fridays, the farmers still come to town to
shop for the week and meet their friends. Weekends, it's empty.''
Of the young people, he says that about half remain in town and
marry; the rest leave for Lisbon, as he did, or seek work elsewhere
in Europe. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away in the medieval quarter _ down flights of
steps from a small room that was a 13th-century synagogue _ is the
town fountain. With its pyramidal stone roof supported by six small
marble pillars, it is said to be the oldest fountain in Portugal.
The mineral waters here and elsewhere in town made it famous as a
medieval spa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Has anything changed? Not that we can see. The water still
splashes softly in the base of the fountain, then silently drains
under the edge of a tiny plaza that slopes up like a scallop shell
to a rim of ancient houses with carved stone window frames and
Gothic doorways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marvao, just a few miles away, is a 12th-century time capsule.
The castle, built into the rock, encloses an entire village of
about 250 people. Perched on a craggy platform 2,700 feet above the
valley floor are dazzling white houses with small iron balconies,
the church of Espirito Santo, a primary school, a fascinating small
museum of local lore, a gracious pousada, a few shops, cafes, and
rooms to rent. Cobbled streets wind mysteriously or end abruptly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing place, magical, unblemished and yet quite real,
a curious outpost of history that goes back to the Iron Age.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the maze of castle courtyards and towering
walls, we spot a number of small, locked wooden doors. Suddenly,
one door opens to our touch. There's even a light switch in the
stone wall on the right. We know enough to flick the switch and we
see an enormous cistern carved from the castle rock and lighted by
bulbs in the low, arched ceiling. The water is fed, we later
notice, by runoffs carved in the stone floors of the courtyard.
Peering left and right at the bottom of a short flight of stone
steps at the water's edge, we could not see either end of the
cistern. Later we learned that it is estimated to hold a six-month
supply of water _ long enough to survive your average serious
siege. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 45 miles south of Marvao (also just a hop from the Spanish
border), is Elvas, a virtual museum of fortification, but on a
grand scale compared to Marvao. A modern, bustling small city of
18,000 people, Elvas is enclosed by some of the most elaborate
battlements in Europe _ moats, drawbridges, iron gates and four
star-shaped bastions whose great walls rise majestically from the
plains below. There, the past and present co-exist without apparent
tension.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic zooms around the octagonal 16th-century Church of Our
Lady of Consolation, past the pillory post on the edge of the
well-preserved Arab quarter, and down to the main plaza, paved with
white, gray and black stones in a pattern of Renaissance cubes. No
city planner or private developer even imagines ripping down a
block for new housing, a shopping mall or a new industrial
district. The stores may have plate glass windows, but water still
runs to the fountain in Largo da Misericordia along the topmost
tier of arches of an aqueduct more than four miles long that took
more than 100 years to finish. That was in 1622.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Elvas, we drive on a flat curving road, which suddenly
ascends to the arched gate leading to the 13th-century castle
village of Monsaraz. Along the road are fields and groves littered
with some of Europe's richest neolithic finds, including a circle
of 50 boulders surrounding a towering seven-ton phallic-shaped
stone, tombs of huge rock slabs, and a profusion of dolmens,
menhirs and other megaliths put in place five and six thousand
years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only in Portugal can a vast outdoor museum of the earliest human
habitation make a nearly intact medieval fortress seem almost
modern. Not until 1167 were the Moors of Monsaraz defeated by
Geraldo the Fearless, but the castle he conquered had been a Roman
stronghold, too. The amphitheater for Portuguese bullfighting was
the stage for Roman dance and drama. Walking along the rows of
stone seats open to the neolithic vista beyond is like having a
ringside ticket to 50 centuries of history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within the walls of Monsaraz live about 90 people, and outside,
at the foot of the walls, about 150 more. The two main streets are
still paved with slivers of shale; three horizontal rows
alternating with three vertical rows. You can walk around the
village, a tableau of whitewashed houses, orange trees, a domed
church and the dilapidated House of the Inquisition, in half an
hour, but that would be a mistake. The handful of small shops that
sell objects of cork (statues, boxes, bottles), pottery or textiles
are inviting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The restrained proprietors, mostly women, wait behind the
counters of the shops we visit, ready to help but hoping that we
will discover for ourselves the appeal of a carved wooden
candlestick or the intricate patterns of an embroidered shawl _ all
handmade in Portugal and many in the region. Unlike many tourist
shops the world over, these are not stocked with tomahawks made in
China or key rings from Mexico; Portugal is too poor to import
trinkets by the ton and too proud to hawk its handicrafts as though
they were T-shirts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such resistance to commercialization, along with a gentle sense
of ceremony and a deep feeling for the land and its traditions,
have almost miraculously preserved Portugal's walled towns and
villages _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay, where to eat
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of state-run pousadas, strategically situated in or
near major tourist destinations throughout the country, almost
invariably offer the most comfortable accommodations and, often,
the finest food in the area. Though they're not cheap compared with
what is generally available (and there are plenty of adequate,
clean and inexpensive hotels, rooms and pensions), the pousadas
offer a real bargain for value received. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a convenient base of operations there are three pousadas in
Estremoz, about a two-hour drive east of Lisbon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the  &UR; Rainha Santa Isabel,  &LR;  (351-68) 33 20 75, a former
palace on the highest hill overlooking Estremoz, and next door to
the medieval castle keep, a double in season is $195 a night (all
prices include a generous buffet breakfast and VAT.) The antique
furnishings remain fit for a king, and the architectural scale of
the halls, ceilings, marble staircases and tapestries is
appropriately royal, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the same price, the  &UR; Pousada dos Loios, &LR;  (351-66) 24051, in
Evora offers a matchless location in the beautiful capital of the
Alentejo region: 10 yards from a remarkably preserved second- or
early-third-century Roman temple. The rooms are rather small
(appropriately?) in this former convent, but the public spaces and
the cozy bar are delightful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three nights of our two-week trip we stayed in small hotels
along the way, when either there was no pousada nearby, or it was
full. That wasn't bad either, though the dim lights and bare walls
of our room in the  &UR; Hotel Turismo da Guarda &LR;  were disappointing;
(351-71) 22 33 66. But $87 a night was a bargain, and it was a
short drive to Monsanto, where the pousada was full.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least as spectacular as the most upscale pousada is the
 &UR; Hotel Convento de Sao Paulo,  &LR; (351-66) 99 91 00, a former convent
perched high on a hill within a private 3,000-acre unspoiled forest
above Redondo, a short drive to the walled village of Monsaraz.
Opened in 1993 after almost two years of reconstruction of a
near-ruin, the hotel is now a posh hideout for a handful of
tourists and a corporate retreat designed for productive
relaxation: walks through the ancient forest, swimming pool, game
rooms, high-tech meeting rooms, air-conditioning and 17 huge,
tastefully appointed rooms (no two furnished alike) off the long,
wide hallways lined with azulejos, painted blue tiles, from the
16th and 17th centuries. Doubles cost about $160 to $175, including
breakfast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pousada de Santa Luzia &LR;  in Elvas, (351-68) 62 21 94, opened in
1942 and was the first in the country. Its modern architecture of
glass, brick and wood is in stark contrast to the classic
restorations of most other pousadas (doubles are about $100,
including breakfast). We had been tipped off about lunch here,
especially the signature dish _ bacalhau dourado (golden salt cod,
with virtually invisible slivers of fish, onion and potato mixed
with the fluffiest eggs imaginable) _ probably the best food we had
in Portugal (about $8).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A close second was a lavish six-course Sunday buffet ($21) at
the  &UR; Dom Joao IV. &LR;  the former Covento das Chagas de Cristo, in Vila
Vicosa, a 45-minute drive from Elvas, among the most recent hotels
to open in Portugal; (351-68) 98742. Just off the plaza, dominated
by the grand ducal palace, the pousada had been a convent, a
mausoleum for duchesses, then abandoned and left to collapse when
the government stepped in and restored it with taste and rustic
elegance. Doubles are about $162, with breakfast.

SPORTS COLUMN: RODMAN IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT THE BULLS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Oh, now Dennis Rodman should be consigned to where he
really belongs, in wrestling rings and on couches next to the most
qualified psychologists, and Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Now Phil Jackson should stand up for the sake of decency and the
coaching fraternity and for impressionable kids who are getting the
idea it is all right to abandon those who depend on them for an
enterprising night of nihilism with Hulk Hogan in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning has never been that important to me,'' Jerry Sloan
announced in disdainful, jaw-jutting fashion Tuesday before his
Utah Jazz prepared for what we are here for in the first place,
Wednesday night's fourth game of the National Basketball
Association finals. ``We'd find a way to remove him from the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That is easy for Sloan and former coach and current ESPN
commentator Jack Ramsay and every columnist right up there on
Moses' mountain to say.
</P>
<P>
   The well-intentioned but twisted logic here is that Jackson and
the Bulls should sever Rodman, cut off their nose rings to spite
their face, in the middle of a championship series they are
leading, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Fire their best rebounder and inside defender after Rodman
shunned Monday's light practice and news media availability to
become ``Rodzilla'' at a wrestling show for a cool quarter million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't wrestle, did he?'' Jackson said, trying to maintain
perspective, more than a sense of humor, because last week, in Salt
Lake City, the predictable act of theatrical intransigence was an
all-nighter in Las Vegas after Game 1. ``In the end, Dennis always
comes back and tries extra hard to please.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just not good enough for those who claim Rodman is
making a cartoon out of what could be Michael Jordan's farewell.
Ramsay said that no other coach would put up with Rodman not on the
bench for the start of the game and not at practice the morning
after.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan asserted that Rodman's chronic disobedience is some grave
threat to basketball's moral high ground, which is like accusing
the clown of subverting the integrity of the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to some of the company many NBA players keep, Hulk
Hogan is practically the dean of Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rodman is the Joker to Jordan's Batman and Scottie
Pippen's Robin. In his third and presumably last season with what
no longer is a mere basketball team but a collection of action
heroes, Rodman as what Jackson calls the ``anti-hero'' has made
himself a windfall as Jordan's evil twin.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodman around, Jordan has become more of a deity than ever.
The star of the show would never think of leaving his team in the
middle of the playoffs to gamble into the morning hours, now would
he?
</P>
<P>
   Unless Rodman becomes insubordinate or violent on the court,
what else can Jackson do at this point? He knows that Jordan's
presence keeps Rodman from distracting the others.
</P>
<P>
   A fairer criticism of Jackson and Jordan is that they signed
onto Rodman's return in the first place after he broke every team
rule for two years and, worse, assaulted a courtside photographer
during a game last season. David Stern could have made the same
example out of Rodman he eventually made of Latrell Sprewell. He
didn't, probably because Rodman had value to the franchise that
carries his league.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson admits he agreed to have Rodman back with no illusion
that he would transform himself into Steve Kerr. When he was asked
Tuesday what, if any, authority he has over Rodman, his facial
expression suggested incredulity. ``No one has authority over
Dennis _ that's his problem,'' Jackson said. When someone compared
Rodman to a kindergartner, Jackson said the situation is ``more
like special ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Every team has recalcitrant players, but Jackson is the rare
power coach who doesn't have to use it to prove he has it. It is
his most redeeming coaching quality.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Pippen removed himself from an end-game
playoff situation against the Knicks, Jackson walked into the
locker room and waited to see what his players would do. Bill
Cartwright stood up, teary eyed, and said to Pippen, ``How could
you do that to us?''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, properly chastened by a respected veteran, apologized.
The team got beyond the worst move of Pippen's career without
Jackson having to say a word. Now one of Jackson's assistants,
Cartwright said: ``That was different from this. With Dennis, we
just leave it to Phil. He knows how to handle Dennis.''
</P>
<P>

re-signed him. He was ready to publicly live with it. If he can,
it's none of Jerry Sloan's business. &QL;

CLINTON REBUFFS CRITICS OF UPCOMING TRIP TO CHINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday defended his trip to
China later this month and agreed to a ``policy of reciprocity'' to
induce North Korea to become more open.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, hosting South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung in an
official state visit, opened the door for easing, but not lifting
as Kim had suggested, some U.S. economic sanctions against North
Korea if the communist nation, now plagued by food shortages, made
moves to reconcile with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference with Kim, Clinton turned aside complaints
from Americans on the political left and right who are pressing him
to avoid an official welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen Square, where
the Chinese Army massacred students and supporters of a
pro-democracy movement nine years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that if this is going to be a state visit to
China and I am going to be the guest of the Chinese, that they
should be designing the terms of the arrival ceremony _ not me. I
simply don't accept the proposition that observing their diplomatic
protocol in any way undermines my capacity to advance the
principles of the United States,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Asian economic crisis and the nuclear arms race
in India and Pakistan, Clinton said it should be ``clearer than
ever before that we have a strong national interest in developing a
constructive, positive relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that China has released several political prisoners
since Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States last
year. ``I intend to make our views clear and unambiguous,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also defended his approval of a waiver for Loral Space &AMP;
Communications, owned by a major Democratic donor, to use a Chinese
missile to launch one of its satellites.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Justice Department was investigating whether
Loral officials gave the Chinese illegal information that could
improve its missile technology. The Justice Department opposed the
waiver, contending it could damage any future prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't resist the advice of the Justice Department. I took
the advice of the National Security Council, the Defense
Department, the State Department and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency,'' Clinton said. He said the State Department
has the responsibility to make the recommendation and the other
agencies concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view it was a pretty routine decision,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In welcoming ceremonies on the South Lawn and at the news
conference, Clinton offered praise for President Kim, once a
dissident placed on death row by a South Korean military regime and
the first leader of an opposition party to win a presidential
election there in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Kim for his efforts at outreach to North Korea
and offered some modest proposals to help South Korea overcome the
economic slump affecting all of Asia. But, Clinton said, the
critical issue of lifting sanctions on North Korea was not brought
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kim did not ask me to lift sanctions. What he asked
me to do was to work with him to support a policy of reciprocity
which would enable us to move forward with the reconciliation of
the North and the South. And I said that I would be prepared to do
that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted lifting most sanctions would take an act of Congress,
but he has authority to take some actions.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 75, appearing frail and weary, added, ``We have nothing to
fear from North Korea. To induce them to open up will be beneficial
not only to the interests of our two countries, but to the peace of
the peninsula and Northeast Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said lifting sanctions would be up to the Americans, but ``we
would not oppose and we would cooperate.'' Kim has encouraged North
Korea, ruled by the elusive Kim Jong Il, to open its markets as
China and Vietnam have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knows well enough about him,'' Kim said
of the North Korean. ``Based on our experience, it's very difficult
to say that you can trust a communist. But we feel the need to
negotiate, and once you've reached an agreement, to hold them up to
that agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather extremes and central planning have left the North
Koreans with food shortages and famine. But Kim said the government
there remains relatively stable. He expressed concern, however,
that if the problems continue North Korea ``could go the road of
military provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's threat to develop its nuclear potential prompted
an international response in 1994. North Korea recently revived
those threats after it was unable to acquire enough crude oil.
Clinton said the United States was working to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Kim offered any timetable for U.S. troops to
end their duties along the demilitarized zone that has separated
the two Koreas since the war ended in 1953.

TALKING ART WITH DAVID BOWIE: A MUSICIAN'S PARALLEL PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: This is the first in an occasional series of talks with
people who, in one way or another, have a special connection to art
but aren't (primarily) artists themselves: writers, musicians,
scientists, politicians, collectors.) 
 (JT)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Bowie fits a few of these descriptions. Like other British
rockers of his generation (he's 51), he attended art school. He
still paints, draws and makes prints. He began collecting when he
was young and typifies the new wealth that has so altered the
demographics of collecting in the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has helped start an art-book publishing company,
21, and has been moonlighting as an interviewer of artists for
Modern Painters, the British magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He has also begun exhibiting his own paintings _ with some
trepidation, as he admits below. His pictures suggest, among other
things, a fondness for Picabia, Surrealism, Marvel Comics and Egon
Schiele. ( Bowie even looks a little like Schiele.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides talking about art and music writing, about rock and his
career, Bowie touches on a number of artists in the interview:
English figurative painters like David Bomberg (1890-1957) and
Bomberg's students Frank Auerbach (1931- ) and Leon Kossoff (1926-
); John Heartfield, the German Dadaist who pioneered anti-Nazi
photomontages during the 1930s; F.W. Murnau, the German director of
``Nosferatu'' (1922), and several of the ghoulishly inclined London
artists who have been making a splash lately, among them Damien
Hirst (of the sliced cows and spin paintings) and Jake and Dinos
Chapman (department store mannequins with multiple penises and
vaginas).(BOX) &QR;
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL KIMMELMAN. You studied art in school. You even started
collecting early. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID BOWIE. Yeah, I collected very early on. I have a couple of
Tintorettos, which I've had for many, many years. I have a Rubens.
Art was, seriously, the only thing I'd ever wanted to own. It has
always been for me a stable nourishment. I use it. It can change
the way that I feel in the mornings. The same work can change me in
different ways, depending on what I'm going through. For instance,
somebody I like very much indeed is Frank Auerbach. I think there
are some mornings that if we hit each other a certain way _ myself
and a portrait by Auerbach _ the work can magnify the kind of
depression I'm going through. It will give spiritual weight to my
angst. Some mornings I'll look at it and go, ``Oh, God, yeah! I
know!'' But that same painting, on a different day, can produce in
me an incredible feeling of the triumph of trying to express myself
as an artist. I can look at it and say, ``My God, yeah! I want to
sound like that looks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. I wouldn't associate you with a painter like Auerbach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I find his kind of bas-relief way of painting
extraordinary. Sometimes I'm not really sure if I'm dealing with
sculpture or painting. Plus, I've always been a huge David Bomberg
fan. I love that particular school. There's something very
parochial English about it. But I don't care. I like Kossoff for
the same reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. And Lucian Freud? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I admire the trickery of his work, the cankerous skin,
which is nice and grungy. But I don't buy into him being the
greatest painter that we have. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. What about Francis Bacon? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. No. Two or three pieces I find extraordinary. I like his
figures around the base of the cross, the very first piece that
blew him to fame, and of course the Pope, which was an
extraordinary thing that he came upon. But he weakened fast. His
demise was swift. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, my tastes are catholic. That's what I mean about
using art. There are times when I prefer a cerebral moment with an
artist, and I'll just enjoy the wit of a Picabia or a Duchamp. It
amuses me that they thought that what they did would be a good way
of making art. Sometimes I wish that I could put myself in
Duchamp's place to feel what he felt when he put those things on
show and said: ``I wonder if they'll go for this. I wonder what's
going to happen tomorrow morning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's the other side of me that thinks he did it just because
he couldn't paint. Maybe in hostility to an art scene that he
wasn't making it very big in, he felt forced into a situation of
producing a new kind of art _ which would be a very human reaction,
and it wouldn't demean him at all in my eyes if he'd just said:
``I'll put a toilet on show. Let's see how far I can push it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would understand that attitude perfectly, because the most
interesting thing for an artist is to pick through the debris of a
culture, to look at what's been forgotten or not really taken
seriously. Once something is categorized and accepted, it becomes
part of the tyranny of the mainstream, and it loses its potency.
It's always been that way for me: the most imprisoning thing is to
feel myself being pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to think if there's anyone who truly has honed his
craft to a point that you are really, really glad that he stayed
with one thing all the way through his life. Of course there is.
How stupid of me! Bob Dylan. He's not actually changed his course
very much, and now his music has such resonance that when I first
put his new album on I thought I should just give up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You mentioned Duchamp and Picabia. What about the current
crop of London artists who owe a debt to them? I'm thinking of the
Chapmans, Hirst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I'm not a huge fan of the Chapmans. It's this sniggering
little schoolboy kind of thing, and I refuse to take it seriously.
They seem to me to have achieved a certain fame by doing one thing
_ which is, in a way, an illustration of the problem. I think their
art has the same kind of spin as Jerry Springer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You admire Damien Hirst, though. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. He's different. I think his work is extremely emotional,
subjective, very tied up with his own personal fears _ his fear of
death is very strong _ and I find his pieces moving and not at all
flippant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. I find him amusing sometimes, his ``retro'' spin paintings,
for instance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I did one of those with him. He encouraged me to dress up
like a Martian, stand on a ladder and throw paint at a spinning
canvas. I had a ball. I felt like I was 3 years old again. It
reminded me of Picasso's attitude. You know, he set parameters in
the studio that produced a kind of playfulness out of which came a
very pure thing. With Damien the work is not earnestly striven for.
I mean, he certainly applies his intellect, but there's not a
desperation about it. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He's also one of the people who has helped to make art very
accessible to the public in Britain in a way that has never really
happened before, even at the height of the '60s. You still had to
go out of your way then to see work by Allen Jones or Hockney or
whatever. Now it's very easy to pop out on the weekend and see some
good art nearly anywhere in Britain. And I notice that the crowds
that go to museums and galleries these days seem a lot younger than
they ever were. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think they're a generation that doesn't see a separation
between the visual and the audio. You know, 25 years ago there were
a whole crop of us that tried to drag all the arts together and
create this potpourri, a kind of new essence for English music. It
started even before us, in the mid-'60s, when so many of our blues
players and rhythm-and-blues bands came out of art school. In
Britain, there was always this joke that you went to art school to
learn to play blues guitar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You played sax. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I wanted to be Gerry Mulligan, only, see, I didn't have any
kind of technique. So I thought, well, baritone sax is kind of
easier, I can manage that, except I couldn't afford a baritone, so
I bought an alto, which was the same fingering [laughs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happened at the beginning of the '70s with guys like myself
and maybe Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno, maybe some of the guys in
Floyd before us, King Crimson, that nature of band: we were all
pretty excited about letting people know what went into our work,
that we weren't all trying to be Chuck Berry. I know Ferry was a
huge Dada fan, for instance. He even did an album called ``The
Bride Stripped Bare.'' Eno and I went, ``He shouldn't do that,''
thinking we should have done it first [laughs). We were excited by
set design, by the way we dressed, by trying to create a whole
landscape for the music we were making. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles had done it to a certain extent because they had
John. I always had such pleasure talking and being with John
because there was nothing that didn't interest him, you know? He
had a real appetite. ``What's that, I love that! It's red and it's
big and I want it!'' A lot of us wanted to be that way. We would
talk about the books we were reading, you know, by the Beats and
people like that. We would talk about Kabuki theater. We would talk
about artists. I was interested in the Expressionists. And there
was an awful lot of Dada in what we were doing. I remember being
impressed by, you know, the collages ... . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Hannah Hoech? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Yes, but also, what was his name ... ? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Schwitters? Heartfield? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Heartfield, who I think must have influenced some of the
English punk bands in the '70s: the way they did posters, cutting
up letters and breaking up sentences. The destruction of the
clothes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. People have pointed out that the Situationists in the '60s
directly influenced punk. You mean that Heartfield's '30s montages
influenced them, too? Ripping, cutting up things, rearranging them?
Or do you mean his irony? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. I think in the '70s that there was a general feeling of
chaos, a feeling that the idea of the '60s as ``ideal'' was a
misnomer. Nothing seemed ideal anymore. Everything seemed
in-between. We thought, ``Are we entering a great flux from which
we'll never come out again?'' The reaction in Brian's work was a
kind of poignancy. With my work, it was just horror: ``Well, it's
all over! So just dress up! Put your best clothes on because it's
finished!''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You mentioned German Expressionism. You mean artists like
George Grosz? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. No. I had a thing for Murnau and Fritz Lang. Grosz was too
direct for me. I always want a certain abstraction. Art should be
open enough for me to develop my own dialogue with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. So what about the political art of the early '90s? It was
pretty direct. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. It left me cold. I thought, what condition has forced these
people to be so finger-waggy? Fortunately, it dissipated fast. Now
you've got Matthew Barney, who has latched onto this idea of the
mythological, which seems very much in the air: the whole
paganization of our culture. With Barney and a number of other
artists I think that their work, a number of years ago, would have
fallen into the area of outsider art. But the art world always
widens its parameters to elevate something from low art to high
art. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. That's an obvious difference between the art world and the
rock-music world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. The difference is that one has a brain [laughs).
</P>
<P>
   ``Spinal Tap'' really wasn't off the mark. There's a high degree
of fame-seeking in rock, and I think that gets in the way of some
great potential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Art's not altogether different in that sense, is it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Yeah, it's true. I guess the same can also be said about
some visual artists. But success in art seems to be a lot more
about knowing and buttering up a few people. If a visual artist is
articulate about his work, he can tell collectors what to think
about what they're buying. People won't sit still to hear a rock
musician say why someone should spend 15 bucks on his album. You
can't get away with much in rock without somebody saying ``You got
to be kidding me.'' You're not talking about 20 people; you are
talking in hundreds of thousands, if you're lucky, and so a
consensus forms about the music. As a rock musician you can live
with your audience, no matter what the critics say. Let me tell
you, many times I've had to. The ups and downs can be pretty
terrifying [laughs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You're in the curious position now of having started a kind
of second career as a painter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Was it a dreadful mistake? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. You're asking me? I'm asking you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. It's a rhetorical question, actually. I kind of went public
in about '94 with the visual stuff that I do. I'm not sure why I
made that choice, and I'm still to this day not sure if it wasn't a
mistake, but there's no turning back. Up to that point, painting
for me was private, and it really was about problem solving. I'd
find that if I had some creative obstacle in the music that I was
working on, I would often revert to drawing it out or painting it
out. Somehow the act of trying to recreate the structure of the
music in paint or in drawing would produce a breakthrough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. How so? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. It's very hard for me to put this into words. I'm not quite
sure what the process is. It's a real ``Eureka!'' thing. I'll put
together a peculiar set of instrumentation, or I'll combine sounds
that are kind of unusual, and then I'm not quite sure where the
text should fall in the music, or I'm not sure what the sound
conjures up for me. So then I'll go and try and draw or paint the
sound of the music. And often a landscape will produce itself, then
I'll identify locations within the landscape. Suddenly I'll realize
where things go in the music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Literally landscapes? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Well, it's all figurative art. I call it landscape, but
location, I think, is a better word. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. I'm still not sure I understand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. That's the trouble talking about art, isn't it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Well, maybe you can explain more clearly why you began to
exhibit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D.B. Vanity [laughs). No, really, Eno asked me to do some stuff
for a charity thing. So I produced a set of prints for him. And I
enjoyed the process. I enjoyed standing in the gallery, kind of in
the back a bit, watching people go past the stuff and come up with
their own explanations for what it was. I thought, this is fun.
Then I was asked to do a show because of that first one. Another
reasoning went into it as well. This starts to become quite a
complex issue, but I felt very dissatisfied with myself as a
musician during a lot of the '80s, the last part of the '80s. I was
going through my middle-age crisis smack on cue. Soon as I hit 40,
it all went wrong. When I hit 1987, it just seemed that nothing
worked for me musically. I'd lost the plot. It really felt bad. I
felt awful with myself as an artist. And I probably started working
on the visual side of things really quite desperately to find some
salvation as an artist. And then during the very early '90s, I
found my way slowly back into music again. Now in music I feel
fulfilled, hopefully not self-satisfied, by what I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, I find I'm bearing in mind how people respond
to the art, which has produced a separation between the visual and
the musical. I'm not sure that that's a good thing. But I went into
it with my eyes wide open. I expected ridicule _ and I got it
[laughs).

NEW YORK'S LATIN IMMIGRANTS PASSIONATELY AWAIT WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least once a year, Juan Ospina finds himself
driving 24 hours nonstop just to watch a soccer match. He sometimes
takes off from work to head to one of the Queens bars that
broadcast games from South America.
</P>
<P>
   And in case there was any doubt of his devotion, he has been
known to shave the name of his native country, Colombia, onto the
back of his head and paint the colors of the Colombian flag across
his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people at work think I'm a little crazy,'' said
Ospina, a translator at Queens County Family Court. ``But soccer is
in the blood of most Latin American countries, and people will go
to extremes for their teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ospina and six buddies have spent the last year planning a
weeklong sojourn to France to watch their team play in the 1998
World Cup tournament, which starts Wednesday. They joke that their
wives have stopped speaking to them, but they have what they want:
tickets for next Monday's match between Colombia and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   While few Americans find themselves seized by the mania and the
fierce national pride involved in the World Cup, immigrants like
Ospina from soccer-mad countries have waited four long years for
this event. Now, they are ready; to scream, to drink, to wallow in
misery or stop traffic in jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the Super Bowl, day after day, for an entire month.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more apparent than in neighborhoods along
Roosevelt Avenue, a bustling spine of immigrant Queens. Under the
rumbling el, dozens of restaurants and sports bars that cater to
Latin Americans have been advertising for weeks that they will
broadcast the 64 World Cup games on ``pantallas gigantes,''
huge-screen television sets. Shops sell T-shirts emblazoned with
the World Cup mascot, a rooster named Footix. Vendors wander the
street selling Colombian and Mexican flags, World Cup key chains
and other trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American immigrants have more than usual to focus on this
year, because for the first time in World Cup history, four South
American teams, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile, along with
Mexico, are ranked among the top 10 teams by the sport's
international body.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the six-hour time difference with France, all games
will be televised in the New York City (on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 or
Channel 41) during the day. While many soccer fans have been
stocking up on videotapes to record what they miss while they're at
work, others have pleaded with their bosses to let them watch the
matches live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get the owner to put a television in,''
said Nubia Garrido, a waitress at La Pequena Colombiana, a
restaurant on Roosevelt Avenue. ``But he just keeps saying, `We'll
talk about it.''' So instead, Ms. Garrido, like many others, has
started planning World Cup parties at home on her days off. ``It's
much more fun to be together and watch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police precincts in northern Queens, meanwhile, have plotted
their strategy for handling soccer revelers after each game
involving a Latin American country. A special task force has been
prepared, with dozens of mounted police officers with riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned the hard way four years ago just how passionate
people in the area can be about their beloved futbol and the Copa
Mundial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got caught with our pants down four years ago,'' said
Officer Earl Dawson, a community affairs officer in the 115th
Precinct in Jackson Heights. ``We didn't realize that there's this
whole geopolitical culture to the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The disturbances in parts of Queens in 1994 certainly never
approached the soccer rioting that has become familiar in Europe
and Latin America. But thousands of soccer fans rushed onto
Roosevelt Avenue, stopping traffic and shutting the thoroughfare
with impromptu soccer games and raucous rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil beat Italy to win the championship, Latino fans
drove up and down Fresh Pond Road in Maspeth to taunt the residents
in the largely Italian area. When police tried to disperse the
crowds, fans hurled eggs, firecrackers and bottles at police. A few
officers were hurt and six people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   This year, police in the 115th and 110th Precincts have mapped
out the schedule of matches and kept tabs on the teams' rankings
with the help of local bar owners and soccer sites on the World
Wide Web to figure out how to deploy police officers. ``Ninety
percent of it is all good-natured rivalry and it's not a hostile
crowd,'' said Officer Noel Colon. ``But if you don't want it
turning into a wild party on the street, you have to prepare for a
riot.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that precincts in other ethnic strongholds _ like an
Italian area on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, or the Jamaican
neighborhood around Flatbush Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and
the Brazilian enclave on Broadway in Astoria _ will also be on the
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that fans were especially frenzied in 1994
because the World Cup was played in the United States, and busloads
of people headed to and from New Jersey to watch matches at the
Meadowlands. This year, the time difference could work in their
favor, since people are less likely to drink heavily while they are
watching games early in the day. ``But if one of their team wins,''
Colon said, ``forget it. Total mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Alarcon, the owner of Chibcha, a Colombian restaurant in
Jackson Heights that has seven large-screen television sets, has
worked closely with police. ``I think they understand now that it's
just our people's celebration, and it is a big pride to see your
country in the World Cup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ospina said he and his friends _ who used to play in one of the
many soccer leagues started by immigrants across the city _ have
been among the crowds that swarmed onto Roosevelt Avenue. ``It's
just a big party, and when you're all together out there, it just
makes the moment better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Martin, a travel agent at San Francisco Travel on
Roosevelt Avenue, is a Colombian immigrant, but he said he would be
watching Argentina and Brazil closely, too. ``Of course I am for
Colombia, but if they lose I will be just as much for Argentina or
Brazil, because we are all from the same side, South America,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was lucky because his boss, Piero Adjemiantz, had
already agreed to tune the office television set to the games. ``Of
course we will watch,'' said Adjemiantz, an Argentine immigrant.
``It's our national game, and every country plays futbol except the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer in the United States recently expanded to 12
teams, and ABC this year decided to increase the number of games it
shows to 12 (from one), but many Americans are still only vaguely
aware of the World Cup and may have never heard of such giants as
the Brazilian star Ronaldo, considered by many to be the greatest
player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ospina and his friends, though, were positively giddy about
their coming trip when they gathered for a pickup soccer game
Friday night. For the last 10 years, they have gone on soccer road
trips at least twice a year, travels that have brought them to
Florida and California as well as back home to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Ospina, 35, sheepishly admitted that he did not become a diehard
soccer fan until he arrived in Queens as a teen-ager in 1980 and
eventually joined Sporting Colombia, a local soccer team that
disbanded last year because ``we all got too old and fat,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to identify with other immigrants, and playing and
watching soccer somehow made me feel a little bit closer to my
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But before they have even packed their bags for France, Ospina
and his crew have already started planning for 2002, when the World
Cup will be played in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do is work, pay taxes, die and follow the
team,'' said Fernando Diaz, another Bogota native who now lives in
Richmond Hill. ``We're already working on our Japanese.''

<P>
   It's a perfect indicator of jazz's restricted place in American
society that Ravi Coltrane _ who is the son of John Coltrane _ was
nobody special as a boy growing up in Woodland Hills, a suburb of
Los Angeles, far away from the bohemian world. He was nearly 2 when
his father died of liver cancer in 1967, and the family moved from
Long Island to the San Fernando Valley, where he lived with his
mother, Alice Coltrane, and three siblings. Of course, he was
suddenly somebody very significant when he arrived at the
California Institute of the Arts to study tenor and soprano
saxophone, because John Coltrane _ who played the same instruments
_ is still the apotheosis of the jazz sainthood myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Cal Arts,'' Coltrane, 32, said, ``I was
starting out late, I couldn't play at all, and I had this name that
people weren't used to dealing with. I constantly kept this in my
mind: I'm here to do one thing. I just wanted to learn about this
music and see if I can deal with it as a player. And I'm still
thinking like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, Coltrane moved to a second-floor apartment and
rehearsal space overlooking a commercial avenue in Queens in 1991,
and started a long apprenticeship with various band leaders,
including Elvin Jones, Jack DeJohnette, Wallace Roney, Joanne
Brackeen and Steve Coleman. He lives there still, with his
girlfriend, Kathleen Hennessy. Relaxed and athletic-looking, he sat
at his piano bench a few weeks ago, slapping a chessboard queen
into the palm of his hand while he talked, the phone ringing every
few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff going on,'' he said, a bit regretfully.
``Too much, sometimes. I'd rather be working than not working, but
I think I'll get a better feel for things after this year is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   After appearing as a sideman on 29 records, Coltrane made a
debut album, ``Moving Pictures'' (RCA/BMG), released last month.
Since then he has played a week at Sweet Basil in New York, taken a
few trips to Europe and has already been occasionally misquoted
talking about his father in a rush of interviews. He will perform
tonight in one of the biggest events of the Texaco New York Jazz
Festival: a double bill with his group and that of his namesake,
the sitarist Ravi Shankar, at Town Hall. Coltrane will be joined by
his mother on piano; she has rarely performed in public since
taking up the study of Indian religion and philosophy in the 1970s.
Ms. Coltrane said that she expected to play two John Coltrane
pieces _ ``Crescent'' and ``Resolution,'' a section from the longer
work ``A Love Supreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving Pictures'' is a rare jazz record. It isn't dazzling;
Ravi Coltrane's music works on you more slowly. He has a warm,
streamlined tone, and he's partial to small, sharp motifs and
pockets of silence rather than the endless stuffing of notes
through complicated harmonic grids. Along with the tenor
saxophonists Mark Turner and Greg Tardy, Coltrane is one of a
growing number of jazz players in their early 30s who are making
their mark, an age at which some of their own ideas about music
have had time to cool and harden.
</P>
<P>
   The positive effects of that waiting process is obvious to any
listener. It's clear that Coltrane hasn't been bossed around by a
producer. The first track on the record gives you the idea: it's
Coltrane and the trumpeter Ralph Alessi playing free improvisations
with the Jamaican drum trio Ancient Vibrations, barely jazz at all.
Thereafter, the compositional ideas are kept simple, the drummer
Jeff Watts turns in a memorable performance as rhythm predominates,
and by the end of the album you're left with an accurate indication
of Coltrane's talent. And, no, he sounds nothing like his father.
Where John's music was urgent and prolix, Ravi's is cool and
concise.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane has gained a sense of quiet pride and tact from living
with his surname, where others in his position might have spiraled
off into brash delusions. From the start, he had been approached
with offers to record as a band leader. ``From the minute I picked
up the horn,'' he said, ``I started to see that I was going to get
some breaks that other guys wouldn't get.'' Some of those potential
breaks felt undeserved. ``You can tell,'' he said firmly, ``when
somebody has the `Coltrane' thing in their eyes.''

`SUBMISSIVE WIVES' STATEMENT SOLIDIFIES CONSERVATIVES' HOLD ON
BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Conservatives hammered home another spike in
their domination of the Southern Baptist Convention on Tuesday by
adopting a statement affirming a biblical hierarchy for the family
stating that ``a wife is to submit graciously to the servant
leadership of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Also symbolizing conservative dominance, Baptists elevated
55-year-old Paige Patterson _ a Texas born biblical inerrantist who
led the 1980s conservative takeover of the Southern Baptist
Convention _ to the presidency of the nation's largest Protestant
group.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected by acclamation without opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, some delegates opposed the statement on ``The
Family,'' but it was approved overwhelmingly by more than 8,000
delegates during the opening day of the convention that continues
through tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates defeated an amendment by the Rev. Tim Owings of the
First Baptist Church of Augusta, Ga., which would have changed the
passage about women submitting to their husbands. Owings, referring
to a passage from Ephesians, wanted to reword the proposal to say
that ``both husband and wife are to submit graciously to each
other. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to amend the Baptist Faith and Message
Statement, let's do it in accordance with scripture,'' Owings said.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida delegate agreed with Owings, saying the idea of women
submitting to men was stated by God after Adam and Eve had lapsed
into sin in the Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hierarchy replaced partnership after their sin,'' he said.
``This (idea of men being over women) is a curse rather than a
thing of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the original wording, the Rev. Adrian Rogers of
Memphis, Tenn., the former convention president, argued that the
proposed amendment did not reflect the entire Bible teaching about
women submitting to men.
</P>
<P>
   Another messenger, the Rev. Dennis Wiles of the First Baptist
Church of Huntsville, Ala., unsuccessfully tried to amend the
proposal to make the definition of a family also apply to include
single people, couples without children, widows or widowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my church members fit into this category, and I think
it should have been added,'' Wiles said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, president of Southeastern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., said the statement is not anti-woman
but is a much needed affirmation of the traditional family. He
noted that it says husband and wife are of ``equal worth before
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as anti-anything,'' Patterson said at a news
conference after the vote. ``The Bible is crystal clear in
assigning certain roles to husbands and wives.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal marked the first time in 35 years that the Baptists
have amended their Faith and Message Statement, a general statement
of Baptist beliefs. The new addition stands against homosexual
marriages or unions of heterosexual couples living together outside
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   It states, ``God has ordained the family as the foundational
institution of human society ...marriage is the uniting of one man
and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. It is God's
unique gift...to provide for the man and the woman in marriage the
framework for intimate companionship, the channel for sexual
expression according to biblical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   While stating that the husband is to love his wife as Christ
loves the church, the statement declares: ``A wife is to submit
graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the
church willingly submits to the headship of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   It continues: ``She, being in the image of God, as is her
husband...has a God-given responsibility to respect her husband and
to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the
next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children from the moment of conception are a blessing and
heritage from the Lord. Parents are to teach their children
spiritual and moral values and to lead them...children are to honor
and obey their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Patterson said the statement backing
only heterosexual marriage should not be construed as `gay
bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Baptists love them (gays and lesbians) and wish them
to know Christ and help them to make corrections in their
lifestyle,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dorothy, was on the committee that drafted the
statement. In an interview prior to its adoption, Patterson was
asked if he supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have to,'' he joked. ``My wife was on the
committee that wrote it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Julie Pennington-Russell, one of about 1,500 women who
are ordained ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention, said she
thought the statement will drive many away from the
conservative-controlled denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is provide a potential litmus test of
orthodoxy,'' said Pennington-Russell, who will become senior pastor
of the Calvary Baptist Church in Waco on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   She is believed to be the first woman to be a senior pastor of a
Baptist church in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Clayton, editor of the Louisiana Baptist Message, the state
Baptist newspaper, said one ramification of the statement is that
seminary professors in the six Southern Baptist seminaries may be
pressured to say they do not support the concept of women being
ordained ministers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ken Hemphill, president of the Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, said the statement doesn't
directly address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Baptists historically have opposed creeds and supported
freedom of conscience, the Baptist Faith and Message Statement is
an important doctrinal document. For example, professors at all six
of the denominations' seminaries are required to sign the
statement.

 UNDATED: their eyes.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But judging from his early recordings, it was clear that he
wasn't ready; he hadn't learned how to shape his solos, and his
tone had rough patches. He waited until the saxophonist and
composer Steve Coleman, whom he trusted to preserve his musical
ideas, signed a production deal with BMG France; recording Ravi
Coltrane was among Coleman's first priorities as a producer. Part
of the album's pleasingly undefinable nature _ the way it falls
between the cracks of the kinds of music we know _ is due to
Coleman's guidance. Coltrane had benefited from spending three
years in Coleman's band at a particularly salubrious time, when
Coleman's curiosity about Afro-Cuban music was blossoming; you can
hear how Coleman's distinctively cropped rhythmic motifs were
fertile suggestions for Coltrane's music.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane also credits his mother with supporting many of his
decisions. During his youth, he said, Alice Coltrane wasn't a stage
mother. ``She never pushed music on us,'' Coltrane remembered.
``She never said, `You have to be a saxophone player.' I always
knew about my father, from stories that she would tell. But when we
moved to California, the life style we had was pretty typical for
the San Fernando Valley. It wasn't that real musician life-style
thing. Every now and then Santana would come by the house, but we
lived very far away from the New York scene.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother avers that she never expected her children to take up
the family trade. ``I felt that was too much of a criterion to put
over your children,'' she said. ``What I made sure of as a mother
was that music would be heard, that instruments were here; then it
was really left up to them to make the decisions. I didn't want
them to reject music and feel that it was forced on them. They had
a life filled with different options.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane picked up the clarinet in junior high school and kept
an idle interest in music; he points to the death of his brother
John Jr. in a car accident in 1982 as a marker for him. From that
moment on he began to reprioritize his life. By his late teens, his
interest in his father's work had begun to grow. ``I'd heard all
that music from a very young age, and it had a surface-level effect
on me,'' he said. ``It never took the place that that type of music
should take when it gets into your body. Later on, it did have that
function for me; it became something I couldn't live without.''
</P>
<P>
   At school, he was suddenly surrounded by students who knew
Coltrane's music better than he did. ``I was 21, and I had only
started listening seriously for about a year,'' he said. ``I was in
a school of advanced players, and people would say, Man, you
haven't heard `Kind of Blue' before?'' (Coltrane played on that
classic 1959 album by Miles Davis.) One day the younger Coltrane
went to the school library, put on headphones and listened for the
first time to ``Monk's Music,'' a 1957 Thelonious Monk album with
his father on it. When he came to the track ``Well, You Needn't,''
he was startled. ``Monk takes his solo and yells out `Coltrane,
Coltrane!,' and I jumped,'' he said. ``I thought someone was
yelling at  &UR; me &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   More recently he has become involved in the Coltrane estate, and
in the decisions about releasing parts of the collection of
Coltrane recordings kept by his mother. Coltrane liked to record
himself rehearsing, and there are more rehearsal tapes in the
collection than anything else. Although, as Coltrane said, ``some
people would kill to hear them,'' it's unlikely that they'll be
released; as a measure of the artist's indifference toward those
tapes, he would often record other music over them. There are other
intriguing oddities, like a little-known extra take of ``A Love
Supreme,'' with Archie Shepp as a second saxophonist. And there are
many unissued recordings of Coltrane's later bands, with Ms.
Coltrane on piano and the drummer Rashied Ali. But of more
immediate interest to the public are unissued recordings by the
``classic'' Coltrane quartet (with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and
Elvin Jones), some of which will surface toward the end of 1998 as
an added disk to a complete boxed set of that band's recordings for
Impulse.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it's the Town Hall concert that Coltrane is
focusing on. The double bill was the idea of the producers of the
Texaco festival, and it is more than a piece of inspired whimsy.
John Coltrane fell in love with the modes and drones of Indian
music in the early 1960s; he and Ravi Shankar were mutual admirers.
Since visiting India for the first time in 1970, Ms. Coltrane has
been deeply involved with Indian culture. In 1975 she founded an
ashram, the Vedantic Center, which now houses 10 families on a
50-acre plot in Agoura Hills, west of Los Angeles. She still plays
a Wurlitzer organ and a piano at home and often records music for
meditation.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until five weeks ago, at the ceremony for the
Juliet Hollister Awards, given for the promulgation of spiritual
values, that the two Ravis finally shook hands. It was a surprise
meeting: Coltrane and his mother were going to see Swami
Satchidananda, who had been a guru to Ms. Coltrane in the 1970s,
receive an award. They didn't know Shankar would also be present to
receive one. ``I saw him and I couldn't speak, really,'' he
recalled, giggling. ``What do you say to him? I'm kind of glad that
I met him before the concert. I think I would have been just too
overwhelmed.''

 Sex a Big Hit Among Cyber Surfers   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In the first comprehensive poll of sexual habits in cyberspace, a
team of psychologists concluded yesterday that ``erotic pursuits''
are among the most frequent uses of the Internet and that ``sex''
is the most-searched word online.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sexuality is a big phenomenon in our society _ and it is
mirrored on the Internet,'' said Alvin Cooper, the San Jose
cybersex expert who conducted the survey. ``Males and females go
online for arousal, entertainment and information.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``click-and-tell'' poll's results are based on anonymous
responses from 9,000 Internet users who filled out a 47-question
survey posted on the MSNBC Web site in March and April. It asked
what they look at, who they talk to and what they get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found a healthy appetite among males for sex sites and
pornography online _ and not the seamy behavior that some people
fear is rampant online.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual activity online is a form of escapism, the survey found.
The researchers concluded that in many cases, men interested in
cybersex hole up in a back room at night, peering at nude images on
their computer screens and ignoring their partners. Women, in turn,
sometimes ignore their companions by engaging in marathon chat
sessions that sometimes escalated into romances.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _Five out of six people who cruise the Net for sexual material
are male.
</P>
<P>
   _Men prefer viewing sexually explicit Web sites twice as much as
women (50 percent vs. 23 percent). More than half &UR;  &LR; of the men
surveyed said they download adult-oriented material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men don't want entanglement in a relationship,'' said
psychologist Coralie Scherer, a survey co-author. ``They just want
to look.''
</P>
<P>
   _Women were twice as likely as men to participate in chat rooms
(49 percent vs. 23 percent). More than half said they do not
download explicit material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net offers anonymity so women can experiment, and there is
a safety factor from rape and venereal disease,'' said Cooper,
clinical director of the San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre. ``I
call it the `triple A' of the Internet _ access, affordability,
anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   _Female cybersex surfers tend to be younger than their male
counterparts. Most women who responded to the poll were in the 18-
to 34-year-old age bracket (59 percent), while males were equally
divided among 18-to-34 (46 percent) and 35-to-49 (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   _Nearly 80 percent of men and women in the poll viewed erotic
material from their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Both sexes admitted (61 percent) to occasionally lying online.
</P>
<P>
   Those expecting evidence of online sexual deviance and addiction
will be disappointed by the survey's results.
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of people polled (92 percent) said they spent
less than 11 hours per week in online pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent of those surveyed claim they spend more than 11
hours per week online, which would constitute addiction, according
to Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, about 3 to 6 percent of the general population
has some form of sexually compulsive disorder, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberaddicts often exhibit a bumper crop of psychiatric
disorders, like manic depression and alcohol abuse, that require
treatment, said psychiatrist Nathan Shapira of the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net is as much about sex education and information as it
is about sexual predators and pedophiles,'' Cooper said. ``This
shows that people are taking their sexual habits to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Those habits include an insatiable thirst for steamy Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   According to Relevant Knowledge, a Washington, D.C.-based market
researcher, 9.6 million users, or about 15 percent of all Web
users, logged on to the 10 most popular sex sites in April.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 70,000 sex-related Web sites, accounting
for a sizable chunk of the $4 billion U.S. adult-entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the anonymous poll guarantees confidentiality, some
question its veracity.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt University business professor Donna Hoffman, a
leading online pollster, has called the self-selected survey
``scientifically worthless for drawing any useful conclusions.''
She compared it to a recent People magazine cyberpoll that named
Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf, a cohort of radio personality Howard
Stern, as the sexiest man in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be considered fun, not a scholarly research
project,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have questioned the validity of such an ambitious
undertaking. ``The poll lacks depth but perhaps has breadth,'' said
Kimberly Young, a University of Pittsburgh psychologist and author
of a book on online addiction. ``It dovetails or confirms some of
my findings, particularly that women fantasize online and men are
more visual.''
</P>
<P>
   Young interviewed 400 &UR;  &LR; people either face to face or over the
phone for her book on cyberaddiction, called ``Caught in the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MSNBC officials said they posted the survey online
( &LR; www.msnbc.com &LR; ) for fun, and not to obtain hard scientific
results.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cooper insists the survey offers an accurate
illustration of sexual browsing. He said more than 4,500 submitted
surveys were ``weeded out'' because of irregularities and
duplicated answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are in line with Relevant Knowledge, which is the
Nielsen of online polling,'' he said. ``Besides, people tend to be
more forthcoming about their sexual behavior in an online setting.
Sometimes it's harder to talk about HIV and other personal subjects
face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   The results will be the subject of research papers and articles
in academic journals, Cooper said.

<P>
   France is gracious &QL; 
host but little else
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ A teen-age house guest of mine, who portends to be France's
biggest soccer fan, inadvertently scheduled himself for an extended
stay in Houston that overlaps the start of the World Cup by almost
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have I done?'' Romain said, grabbing his head, when I
told him of his mistake. But he recovered quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is OK,'' he said, smiling. ``I will be back in time to see
France win.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's one luv-ya vote for Les Bleus, the home team for Coupe
de Monde '98, which kicks off today with Brazil vs. Scotland at the
Stade de France in the blue-collar Paris suburb of Saint-Denis,
where in pre-revolutionary times the French kings were buried.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of dead kings, most Frenchmen view their country's
soccer chances more cynically than Romain. Although among the
planet's most rabid soccer countries and a major source of stars
for the elite clubs of Europe, France has been a miserable World
Cup failure since the competition was founded in 1930 by Jules
Rimet and Henri Delaunay.
</P>
<P>
   Who were Frenchmen, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 68 years and 15 tournaments, held quadrennially except
for a 12-year hiatus around World War II, Brazil has won four World
Cups, and the West Germans and the Italians three apiece. Argentina
and Uruguay are twice champions, and England captured the one
contested on its home sod in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Unbearable pressure
</P>
<P>
   Not only have Les Bleus _ not to be confused with Italy's
blue-jerseyed warriors, the Azzurri _ never held aloft the Cup,
they never have reached the final. And, worse, the French didn't
qualify to participate in the past two football fetes, missing out
on a trip to the United States in 1994 when they failed to beat
Israel or tie Bulgaria, losing to the latter with seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the newspaper Liberation ran the headline:
``FRANCE QUALIFIES! FOR 1998!''
</P>
<P>
   Which is now. With new coach, Aime Jacquet, a lame duck and in
trouble with the other 60 million experts _ Romain included _ with
whom he shares citizenship for utilizing a cautious,
defense-oriented style, France must go forth and try to withstand
the stifling pressure of its mission improbable.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians can relate to France's hard place next to that
rock. In 1990, they were the hosts playing before a hysterical
populace. I remember being in a remote village the night of a game
and listening while every home, mostly dark except for the blue
glare of the TV, erupted in roars when an Italian player did
anything other than fall on his face. And that's what Italy,
collectively, did in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, was expected of the Americans in '94 except
for them to be good sports. It was our party, but we didn't have a
big dog in the fight. Reaching the second round was a huge
accomplishment, and it will be no less of one for the U.S. team
here as well.
</P>
<P>
   The short list of championship contenders is just that: Brazil
and Argentina from South America; Germany, Italy and Spain from
Europe; and, out of Africa, Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina defeated Brazil in a friendly and has the softest of
groups through which to play, meaning it can save energy for the
big matches. But Brazil is Brazil and Ronaldo is Ronaldo, the most
gifted and stylish of the 704 players in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Spain is 31-1 since the last World Cup but shares France's
problem, a lack of past successes to provide comfort in moments of
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have lost two key defensive specialists from the
runner-up team of '94, but they remain a heavy on historical
momentum alone. As do the Germans, who, although aging, seldom make
mistakes and have a tremendous will to win.
</P>
<P>
   Handful of favorites
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians might not have a national mandate to win, but they
have sufficient talent. Four years ago, they came within three
minutes of beating Italy, and when they claimed the gold medal in
the '96 Olympics, they caught Brazil and Argentina from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Internal jealousies have created discord and might reduce the
Nigerians to underachieving malcontents. If not, a breakthrough
seems immiment, and fittingly so because outgoing Federation
Internationale de Football Association president Joo Havelange has
been a good friend to the African soccer federations during his
iron-willed 24-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the 82-year-old Brazilian say he bought African votes
to heighten his grip on soccer's governing body, but nobody can
argue he hasn't grown the competition on his watch. TV income in
1978 was $100 million; in 2002, it will be $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is serious business, even with what must still be
described as tepid support from the United States. America's
passion for sport might be extreme but no more so than the rest of
the world's. For France, the Coupe de Monde '98, is certain to be a
source of intense national pride yet, ultimately, severe national
angst.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Romain. But bonchance anyway.

Puck samples some of his own work at his new Spago in Beverly
Hills, Calif. The new Spago is considerably less casual than the

Puck, a classically trained French chef, continues to reinvent food
and once more proves that American dining is coming of age. (Susan

the trip accross the Atlantic in dry, styrofoam boxes the turbot
flutter back to life once in the tanks at the Imperial Seafood in
Chinatown. The France Turbot company has been able to keep some
turbot alive for 40 hours out of water, but its goal is less
ambitious. It guarantes a 100 percent survival rate after 24 hours,
so that the fish can easily make the 18-hour journey from Paris to
Tokyo. (Ed Quinn/New York Times Photo)

Brocoletti and broccolini goes by several aliases, but this small

broccolini is harvested five times a year and is therefore more
like a firm, yet pliant sprout. (Boyd Hagen/New York Times Photo)

RESCUERS CLAW THROUGH MOUNTAIN OF GRAIN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA, Kan. _ While anxious family members waited and prayed,
dozens of rescue workers desperately dug through tons of grain and
debris on Tuesday in search of four men who were trapped after an
explosion at one of the world's largest grain elevators in this
Midwestern city.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty rescue workers made their way to a 200-foot area in one
of four tunnels at the bottom of the elevator, using shovels and a
grain vacuum to clear a path.
</P>
<P>
   The four missing men were believed to be working in that area at
the time of the explosion on Monday, and search dogs reinforced the
belief that humans were in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relatively confident there are spaces in between grain
piles and debris,'' said Kenneth Cox, division chief of the
Sedgwick County Fire Department. ``We've got a good chance of
bringing them in alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were faced with tons of rubble and grain as they
searched for the missing workers. Two people died in the grain-dust
explosion, which is believed to have occurred when a spark ignited
dust suspended in the air, at the DeBruce Grain elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred about 9:20 a.m. central time on Monday.
It shook homes miles away and left 11 people injured.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, which has a capacity of 24 million bushels, had
been cited at least twice in the last few years for excessive grain
dust by inspectors from the U.S. Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent
investigators to the scene Tuesday, and a local official said the
agency had not been notified of the Agriculture Department's
earlier findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had been,'' said Thomas Marple, area director for
the federal safety agency. ``We might have been able to do
something about it before the explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Searchers have been focusing on 800 feet of a 1,600-foot tunnel.
As of Tuesday night, less than 200 feet was left to be excavated,
Cox said. Progress was slower Tuesday than Monday because rescue
workers had to resort to a different method of shoring up the
ceiling of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the four missing men, who were described by
officials as maintenance workers, stood by at Oatville Elementary
School to get updates on the search for their loved ones. Some sat
outside at picnic tables in the afternoon sunlight, waiting for
word. Every two hours, the families heard from officials, who then
briefed reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're anxious to see what's going on,'' said the Rev. Dave
Castleberry, minister of the Glenn Park Christian Church in
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're optimistic. We're on the same boat and we're
encouraging one another. ``There are tears off and on. We're all
trying to get through it. We're praying constantly.''

GLASS: IT CAN COVER A CASSEROLE, AND ALSO ENCHANT AN EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14.)  
 (JT)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is easy to laugh at the utopian fervor with which early
20th-century architects championed the use of glass. ``The face of
the earth would be much altered if brick architecture were ousted
everywhere by glass architecture,'' wrote the poet Paul Scheerbart,
a cheerleader for the so-called Glass Chain, a group of
Expressionist architects whose belief in glass was virtually
religious. ``We should then have a paradise on earth, and no need
to watch in longing expectation for the paradise in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   What a chucklehead! But then you go cruising around town in a
car with a moon roof, or visit a house with a glass-enclosed
atrium, your mood naturally brightens, and you realize: Scheerbart,
Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius and their fellow glass fanatics weren't
such fools.
</P>
<P>
   A new project by Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson goes
far toward recapturing the early modern enthusiasm for glass. A
remodeling and expansion of the Corning Glass Center in Corning, N.
Y., the Smith-Miller &AMP; Hawkinson design is not large in scale. But
it restores an aura of enchantment to a material that has become
commonplace and to a period of architecture that, not long ago, had
fallen out of style.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Corning's corporate campus, just west of
Elmira, N.Y., the Glass Center was designed in 1951 by Wallace
Harrison of Harrison &AMP; Abramowitz, architect of the Metropolitan
Opera House, the United Nations Headquarters and other New York
landmarks. Originally, the center consisted of just two buildings,
joined in an L-shape. One of these was the Steuben factory, an
industrial shed capped with a flaring ventilator roof, where all of
Steuben's glittering glassware is produced to this day. Attached to
the shed was a low, International Style glass box that housed a
glass museum and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Lens? If you grew up in the fifties, you may well
have a memory of it tucked away somewhere: the gigantic reflecting
lens made by Corning for the telescope at Mount Palomar
Observatory. The disk came out of the oven with flaws, so its
mirrored surface was never polished. Instead, the lens became the
Glass Center's iconic exhibition. Its roundness and honeycomb
structure were ominous, a spooky mandala of modern science, while
the flaws gave it the quality of a Japanese object of meditation.
You couldn't tell if this was the eye of humankind staring at the
heavens, or the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of the Glass Center's two structures told a
story: how modern architecture evolved from the industrial
vernacular of sheds, factories, greenhouses. Like a vase blown from
a lump of molten sand, culture could be fashioned from raw matter.
The culture here was corporate at its most benign. Besides the
museum, the center contained a library, a small theater for musical
performances, even a bowling alley for Corning employees. This was
the statement of an enlightened company in a company town.
</P>
<P>
   The loveliest feature of Harrison's design was a round
courtyard, enclosed by (naturally) the world's largest curved glass
sheets. A small fish pond was fitted with a glass bottom, which
helped to illuminate the cafeteria one floor below. For a time,
this was the place to lunch in Corning: a light, lucid, open space
for the postwar way of life.
</P>
<P>
   This style of gracious modern living did not survive the 1960s.
Eventually, the cafeteria was moved to another part of the campus,
the courtyard covered over. Other assaults on the Glass Center's
integrity came from outside. A highway-widening program paved over
the ends of the center's original curved driveway, leaving its
entrance ramp flapping in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the clarity that was the point of the entire exercise had
been forgotten. In 1972, the Michigan architect Gunnar Birkerts was
hired to design a new building for the glass museum and library. A
silvery-skinned structure with a curvilinear, free-form shape, the
museum wraps around one corner of Harrison's building like a giant
glass-eating amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass Center's decline mirrored that of the movement that
produced it. But Smith-Miller and Hawkinson's plan, while deeply
sympathetic to Harrison's, should not be mistaken for a modernist
revival. Instead of restoring Harrison's building, they have
rethought the Glass Center in contemporary terms. The guiding idea
seems to be: If it's broken, break it some more.
</P>
<P>
   Smith-Miller and Hawkinson were initially hired four years ago
to create a temporary exhibition gallery in a corner of Harrison's
building. On the basis of that project, they were invited to expand
and remodel the entire center. The plan is being constructed in
phases and is to be completed in May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The plan's most prominent architectural features are two slim,
glazed additions, clamped to the east and west sides of Harrison's
building like a pair of faceted quartz bookends. The western
addition, now completed, contains a lobby for a new auditorium, a
cafe and overhead corridors that link the Steuben factory to the
Birkerts building. More important, the addition creates a visual
and spatial whole out of the center's three structures. The
addition's irregularly angled facade serves as a poised, push-pull
mediator between the existing buildings' volumes and voids.
</P>
<P>
   The addition to the east side of Harrison's building is somewhat
larger and will contain the center's main entrance lobby and an
orientation theater. Sheer formal exuberance, however, is this
addition's chief function: the play of reflections and the glimpses
of light and space within as visitors pull up along a new sloping
driveway. Here, as in Jean Nouvel's Cartier Foundation in Paris,
the objective is to expand the expressive properties of glass by
extending sheets of it beyond the building envelope. At Corning,
the effect is heightened by the angling of the wall's segments. The
angles insure that the glass is seen not only as three-dimensional
planes but as two-dimensional edges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 750-seat auditorium, glass is visible only in the light
bulbs. But the faceting motif continues in the acoustical baffles,
wooden panels that stretch across the upper side walls in sharp,
angular folds. Beneath the wood, panels of unpolished green-gray
serpentine stone wrap the lower part of the hall in a discreet
mineral frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If brick architecture were ousted everywhere ... '' Polemical
phrases like Scheerbart's help explain the conventional view that
modern architects were out to sabotage tradition. But as Smith
Miller and Hawkinson's design makes clear, they have been among its
most dedicated custodians throughout this century. There is a Glass
Chain that runs from Joseph Paxton to Taut to Mies van der Rohe to
Harrison to Nouvel to David Chipperfield to Toyo Ito and beyond. No
other architects of this century have displayed more vibrantly such
traditional qualities as lucidity, harmony, wholeness, scale,
procession and the creativity necessary to renew their continuity
from one generation to the next. At Glass Center 2000, the chain
goes on.

AFTER ITS RAPID DEMISE, JAZZ SEEKS RESURRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Four days ago, they were the most economical and
efficient team in basketball. One minute away from putting Michael
Jordan's team in a two-game hole on its home floor, the Utah Jazz
appeared to have all the artillery necessary to end the Chicago
Bulls' championship reign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Karl Malone and John Stockton are 48 minutes away from
going down, 3-1, and being devoured by the Bulls. They will take
the United Center floor on Wednesday night for Game 4 of the league
championship series searching for their confidence and anything
resembling an offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to be told that tomorrow is a must-win game,''
the reserve center Greg Foster said on Tuesday. ``You can sense it
and feel it. Giving away another game would be like giving up our
hopes of winning a title.''
</P>
<P>
   In the worst loss in finals history, a 96-54 defeat in Game 3,
Utah scored the fewest points in a National Basketball Association
game _ playoffs or regular season _ since the inception of the shot
clock in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by 1 point with less than a minute remaining in
Game 2 before falling to the Bulls, the Jazz has essentially gone
from putting Chicago on the ropes to desperately needing a victory
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, meanwhile, have no intention of going back to Salt
Lake City for either Game 6 or 7, preferring to end the series in
five games on Friday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always responded well after a tough loss like that, so
there's no reason to think any different,'' Malone said. ``I like
our attitude now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Jazz has dealt with adversity well in the playoffs
this season. Utah was down, two games to one, to the Houston
Rockets in a three-of-five-game first-round series. The Jazz
rebounded and won in five games on its home floor. In the second
round, Utah was annihilated by San Antonio in Game 3 at the
Alamodome before coming back to win Game 4 and close the Spurs out
in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But that was Houston and San Antonio. This is Jordan, Scottie
Pippen and the ring dynasty. If the Bulls win Game 4, Chicago will
almost be assured of winning its sixth title in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can create distance between them and us, we can put
ourselves a step closer,'' Jordan said. ``We can put them closer,
put their backs closer to the wall, put them in a panic
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have made the necessary adjustments after a Game 1
loss in overtime, letting Pippen play off his man and operate as a
roving help defender. Dennis Rodman has plastered himself on
Malone's elbow, and no one on the Jazz roster has been able to
contend with Jordan physically.
</P>
<P>
   About the only good news for the Jazz going into Wednesday's
game was that its power forward did not skip practice on Monday to
hang out with Hulk Hogan and a cast of professional wrestlers in
Detroit. Rodman is indeed at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's irascible forward caused so much of a distraction by
skipping practice and flying to Detroit on Monday to participate in
a World Championship Wrestling extravaganza, the parties involved
almost forgot they had a game to play on Wednesday night at the
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   While Coach Phil Jackson and the Bulls welcomed their wayward
forward back with open arms, Jerry Sloan and the Jazz simply could
not relate. Instead of dealing with how they might recover from
their record loss, Sloan and his team wondered aloud how a
flamboyant role player could make a mockery of the league
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would discipline Rodman for his latest
transgression, ``First of all, I wouldn't have him,'' Sloan said.
``That's what makes the question real simple, because Dennis,
everybody knows what he's about. Winning has never been that
important to me. I'd just as soon lose if I had to be put in that
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I can deal with. Guys have a problem once in
a while, I can deal with that. But I can't deal with it when
winning is the only thing there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bulls and the NBA were each planning to fine Rodman
$10,000, the implication from the Jazz seemed to be that the Bulls
organization was letting Rodman make a mockery of the finals, that
Chicago would put winning before proper, old-school decorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about where this league is going without
Michael Jordan,'' Sloan said. ``I think it's important to realize,
if we want it to go in the other direction, where there is no
discipline and no respect, then those things will be important. To
me, they aren't. I know how corny it sounds, but when that is more
important than the game itself, we've lost our whole reason for
being here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were not buying that theory. Jackson said, ``In the
end result, Dennis always comes back and tries extra hard to
please.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls center Luc Longley said: ``I like having Dennis as a
teammate. The things he's brought to this team are far greater than
anything he is taking away from the team. Some of those long road
trips, he spices it up a little. He's a good bloke to have
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Longley added: ``Anyway, aren't we supposed to be talking about
basketball today? I would think Game 4 is fairly huge for the Jazz,
wouldn't you?''

SUDDENLY METS FANS CAN BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the ``Let's Go, Mets'' chant was heard in recent
years, it too often was a waste of loyal lungs. Most of those Mets
teams usually didn't go anywhere except down to the dungeons of the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   It's all different now. Mike Piazza's arrival nearly three weeks
ago suddenly provided Mets fans everywhere with a rebirth, with a
contender to root for, a team to believe in. Bobby Valentine
noticed this on the recent road trip through Florida, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time,'' the Mets' manager recalled, ``that
I've heard the `Let's Go, Mets' chant on the road before it was
drowned out by the local fans.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Valentine heard it at Shea Stadium during Tuesday
night's game with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, it wasn't drowned out.
It got louder as Hideo Nomo spun out of his corkscrew windup for
the first time in a Mets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers, the 29-year-old right-hander's record was 2-7
with a 5.05 earned run average. Piazza, his Dodger catcher for more
than three seasons, described Nomo's problems there as ``walking
guys, big-inning trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Over five innings Tuesday night, Nomo's performance was not much
different: four runs, five hits, five strikeouts, three walks, a
wild pitch and a balk.
</P>
<P>
   About three hours before the game, Nomo was sitting at his
locker, his back turned. He was reading a scouting report on the
Devil Ray hitters. At the next locker, Masato Yoshii was asked if
the report was in English or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``In English,'' Yoshii said through his interpreter, Bobby
Norton, ``but basically, it's in Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Baseball were an international language. But more and
more, of course, it is. More and more Latin American major leaguers
speak it. So do Nomo, Yoshii and the Yankees' Japanese import,
Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomo is a good competitor,'' Valentine said. ``He's got a good
fastball, a good forkball. I hope he's a good teammate. I just
don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' manager didn't consider the difference in real
language (as opposed to the language of Baseball) as a determining
factor in a ballplayer being a good teammate. To him, real language
is the least important factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is the willingness to be a teammate,''
Valentine said. ``With pitchers, when they're out there together in
batting practice, that's when you see some kind of togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other time is when there's a good play behind or when he
makes a bad pitch _ whether he's with them and they're with him.
Yoshii is good that way. He has a lot of traits that help people.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Mets staff that is the National League's best with a 3.02
earned run average, Yoshii has a 4-2 record, Rick Reed is 7-3, Al
Leiter 6-3 and Bobby Jones 5-3. Reed had a perfect game through 20
batters against the Devil Rays on Monday night before Wade Boggs'
double over center fielder Brian McRae's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rick's not pitching, he really watches hitters during a
game,'' Valentine said. ``He watches their feet, their swing, their
reaction to certain pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, Reed's control and command of his
three pitches has made him a potential member of the National
League team for the July 7 All-Star Game in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing he's always been able to do consistently is
throw the ball over the plate,'' Valentine said. ``He doesn't walk
many people. And he has three pitches that complement each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a fastball that will break to the outside part of a
left-handed batter's strike zone. He has a slider or a cutter that,
if he throws it to the center of the plate, will break to the
outside of a right-handed batter's strike zone. And he has a change
of pace that will break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the batter, when the ball is out there,'' Valentine
said, pointing a few feet away, ``you don't know where the ball is
going. One goes this way, one goes that way and one stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Mets, the best is yet to come _ the three-game
series with the Yankees that begins two weeks from Friday at Shea
and the National League wild-card race with the Cubs, Astros,
Giants and Padres. If the Mets qualify, it would be the first time
that both the Yankees and the Mets were in the post-season playoffs
together.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yankee fans should be chanting, ``Let's Go, Mets.'' In any
language. &QL;

TEXAS' HISTORY DOTTED WITH RACIAL CRIMES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Though Texas geographically is on the periphery of the
Old South, it shares the region's bloody history of race-motivated
hate crimes _ a legacy that continues to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   As Jasper authorities Tuesday sought to establish a motive in
the death of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was chained and
dragged to his death behind a pickup, the Texas Department of
Public Safety noted that most hate crimes in Texas are fueled by
racial or ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 72 percent of the 331 hate crimes reported in the
state fit that category _ compared with crimes against homosexuals
and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' violent history dates to the late 19th century when it
was among the South's most lynch-prone states. At least 355 people,
most of them blacks, died in Texas mob violence between 1889 and
1918.
</P>
<P>
   Laws outlawing mob and less lethal hate crimes have since been
passed, but incidents with possible racial components have
continued to occur _ even in Jasper, a city with a black mayor and
a population that is 45 percent African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, one of the most publicized cases of violence against
a black citizen occurred just up the road in the neighboring county
of Sabine 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day 1987, Loyal Garner, a Florien, La., father of
six, was arrested for drunken driving. Garner protested that he was
sober, and asked for field sobriety and breathalyzer tests, but
police took him to the county jail in Hemphill.
</P>
<P>
   Garner asked to be allowed to telephone his wife. Instead, he
was taken to the jail detox room and bludgeoned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner and two county
deputies, Billy Ray Horton and James M. Hyden, were convicted on
state murder charges and sentenced to prison. Horton's conviction
was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1988, Kenneth Simpson, a 30-year-old black man
arrested for the theft of a fountain pen, died in his Cleveland
jail cell after being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Half the city police force was suspended as a result, but later
returned to their jobs after being acquitted. However, Police Chief
Harley Lovings remained under public pressure and resigned the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   The pen later was found atop a soft drink machine in the police
station lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1987, Troy Lee Starling, 24, of Mount Enterprise was
fatally shot in the neck by a state highway trooper after a
high-speed chase in Rusk County.
</P>
<P>
   Though the trooper was cleared by a grand jury, Starling's
family filed a civil rights lawsuit against the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all incidents involved bloodshed, but still revealed a dark
side of East Texas culture.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrative was the hostility faced by three black families who
moved into an all-white public housing project in Vidor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The families were part of the third effort to integrate the
project. They moved in only after then-Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Henry Cisneros allocated $3 million to
upgrade security.
</P>
<P>
   But residents were soon frightened by death threats and the
obvious patrols of Ku Klux Klan members through the projects
displaying high-powered weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI later investigated alleged Klan death plots against
William Hale, director of the Texas Commission on Human Rights, and
Attorney General Dan Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joe Roy, head of the intelligence project of the Southern
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., suggested such crimes,
though stereotypical of the South, are no longer are limited to one
region. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think this is a stark reminder, this case in Texas, of what
can happen in this country,'' he said. ``Education is not the sole
answer, but it's one of the cornerstones of correcting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the races is fueled by competition between
economically marginal groups, Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode is a horrendous example of the rage that is out
there.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AT ST. JOHN'S, A NEW ERA REQUIRES A BIG NAME  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a split second of hesitation on the other end of the
line. Eric Barkley, the all-America guard who will attend St.
John's in September, learned that he might be the linchpin for a
new coach's championship aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis, the man St. John's wants to hire as its new head
basketball coach, wants to win a national title. Championships
begin at the point. Barkley is expected to be the man at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I want that, too,'' Barkley said. ``I never think about
me being a key part to a national championship team. But if he's
willing to go that far, I am, too. Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had an early introduction to the realities of big-time
basketball last month when Fran Fraschilla, who recruited him and
attended some of his games at Maine Central Institute, was suddenly
dismissed as the St. John's coach.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the school called Barkley in advance. He was
browsing the Internet when he learned of the dismissal. ``At first
I didn't believe it, because you cant believe everything you
read,'' he said. ``Then I went to my room and I saw it on ESPN. I
was just surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley rushed to see his coach, Max Good, and told him he was
transferring. ``I panicked a little,'' he said on Tuesday by
telephone from Maine. ``I was shocked, you know, Coach Fran being
as he had two years on his contract. I thought he would at least
get the chance to coach me. So when it happened, I just panicked.
Immediately, I didn't want to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Good told him to relax, to think about it. He thought about it,
and decided to come anyway. ``I wanted to honor my commitment,'' he
said. ``I didn't want people to think I don't honor my commitment.
And my mother really wanted me to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley left Maine for New York Tuesday night, and Wednesday
afternoon he will head over to St. John's and meet with his
teammates. But as of Tuesday night, they were an army without a
general.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre chase for a high-profile coach, St. John's has
backed itself into a corner; wrapped in a veil of silence, it has
put itself in a situation where it cannot lose, but cannot win,
either. If it hires a successful, high-profile coach, it runs the
risk of losing him to the National Basketball Association after a
few seasons. If it hires a hot up-and-coming coach, it risks losing
him to a program perceived to be on a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   What it wants to do with Jarvis is establish itself as one of
those programs at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis is asking for $800,000; St. John's has spent the
last week or so devising ways to give it to him, which would
effectively make him the highest-paid coach in St. John's history
and one of the highest paid in the Big East Conference. There were
excellent younger candidates, Paul Hewitt at Siena and Bob McKillop
at Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he preferred a new name. ``I like the underdog
coaches,'' he said. ``The underdog always wins. Look at St. John's.
They were the underdogs, they made it to the tournament. The
high-profile coach will come in with a lot of pressure. He's got to
take everything under control. Some players may not accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his salary being that much, he's going to want us to be,
like perfect. I'm ready to accept it. I'm ready to play. I'm just
worried about the other players. Are they with me? Ron is with me,
definitely, Glover, definitely, Tyrone.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his future teammates, Ron Artest, Tyrone
Grant and the incoming freshman Anthony Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we're just going to be a target,'' Barkley said.
``Everybody's going to be out to get us,''
</P>
<P>
   An official familiar with the negotiations said that Jarvis
wants to be able to compete for the national championship; he
cannot do that at George Washington. He feels he can do it at St.
John's, in a high-profile city and a high-pressure conference.
</P>
<P>
   The instant the contract is signed, St. John's will have
catapulted itself out of the mom-and-pop phase of the business and
into the new millennium. New arenas, escalated women's program.
High octane.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is ready to play. The Fraschilla firing, Barkley said,
``went through one ear and out the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be depressed or let a coach bring down my
career and my future status because he got fired,'' Barkley said.
``That's between him and the school.''
</P>
<P>
   But the incoming freshman admitted that this first dose of
reality hit him a little in the heart. ``Yeah, it did a little
bit,'' Barkley said. ``But life goes on. I got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The deed is nearly done. St. John's, for better or for worse,
begins a new era with a new coach. The old standard of judging
whether a coach and a school are compatible is no longer relevant.
In an age of mega-marketing, when eyes are glued to the ratings, a
high profile is tantamount to the right fit.

 &HT;    Memories gives Florida man strength to take on Catholic Church
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The 11-year-old altar boy with the wide
smile and neatly parted hair could stand it no more.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down with his mother and told her the brutal, graphic
details of his unbearable ordeals. He said the parish priest, a
trusted family friend, had sexually molested him many times during
the weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and bewildered, the mother called her husband at the post
office where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should we do?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe him,'' the father replied, ``because the same thing
happened to me when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1967, and Kevin Sidaway's long, anguished recovery
had officially begun. The 11-year-old had made his stand _ against
the predator rapist, against the Catholic Church, against the
insidious problem that ran wider and deeper than he could imagine,
damaging one generation then the next.
</P>
<P>
   Through the following three decades, Sidaway's courage would be
tested by the unrelenting memories of his tortured childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am constantly flooded with the images of me and my friends
having to endure these indignities,'' Sidaway said this week, his
voice trembling. ``There is no greater betrayal than having your
priest violate you. I have to live with anger every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 42, Sidaway has become, like his father, a postal
employee. He delivers mail along the Intracoastal Waterway in Lake
Worth, Fla., going door to door in the small resort area where
people know the people who stay when the snowbirds leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway's name is known because he decided to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   He did not file suit against the Catholic Church and his abuser,
Father Rocco D'Angelo, as an anonymous ``John Doe.'' He did it four
years ago as Kevin Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   He has not become the champion for molestation victims by quiet
work. He has spoken out loudly. He has spoken out often. And he has
spoken with his name: Kevin Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is a man who has come forward and said one of the
hardest things for a man to say,'' said James G. Souza III, a
Tampa, Fla. attorney who represents four other former altar boys,
``John Does,'' who were victimized by D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he stood up and said it anyway. I have never met him, but
my clients would like to talk to him to thank him. He gave them the
strength to pick up the telephone and come forward, too. If he
never does anything in his life, this is something truly great. It
was the bravest thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 other victims have since come forward and accused
D'Angelo of sexual assaults. Two weeks ago, Sidaway reached an
undisclosed settlement of his civil suit against the church. A
separate case is pending against D'Angelo, who has admitted
assaults against numerous victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rev. J. Keith Symons, bishop of the Diocese of Palm
Beach, Fla., was forced to step down after admitting he had
sexually molested five boys more than three decades ago. Symons had
been chancellor of the St. Petersburg, Fla. diocese in the 1970s
when D'Angelo was transferred there, after leaving St. Mark's
church in Boynton Beach where he terrorized Sidaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church covers up its own, one pedophile protecting
another,'' Sidaway said. ``There is a mindset in the church that
can blow away the souls of our children. If any of us had the
chance to stop the Oklahoma City bombing and save all those lives,
the lives of all those children, wouldn't we do it? I did what I
did for the same reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer horror of D'Angelo's attacks has left a darkness
within Sidaway that 25 years of therapy have tried to remove. He
has fought off alcohol and thoughts of suicide. As an altar boy,
Sidaway would cinch his wide black leather belt, the uniform of the
parochial school, as tight as he could stand it in the hope it
would protect him from D'Angelo. The daily struggle now is to
harness his rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I believed it was Jesus Christ that was raping me,''
Sidaway said. ``I would shake my fist at God. I would literally
curse him. I would call him every name in the book. I would tell
him to come down from heaven so I could fight him and whip him
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway and two of his fellow altar boys first confronted the
church in '67. They sat before three priests in an office at St.
Vincent DePaul's in Boynton Beach, Fla. Sidaway remembers the
exchanges vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us we should forget Father D'Angelo,'' he said.
``They said it was wrong to molest little children. They told us
that we should not go out and molest children when we grew up
because it was a sin. They asked us if it would be all right with
us if Father D'Angelo was sent somewhere where he could never hurt
children again. We all nodded yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Sidaway learned D'Angelo had not been
``sent away'' _ but transferred to St. Petersburg, where he would
claim more victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely heartbroken,'' Sidaway said. ``I couldn't
understand how the church had allowed more children to be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning that too much time had passed to pursue criminal action
against D'Angelo, Sidaway took his anger to civil court and
targeted the church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a monster, and they protected him,'' Sidaway said.
``Money will not satiate my anger. But I believe all victims should
take every dollar they can from the church. I will continue legal
action against D'Angelo. He will be hunted and haunted the rest of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Sidaway has developed a formula for living.
He confronts each thought as it comes to him, good or bad. ``I
cannot let the events of the past destroy me,'' he has said to
himself countless times.
</P>
<P>
   He takes comfort in the love of his family, his 21-year-old
daughter and his sons, 20 and 19, and draws strength from the
devotion of Maureen, his wife of 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has helped me so much,'' he said. ``She always told me:
God is not the author of what happened to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway's faith today comes from within. He occasionally attends
a Protestant church with Maureen; he reads the scripture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much turn the pages of the Bible as well as anyone
else,'' he says. ``I don't need anyone to preach to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Further inspiration comes from that photograph of the
11-year-old with the wide smile and neatly parted hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That child . . . I've always felt he has been crying out to me
for justice,'' Sidaway said. ``He was the one who gave me the
courage to go through this. I couldn't let him down.''

ASIAN CRISIS FORCES NEW CUTS AT BOEING
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. announced on Tuesday that weakening demand in
Asia would force it to cut production of its wide-body jets even
deeper than the company had previously indicated, resulting in
further job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's biggest aerospace company and the country's
leading exporter, said it would cut production of the 747 jumbo jet
by 30 percent early next year rather than the 20 percent reduction
it had hinted at two weeks ago. It will also cut production of the
newer 777 to five a month from seven a month.
</P>
<P>
   The move surprised Wall Street analysts who follow Boeing
because only a month ago the company was saying that strong orders
for the 777 might force it to raise the rate above seven a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things must be moving fairly quickly for this to come out in
the form it has,'' said Byron Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The 747, which carries more than 400 passengers, is the biggest
commercial jet on the market and is Boeing's most profitable
airplane by a wide margin. But it is mostly used to fly over the
Pacific Ocean to and from Asia. Since an economic crisis began to
sweep over much of Asia nearly a year ago, air traffic has plunged
and many airlines have delayed orders for new airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continued slow traffic growth in Asia has caused some
airlines to negotiate slides in deliveries of their 1999 747 orders
or to substitute other Boeing airplane models for their existing
747 orders,'' said Fred Mitchell, Boeing's executive vice president
of airplane production.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it would reduce production of the 747 to 3.5 a month
in the second quarter of 1999 from its current rate of five a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company has been plagued by problems since
last fall, when it was forced to halt production on the 747 and
narrow-body 737 jets because it did not have enough parts and
experienced workers to assemble the planes fast enough. The
production difficulties have since forced the company to take
billions of dollars in charges against earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The great fear on Wall Street was that by the time Boeing
recovered the boom in demand for new jets that began in 1996 would
begin to subside. That sequence of events may appear to be coming
to pass, though many analysts believe that strong demand for new
aircraft will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Tuesday that demand for its narrow-body planes,
especially the latest version of the 737, the world's most popular
commercial jetliner, remained strong. That is an indication of the
continued strength of the economies in Europe and North America,
where a larger number of smaller planes are used than in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The production-cutback announcement came after the stock market
had closed. Boeing shares rose 25 cents, to $46, on the New York
Stock Exchange.

FORMER SALOMON CHIEF TO REJOIN LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS BUFFETT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Denham, the former chairman and chief executive of
Salomon Inc., will rejoin Munger, Tolles &AMP; Olson, the Los Angeles
law firm where he long served as the primary lawyer for Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., headed by Warren Buffett.
</P>
<P>
   Denham, 52, joined Salomon as general counsel in 1991 in the
wake of a bond-trading scandal. He became chairman and chief
executive the next year, serving in that position until Travelers
Group bought Salomon late last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a partner at Munger, Tolles, Denham will specialize in
mergers and acquisitions and financial regulation. He also plans to
resume his old duties as one of Buffett's lawyers and,
unofficially, as Buffett's investment banker and financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett does not rely heavily on investment banks to arrange
acquisitions or help determine fair prices for his investments,
preferring to keep that work in-house, Denham said. As a result,
his lawyers often assume some duties normally associated with
bankers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The crowd grew quiet, knowing a solemn moment was
finally at hand. Pamela Foresman stepped forward. These were her
final minutes as Baltimore's Best Hon, the title she won at the
Cafe Hon last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reign may be over,'' Ms. Foresman said, handing a bouquet
of flowers to Sharon Gill, her successor. ``But once a Hon, always
a Hon.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what is a Hon, and why are they beloved enough that 200
people would spend a nice weekend afternoon in a restaurant parking
lot to celebrate their existence?
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, Hons are as much a part of Baltimore's cultural
landscape as crab cakes, the Orioles and Harbor Place. They have
earned their sociological niche for greeting friends and strangers
alike the same way _ ``Howya doin', Hon?'' _and speaking in
``Bawlmerese,'' a dialect indigenous to the area and virtually
unknown anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent fifth-annual Best Hon contest, Ms. Gill, a
44-year-old legal secretary, defeated two other contestants with
her quintessential Hon look: black stretch pants, faux tiger-skin
shirt, high-heeled sandals and wildly teased hair that takes her as
long as ``two arries'' _ translation from Bawlmerese, two hours _
to set properly in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my very first booty pageant,'' she told adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the accent, with its mangled vowel sounds and
fractured syntax, is not limited to Hons. Included in the day's
festivities was the Best Bawlmerese contest, in which one man sang
``Home on the Range,'' where in his version ``the deer and the
cantaloupe'' play. Finishing first was a pair of beehived
11-year-old Honchkins _ Chiari Lattanzi and Leah Platek _ who sang
a hilarious Bawlmerese version of ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the
theme song from the film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker John Waters has made a career of feasting on the
idiosyncrasies of Hons, setting ``Pink Flamingoes'' and
``Hairspray'' in the Baltimore neighborhoods he knew growing up.
All his characters speak in Bawlmerese, and many of his female
characters dress like Hons.
</P>
<P>
   But Hons and Bawlmerese seem harder to find now. As Baltimore
has polished its image with downtown redevelopment, new hotels,
first-class sports stadiums and reborn commercial centers, the Hon
life style, like the old, working-class neighborhoods that spawned
them, is slipping into the shadows of progress.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Hamden, a central neighborhood that was once a hotbed of
Hons and their families, the main thoroughfare, 36th Street, has
taken a decidedly upscale turn in the last few years, with new
restaurants, boutiques and refurbished row houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Main Streets are making a comeback, not just here but all
across the country,'' said Denise Whiting, 39, owner of Cafe Hon
who strapped on a foot-high beehive wig for her role as emcee.
``People are rethinking cities, to get them back to what they once
were, the hub of major activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes, here as elsewhere, have not come without pain,
especially to residents who find gentrification scary and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people are afraid of change,'' Ms. Whiting said. ``They
don't necessarily see it as positive. They're frightened by it.
They even felt more comfortable with the drug addicts and
prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was largely to celebrate the old Hon ways that Ms. Whiting
opened her 1950s-style restaurant six years ago and began the Best
Hon contest a year later. But even that seems to have gentrified,
with more faux Hons entering than real ones. The first year's
winner seemed legitimate enough, Kelly Gambino, a forklift
operator. But subsequent titles were captured by a professional
dancer, a medical writer and, last year, by Ms. Foresman, 32, a
lawyer who deflates her beehive for the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was saddened that Hons were disappearing, ``like
drive-in theaters.'' But she vowed to continue doing her part to
keep them alive, if only in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, someone asked me where all the Hons have gone,''
she told the crowd in parting remarks. `'It made me think that a
lot of things are gone, and we need to save 'em. Like duck-pin
bowling.''

JUDGE DISMISSES THREE JURORS FOR SLEEPING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In American courtrooms, the government rests after
presenting its case. The defense, too, rests. But woe to any jurors
who nod off during a trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, three jurors were thrown off a major gang trial after
the judge in the case, Shira Scheindlin of federal district court
in Manhattan, determined that they had ``spent the better part of
many trial days asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks have taken a bit of a nap here and there,''
Scheindlin said as, in a highly unusual step, she dismissed the
three jurors. ``I want to make sure that everybody has a fair
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the sleeping jurors had been simmering for weeks in
the case, in which seven men stand accused of membership in a
violent narcotics gang in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Since early March, the jury has been hearing the case under
heavy security, with extra marshals in the courtroom and with the
jurors being referred to only by number.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial neared its conclusion, a court transcript shows,
lawyers on both sides voiced concerns about the sleeping jurors,
and the judge agreed that three of them had ``been a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With the jury out of earshot, the prosecution suggested the
possibility of kicking three drowsy jurors off the case as a group,
but the defense disliked dismissing them as ``a package deal,'' as
one lawyer put it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a touchy issue for all the parties. With the stakes so
high for their clients, who could face life in prison if convicted,
none of the defense lawyers wanted to anger any jurors. And
sometimes defense lawyers have been known to prefer that jurors go
to sleep _ at least when the government is presenting its evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments from both sides on Friday, Scheindlin
had her staff research the issue. When she arrived in court on
Monday, she said she had decided that three jurors _ two regular
jurors and one alternate _ would have to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three jurors have spent an inordinate amount of time
asleep,'' she said. ``I conclude that they could not have heard a
significance percentage of the testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the defense lawyers made a last-ditch effort to keep
jurors on the panel. One lawyer, Labe Richman, said that he did not
see Jurors 7 or 16 sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   But Scheindlin disagreed. Juror 16, for example, sometimes had
``his head tipped far back asleep,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, Daniel Nobel, suggested that although
Juror 7 ``had her eyes closed, we don't really know if she was
asleep or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She could sit there with her eyes closed and listen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge disagreed with him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the three jurors into the courtroom, she thanked them
for their willingness to show up every day. ``But I did watch
carefully and there were times that each of you fell asleep,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   All three were excused, and the two regular jurors were replaced
with alternates. The rearranged jury began its deliberations
Tuesday.

   GREENE COUNTY, Ohio _ A Fairborn, Ohio fifth-grader failed all
main subjects throughout the school year, but was promoted to the
sixth grade anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the 11-year-old Five Points Elementary student
brought home F's in reading, communication skills, spelling,
mathematics, science, social studies and health. An F means ``work
shows insufficient growth for advancement to a higher level,'' the
report card said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made straight Fs in all the main subjects. The only thing
he didn't have an F in was gym, art and music,'' Yvette Sales said
of her son. The district's decision to promote him outrages her.
</P>
<P>
   Homework is the problem, both mother and son admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to do it on my spare time. School is six
hours, not 24,'' the boy told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The boy even understands the value he places on education. His
mother tells him ``20 times a day'' that you need an education to
get a job, the boy said, adding he's been grounded throughout the
year for bringing home failing grades.
</P>
<P>
   But Fairborn City School District administrators believe they're
right but are willing to work with Sales to reconsider the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon my knowledge of this situation, the school has
taken into account a variety of factors and made a decision they
feel is best for the child,'' Superintendent Steve Clifton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton said school districts commonly use a number of factors _
not just grades _ to decide whether a student is promoted to the
next grade. Furthermore, the district tried to involve Sales in the
decision to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, though, said she was never contacted and will demand that
her son remain in the fifth grade. She doesn't know how he'll be
able to grasp sixth-grade material.
</P>
<P>
   The district's decision, she said, also has taught her son a bad
lesson: he can still be promoted even though he did no homework and
received Fs in all the main subjects all year.
</P>
<P>
   Individual districts establish their own policies to determine
whether students are promoted or retained, said Monica Zarichny,
spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Fairborn's Promotion and Retention of Students policy states
that ``promotion procedures demand continuous analysis and study of
the cumulative student case history records so that guesswork and
conjecture may be reduced to a minimum and decisions may be as
objective as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Sales said her son was a fair student _ earning
Bs, Cs, and Ds _ and is going through a phase of laziness and
rebellion. The boy's teacher also said he was capable of doing the
work, but didn't complete homework, Sales said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron McDermott, a principal for 27 years, said the school has
tried to get Sales more involved in helping her son improve his
grades. ``We have done everything in our effort to provide the
interventions and to get parental involvement with limited
success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's report card said he was absent 23 days during the
school year, which Sales said was because of asthma problems and
other illnesses. Sales, a 28-year-old single mother of four who did
not attend high school, said she has tried to do her part and she
has preached ``the value of an education'' to her children, who
range in age from 4 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my kids to live the life I have and struggle,''
she said, adding she put her pursuit of a GED on hold to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said the decision to pass the boy was made after
consulting with the teacher and a team of other school officials.
Factors including age, previous retentions, parent participation,
academic ability and a student's attitude can factor into whether
to promote a student. Sales said her son has never been held back.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton would not discuss this case or the student's grades
because of confidentiality rules, but said he stands by the
decision
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many principals from time to time struggle with what's
in the best interest of kids and it's not always apparent to the
public that we serve that there are credible efforts being made to
serve the best interest of the student,'' he said.

   VICIDIOL, Albania _ The family farm of the former Albanian
president, Sali Berisha, who was driven from power last year, has
become a base for the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian
group fighting for independence for their province from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha's decision to turn over his birthplace to the rebels is
part of his skillful manipulation of the crisis in Kosovo to mount
a political comeback, Western diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   His return to power would not be welcomed by Washington, which
blames his administration for Albania's economic melt-down and
descent into lawlessness. The unrest began with the collapse of
pyramid schemes, many of them encouraged by the government, that
cost thousands of Albanians their savings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to back the armed movement in Kosovo could also
push Albania toward open conflict with Belgrade and spread the
fighting beyond Serbia's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased violence in the border region is
counterproductive,'' said Daan Everts, the representative in
Albania for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. ``Instead of reducing militancy, it has increased it inside
Kosovo and Albania. The more violence, the more militancy.''
</P>
<P>
   The stone farmhouse here, two miles south of Tropoje, with a red
tile roof and small, narrow windows, was surrounded Tuesday morning
with dozens of pack horses and 30 young men who were being issued
AK-47 assault rifles from an underground bunker in a field. Those
interviewed said they were preparing to cross the rugged border to
join the rebels and fight Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha's elderly cousin, Besnik Berisha, who had lived with his
wife and family in the house for several years, moved out a few
days ago, the men said. A newly built wooden fence around the
compound and piles of assault rifles and ammunition boxes gave the
place the feel of a fortress.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who move in darkness across the border into Kosovo,
spoke bitterly of the request by the prime minister, Fatos Nano,
Berisha's political rival, that NATO troops be stationed along the
border on the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want NATO troops here,'' said a young, bearded leader
who would not give his name. ``The deployment of NATO troops on the
border will only assist the Serbs and hurt our struggle. If NATO
troops go into Kosovo, we will welcome them and respect any
arrangement made by them, but they have no place in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred young ethnic Albanians, with tons of weapons and
supplies, have entered Kosovo during the last week with Kosovar
guerrillas based here. The influx drew heavy Serbian shelling and
blasts from 20-millimeter anti-aircraft canon, which pounded the
mountain range along the border on Monday night and Tuesday.
Thousands of refugees have fled Kosovo for Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha's decision to turn the border region under his control
into a staging area for the guerrilla army is popular here in the
north, where many Albanians have relatives in Kosovo and have
accepted refugees into their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Nano, who had condemned the armed movement in
Kosovo, has begun referring to the guerrilla movement as ``armed
resistance'' and the struggle as ``legitimate self-defense.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The arms trafficking, paid for by ethnic Albanians in Germany
and Switzerland, is enriching Berisha's supporters and swelling his
power base. The trafficking, which underlines the fact that Nano's
administration lacks control over whole sections of the country,
has also welded the growing rebel army in Kosovo to Berisha's
political party.
</P>
<P>
   Berisha refers to the fighting in Kosovo as a holy war and has
called on ethnic Albanians to ``defend their homes and their
land.'' He has called Nano's government an ``enemy of the Albanian
nation'' for failing to support the rebel cause. He defines the
``Albanian nation'' as including not only Albania but also Kosovo
and western Macedonia, which itself is dominated by ethnic
Albanians. Berisha refers to the Serbian forces as ``barbarians''
and the rebels as ``blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Albania has been flooded with more than 10,000 refugees. A few
hundred new arrivals come each day. Local television runs frequent
pictures, shown throughout the day in homes and coffee shops, of
lines of refugees and weeping mothers speaking of suffering and
violence inflicted by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Kosovo, which has taken at least 250 lives since
March, has intensified in recent days with attempts by the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to force residents from villages
along the border and raze what remains. The campaign is seen as an
effort to thwart the arms smuggling and crossborder incursions by
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In the anarchy that swept Albania last year, mobs stole 650,000
weapons and tons of military equipment from local armories. Many
weapons were smuggled into Kosovo and old stockpiles, as well as
new purchases, are swelling the rebel inventory, Western diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, armed gangs with assault rifles in the trunks
of their cars roam freely. Police and local officials are corrupt
or powerless, and factories and stores, looted and gutted last year
in the upheaval, stand idle and deserted. Cars are stopped on the
roads during the day and stolen by brigands, and there are frequent
shoot-outs in the dusty village streets to settle feuds and
rivalries.

BAPTIST LEADERS DEFEND `SUBMISSIVE WIVES' STATEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
and CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Southern Baptist Convention leaders Tuesday
defended a new doctrinal statement on the family that defines the
role of husbands as providers and leaders and asks that wives
``submit graciously to the servant leadership of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates overwhelmingly approved the addition of the family
statement to the Baptist Faith and Message in a show of hands vote
on the opening day of the annual national convention meeting at the
Salt Palace. The 35-year old Baptist Faith and Message consists of
denominational statements on spiritual issues although it is not
binding on the 15.9 million members. However, it is the closest
thing to a creed, which the convention has.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Jordan, chairman of the statement committee, called it a
biblical response to family deterioration and cultural immorality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce, homosexuality, abortion and abuse all tear at the
fabric of the family,'' said Jordan, an official of the Baptist
General Convention of Oklahoma. ``While there have been a barrage
of books from every perspective on the family, we have failed to
give a clear call to biblical principles of family life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is the uniting of one man and one woman in a covenant
for a lifetime,'' said the statement, which implicitly rejects
homosexuality and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   While husbands and wives are equal before God, they have
different roles, the statement said. ``A husband is to love his
wife as Christ loved the church,'' it said. ``He has the God-given
responsibility to provide for, to protect and to lead his family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A wife is to submit graciously to the servant leadership of
her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of
Christ,'' it reads. ``She, being in the image of God as is her
husband and equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to
respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the
household and nurturing the future generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction among Baptists not attending the meeting varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I agree with the biblical admonition that wives
should submit to their husbands,'' said Doris Gardner Ratliff, wife
of the Rev. Joe Ratliff, pastor to Houston's 9,000-member Brentwood
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Modern believers must understand the context of the admonition,
she said. It was made at a time when Christians were not adhering
the moral principles they should follow. Christians today embrace
the precept because they believe Scripture applies to modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that does mean is that hopefully the wife has been led to
a Christian man by the Holy Spirit who she can respect enough to
submit to,'' she said. ``What that doesn't mean is _ if you don't
respect your husband and you know in your heart that he is not
leading you and your family in the right way _ that doesn't mean
you should let him lead you down a path of destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Baptists were sharply critical of the amendment's
passage, linking it to the convention's increasingly conservative
course in the past decade and to earlier social dilemmas perplexing
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amendment is historically consistent,'' said Bill Leonard,
a Baptist historian and dean of Wake Forest University's Divinity
School in Winston-Salem, N.C. He noted Baptists more than 100 years
ago used certain biblical texts to defend slavery _ something the
convention publicly repented over and apologized for several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it will be another century before they apologize
to women,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Baptists have interpreted the statement as suggesting that
women should stay home to care for children rather than work. The
statement also describes children as a blessing from God beginning
from the ``moment of conception.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tim Owings of Georgia tried to amend the statement
arguing that Scripture in the writing of the Apostle Paul required
mutual submission between spouses. ``Husbands, wives and children
are as followers of Jesus to submit to each other and supremely to
the lordship of Christ,'' Ownings said. ``If we are going to amend
the Baptist Faith and Message, let us do so being true to Holy
Scripture and not contrary to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment failed as did an amendment by Dennis Wiles of
Alabama, who proposed to include single adults, widows, widowers
and childless couples in the statement. He said the statement was
directed to marriage and parenting.
</P>
<P>
   The statement's seven-member committee, which included two
women, defined the conservative family definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue comes down to a matter of Scripture,'' said
Mary Mohler, wife of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
President Albert Mohler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a scholar to be able to interpret what is so
clearly laid out in God's blueprint for the family'' Mary Mohler
said. ``Submission is not a negative word. It may not be
politically correct word, it may not be a popular word, but it is a
biblically correct word, and that's what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mary Mohler and fellow committee member Dorothy Patterson,
wife of convention president Paige Patterson, said they obeyed
their husbands in family issues.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Richard Land, director of the convention's
religious liberty agency, said the statement did not prohibit women
from working outside the home. But Land said if a husband did not
want his wife to work, she should not.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Patterson, who was elected convention president Tuesday
without opposition, also defended the statement in his first
presidential press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a statement that is made in a time of growing crisis in
the family,'' Patterson said. ``Frankly, I am a little surprised
that anybody is surprised (by the statement),'' he said. He said
Southern Baptists have long followed the biblical model of family
long before the advent of feminism and women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a negative statement against anybody or
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The original version of the Faith and Message Statement was
drafted in 1925, in a period of great disagreement among Protestant
liberals and conservatives over Scripture interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The language added Tuesday was prepared by seven-member
committee, with members taken from top Baptist leaders. Of the two
women on the committee, one was Dorothy Patterson, wife of the new
convention president.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists may also have adopted the amendment because the
convention is meeting for the first time in Salt Lake City,
headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Prior to the convention's opening Tuesday, Baptists erected large
billboards and conducted an evangelism blitz, an unusual move among
Mormons who are also known for their proselytizing zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists ``wanted to speak strongly about the family in Mormon
territory because the strongest national claim that Mormons make
about their faith is the strength of their families,'' Leonard
said. ``It's not insignificant that this was done in Utah, right
after he effort to evangelize Mormons.''

U.S. AND INDUSTRY DISCUSS DATA ENCRYPTION
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN.: Calif.)  (ja) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading computing executives, including Microsoft's
chief executive, Bill Gates, huddled for two hours on Tuesday with
Attorney General Janet Reno and the director of the FBI to discuss
disagreements between the industry and the government over data
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the White House said it hoped that the talks
would lead to an easing of export restrictions on data encryption
technology by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of industry leaders encourages us now to redouble
our efforts with industry,'' said a White House official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. ``Without a solution, we risk losing
our lead in this important technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement ``must include further real relaxation in export
controls,'' the official said, adding: ``We are still discussing
exactly what those relaxations should be. That's the $64,000
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives who took part in the meeting at the office of
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., had little to say afterward. But
their very presence in one room was highly unusual _ a sign of just
how critical it has become for high-technology companies, privacy
advocates and the administration to resolve their years-long
stalemate on encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The United States currently prohibits, without special
permission, the export of strong encryption, a policy that even the
Clinton administration has acknowledged is hurting the dominance of
American encryption technology in the international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration, under pressure from Louis Freeh, the FBI
director, has insisted that any easing of export controls be
coupled with creation of a system that guarantees law enforcement
quick access to encrypted files.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been pushing for a third-party key recovery, or
``key escrow,'' system, that would essentially require anyone who
uses encryption to file a ``spare key'' for that data-scrambling
code with a company set up for that purpose. This method is
supposed to guarantee law-enforcement agencies access to encrypted
computer files in criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and privacy groups have balked at any third-party
recovery systems, a position that has stalled attempts to ease
export controls.

NEW YORK UTILITY RECORDS SHOW HUGE DEMAND BY ITS CHIEF

<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Newly released documents show that members
of the Long Island Lighting Co.' board were trying to keep the
compensation package of the company's chairman secret but were
worried that the chairman was demanding so much _ $63 million _
that it would force the issue into the open.
</P>
<P>
   According to minutes of the board's private meeting on May 18,
just days before Lilco was set to go out of existence, board
members did not want to give the chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos,
the compensation he was demanding but feared that if they did not
concede, the dispute would become public.
</P>
<P>
   Such a disclosure, they feared, could result in a backlash from
Albany and Lilco shareholders that could jeopardize the company as
it was about to close two major deals, completing a partial
takeover of its electrical service by the state through the Long
Island Power Authority and merging its remaining divisions with the
Brooklyn Union Gas holding company to form the Marketspan Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open a Pandora's box and create more aggravation
from Albany than we would dream of,'' a consulting director, Eben
Pyne, warned, according to the minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that occurred before the closing, which is less than two
weeks away, and the disagreement was disclosed,'' he said, ``I
suspect that would be the beginning of shareholder lawsuits and
Albany becoming concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Catacosinos' service to Lilco, Pyne urged the board to
negotiate a fair settlement. But he warned, ``If we don't, then I
believe that we're in for a storm and a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Catacosinos and the board kept their dispute private
and eventually agreed on the $42-million compensation package on
May 27 _ just one day before he signed the final papers completing
the takeover and merger.
</P>
<P>
   The board minutes bolster accusations, made by Gov. George
Pataki and other critics of the Lilco payments, that Catacosinos
and Lilco's directors purposely concealed the payments. Former
Lilco officials, who have now assumed posts in Marketspan, have
contended that the payments were based on policies that Lilco
publicly disclosed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has denounced the payment to Catacosinos, along with $25
million more paid to 25 other Lilco officials, as a form of
robbery. He has called on Marketspan to rid itself of the former
Lilco officials who were involved in the special payments,
including Catacosinos, now chairman of Marketspan, the other
recipients of special compensation and the former Lilco directors
who authorized the payments.
</P>
<P>
   At the governor's request, the payments are being investigated
by the state attorney general, Dennis Vacco, and the state Public
Service Commission. Catacosinos received a subpoena on Monday to
appear before investigators next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is further evidence of the outrageous conduct of this
company and apparently confirms their attempt to conceal the
information,'' Vacco said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Catacosinos presided over the May 18 meeting, the
minutes indicated that the board was in a deep conflict with him.
Besides Catacosinos, 10 other directors were present and one was
linked by telephone. At certain points, recesses were taken so that
eight directors could confer with their independent counsel. There
are references to personal consultants hired by Catacosinos to
calculate his compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive comments in the minutes were from Pyne, a
nonvoting official affiliated with Lilco for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand our concern with respect to potential
shareholders' litigation and Governor Pataki's possible concerns if
there was a disclosure of a dispute with respect to the Lipa
transaction,'' Pyne was quoted as saying, referring to the Long
Island Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, as I understand it, the board intends to offer Bill a
take-it-or-leave-it number,'' he continued, ``that could place Bill
in the untenable position of having to notice the board that he
will arbitrate.''
</P>
<P>
   In that event, Pyne said, the dispute would have to be disclosed
in company documents.

FINDING A PLACE FOR SMALL MOVIES IN THE BIG PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (JT)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Altogether, it has been a high-profile month for First Run
Features. Once again the small New York film and video distributor
is succeeding in acting a little too big for its acquisition
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Now playing at the Lincoln Square and Quad theaters in
Manhattan, ``Insomnia,'' a chilly Norwegian psychological thriller
released by First Run, has earned top-flight reviews. The film
stars Stellan Skarsgard as an investigator implicated in a murder.
``The hottest Swedish import since Garbo,'' John Anderson wrote of
the actor in Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown at Film Forum, ``The Disenchanted,'' another First Run
release, is also doing well after high praise from critics. A
French film directed by Benoit Jacquot, it stars Judith Godreche as
a precocious 17-year-old who on a dare from her boyfriend agrees to
sleep with the ugliest man she can find. An ``uncannily rich
evocation of a young woman's turbulent inner life,'' Stephen Holden
wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   When these movies are through in New York, or perhaps before,
they will move on to selected theaters around the country, playing
in only one or two at a time to conserve and concentrate promotion
money, and then on to video.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Wishman, First Run's president, has a reputation for
knowing just how to handle a small film. ``He's not a Miramax or an
October Films,'' said Karen Cooper, director of Film Forum, which
books quite a few First Run films. ``He doesn't have that kind of
buying power or capitalization. But with a very minimal budget, he
does a good job of opening a lot of this work nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishman got into movies in 1985 after a career as a criminal and
civil rights lawyer and then as a writer. ``I was writing books,
which got me out of the law and into being incredibly lonely,'' he
said. About the same time, First Run, which was begun in 1979 and
had earned a reputation for getting small films into New York art
houses, was in financial difficulty and looking for new leadership.
Wishman loved movies, and he needed someone to talk to. ``Mainly
they were creditors yelling, `Where's my money?' _ but at least it
was people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, First Run specialized in perhaps not the most
exciting documentaries in the world _ ``earnest, do-good lefty
films,'' Wishman said. As a first step, he broadened the repertory
and turned the tide with two highly successful films, albeit
documentaries: ``28 Up'' (1985), the culmination of Michael Apted's
series following a group of Britons from childhood to adulthood,
and ``Sherman's March'' (1986), in which Ross McElwee uses
Sherman's Civil War route to reflect on his own life and the women
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Up'' played first at Film Forum. In those days the theater
had only two screens. ``After three weeks Karen didn't have room
for it,'' Wishman said, ``so we moved it to the Bleecker Street
Theater,'' where it had a long run.
</P>
<P>
   As these films kept the company in business, he searched the
country for theaters that would book First Run films. ``Sherman's
March'' presented a special problem because it was made in 16
millimeter. ``I made a list of theaters that had 16 millimeter and
would be willing to play the film,'' he said. ``Sherman's March,''
he said, eventually played in 200 theaters for periods ranging from
a week to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed a network,'' Wishman said. ``We played one or two
cities at a time, not many at once, because it was too expensive to
advertise.'' First Run films depend on good reviews. ``Sometimes
they get awards; sometimes they get audiences,'' he said. This
year, ``Watermelon Woman,'' Cheryl Dunne's autobiographical film
about lesbian life, was released on video after a national theater
run in 100 cities, one or two cities at a time over a year.
</P>
<P>
   First Run got into video in the late 1980s, at first without
much success. ``We'd get large advances from larger video
companies, but they tended to sell to chains in large numbers,''
Wishman said. They didn't know what to do with First Run films, so
he moved on to smaller companies. They didn't know, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was utterly dependent on a sales force that was at best
indifferent, if not hostile, to the kind of titles we had,'' he
said. ``So I couldn't develop customers I could be independent
with.'' As Wishman had with theaters, he ended up building a list
of 2,000 video stores that he could sell to directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All small distributors are guided by one person's passions and
sensibilities,'' Ms. Cooper said. Wishman builds his inventory in
categories that interest him: politics, religion, gay and lesbian
subjects, the fine arts, to name a few. Most of his titles come
from film festivals or from producers who have become acquainted
with his taste for films with a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berlin is a good festival for me,'' he said. ``I occasionally
go to Cannes, but film makers there have much larger expectations
and want large advances. I usually have to wait for them to be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the animator Michael Sporn was looking for a
distributor for his award-winning short feature ``Whitewash,'' a
devastating story about a young black girl who is taunted by gang
of toughs who spray-paint her face white. ``First Run had seen the
film in festivals and wanted to distribute it, but I, of course,
wanted a big company and held off,'' said Sporn.
</P>
<P>
   Offers materialized but Sporn didn't feel comfortable with any
of them. ``Since I loved this film, I wanted someone to take care
of it,'' he said. Two years later he called First Run, which
immediately took ``Whitewash.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will release two more Sporn films. ``They seem to
jump at the chance to release more interesting films,'' Sporn said.
``As an independent animator, I can't argue with that.''

PLAYING YOURSELF  
 CLOSING THE KITCHEN  
 MINOR OMISSION

   NEW YORK _ ``Usually I'm the person standing on the sidewalk
going: `Look, they're filming a movie; are there any movie
stars?''' said Lisa G., a radio personality who also appears as an
entertainment reporter on WCBS-TV (and who uses only the first
letter of her last name, which is Glasberg).
</P>
<P>
   But this time, she was one of the stars in a scene in ``Macbeth
in Manhattan.'' The script called for her to play herself and
interview John Glover, the actor, outside the Cherry Lane Theater
in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an out-of-body experience, hearing them say, `Lights,'
`Speed,' `Action,' and being there in the middle of it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently Glover was not prepared for the Lisa G. approach
to acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Do you want to rehearse our lines?''' she recounted.
``I said, `No.' This was when we were waiting in the holding area.
I was feeling intimidated and my mind just went blank. He said,
`Oh, come on. I think it will help us get into the scene.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want me to take anything personally because of his
character, which I knew about from reading the script: I was almost
a thorn in his side, and he didn't want to be interviewed, but I
had to talk to him, just a reporter doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was shot in a single take. Then came her close-up. ``I
had to say: `Excuse me, I haven't done this before. What do we do?'
It wasn't an easy question to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Rent Gets No Stars
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rosenzweig, the chef, is throwing in the toque at Arcadia,
a restaurant on East 62nd Street near Madison Avenue with a
woodsy-looking wraparound mural.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenzweig said that she and her partner in Arcadia, Ken
Aretsky, would close the 15-year-old restaurant on June 20 after
failing to negotiate a new lease with a landlord she said had
demanded a big rent increase. She would not say how much Arcadia
had been paying or how much the landlord wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then it seemed like a huge amount,'' she said. ``Now it
seems very reasonable, but not in this real estate market.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the landlord did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the Mouse
</P>
<P>
   The single-spaced biography from the Children's Scholarship
Fund, the business group behind a $200 million push for a national
school-voucher program, said that his accomplishments included
``creating Coke Classic's polar bear mascot.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that he ``consulted for many major international
businesses and helped them with mergers and acquisitions within the
entertainment industry.'' It mentioned Matsushita's deal for MCA
and Sony's takeover of Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It said that he was a co-founder of Creative Artists Agency, the
powerhouse talent agency. It said that he sold his stake in
Creative Artists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It even said that he began his career as a tour guide at
Universal Studios ``and then moved to a similar job at 20th Century
Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not say that Michael Ovitz, who is becoming a major
investor in Livent, the entertainment company based in Toronto that
produced ``Ragtime,'' was president of Walt Disney Corp. for 15
months in 1994 and 1995 (until he was ousted by that other
Hollywood Michael, Michael Eisner).
</P>
<P>
   The biography was drafted for Ovitz in April, before the Livent
deal was announced. As for not mentioning his time at Disney, a
spokesman for Ovitz said, ``Mr. Ovitz spent 25 years of his career
building CAA, and that's the focus of his bio.''

JORDAN'S WILL TO WIN SAVING BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The gerbil of a general manager craves equal billing.
The coach finds the secret of success while meditating in a tepee.
The tattooed goofball flies to Detroit, stealing the spotlight
while hanging out with Hulk Hogan. And the impending breakup
staggers along like a bad soap opera because the owner is gorged on
championships.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, they forget the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these banners, all the rings,'' Steve Kerr said. ``Nobody
would have any of this if not for Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Something has changed in this title bout, one that started out
as Ali-Frazier and digressed into Tyson-McNeeley. The Jazz, which
appeared ready to take the final step after gutting out a Game 1
victory, has turned to mush. The Bulls, who appeared ready for the
rocking chair and a long nap, should be tested for Viagra. The
series has tilted like a cheap pinball machine, and all because of
one man.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls crossed the previous finish line in a wheelchair,
eking by the Pacers, Jordan admitted the swagger was gone. After
losing the opener, there weren't enough knives to accommodate all
the back stabbing. Sensing the end was near, Jordan simply changed
the tone of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to practice the next morning laughing and joking,''
Kerr said. ``The only time in three years I've seen him do that
after a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the Jazz started gagging on its own desire, the Bulls
were liberated by their leader. The results are undeniable. And
while the Jazz can climb back into the series with a victory
tonight, the mental edge is clearly in the other corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they take us seriously at all,'' Karl Malone
said. &QL; 
Jackson losing credibility &QL; 
This stunning transformation has little to do with Bulls Coach Phil
Jackson, whose mystique has taken a major hit in the past few
weeks. On Tuesday, he was again preaching his spin, coddling Dennis
Rodman at the expense of his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rodman blew off practice, hung up on his coach, holed
up at Hooters, then bolted for an appearance on WCW's ``Monday
Nitro.'' It is an embarrassment to authority, an insult to the
dignity Jordan has infused into the organization, a slap at the
sanctity of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I wouldn't have him,'' Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan
said. ``Everybody knows what he's all about. Winning has never been
that important to him. I'd just as soon lose if I had to be put in
that situation. When that's more important than the game itself,
we've just lost the whole reason for being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman didn't explain his need to collect a quick appearance
fee, instead indicting Malone as an ``awkward player,'' an
``average player.'' But he did express a desire to get this thing
over quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life just goes to complete hell when I go to Utah,'' Rodman
said. ``That means I have to revert to going to Las Vegas or
somewhere to get my excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Idiot. &QL; 
Sold his soul &QL; 
If Jackson had any guts, he would bench Rodman, if not drop him
from the roster altogether. As much as Jackson claims he is working
his Buddhist magic to keep Rodman productive, he has sold his soul
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sleeping in a nest that we helped to build,'' a
disgusted Luc Longley said. ``Our acceptance of him and our
tolerance of him perpetuated the myth.''
</P>
<P>
   As well as exposing Jackson's. Really, now. How many games would
Zen be worth if Big Chief Triangle was coaching the Denver Nuggets?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the full-court brilliance of Scottie Pippen, there
would be nothing without Jordan. Jackson wouldn't be assured a
place in the Hall of Fame. The owner wouldn't have a palatial
stadium. The general manager wouldn't foolishly place himself next
to Red Auerbach. The Bulls wouldn't overcome the odds and the
oddballs to where they are two wins from another shipment of rings.
</P>
<P>
   No man has ever made more money for others, bloated so many egos
or defied defeat with such vengeance. And it's never been more
apparent than now. &QL;

 10 &HT;    Couple's killer is put to death 13 years later

<P>
   JACKSON, Ga. _ There were no stays _ just a 2 1/2-hour ''hold''
_ so double murderer David Cargill went to his own state-sanctioned
death Tuesday night with barely a notice from the world outside the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The day was marked by a series of court challenges and pleas to
the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, Butts County, Ga. Superior
Court Judge Arch McGarity and the U.S. Supreme Court. But no one
who could stop the execution for the 1985 murders agreed with
Cargill's attorneys and his family, who argued that the 39-year-old
man no longer deserved to die.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the boys orphaned when Cargill killed Cheryl and Danny
Williams during a winter night gas station robbery in 1985 in
Columbus, Ga. spoke out, unlike the survivors of murder victims in
the previous 22 executions held in Georgia since December 1983.
</P>
<P>
   There were no television trucks parked outside the Georgia
Diagnostic and Classification Prison equipped for live reporting.
Only eight death penalty opponents and a half dozen supporters of
executions gathered outside for the moment Cargill sat in the
state's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill and his younger brother, Tommy, both of Phoenix City,
Ala., were convicted of the armed robbery of the Premium Oil
Station in Columbus and the execution-style slaying of the
Williamses, the parents of four boys ages 2 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses worked days at a now-closed textile mill near
Columbus. Cheryl Williams worked at the service station to earn
extra money for the family. Her husband often stopped by to help
her close.
</P>
<P>
   During the robbery, $482.79 was taken. The couple was forced to
lie face down on the floor of the service station. Each was shot
twice in the head. Cargill, 26 at the time, was sentenced to death
for shooting the couple; his brother, then 21, was sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   David Cargill spent Tuesday with his aging, ailing mother, a
sister, a niece and a chaplain. After they left at 3:30 p.m.,
Cargill had his last meal of steak, baked potato, salad and vanilla
ice cream. Then his head and a leg were shaved to prepare for the
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill asked for forgiveness Tuesday and said he hoped his
execution would bring closure to those he hurt, said Scott
Stallings, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections. The
U.S. Supreme Court asked Georgia officials just before 7 p.m., the
scheduled time for the execution, for time to review the case. Once
the court had declined to act on his appeal, Cargill's execution,
witnessed by 22 people, began at 9:42 p.m. He was pronounced dead
at 9:50 p.m.

A FARSIGHTED COLLECTOR EVEN AS A BOY, BY JEEVES! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 14)  
 (JT)  
 By RITA REIF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1927, when James H. Heineman was 10, he demonstrated a
bibliographic bent: he began buying first editions of the novels of
his favorite author, the British writer P.G. Wodehouse, whose works
poked fun at bumbling English aristocrats. The young Jimmy avidly
devoured Wodehouse's stories about Bertie Wooster and Jeeves in
Never-Never Land, the escapades of Rupert Eustace Psmith and the
sagas at Blandings Castle. But rather than read them in hardback,
Jimmy found paperback editions. He was the son of a collector, and
to preserve the pristine state of the hard-bound copies he stowed
them unopened on bookshelves in his family's home in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 60 years, Heineman, who died in 1994, continued to
buy the works of Pelham Grenville (Plum) Wodehouse, amassing a
collection of some 6,300 items. Among them are at least one copy
each of the nearly 100 novels Wodehouse wrote as well as short
stories, plays, book reviews, lyrics and caricatures of the author.
In 1981, Heineman lent part of the collection _ a few hundred
choice pieces _ to the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan for an
exhibition commemorating the centenary of Wodehouse's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, Heineman's entire Wodehouse collection goes on view
for the first time at Sotheby's in New York, where it will be
auctioned in 150 lots on June 26. The stunning assortment of
Wodehousiana, the most comprehensive ever offered, is expected to
command a total price of $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Letters and other objects in the collection also shed new light
on Wodehouse's involvement with the Nazis during World War II. In
1940, the author was seized by the Germans at his home in Le
Touquet, France, taken to Germany and briefly interned. The Nazis
then moved him to a hotel in Berlin, where his wife, Ethel, joined
him. There, in the summer of 1941, Wodehouse made five
controversial radio broadcasts to the United States in which he
made light of his life in an internment camp. ``It has been in many
ways an agreeable experience,'' he said, adding, ``It keeps you out
of the saloons and gives you time to catch up on your reading.''
</P>
<P>
   A phonograph recording of one of the broadcasts will also be
sold, along with some letters and documents, in a lot estimated to
bring $7,000. The sale's most important offering is a set of 12
letters, written by Wodehouse to a friend, Baroness Anga von
Bodenhausen, in which he reveals his plan to work in German films
during the war. Sotheby's expects that the letters will fetch
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have paid me a nice fat sum for option rights,''
Wodehouse wrote to the baroness in March 1942. ``If they decide to
use one of my novels as a picture, I get another lot of money. So I
am quite well off and Ethel has been buying some wonderful hats.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans were outraged by the broadcasts, as were the British,
who accused Wodehouse of treason, saying he had participated in
Nazi propaganda. But Wodehouse was not without his defenders, among
them the authors Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell and Malcolm
Muggerridge and to a lesser degree Heineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy thought Wodehouse's actions showed a political naivete
of an almost incredible kind,'' said Charles Gould, a Wodehouse
expert who teaches English literature at the Kent School in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The British royal family did not officially forgive Wodehouse
for his activities with the Nazis until 30 years after the war had
ended. In 1975, six weeks before Wodehouse died at 93, Queen
Elizabeth II made him a Knight Commander of the Order of the
British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Wodehouse fans will find many rarities in the sale, the scarcest
of which is a copy of ``The Intrusion of Jimmy,'' published in New
York in 1910. The book cost $1.50 when published and was reissued a
year later at 50 cents. Sotheby's expects this copy, which is
inscribed by the author and has its original dust jacket, to sell
for about $6,000. That would be a record for a Wodehouse book.
</P>
<P>
   Wodehouse's work as a songwriter for Broadway and Hollywood is
less well known. His most notable lyrics were for the song ``Bill''
from the Jerome Kern musical ``Showboat,'' and a copy of the sheet
music for the song is one of 505 items related to his musical
career being offered by Sotheby's. The lot also includes posters,
playbills and phonograph recordings and may sell for as much as
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Heineman's father, Dannie, had amassed an extensive collection
of books and papers _ manuscripts, letters and books by Einstein,
Mozart and Balzac. He managed to get much of it out of Belgium
before the German occupation and, 20 years ago, the Heineman
foundation donated it to the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Heineman was not so lucky. He left his earliest
Wodehouse acquisitions at home in Brussels when he was sent to New
York on the eve of World War II to work in the offices of the
family business. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, Heineman, an American
who had lived abroad until then, was drafted by the Army and went
back to Europe as a warrant officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1944, I managed to make my way to my parents' home,'' he
later recalled. He found it surprisingly intact after four years of
German occupation: the rugs, the furniture, even the flooring, had
not suffered. ``However,'' he said, ``my Wodehouse books had
vanished.''

BOWL OFFICIALS DEBUT CHAMPI ONSHIP FOR MULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will be the only college football contest played this season
in which the lowest score wins.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the new Bowl Championship Series have approved a
statistical rating system to decide the nation's top two teams, as
well as other schools eligible to participate in the four-bowl
series.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system has four components: the average ranking in
the Associated Press and coaches' poll, the average of three
computer rankings, the strength of schedules and team records.
</P>
<P>
   The system, officials hope, will be particularly helpful in
those years when it's not obvious which two teams are the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear-cut and it's very objective,'' said Roy Kramer,
chairman of the Southeastern Conference and the series coordinator,
said of the rating system.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series, the successor to the alliance, is
designed to guarantee that the nation's two teams are matched in a
bowl every year. The Fiesta Bowl will host the title game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The national title will still be determined by the postseason
polls, and no one thinks the rating system will diminish the
support of those who want a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as long as there are newspaper columnists and call-in
shows,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The rating system not only will select which teams play in the
title game but will determine whether an independent or a team from
a conference without an automatic bid in the series is guaranteed a
slot in one of the four participating bowls: the Fiesta, the
Orange, the Sugar and the Rose. Those teams must finish in the top
six in the final series poll.
</P>
<P>
   The point system will not be used to determine the match-ups in
the series' other non-championship bowl games. Those bowls, each
with a conference tie-in, can determine their best match-ups among
eligible teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl, for instance, would still be free to choose to
do what it did last year when it picked Kansas State as an at-large
team largely because the Wildcats bring thousands of fans with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The four bowls will host the series' top game on a rotating
basis. This will be the first season in which the top two ranked
teams are assured of meeting in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That was impossible in previous years because the Rose Bowl did
not participate in the agreement, which eliminated Pac-10 and Big
Ten teams from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident and comfortable with the system,'' said John
Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's, executive director. ``Since our game is
the focus of college football this year, it's awfully nice to have
it resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   If the current agreement had been in place two years ago,
Arizona State would have played Florida State for the title. Last
season, Nebraska and Michigan would have played.
</P>
<P>
   Series officials won't begin releasing its rating until November
because early season ratings are meaningless, Kramer said. The
strength-of-schedule category is only pertinent when teams have
played at least seven or eight games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The series probably will not eliminate all controversy. There
could be a scenario in which the same two teams are ranked Nos. 1
and 2 in the AP and coaches' polls, yet the rating system
determines the third-ranked team should play for the national
title.
</P>
<P>
   That would have happened in 1990, when Colorado was ranked
first, Georgia Tech second and Texas was third. Colorado and Texas
would have played for the national title because their schedules
were deemed tougher than Georgia Tech's, which ended up sharing the
national title with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that neither team in the championship
plays well and the third-rated team is impressive in its bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the final polls still determine the national champion,
it's possible voters could choose to elevate the third-ranked team
to No. 1. &QL;

PLAYERS ARE TRADING PLACES ON OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shuffling and experimenting on the offensive line continues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jerome Daniels, an offensive tackle as a rookie last season, is
working at right guard, a 360-pound right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big guards who are athletic, explosive and can play are
something special,'' first-year offensive line coach  &UR; George Warhop
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alan DeGraffenreid, who experimented at center during last
month's minicamp, is working at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a unique player,'' Warhop said. ``He has the ability to
play several positions. The guy never had played center before.
Don't be surprised if some time he lines up at guard.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGraffenreid feels comfortable at any position, even at tight
end, where he has been working on goal-line situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the  &UR; Eric Metcalf of offensive linemen,'' said
DeGraffenreid, referring to the wide receiver/running back/return
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie  &UR; Anthony Clement, the second-round draft pick from
Southwestern Louisiana and heir apparent to  &UR; Lomas Brown at left
tackle, is working during this week's rookie camp at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played right tackle in two years, but we're focusing
in on that right now,'' Warhop said. ``We're trying to create some
competition there.''
</P>
<P>
   Warhop said Tuesday that four of the five offensive line
positions are wide open, with only Brown assured of a starting
job. &QL; 
Diet plan &QL; 
Warhop said he would like to see Daniels, a third-round pick of the
Miami Dolphins a year ago, get his weight down to about 335 by the
start of training camp next month.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, whose teams have nicknamed him ``Pudding,'' said he is
shooting for 340.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a nutritionist once a week and am dropping four or five
pounds (a week),'' he said. ``Now I do most of my eating midday.
I've cut out the late-night meals. I'm steadily getting to the
weight they want.'' &QL; 
Two-wheelers &QL; 
Cornerback  &UR; Tom Knight and tight end  &UR; Chris Gedney have begun
riding their bicycles to camp each day.
</P>
<P>
   They're doing it to try to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me 40 minutes to get home with a head wind,'' Gedney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a first-round pick a year ago, said his teammates have
teased him about not having another ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all talking about me,'' Knight said. ``They wonder why
I can't drive and what's wrong. I tell them nothing is wrong. It's
just a great experience, riding around _ 3{ miles each way _ taking
in this wonderful Arizona weather.'' &QL;

OVERHAUL PROPOSED FOR NEW YORK'S SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In proposing an overhaul of the $2.5-billion
special-education system in the city's schools, the mayor and the
schools chancellor said Tuesday that they were seeking to reverse
what they described as alarming growth in the number of children
consigned to expensive, segregated classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Special-education rolls grew by nearly 10,000 children last
year, to more than 161,000, or 13.5 percent of the total student
body. The jump was the largest in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible tragedy and a terrible mistake,'' Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, described on Tuesday at a news conference at City
Hall, call for adding support services in regular classes as well
as privatizing the process of evaluating children referred to
special-education classes.
</P>
<P>
   They come at a time when the state is under pressure from
Washington to reduce the number of children in special-education
classrooms. Under current policy, the state offers each district
more money for each student referred to a special-education class,
a practice that runs counter to new federal laws requiring
districts to push more children into inclusive settings. If the
Legislature does not amend its funding formula by the end of the
1999 session, the state risks losing $300 million in federal school
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan, who is chairman of the
state Assembly's Education Committee, said of the effort to
overhaul special education, ``Now, there is an sense of urgency and
focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, educators around the city praised the city's goal
but questioned the idea of using private evaluators unfamiliar with
the children and the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, drawn up by a task force empaneled by the mayor,
focuses on one of the most widely criticized pieces of the
special-education pie: the school-based three-member teams,
consisting of a psychologist, a social worker and a teacher trained
in educational evaluation, that screen every child referred to
special education by a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   An independent study conducted in 1995 found that 85 percent of
the referred children were placed in special education, even though
many were not diagnosed with a learning disability as defined by
state law. The city is also under scrutiny by federal civil rights
officials for having a disproportionate number of black and
Hispanic boys in special education.
</P>
<P>
   The task force suggested on Tuesday that private psychologists
be contracted to do the screening. ``We are really bringing to this
a fresh set of eyes,'' Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said. Crew was
a member of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also called for principals and superintendents to
have direct control over the team members, who are now independent
of the school districts. The teams have been criticized as
unproductive; the psychologists on the teams, for instance,
conducted 1.4 evaluations a week, according to the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The United Federation of Teachers, which in the past has
insisted on shielding the 3,500 evaluators from the control of
principals and district superintendents, softened its position on
that issue on Tuesday, but they drew the line on privatizing the
jobs of the evaluators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we will definitely fight is any attempt toward
privatizing,'' said Randi Weingarten, the union president. ``We
will fight it any way we can.'' She said that instead, the city
should have enforced a provision in the union contract to address
productivity quotas: each school-based evaluation team is to
perform 55 to 80 evaluations a year.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Fruchter, a New York University professor who has written
extensively on the city's special-education system, said Tuesday
that he did not think the privatization plan would lead to sounder
evaluations but that it could be a way to bargain for higher
productivity standards in the next contract. ``I suspect this is a
way to introduce competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galen Kirkland, the executive director of Advocates for
Children, a Brooklyn group that represents youngsters with learning
disabilities, said he feared that private contractors would be
under pressure to remove more students from special-education
classes, even some who desperately needed them.
</P>
<P>
   The task force insisted Tuesday that the proposals were not
intended to save money. Instead, Crew said, the changes would
continue to offer special-education services to students who
genuinely needed them.
</P>
<P>
   But the task force, which includes Michael Hess of the
Corporation Counsel's office and Peter Powers, a former deputy
mayor, declined to say how many children they would remove from
special education.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education is expected to vote, as early as next
week, on the proposal to bring the school-based evaluators under
the control of principals and superintendents.

Rodman's 
truancy

   Wrestling pay dwarfs &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rodman
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ The aftermath of the Bulls' 42-point victory on Sunday
has been interesting, to put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   And put the emphasis on the ``math'' in aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   You practically need an abacus to total up the records set in
Chicago's 96-54 victory over the Jazz in Game 3 of the NBA Finals,
but to the Bulls, the only numbers of note this week are one, one
and 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first refers to the number of practices Dennis Rodman has
skipped this week. The second refers to the number of World
Championship Wrestling events he has chosen to attend. And the last
refers to the number of dollars Rodman was fined _ $10,000 by the
NBA for skipping Monday's media availability session and $10,000 by
the Bulls for missing Monday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it mattered to Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   No, the amazing technicolor dreamboat to so-called rebels
everywhere picked up a cool $250,000 for his appearance with pal
Hulk Hogan on TNT's Monday Nitro wrestling event in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all good,'' Rodman said at Tuesday's practice session.
``I made some good friends and made a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those friends Rodman spoke of obviously weren't his teammates,
who were not pleased with the incident. It is only the latest
addition to what Michael Jordan calls Rodman's attendant
``baggage'' _ which looks more like a steamer trunk with each
passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was certainly steamed at Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of answering questions about how the Bulls were up 2-1
in the best-of-seven Finals, which resume tonight at the United
Center, Jordan instead found himself fielding questions about
Rodman's whereabouts and impact on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil (Jackson, the Bulls' coach) addressed that today _ I
didn't know where he was,'' Jordan said. ``Somebody said he was
wrestling somewhere. I told Phil that whatever he (Rodman) got
paid, that he should distribute it to the players, split it up
evenly. I don't know if he's going to do that, but Phil was pretty
upset by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's suggestion of disbursing the $250,000 among the rest of
the team seems like a better solution than what the Bulls and the
league decided upon. You do the math: $250,000 minus $20,000 for
fines still comes out to a pretty hefty chunk of change.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jackson, however, it is the media's fault for
glamorizing Rodman's aberrant behavior, his outrageous appearance
and his often-ridiculous statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only taking your (the media's) focus away from the
Finals, not ours,'' said Jackson of Rodman. ``You're focusing on
him, and you're the ones who have made him what (he's become).
That's exactly one of the problems. He becomes an anti-hero figure
in this society, and that's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and all this time everyone thought the problem was Rodman's
skipping practice to go to a wrestling match in another state.
Jackson doesn't see that as a problem, even if his Bulls are trying
to prepare for Game 4 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having worked with people, professional athletes, in this
business for a long time, and having been one myself, I think the
focus should be that Dennis is a unique individual, and maybe, in
some sense, handicapped, but who is finding an occupation in which
he is doing extremely well,'' Jackson said. ``(Look at it that way)
rather than trying to make him out to be some dysfunctional
character. Dennis is functioning probably as well as he can
function under a system like this, and it's a wonderful thing that
he's been able to find employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he could have employment in the 9-to-5 world.
I doubt if he could. But he's made it in this world, and that's
great. For us, it's even better if he can bring the best of himself
to the court. And that's what we ask him for.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than fines, Jackson seems content to ignore Rodman's
behavior, but his teammates seem to be wearying of the sideshow and
of Jackson's way of dealing with all the distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's par for the course,'' said Luc Longley of Rodman's
behavior and Jackson's willingness to overlook the incident.
``That's the way he's behaved all year, and that's the way he's
behaved the last two years. We're sleeping in a nest that we helped
to build. It's our acceptance of him and our tolerance of him that
has perpetuated this stuff.''

HEALTH PLAN CUSTOMERS POLLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ J.D. Power and Associates, a company best known
for rating cars based on customer satisfaction surveys, has turned
its sights again on the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, the company teamed with the Ann Arbor,
Mich.-based Medstat Group to rate HMOs, fee-for-service plans,
preferred provider organizations and other health plans, based
solely on what their members say about them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results, which will be sold back to the health care
industry in customized reports, partially vindicate the
much-maligned health maintenance organization, organizers said. An
HMO was the top-rated plan in more than half the 20 metropolitan
markets where customers were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some HMOs scored poorly (but) enrollees rated many HMOs higher
than traditional fee-for-service plans in several health care
markets,'' said Dennis Becker, a Medstat vice president.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the survey, J.D. Power and Medstat sent
questionnaires to 81,000 members of 181 different health plans,
asking them to rate the performance of their plan in 11 different
categories. The survey pool was made up of employees at companies
that do business with Medstat. As a result, only health plans
serving those employees were included in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are not aimed at consumers, said Medstat
spokeswoman Andree Joyaux. ``This is for the industry ... primarily
the health plans and purchasers,'' Joyaux said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, only members in the San Francisco area were
included in the study, and no plan there emerged ``significantly
above other plans,'' according to the study. Another survey focused
exclusively on California is in the works, Joyaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the study's results will be sold to health plans and
other interested parties for ``thousands of dollars,'' Joyaux said,
to help plans better meet the needs and wants of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But with dozens of other employer-, consumer- and
industry-supported health plan surveys already around, some
question the need for the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many other surveys out there that this could be
redundant with information being provided by other sources,'' said
Blue Cross of California spokeswoman Elise Anderson. ``Is there
anything in it that doesn't already exist?''

IN BILINGUAL SCHOOLING SETBACK, EDUCATORS SEE ANOTHER SWING OF THE

 (JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the defeat of bilingual schooling in California, educators
around the country are examining that program's ill-fated path and
drawing parallels to the outcome of other educational innovations
of recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   They say the story of bilingual education _ its rise in the
1960s, preceded by little research or experience in it; its
mushrooming bureaucracy; the passion of its ill-prepared
implementation, and, in California at least, its sudden abandonment
for an equally unproved method _ is the story of American
education.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the issue is reading or mathematics, outcome-based
education or open classrooms, public schooling in this country
lurches from one trend to its opposite with alarming speed and
little forethought, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the pendulum-swing approach to educational reform,''
asserted Patricia Albjerg Graham, professor of the history of
education at Harvard University. ``Bilingual education exemplifies
the American enthusiasm to find a complete solution by going to
extremes, when most solutions in fact are in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester E. Finn Jr., a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute,
put it this way: ``Bilingual education, like every interesting
idea, was eventually carried to a pernicious extreme and created
its own backlash. It began for humane and reasonable motives. But
it got distorted, twisted and turned into a caricature, with its
interest groups and zealots and funding streams. The view was, If
one year of bilingual education is good, two years must be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual education _ teaching immigrant children in their
native language while they simultaneously learn English for several
years _ has hardly vanished overnight. It exists in most states and
has many backers and practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   But it was decisively rejected last week by California voters,
many of them Hispanic. Barring a successful court challenge, then,
bilingual education will end in the state that is home to 45
percent of the nation's children with limited English skills. And
other challenges to it, in the states and in Congress, suggest that
its days as a widely hailed solution to the complex problems of
immigrant absorption are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the program that will replace bilingual education in
California _ one year of so-called structured English immersion for
all limited-English students, with minimal instruction in other
subjects during that period, all of it in English _ comes equally
untested. That was the main reason many of California's political
leaders and editorial pages gave for opposing the anti-bilingual
ballot initiative, Proposition 227.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what we do in education is a reaction to what we
just did,'' lamented Marc Tucker, president of the National Center
on Education and the Economy, in Washington. ``A lot of people I
know would have supported Proposition 227 if it had included two to
three years of English immersion rather than one, which is seen as
draconian and hard to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a similar pattern in reading instruction, which
has moved, on and off, from traditional phonics (the sounding out
of words) to so-called whole language (looking for contextual clues
to meaning). The same has been true of mathematics, where the
tradition of drill and practice yielded to a more conceptually
oriented approach of word problems and team solutions before
emerging to the fore again.
</P>
<P>
   The reading wars are not new _ Jeanne Chall, now retired from an
education professorship at Harvard, wrote a book on the debate in
1967 _ but they have grown so intense that a committee of experts
commissioned by the National Research Council sought to put an end
to them by studying the issue. In a recent report, the committee
said there was merit to both approaches and to a mixture of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often,'' Finn said, ``the truth about these things can be
summed up with the word `both.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Theodore Sizer, chairman of the Coalition of Essential Schools,
a group advocating educational innovation, said being a teacher
could be frustrating. ``They tell you not to use phonics or whole
language,'' Sizer said, ``when in fact a good teacher uses both
with an eye on who the kid is. We have this bad habit of giving
simple encyclicals to define very complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That tendency appears to have grown more common in recent
decades, with tugs-of-war inside the educational system serving
increasingly as proxies for battles over larger societal concerns.
(Larry Cuban, education professor at Stanford University, sees an
analogy to the religious wars of earlier societies.)
</P>
<P>
   This has been the case to some extent since public schooling was
made compulsory in the last century, but even more so since the
1960s, when education began to be viewed as a means toward national
as well as personal well-being. ``The answer for all our national
problems comes down to a single word,'' President Lyndon Johnson
declared in 1965. ``That word is `education.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the war on poverty, absorption of immigrants and
preparation of a new multicultural generation are all viewed as
appropriate goals for the educational system. At the same time,
parents look to schools as a cornerstone of their children's
credentials and financial future. Each set of forces creates
pressures to innovate, but not necessarily in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in the failure of some innovations is the
unacknowledged difficulty of undertaking them. Since reform often
comes in response to a pressing problem _ immigration, delinquency,
international competition _ adjusting the system to meet the need
is like repairing an airplane in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Right to Learn'' (Jossey-Bass, 1997), Linda
Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at Columbia University,
noted that after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik four decades
ago, American policy makers felt an urgent need to improve
teaching. But despite research showing that approaches like
``discovery learning'' and team teaching prepared students to think
more critically than did the rote approach of previous years,
efforts to incorporate the new methods largely failed because
teachers were not properly instructed in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to maintaining progressive
reforms is the extensive skill needed to teach both subjects and
students well,'' Dr. Darling-Hammond wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This is evident in the current examinations of what has gone
wrong with bilingual education. Finding teachers who were fully
bilingual was itself difficult, let alone making sure that they
were also skilled and fully trained.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Snow, a professor of education at Harvard who was
chairwoman of the National Research Council committee that examined
the teaching of reading, said the trouble with many reforms is that
``there is inadequate recognition of how much professional quality
it takes to do a good job of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most education research, Professor Snow said, is done by giving
bold new ideas to first-rate teachers. Their successes produce
``lots of descriptions of extremely wonderful, exciting classrooms
and relatively few of average classrooms,'' she said. Far too
little research, she added, takes the somewhat jaundiced but
essential perspective: not of how good an approach can be when well
done, but of how bad it will be when badly done.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say methods are less important than the presence
of dedicated and thoughtful teachers.

WNBA TAKES ON AN INTERNA TIONAL LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The moment the Mercury's raiding of the international
basketball arc crossed from real to surreal was when the team
drafted 6-foot-8 Russian teenager Maria Stepanova. . . .
</P>
<P>
   . . . and was introduced to her agent Boris Leichitski and his
assistant Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Can Moose and Squirrel be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   For that humor to be understood at Mercury practice, however, it
first requires an explanation of Rocky and Bullwinkle in French,
Japanese and Russian, providing interpreters can first grasp the
concept. Now you begin to see why some WNBA teams dip no deeper
into the international market than English-speaking players out of
U.S. colleges.
</P>
<P>
   With the league assignment of its first player, Australian point
guard Michele Timms, in January 1997, the Mercury plunged into
worldwide talent scouting. The team could begin its second season
Thursday with more than half the roster born outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Final cuts are due today, but the 11-woman squad is certain to
include returners Timms and Marlies Askamp of Germany and first-
and second-round draft picks Stepanova and Andrea Kuklova of
Slovakia. On the bubble are returner Mikiko Hagiwara of Japan and
Kristi Harrower and Michelle Griffiths of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other nine WNBA teams, only the expansion Detroit Shock
is anywhere close to the Mercury in international numbers with
three Australians, a Bulgarian, a Bosnian and a Croatian. Detroit
also put in a claim Monday on forward Natalia Zassoulskaya, whose
20 points and 9 rebounds almost carried Russia past the United
States in the World Championships gold-medal game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Shock's multi-cultural mix pales in comparison to the
Mercury's because the Bulgarian and Croatian speak English, and the
Bosnian can converse with the Croatian and in Italian with one of
the Americans. Zassoulskaya, if she goes to the Shock, would need
an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury huddles will be more like the United Nations, with
Boutros Boutros (aka Cheryl) Miller serving as secretary-general as
much as coach-general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not about international-American, it's getting the
best players,'' said Seth Sulka, Mercury vice president-operations.
``The only thing you have to be careful about is does that bring a
language barrier, does that bring other cultural barriers and does
it give you the best player as a package? Maybe you get the best
skills, but the package isn't as good. That has to be evaluated
case by case.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the parent NBA, the WNBA thinks globally, not only for
marketing reasons but because there was no domestic women's
basketball between 1984 and '97. ``To have the best basketball
league in the world meant to have the best basketball players from
the world,'' Sulka said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, combined with the American Basketball Leagaue's
early dominance in signing U.S. collegians, attracted a core group
of 15 international players that will almost double this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like having the international players in our league, and
they add a lot to the quality of competition,'' said WNBA President
Val Ackerman. ``We think it has helped make us more attractive to
the rest of the world in terms of fans and international broadcast
alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem Capital Sports, for example, recently agreed to a
two-year contract to televise some 70 NBA and 20 WNBA games per
season. Israel is among 140 countries receiving WNBA games and/or
highlights show. Many of those countries have pro women's leagues
that have financially supported American players for years.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA stars, most of whom top out at $62,000 in salary, can go
overseas and make up to six figures for the other eight months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we have so many international players says they're
like the Americans, they see the carrot dangling in front of them
and want to play in a league such as ours,'' said Shock
Coach-General Manager Nancy Lieberman-Cline. ``I know Ticha
Penecheiro (Sacramento's Portguese point guard). Her parents are
going to be able to see her play (on TV). That would be very
appealing to me as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline played for the Mercury last season and saw the
impact of Timms, not only on the court but in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Because Timms knew the 6-foot-5 Askamp through two seasons as
teammates in the German League, Miller went unexplainably small in
the first WNBA draft, then pulled Askamp out of the hat before
training camp. And when Sacramento gave up on Hagiwara and
considered cutting the 1996 Olympian, the Mercury pulled the first
WNBA trade largely on Timms' recommendation of Hagiwara, who three
times scored 20 points or more against the United States during
international games this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mercury has an Australian assistant coach, Carrie Graf,
and is considering Harrower, who backed up Timms at the recent
World Championships, and Griffiths. It used its first two draft
picks on Stepanova and Kuklova even though the collegiate talent
was ample after the WNBA convincingly beat the ABL in round 2 of
bidding on seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Kuklova speaks what Sulka calls survival English and mostly
communicates through a French interpreter. English is one of
Askamp's three languages, but Russian and Japanese translators are
being hired for Stepanova and Hagiwara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be pretty annoying on the bench,'' with Miller's
often colorful speeches flying in four tongues, All-WNBA center
Jennifer Gillom said. ``You're trying to concentrate on the game
and you hear all this blah, blah, blah. Sometimes it can be
distracting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury has been lucky with its first two interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Yasuko Matsumoto had brought a youth basketball team from Himeji
City, Japan, to its sister city of Phoenix for a tournament and
still was here on vacation when the trade for Hagiwara was made.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Guay, who has worked with Kuklova and French free agent
Odile Santaniello during training camp, is a French-Canadian who
came to the Valley to play basketball at Grand Canyon University,
where she met Carolyn Griffiths, now the Mercury trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The new Japanese interpreter is Kyoko Takahashi, an Arizona
State student with no basketball background who has lived in the
United States for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   When expenses for 15 road games are included, the interpreting
cost becomes a factor, Sulka said, especially when tripled. ``Then
there are the logistics. Are they behind the bench? Do they come
into a huddle? This stuff works fine in practice, but when you're
in the thick of a game, it's not as simple as the coach saying,
`Tell the player to run fast.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, an 11-year overseas veteran, has mixed feelings about
the use of international players. Most overseas leagues limit the
number of foreigners to two per team, something she thinks the WNBA
should consider in order to cultivate young American talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may limit itself because of some of the logistical
issues,'' such as obtaining work visas, Ackerman said. ``As for
now, we welcome them, and most of all they have to be good enough
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman-Cline agrees. ``It's about competition,'' she said.
``If we as American players can't continue to work on our games and
be better, then I think the best players should play. That's the
way it works in any industry, and the way it should be in the
WNBA.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - Faster than Cheryl Miller can blast her right foot
into the scorer's table and break her big toe, the balance of power
in the WNBA has swung to the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Miller can preserve her other foot from
damage in what promises to be an emotion-charged, parity-driven
crusade. At stake is not only the conference title but a record
good enough to earn a precious playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four playoff teams in the inaugural season were
from the Eastern Conference, including the Houston Comets, who won
it all and now are in the West. That immediately takes Miller's
Mercury down a notch from defending West champion in preseason
predictions. Some are dropping Phoenix further, below the
fast-finishing Los Angeles Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, when you go strictly on talent, that LA will be tough
to beat,'' Houston Coach Van Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury might be, too, once the players who joined the team
this week after the World Championships find their way into a new
motion offense. The cut to a roster of 11 comes today before the
team departs for its opener Thursday in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she would rather be faced with tough decisions than
having too few talented players to fill the roster. She compared
her predicament to what Danny Ainge went through this season with
the deep Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a wonderful situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The six incoming players (Michele Timms, Michelle Griffiths and
Kristi Harrower of Australia; Mikiko Hagiwara of Japan; Marlies
Askamp of Germany; and Maria Stepanova of Russia) must ``sink or
swim,'' Miller said. ``Right now after throwing them in the water,
I saw a lot of people doing the backstroke and feeling good about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Once beyond today's roster decisions _ ``Emotions are high right
now,'' Miller said _ the Mercury's goal will be to stand at least
2-1 after the first five days of the season, then use a five-day
break to fully integrate the World Championships players into the
system.
</P>
<P>
   What should emerge by June 21, a home game against Charlotte, is
a bigger and better shooting Mercury than the team that fought off
the Sparks to win the West but was held to a league-low 41 points
in a semifinal playoff loss to the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   With 6-foot-8 first-round draft pick Stepanova and probably 6-3
veteran Pauline Jordan providing reinforcements, frontcourt
starters Jennifer Gillom and Toni Foster will wear better
throughout the 30-game season. And with a microfiber basketball
that is billed as being easier to handle, the 6-5 Askamp could
raise her scoring average into double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (Sheryl Swoopes, who missed much of last season after
giving birth to her son) and Los Angeles (Allison Feaster) both get
an injection of scoring punch at small forward. But Phoenix
acquired its own lower-profile help.
</P>
<P>
   Second- and third-round draft picks Andrea Kuklova of Slovakia
and Brandy Reed flashed their offensive skills during exhibition
wins over Utah. Hagiwara, if she makes the roster, is coming off a
sparkling international tour and might thrive in an offense more
like that of the Japanese national team.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom and Timms, who turn 34 and 33 this month, carried much of
the load in a 16-12 regular season that included an an 8-3 start
and a six-game losing streak. They need help and rest if the
Mercury is to reach a second postseason with bullets left in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, too, was spent by season's end, carrying the weight of a
franchise that led the league in attendance (13,703 average) and
has doubled its season ticket base to 9,000. She tripled her
assistant coaching staff but is no less intense. The broken toe
that will require her to wear a soft cast for four to six weeks
came in the exhibition opener just before she was hit with a
technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional person,'' she said. ``Would I have done
anything different (to avoid the injury)? Probably not. The only
thing it affects is my clothing attire. Instead of a complete 10,
I'm a 9.''
</P>
<P>
   And no less bold than last season in her public predictions.
``We're bringing this bad boy (WNBA title) home,'' she promised the
crowd after the home exhibition. &QL;

DOMINICAN PRESIDENT CHEERED BY STUDENTS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The guest speaker at George Washington High School in
Washington Heights on Tuesday was not quite a local boy made good.
Leonel Fernandez Ryna regretted to report that he had grown up a
few neighborhoods south and attended rival Louis Brandeis High
School.
</P>
<P>
   But the 700 or so screaming, cheering, sign-waving students who
packed the school auditorium to give the 44-year-old Fernandez a
rock star's welcome did not seem to mind. It is not often, after
all, that the president of the Dominican Republic _ homeland of
more than 80 percent of the school's students _comes to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who spoke on Monday at the U.N. meeting about
fighting illegal drugs, decided to make a detour to the city's most
overwhelmingly Dominican neighborhood to preach against drug use.
He reminded the students that though most of their cousins back
home were far less fortunate than they were, they had one
significant advantage: drugs are used by less than 2 percent of
those over 12 years old in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Though Washington Heights has partly recovered from the crack
plague of the early '90s, students said drugs were still easily
available there.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic itself, according to U.S. authorities, is
a major conduit for drugs entering this country. At the United
Nations, Fernandez said that the demand for drugs in the United
States was what made the illegal trade in the Dominican Republic so
profitable and attractive. But he has also vowed to get tough with
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez spoke of his humble roots and said that even though he
had heard when he was growing up on 95th Street that in America,
anyone can become president: ``I never thought I'd become president
of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fernandez, who was elected in 1996, drew his loudest
applause when he spoke of the changes he was bringing to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get back to the Dominican Republic,'' he said,
``you're going to see a lot of things that you have here _
McDonald's, Burger King, pizza that you can call and get delivered.
And all the cable channels. All the kids there can watch the
Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 15-minute speech, which was given in Spanish,
Fernandez, a former lawyer, remained seated at a desk at the front
of the stage and fielded questions from the students, mostly about
his domestic policies. What was he doing to improve the country's
chronic electricity shortage? Buying new plants from Germany and
Spain. Why not sell off drug-traffickers' property to raise money
for the power plants? Already being done.
</P>
<P>
   How has the country changed in the last two years? Fernandez
ticked off accomplishments like better bus service in the capital,
an unaccustomed absence of political scandals, upgraded hospitals
and more computers in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded the students that starting in the year 2000,
Dominican citizens who live abroad will be able to vote by absentee
ballot in elections back home. (They will not be able to vote for
him, however: Dominican presidents cannot serve two successive
terms.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warm welcome, Fernandez received mixed grades from
students afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was giving real answers, not just saying things to make us
happy,'' said Cris Marcario, a senior and a student government
representative who said he was inspired to continue in politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Jaime Rodriguez, a 15-year-old sophomore, disputed
Fernandez's claims of having moved the country forward. ``Mostly,
he lied,'' she said. ``The past two years, when I go home, I don't
see too much difference. They're doing things about the appearance
but not the big problems. People are wasting their money buying
generators because there's no electricity. That's what my father
has in his house there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Gonzalez, 18, a senior, said that Fernandez had the common
touch. ``He's so simple, he's just like us,'' she said. ``He's an
ordinary man, he's nice and he wants us to succeed.'' But she had
mixed feelings about Fernandez's modernization programs. She was
excited about McDonald's but had reservations about cable
television. ``I guess it's pretty nice,'' she said, ``but they
should have their own channels.''

   &UR; Who's new: Albena Branzova, 6-3 F; Elisabeth Cebrian, 6-5 C;
Nadine Domond, 5-7 G; Vanessa Nygaard, 6-1 F (injured list); Alicia
Thompson, 6-1 F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Even making the transition from power to
small forward, Texas Tech All-America Thompson was a steal at ninth
in the draft. The Liberty gets somewhat younger and adds depth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 2nd East. &QL; 
 &UR; Cleveland Rockers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

Kostic, 6-1 F; Raegan Scott, 6-3 F; Suzie McConnell Serio, 5-5 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Edwards begins the season out because of a
foot injury, but the additions of Blodgett and Serio soften the
loss. Serio, 31, is a two-time Olympian and mother of four;
Blodgett, 22, scored 3,005 points in her college career at Maine.
Brown had 46 points in two exhibitions against champion Houston. &QL;

Murriel Page, 6-2 F-C; Alessandra Santos de Oliveira, 6-5 C;
Adrienne Shuler, 5-6 G; Rita Williams, 5-6 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: McCray brings American Basketball League
Most Valuable Player credentials. Santos de Oliveira took Brazil to
a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics. Burge and Moore are nice
expansion-draft acquisitions. Page was good enough to be drafted
ahead of fellow All-America forwards Tracy Reid and Alicia
Thompson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 4th East. &QL; 
 &UR; Detroit Shock &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach: Nancy Lieberman-Cline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's back: No one, also an expansion team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Tajama Abraham, 6-2 C; Rhonda Blades, 5-7 G; Gergana
Branzova, 6-4 F; Sandy Brondello, 5-7 G; Cindy Brown, 6-2 F; Korie
Hlede, 5-9 G; Razija Mujanovic, 6-8 C; Carla Porter, 6-1 F; Rachel
Sporn, 6-1 F; Tara Williams, 5-11 F; Lynette Woodard, 6-0 G;
Natalia Zassoulskaya, N/A F (if approved by league). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Next to the Mercury, the Shock is the most
international of WNBA teams, with three Australians (Brondello,
Porter, Sporn), a Bosnian (Mujanovic), Bulgarian (Branzova) and
perhaps Russian World Championships silver medalist. Woodard, 38,
is a playing contemporary of Lieberman-Cline's, Blades and Brown
are experienced pros. Hlede was the second of six point guards
taken in the first 17 picks of the draft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 5th East. &QL; 
 &UR; Houston Comets &QL; 
 &QL;

Nyree Roberts, 6-3 C; Polina Tzekova, 6-4 C; Amaya Valdemoro, 6-1
F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: The defending league champions, shifting
from the Eastern Conference to the West, are bigger, more physical
and have an in-shape Swoopes for a full season. Tzekova is
unavailable for the foreseeable future because of her mother's
heart problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 1st West. &QL; 
 &UR; Phoenix Mercury &QL;

G; Michele Timms, 5-7 G; Umeki Webb, 5-10 G-F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Dena Evans, 5-5 G; Michelle Griffiths, 6-1 F; Kristi
Harrower, 5-4 G; Andrea Kuklova, 6-0 G-F; Brandy Reed, 6-1 F; Maria
Stepanova, 6-8 C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: The defending West champions got bigger
without sacrificing their trademark mobility. Perimeter shooting
should be more consistent with Reed and Kuklova taking some of the
load off Pettis. As Stepanova develops, Gillom might shift to power
forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 2nd West. &QL; 
 &UR; Los Angeles Sparks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Erin Alexander, 5-7 G; Octavia Blue, 6-1 F; Allison
Feaster, 5-11 G-F; Pam McGee, 6-3 C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Feaster, the national collegiate scoring
leader, makes the Sparks as deadly at small forward as at the other
four starting positions. LA won't have to dig out of a 5-10 hole
like last season. Wideman (back) could be out for the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 3rd West. &QL; 
 &UR; Sacramento Monarchs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

5-11 G; Bridgette Gordon, 6-0 F. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Who's new: Adia Barnes, 5-10 F; Quacy Barnes, 6-4 C; Linda
Burgess, 6-1 F; Lady Hardmon, 5-10 G; Tiffani Johnson, 6-4 C; Ticha
Penicheiro, 5-11 G; Franthea Price, 5-9 G; Tangela Smith, 6-4 F-C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: Penicheiro added to Bolton-Holifield makes
for the league's best guard combination. The organization by
default has to be more stable than last season, with its coaching
change and player revolt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 4th West. &QL; 
 &UR; Utah Starzz &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

5-6 G. &QL;

   &UR; Who's new: Tricia Bader, 5-4 G; Malgorzata Dydek, 7-2 C; Fran
Harris, 6-0 G; LaTonya Johnson, 6-0 F; Olympia Scott, 6-2 F-C;
Chantel Tremitiere, 5-6 G. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why they're better: ``Large Marge'' will do her job as the
Mercury saw in a pair of exhibition games, but the black hole at
guard remains. Tremitiere, obtained in a trade from Sacramento, led
the league in minutes last year but hasn't found favor at point,
leaving the unproductive Head. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where they'll finish: 5th West. &QL;

PROSECUTOR IN LOUIMA BRUTALITY CASE TO RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a decision that surprised legal observers and led
to speculation about its timing, the lead federal prosecutor in the
Abner Louima case said Tuesday that she would resign and return to
her former job at a private law firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Catherine Palmer, an assistant U.S.
attorney, was made three months after the federal government took
over the prosecution of four police officers with the 70th Precinct
in Brooklyn who are accused of a brutal attack on Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, in August. A fifth member of the precinct, a sergeant,
has been indicted and accused of helping the four cover up the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to be among the biggest, and most
explosive, handled in some time by the U.S. attorney's office for
the Eastern District, touching the tender issues of police
brutality, race, civil rights and police cover-ups. Both the U.S.
attorney's office and the lawyers representing the police officers
have begun to delve into the case, and the trial is expected to
begin possibly by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Palmer said that she could not pass up an
opportunity to rejoin Latham &AMP; Watkins to concentrate on law
involving patents and trademarks. She had worked at that firm from
September 1994 to November 1996, and her time there was bookended
by two stints at the U.S. attorney's office, starting in August
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a prosecutor for 11 years, which is a long time,''
Ms. Palmer said in a telephone interview. ``I'm 42, and it's time
for me to move on to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer's resignation, which was reported this week in The
Village Voice, surprised many in the legal world. She has a
reputation of being tenacious and fiercely competitive, a star
prosecutor who reportedly relished the chance to work on the Louima
case.
</P>
<P>
   Her resignation comes at a controversial juncture. On Friday,
The New York Post reported that the FBI was investigating whether
federal prosecutors and agents and New York police detectives tried
to coerce testimony from witnesses and to strengthen the testimony
of other potential grand jury witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ms. Palmer and William Muller, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn, declined to comment on that report.
But Ms. Palmer said that it was ridiculous to infer that her
resignation was related to an investigation, whispered or realized,
by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely nothing to it, and that's the truth,''
said Ms. Palmer, adding that she told her boss, Zachary Carter, the
U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, about her resignation in early May.
``Unfortunately, I'm just the victim of some bad timing with the
Post article last Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after joining the U.S. attorney's office in 1985, Ms.
Palmer began to concentrate on Southeast Asian heroin smuggling.
She quickly earned a reputation as a tough and vigilant prosecutor,
picking up the sobriquet of ``Dragon Lady'' from drug smugglers. In
1990, Ms. Palmer barely escaped an assassination attempt from a
booby-trapped package sent to her office.
</P>
<P>
   She left the U.S. attorney's office in 1994 to work for Latham &AMP;
Watkins. But she returned to government work less than two years
later, telling friends that being a prosecutor was more exciting
than private practice.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, she was assigned the Louima case _ a plum,
high-pressure job.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities contend that Louima was beaten in a police car
by four officers after being arrested outside a Flatbush nightclub
after a brawl. The authorities say that one of those officers then
rammed a stick into Louima's rectum while another officer held him
down.
</P>
<P>
   The state later indicted Justin Volpe, Thomas Wiese, Charles
Schwarz and Thomas Bruder on assault charges, and Volpe and Schwarz
on sexual abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the federal government took over the prosecution,
citing a variety of civil rights charges, and indicted Sgt. Michael
Bellomo, accusing him of helping the four cover the case up.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in light of Ms. Palmer's resignation, Muller said
that her partner on the Louima case, Ken Thompson, would continue
with the prosecution. He will be joined by Loretta Lynch, chief
assistant U.S. attorney, and Margaret Giordano, a member of the
special prosecutions unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palmer's last day at the U.S. attorney's office is Friday.
Her first day back at her old firm is on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, defense lawyers in the Louima case were still trying to
absorb the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little dismayed because I know Cathy Palmer's personal
honesty and integrity and I think the case will sorely miss her,''
said Joseph Tacopina, whose client is Wiese.

POLICE DID NOT TELL CHILD AGENCY BEFORE MAKING ARRESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police acknowledged Tuesday that they had failed to
notify New York City's child welfare agency before arresting a
Bronx couple charged with running a large-scale drug operation in
which their young sons were said to have been used as couriers of
drugs and money.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, who are 6 and 10, were left after the arrests with a
relative who lives in the same building where their father was
accused of basing a lucrative narcotics operation. In asserting on
Monday that it had told the city's administration for Children's
Services about the children before going out to arrest their
parents on Friday and Saturday, the Police Department left the
impression that the child welfare agency had delayed in acting to
help the children.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Marilyn Mode, the Police Department's deputy
commissioner for public information, confirmed the child welfare
agency's statement that police had not alerted it until Monday
afternoon. ``I was given inaccurate information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the child welfare agency, said
that the agency had not learned about the case from police until
Monday afternoon, and moved quickly to put the boys and their two
teen-age sisters in foster care. The boys received medical
examinations Tuesday and were to be placed with a foster family,
possibly as early as Tuesday night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The custody questions were raised after New York City Police and
federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents arrested the boys'
father, Manuel Grullon, on Friday and their mother, Maria Polanco,
on Saturday at their apartment building at 162 W. 165th St.,
leaving the children in the care of a relative who lives in a
nearby building.
</P>
<P>
   The government said in court papers that Grullon and several
associates ran a drug trafficking operation from that building, at
1055 University Ave., in a group of apartments they controlled, as
well as from inside its lobby and from a bodega on the ground
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said on Monday that the University Avenue building
had long been the site of pervasive drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   In all, prosecutors said, more than two dozen of Grullon's
associates and customers were charged in the joint investigation by
police and the DEA, which lasted eight months.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcement official said that Grullon's organization
sold as much as $50,000 a week in heroin, cocaine, and crack
cocaine in the High Bridge section of the Bronx and elsewhere.
Grullon told one witness, who was secretly cooperating with the
government, that he controlled ``most of the narcotics business''
in the University Avenue area of the Bronx, according to a federal
complaint signed by two federal prosecutors in Manhattan, Steven
Peikin and Laura Birger.
</P>
<P>
   That complaint, which was unsealed on Monday, describes two
instances earlier this year in which it says Grullon used his sons
in drug deals, in both cases to carry crack cocaine in their
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance on Feb. 3, Grullon negotiated a drug deal in a
car, and told the buyer _ a convicted drug dealer working
undercover for the Drug Enforcement Administration _ that he would
send his son to collect the payment, the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, one of Grullon's sons _ the document did
not say which _ entered the car, removed a bag containing about 100
grams of crack cocaine from his pocket and gave it to the buyer.
The customer gave the boy $2,400, and the boy left the car, the
complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Grullon and his family lived at 162 W. 165th St., and a neighbor
said in an interview Monday night that although their four children
tended to play loudly, they were polite and appeared to be in good
health. The neighbor, Barbara Colon, said that Grullon's young sons
especially enjoyed playing handball.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Rodriguez, who is married to the building's superintendent,
said: ``They are good tenants, no problems. The kids are OK.
They're good kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when police and federal drug agents arrested Ms.
Polanco on Saturday morning, the children had to be roused from
their sleep. ``They took the kids out to the hallway and told them
to put their hands up,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ``The children were
all crying and so was their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez said that police ``asked me if I would take care
of the kids because their mother is arrested.'' She said that she
kept the children until their aunt, Ms. Polanco's sister, Carina,
who lives at the 1055 University Ave. address, called on Saturday
afternoon and picked up the four children.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, both Grullon, 38, and Ms. Polanco, 37, could be
sentenced to life in prison. The parents are being held without
bail pending further proceedings. Lawyers for both have declined
comment.

   VIDALIA-ONIONS (Glennville, Ga.) _ In springtime, you know
you're in Vidalia country without reading the signs. As soon as you
leave the piny woods of Fort Stewart, the vast Army base, you come
upon an amazing sight: row after row of burlap bags stretching
across the sandy fields as far as the eye can see, full of onions
drying in the Georgia sun. A local curiosity only 25 years ago,
Vidalia onions have joined the ranks of seasonal foods keenly

   FRANCE-TURBOT (Paris) _ In a refrigerated warehouse at Roissy
Airport, near Paris, a man in a white lab coat lifts turbot out of
a cold seawater tank and lays them, one by one, into styrofoam
boxes. Now and then, a fish quivers its fins lethargically as it
settles into the box, but that is the only sign of life. Roughly 18
hours later, they arrive in Tokyo, where a truck fitted with water
tanks awaits them. The turbot are unpacked and slipped into the
tanks. Instantly, as if touched by a magic spell, they flutter back
to life. As incredible as their revival is, it is often brief. The
trucks deliver the fresh, live turbot to restaurants around the
city where many become part of dishes before the day is over. For
many chefs today, though, that is the point. They want to have the
freshest possible ingredients, no matter how extreme the measure is
to get it to them. By Amanda Hesser.

   SPAGO (Beverly Hills) _ When Wolfgang Puck opened Spago in West

not do it by serving California cuisine or putting caviar on pizza;
in fact, he didn't do it with the food at all. Puck, and his wife
and partner, Barbara Lazaroff, were the first restaurateurs to
realize that rich Americans longed for great food without
formality. And so he began serving oysters without ostentation and
foie gras without fuss. Puck opened Spago Beverly Hills last year,
switching his focus from the casual West Hollywood location to a
far more refined setting. His restaurant changed with the times and
once again gave an early clue to a new direction for dining in
America. By Ruth Reichl.

   BABY-BROCCOLI (Undated) _ A new sprout in the enchanted broccoli

six inches; the head is a loose cluster of flowerettes that
resemble infant broccoli rabe. By Molly O'Neill.

A UNITED NATIONS OF PITCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations is in New York, so why shouldn't
the city's baseball teams look like a United Nations of players.
The pitching staffs, in particular, are taking on that look.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo, the Mets' newest representative from Japan, made his
first start at Shea Stadium Tuesday night. At the same time,
Orlando Hernandez, who brought the name El Duque with him from
Cuba, pitched for the Yankees in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 16 games _ eight for each team _ eight were started
by pitchers who have come here from other countries: Nomo and
Masato Yoshii, also from Japan, for the Mets, and for the Yankees,
Hernandez, Hideki Irabu from Japan and Ramiro Mendoza from Panama.
</P>
<P>
   At spring training, after Hernandez went through his first
workout with the Yankees, catcher Joe Girardi considered the
potential pitching lineup and said: ``We're going to have quite a
universal staff. Cone is American. Pettitte is French. Irabu is
Japanese. Wells is Martian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martian has since pitched a perfect game, and Irabu has the
lowest earned run average among starting pitchers in the major
leagues. But when baseball people talk about the
internationalization of the game, they don't mean Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for New York,'' said Omar Minaya, the Mets'
assistant general manager, who is one of baseball's leading experts
on international scouting. ``The New York fan is very fortunate.
The summer of 1998 is great not only because both teams are doing
well but also because of the different type of players, especially
the pitchers who are taking the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is becoming more international. As many of the best
athletes in the United States turn to other sports, major league
organizations have widened their search for talent, mining the
fields of Latin America, scouting the Far East, traveling to
Australia. These days if a team hears about a prospect, it will
send someone to check him out, wherever he lives and plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nomo coming to New York is the confirmation of this
global type of change in baseball,'' Minaya said. ``New York fans
have a chance to see what is the future of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo created a major stir when he landed in Los Angeles for the
1995 season. He was the National League rookie of the year that
season, then pitched a no-hitter the following year. His unusual
pitching style, in which he turns away from the batter before
releasing the ball, and his ability to strike out batters in
bunches made him a hit not only with Dodger fans but baseball
followers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, still nearly three months from his 30th birthday, has
slipped with his performance in succeeding seasons and is more or
less on pitching trial with the Mets. If he can regain the form and
consistency that attracted so much early attention, he could become
even bigger than he was with the Dodgers. Los Angeles is big, but
New York is bigger. He would become a star all over again, only
this time a bigger star. On the other hand, if he continues to
pitch ineffectively and inconsistently, he would be written off as
a flash who didn't sizzle in the pan long enough.
</P>
<P>
   With Shea fans noisily wanting to see a vintage performance,
Nomo displayed little sizzle Tuesday night. He struck out five in
five innings, but he gave up five hits, three walks and four runs,
the last on a balk. Dave Mlicki could have done that, in fact did
just that often before the Mets traded him to the Dodgers for Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez initially was supposed to return to Columbus after his
impressive debut at Yankee Stadium last Wednesday night, but the
Martian's aching shoulder and the owner's wishes bought him an
extended stay. Now, after pitching a four-hitter in the Yankees'
11-1 victory Tuesday night, he will most likely remain permanently.
Even if Joe Torre wanted to keep Mendoza in the rotation instead of
shifting him to the bullpen, his boss almost certainly would
overrule him. A change in the rotation could have an impact on the
pitching matchups for the interleague series between the Yankees
and the Mets at Shea later this month.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone hoping for a Nomo-Irabu matchup, it won't happen
unless a rainout affects the Mets' schedule. Pitching in rotation,
Nomo would start June 25, the day before the series starts. Yoshii,
though, would start the third game.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu could start against the Mets, depending on how George
Steinbrenner makes out the Yankees' rotation. If Irabu, who starts
in Montreal Wednesday, continues to start every fifth day, he also
will pitch the day before the Yankees play the Mets. But the order
could be changed if El Duque remains in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez, for one, would like to see his countryman pitch
against the Mets. The Mets' shortstop recalled Tuesday that he
faced El Duque in Cuba in 1990. ``He doesn't remember what he did
against him,'' Cookie Rojas, the Mets' coach said acting as
interpreter, ``but he remembers that he had pretty good control and
good command of his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Ordonez like to face him again? ``It would be nice to see
him again,'' the shortstop said.
</P>
<P>
   That matchup remains to be seen, but there's no question that
Hernandez, if not now in the near future, will add a Cuban flavor
to New York's U.N. pitching platoon. But with the Mets providing an
integral part of that platoon, it will put to the test the status
of the New York Mayor as host to this United Nations. A good host
would appear at Shea to greet the foreign guests. The mayor, alas,
has shown no inclination to make that gesture. He continues to
recognize only the Yankee delegation. &QL;

NEIGHBOR RECALLS SUSPECTS IN TEXAS MURDER AS BEING `JUST WILD' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By T.J. MILLING 
and RONNIE CROCKER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Neighbors in the tiny Timbers Apartments complex
knew him as Bill, an extensively tattooed ex-con, prejudiced but
not overtly so, apparently trying to get his act together after
getting out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   John William King didn't have any racist paraphernalia in his
weathered but tidy one-bedroom apartment, at least not when the
manager visited it recently. His white supremacist tattoos might
have been a hint, but nobody got close enough to make them out.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry was just a polite buddy who stopped by a
little too often, ``not the ring leader type,'' said the apartment
manager who declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three weeks ago, Lawrence Russell Brewer showed up,
tattoos dotting his arms, supposedly just a friend in from Dallas
for a week's visit, the manager said. In reality, he, like the
others, was a veteran of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Once Brewer arrived, things started to get a little rowdy,
late-night drinking bouts, some marijuana smoking and a few
screaming matches with sundry girlfriends, but nothing the likes of
the crime the three now stand accused of, the gruesome murder of a
black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought they were just wild,'' said L. Cartwright,
King's neighbor. ``I look at prejudice as ignorance, so I thought
they were just ignorant. I really didn't know they had that type of
hate inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, who is black, said the management had warned him
when he moved in that his neighbor was prejudiced. He said he could
``feel'' King's racism but there wasn't any one thing he could put
his finger on to prove it. King was just distant, said hello just
once in the six weeks Cartwright lived there, his front door one
small step away from King's.
</P>
<P>
   Several other neighbors confirmed Cartwright's account: the boys
were rambunctious and loud, but didn't seem particularly dangerous
or outwardly racist. They didn't even sport Confederate flags on
their cars, which is not uncommon in this area.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few weeks Cartwright lived there, he said, King,
23, was apparently staying on the straight and narrow, living a
fairly quiet life with his 17-year-old pregnant girlfriend, who
worked at a hamburger joint. But after Brewer showed up and Berry
started coming around more often, the parties started and the
relationship with the girl soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's when he started going back to his old ways,''
Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl showed up a few more times, once to write an
expletive-laced note in the dust on King's new girlfriend's Ford
Bronco. ``I'm pregnant with Bill's baby,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's shouting matches, similar ones between Berry and
his girlfriend and the late night parties led to complaints from
neighbors and eventual eviction proceedings by the management.
</P>
<P>
   But King headed the manager off in court, got the judge to give
him time to clean up his act. ``He was running me around,'' she
said. ``He was smart.''
</P>
<P>
   She posted another eviction notice on King's door June 2, but it
took the Jasper County Sheriff's Department's arrest of the three
Sunday to really get him out. On Tuesday, a handwritten notice,
stating ``Evicted!'' and dated the day before was plastered on the
apartment door.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors stood in the yard shaking their heads at the turn of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (King) never did anything racist,'' Cartwright said. ``He
just wasn't very friendly ... You know, just someone not to mess
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Records show King had done two stints in Texas prisons. First,
he received 10 years for a burglary in Jasper County but was
released on shock probation in early 1993. He returned as a parole
violator in June 1995, and was released to Orange County last July.
He had served his time at the Jester 2 Unit in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, also 23, was a co-defendant with King and also was
sentenced to 10 years for the Jasper County burglary. Prison
records show he arrived at Jester 2 in October 1992 and was
released on shock probation the following January.
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of Berry's arrest was a shock to others who knew him
in Jasper. Mike Twine, a 21-year-old black man, said he used to
compete against him in local rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought he'd do anything like this,'' said Twine, who
said Berry seemed like a friendly individual with no hatred for
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrence Brewer Sr.'s son arrived home in Sulphur Springs
from his latest trip to the penitentiary, there was one striking
change: Tattoos covered much of both arms.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Brewer said he told him getting the tattoos was ``a
sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was typically tense for a father and son who had
grown estranged over the younger man's drug use and legal problems
from the time he was 18 or 19 years old. The young man left in a
huff.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the tattoos indicate the ex-con's affiliation
with the white supremacy movement. That comes as another sad
surprise to his father, a retired infantry soldier who served in
Vietnam and spent 20 years in the Army. He swears his son was not
reared like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as great a shock to me as what they done,'' he said
from his Sulphur Springs home in northeast Texas. Traveling the
country in the military his three sons and two daughters went to
school and church with numerous blacks and Hispanics, he said, with
no troubling incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was involved in any type activity like that, it had to
be when he was in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer described his son as a ``normal kid'' who dropped out of
school in the 11th grade but went on to earn an equivalency
diploma. ``He's no dummy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems started, Brewer said, with serious drug abuse in
the young man's late teens. That was something he could not abide
of someone living at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Prison records show the younger Brewer, now 31, served time in
the Beto I prison unit at Tennessee Colony. He was incarcerated on
a seven-year sentence for breaking into a house in July 1987, then
paroled the following February; went back with 15 years on a drug
possession charge in May 1989, then was paroled in May 1991; was
returned to prison on a parole violation in February 1994 and got
out again last September.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Brewer Sr. said he thought his son had straightened out
his life this time, but that he went through a series of jobs and
left the area after a breakup with his girlfriend _ presumably on a
bus bound for Houston. He said he had not seen his son in about six
months and had never even heard of Jasper. He received word of the
latest arrest from a friend who had seen a news report.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said that, if his son is guilty, he deserves whatever
punishment is coming. His sympathy, he said, is reserved for Byrd's
family and for his own wife who is grieving for their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure feel sympathy for the victim in this case,'' Brewer Sr.
said. He repeated the sentiment several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the color of your skin is gonna cause you to be killed,''
he said, finally, ``there's something wrong with society.''

BUDGET FEUD COULD RESULT IN HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The political deadlock over the shape of the city's
next budget could cause owners of single-, two- and three-family
houses to pay about $50 more in taxes in the next fiscal year. And
the Council and the mayor's office blamed each other for the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the mayor's office and the City Council were able
to persuade the state Legislature to allow the city to manipulate
property tax rates to keep property taxes for those homeowners
artificially low. But Tuesday, aides to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Speaker Peter Vallone said that because of the budget feud, it was
unlikely that the two men would make the trip together this year to
Albany to lobby for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and Giuliani have been locked in fiscal gamesmanship
since the Council defied the mayor and passed its own budget last
Friday. On Monday, the Council _ as it usually does in June _
reviewed the city's property tax rates and left the overall rate
unchanged. But taxes will rise for those homeowners unless a state
rate is also changed.
</P>
<P>
   Each side vowed Tuesday to try to persuade the
Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate
to agree on a bill to limit the increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go to Albany ourselves,'' said Randy Mastro, deputy
mayor for operations. ``The mayor will try to reverse this
situation himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McMahon, the director of the Council's Finance Division,
said the Council had, on its own, persuaded Assembly leaders
Tuesday to introduce a bill to limit the increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Giuliani administration is ready to join us, mazel
tov,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes on property from single-family homes to condominiums to
skyscrapers are calculated each year according to a complicated
city and state formula based on property market value. In previous
years, the mayor and the Council have lobbied together to limit the
increases on the politically influential group of owners of single-
and two- and three-family homes, essentially keeping the rate flat.
</P>
<P>
   But this year _ because the mayor and speaker failed to lobby
Albany to reduce that percentage from its 5 percent level _ the
taxes levied on property owners will more closely reflect their
real market value, fiscal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That has left those owners facing an average $50 a year increase
in property taxes, while the city's co-op, condo and
apartment-building owners will actually benefit with decreases
averaging $65.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the benefits of little skirmishes between the
mayor and the Council,'' said Raymond Horton, president of the
Citizens Budget Commission. ``Finally, we're getting property tax
reform because the mayor and Council cannot agree on a budget.''

NEW SPICE FOR A STAPLE OF SUMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 23, when the nation's oldest summer dance festival opens
in tiny Becket, Mass., it will have a new director, Ella Baff.
Running Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival is hard work, but Ms. Baff is
full of ambitious visions. For one thing, she would like to give
the 10-week event a stronger musical profile. For another, she
talks excitedly about winterizing the Pillow's rustic cabins so
that artists can work there year round.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those cabins date back to the early 1930s, when the
modern-dance pioneer Ted Shawn and his Men Dancers company built a
handful of studios on lush sprawling farmland in Becket in the
Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   Performances began in 1932, at first for elderly dowagers in the
area. But by the 1940s, after Shawn's company had disbanded, the
Pillow was well on its way to becoming a festival known and
cherished for its smorgasbord approach to dance, with each program
a wildly diverse mix of genres.
</P>
<P>
   Though bigger, sleeker and internationally known now, the Pillow
has retained a good deal of its early atmosphere, remaining a home
away from home, where dancers and choreographers can create as well
as present new work. For Ms. Baff, who was appointed in April, it
is a sanctuary for thought as well as action. ``It's a very
peaceful place, a spiritual place,'' she said. ``An ideal
environment for sound thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking over the lineup of attractions at the festival, which
opens with performances by Ballet Hispanico and the Bebe Miller
Company, one could be forgiven for assuming that the Pillow might
be a pretty hectic place for reflection.
</P>
<P>
   There will be programs by 19 companies and solo dancers in the
two theaters, with additional events on an informal outdoor stage.
Eleven dances and works-in-progress have been commissioned by the
Pillow, which won this year's prestigious Capezio Award for service
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Ms. Baff's intense and far-ranging conversation in
a Manhattan restaurant, it soon becomes clear that she relishes
meeting challenges head-on.
</P>
<P>
   She comes to the Pillow via Cal Performances, which produces
arts events at the University of California at Berkeley, where she
was program director and director of education and community
projects. Growing up in New York City in an arts-conscious family
that also produced the stage actress Regina Baff, she studied music
as well as dance. ``To this day, music is one of the most important
things in my life,'' said Ms. Baff, who declined to give her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never in my mind to be an arts administrator,'' she
continued. ``In fact, it makes me wince on a certain level. There
was no such thing as `arts administration' when I was coming up.
But I certainly respect the field, which is primarily about
supporting artists and having the arts be better appreciated by the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Being an arts administrator is also about having a passion for
the arts, she added, citing Ivan Sygoda, a director of the Pentacle
performing-arts service organization and a tireless dancegoer, as
epitomizing ``the love and internal understanding of the arts''
that are central to good administration.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting artists and developing community programs at Cal
Performances, known for the adventurousness of its dance
productions, was also good preparation for her new job. As director
of education, Ms. Baff created more than 100 programs that brought
audiences and artists together and offered young people
opportunities to immerse themselves in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baff has arrived at a festival that only recently, under the
direction of the previous director, Sali Ann Kriegsman, pulled
itself back from the brink of bankruptcy. ``The board and staff
demonstrated an exemplary institutional will,'' Ms. Baff said.
``Businesses go through this. Arts organizations go through this.
The measure of success to me is not so much what happened but the
result produced. Now the big work occurs to keep the Pillow
healthy. The need for contributions is never-ending.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival's operating budget for the 1997-98 season is $3.2
million. The Pillow has paid off its deficit and plans to invest a
$1 million grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation so that
interest may be accumulated to pay for commissioning works and
much-needed repairs to its 150-acre site, an important part of
American cultural history, as well as a stop on the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   This season's performers were chosen by Ms. Kriegsman, but Ms.
Baff worked on the programming. That has helped her to envision
some future directions for the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer,'' she said, ``we have a very, very compelling
group of composers working with our choreographers. Mark Morris
will collaborate with John Harbison, and the choreographer Joanna
Haigood and the composer and singer Linda Tillery have created a
site-specific piece that evokes the experiences of slaves fleeing
north on the Underground Railroad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Baff is excited about the mix of jazz composers and
choreographers who are collaborating this season, among them Bebe
Miller with Don Byron, Donald Byrd with Max Roach, Vernon Reid with
Geri Allen. Most dance companies cannot afford to pay musicians and
perform to taped scores, but Dianne McIntyre will appear with the
jazz composer Lester Bowie and his Brass Fantasy. ``I'd like to be
able to have them all come up and participate,'' Ms. Baff said.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the emphasis on jazz will draw more music lovers to
the Pillow and is plotting a means to attract Berkshires theater
lovers and antiques hunters as well. ``Two million people pass
through the Berkshires each summer,'' she said. ``Of course I want
them all to come to the Pillow. I want to encourage more public
access at the Pillow. I want to encourage people to see the entire
picture of Jacob's Pillow. The whole is greater than the parts,
though the parts are quite incredible, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baff would also like to make it possible for visitors to
watch occasional classes and rehearsals, or, while strolling
through the grounds, to catch glimpses of conversing artists like
Meredith Monk and Edward Villella, director of the Miami City
Ballet, both of whom will be at the Pillow this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There are many opportunities, Ms. Baff said, to capture the
``accidental audience'' as it passes by and to provide chances for
learning in a casual but stimulating way _ ``the kind of planned
spontaneous combustion that is very exciting for everyone,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Want the public to consider dance in the broadest and
richest way,'' she said. ``I'd like to present more dance from
other countries. While I want to support the home team, I also have
a big appetite for the world. Wherever you travel, there is better
and less good art. I don't care if it's from Bali or the Bronx. I'm
looking for work that is going to engage people.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's other major summer dance festival, the American
Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., has always been affiliated with
academic institutions. But when the school year begins, the Durham
festival must end. The Pillow, on the other hand, could operate all
year. Even now, a few artists work there in the fall and spring. If
the studios and living spaces were winterized, Ms. Baff said, they
could have year-round residencies.

AN UNREPENTANT LEFTIST MOVES BACK INTO SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 14)  
 (JT)  
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Surprisingly perhaps, given his distaste for the
prevailing social order, Ken Loach was never an angry young man.
Shy and soft-spoken, he was almost 30 by the time he set off down
the path that three decades later earned him recognition in Europe
as the dean of leftist movie makers. Until then, he simply
personified the new social mobility of postwar Britain: born of a
``working-class Tory'' father, he did his military service in the
Royal Air Force, studied law at Oxford University, tried his hand
at acting and then joined the BBC as a television director.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the BBC, he turned radical, making his name in 1966 with
a television docudrama called ``Cathy Come Home,'' which for the
first time denounced homelessness in Britain. And well into the
1970s, in the tradition of Italian neo-realists like Vittorio De
Sica, Loach continued to make television and feature films with
strong social content. Then, in 1979, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher started her conservative revolution, and financing
evaporated for his kind of socialist realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the British movie industry at the time had any perception
of what I did, it was that I made films in an impenetrable dialect,
driven by a kind of hard-line Marxist view, which no one would want
to see,'' Loach, 61, recalled in a recent interview over coffee at
a bookstore in central London, ``and, if they did want to see them,
they wouldn't understand them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, however, the pendulum had begun to swing away
from Thatcherism. Britain had changed: it was no longer a nation
with an economy dominated by government-owned industries and
powerful trade unions, and awareness of the social cost of factory
and mine closings was growing. Suddenly, thanks to backing from
Britain's Channel Four Films, Loach was able to work again.
Starting in 1990 with ``Hidden Agenda,'' set in troubled Northern
Ireland, he demonstrated with a series of small-budget movies that
he was just as energetic and politically committed as he had ever
been. For some in Britain, his ideological drumbeating seemed
antiquated, but he was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla's Song,'' which was made in 1996 and opens in New York
on June 26, is the fifth movie of his comeback. The others are
``Riff-Raff'' (1991), about union-busting in the construction
industry; ``Raining Stones'' (1993), about a grim housing project
in Manchester; ``Ladybird, Ladybird'' (1994), about a distraught
single mother of four, and ``Land and Freedom'' (1995), about the
Spanish Civil War. ``My Name Is Joe,'' which was finished recently
and has no release date in the United States yet, was well received
at the Cannes International Film Festival last month, with Peter
Mullan winning the best actor's award for his role as a reformed
alcoholic struggling to rebuild his life in a rundown Glasgow
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla's Song,'' though, is unusual in that Loach takes his
story outside Britain. He did this once before, in ``Land and
Freedom,'' which follows a young Englishman who volunteers to fight
against Franco's forces in the late 1930s. But in ``Carla's Song''
he has tackled an international conflict that until recently at
least was highly topical: the war that pitted the United
States-backed contras against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government during much of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1987, the film starts in Glasgow. George, a bus driver
played by Robert Carlyle (``Trainspotting,'' ``The Full Monty'')
meets and is smitten with Carla (Oyanka Cabezas), a young
Sandinista exile who dances on sidewalks to make ends meet. He
offers to help her, but Carla is hesitant, only slowly revealing
her pain at fleeing Nicaragua's war and at abandoning a badly
wounded boyfriend. George tries to distract her, taking her for a
drive around Loch Lomond in his double-decker bus. But eventually
he concludes that she has to return home and that he will go with
her.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, speaking nothing but English with a strong
Glaswegian accent, George feels he has arrived on a different
planet. But through Carla he meets peasants who boast of the
Sandinistas' land-distribution program, and he learns that the
United States is trying to crush the revolution. He is also caught
in a contra attack on a Sandinista village and wonders just what he
is doing there: he has followed a woman and found himself in a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want the usual device of the fearless reporter or
the person who goes there with the aim of discovery,'' Loach
explained. ``The point was to take a guy who is a humorous,
thoughtful guy but who doesn't even know where Nicaragua is. We
wanted a person drawn in against his wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the film came from Paul Laverty, 41, a Glasgow
lawyer who did human-rights work in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s and
who in 1992 sent Loach a movie treatment out of the blue. The
director encouraged Laverty to try his hand at screenwriting, and
after three years of writing and rewriting, the script for
``Carla's Song'' was completed. ( Laverty also wrote ``My Name Is
Joe.'') Of course, by the time the Nicaraguan section of the film
was shot, early in 1996, the fighting was long over and the
Sandinistas had been voted out of office. But Loach was soon
persuaded that the United States had been the guilty party in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``My judgment in the end was that if the Americans had not
intervened,'' he said, ``a lot of things that went wrong with the
Sandinistas would not have gone wrong because it came out of their
inevitable inability to keep the revolution afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle, who has been a great admirer of Loach's political
engagement since they worked together on ``Riff-Raff,'' said that
like his character in ``Carla's Song,'' he had experienced deep
culture shock arriving in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no way can you be prepared for that kind of third-world
poverty,'' he said. ``It affected me profoundly. A lot of people
who know me well said it changed me. It made me see things
differently.''

UPSET IN NEWARK RUNOFF ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A 29-year-old Rhodes scholar and newcomer to
Newark upset a four-term councilman in the city's Central Ward
Tuesday in a runoff election that most said touched on some deep
discontent with established politicians and mobilized
long-discouraged voters.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 80 percent of the districts reporting Tuesday
night, Cory Booker, a cum laude graduate of Stanford University and
a graduate of Oxford University and Yale Law School, defeated
George Branch, 69, who for the last 16 years had represented the
district where the 1967 Newark riots started. Unofficial returns
indicated that Mr. Booker had about percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff was necessary because neither candidate got a
majority of the vote in the May 12, nonpartisan municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In other runoffs, the three incumbents running for re-election
to the four at-large Council seats that were up for grabs in an
eight-person race won easily. They were Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins,
Luis Quintana and Donald Tucker. They were joined by a newcomer,
Bessie Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's West Ward, an Essex County college professor,
Mamie Bridgeforth, seemed headed for victory with 60 percent of the
vote in nearly complete returns.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the race between Booker and Branch that attracted the
most attention and seemed to test whether residents of the ward,
which has seen much redevelopment and change in demographics in the
last decade, would stay with the incumbent who had the support of
Mayor Sharpe James or strike out in a new direction with a untested
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It was pandemonium at the Booker headquarters as car horns
blared and the sirens of a campaign van sounded to announce their
candidate's victory. Into the celebration strolled Branch and his
wife, Joyce, who had walked from their own campaign headquarters
around the corner to concede defeat and congratulate Booker.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that seemed uncharacteristic in a campaign that
had turned bitter, with anonymous literature and angry charges in
the final days.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, moments earlier in his own headquarters addressing his
supporters, Branch had been anything but conciliatory as he labeled
Booker ``an outsider'' who was controlled by whites who had
abandoned the city in its time of need but were now trying to gain
a foothold as things were improving.
</P>
<P>
   But standing next to Booker later, Branch was gracious and even
a bit jocular as he said he said of the race and the anonymous
campaign literature that ``I tried to win it clean, but it was
hard.'' The two embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply touched,'' Booker said. ``He showed great dignity
in defeat and in passing the torch to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Booker in an interview vowed as he had during the campaign to
accept only the $55,000 salary for the part-time council member's
job and turn down such perks as a car with a telephone, which he
called ``a disgusting use of city finances.' He also repeated his
pledge to account for every penny of the $18,000 budget each
Council member gets.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the vote, both the Booker and Branch camps agreed
on what had happened. Booker's nontraditional technique of knocking
on nearly every door in the district surprised the Branch forces,
which worked with the traditional political organizations and
churches in the district.

 VIOLENCE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She wanted him to die that night.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly four years, Betty DellaCorte Ryan had endured her
husband's slaps, kicks and punches. They often left her in a bloody
mess and heading for the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   She could tell this night was going to be another bad one by the
way he was ranting and screaming at her. Lately, he had been
threaten ing to pull out his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're shacking up with men,'' Ryan recalls him yelling at
her. Then, he shouted for another beer. That was her cue.
</P>
<P>
   She walked into the kitchen, pulled out a fistful of Valium, got
a beer from the refrigerator and began dropping the capsules into
the can. She was amazed at how calm and natural it all seemed.
</P>
<P>
   `` `One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven. That should do it,' '' she says she thought to herself. ``I
slept so good that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband passed out before he could finish the beer, but
survived.
</P>
<P>
   That night in 1971 was a turning point for Ryan. It pushed her
to become a pioneer in the battle against domestic violence. In
1974, Ryan founded Faith House, one of the first domestic abuse
shelters in Arizona and the country. Six years later, she opened a
Faith House in Prescott to help victims in less urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her legacy has grown. There are eight licensed shelters
in Maricopa County, with a little more than 200 beds for domestic
abuse victims. Other agencies, such as homeless shelters, also
provide beds to domestic violence victims.
</P>
<P>
   In July, she expects to break ground on a 5-acre domestic vio
lence center with services that will include plastic surgery to
repair damage, counseling for batterers and victims, crisis housing
for victims and job training. The shel ter, she says, will be
called Prospect Park, after a place in Brooklyn where she sought
refuge from an abusive home.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her patio office last week, Ryan looked back on her
65 years of life. So much of it, she says, seems like such a
distant nightmare. &UR; Nights she spent crouched in her front-yard
bushes to escape the beatings. All the bruises she tried to cover
with makeup. A broken nose. And the time she woke up with a gun to
her head and he pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was empty that time. And she vowed there would be no
next time. She filed for divorce the next day.
</P>
<P>
   She was already attending classes at Al-Anon, a 12-step program
for families of alcoholics. It helped her understand why she stayed
with her abuser and how she could break the cycle of violence she
kept repeating and repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Turning and looking out the window, Ryan says her life had
always been a violent one. She recounts a childhood memory.
</P>
<P>
   She is 4 years old and in the kitchen of her Brooklyn home,
clinging to the front of her mother's legs. Her mother has her arms
wrapped around her, trying to block the blows to the child's back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her father continues to beat her until she slides down
her mother's apron, catches her two front teeth on it and they rip
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were loose already,'' Ryan said. ``See, even to this day
I tend to minimalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimalizing and rationalizing was how Ryan says she made it
through life.
</P>
<P>
   First, she did it for her father. Later, it was for her first
and second husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Her first husband also had been abusive. Ryan says he was very
controlling and criticized everything she did. By the time she
divorced him in 1963, after 11 years of marriage and the birth of
two daughters, she says, she had little self-esteem left and fell
victim to a physically abusive second husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all I knew,'' confesses Ryan, who divorced her second
husband after 3{ years. ``I didn't know there was any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Anon, Ryan says, helped her realize she had choices. It also
got her started in the domestic violence field. From her Al-Anon
meetings, Ryan had met other women who were being beaten by their
hus bands. She began offering them and their children shelter in
her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would wake up in the morn ing and see these women and
children asleep in our living room,'' recalls Lisa Gebhardt, Ryan's
38-year-old daughter. ``At first, I really resented it. I wanted
nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lisa and her sister, Robin Burke, are part of the Faith
House team. Robin runs the Prescott shel ter and Lisa manages the
alternative programs in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of taking domes tic violence victims into her
home, Ryan decided to convert her resi dence officially into the
first do mestic abuse shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the shelter ran only with volunteers and
donations. Later, bingo games helped fund the programs and build
the Prescott facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a constant struggle for funding. We've had to work
so hard for every dollar we get,'' Ryan says. ``I remember going to
the food bank to put meals on the table for the women. We still
have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ryan would do practi cally everything. Her right-hand
assistant was _ and still is _ Flo Mills, another domestic abuse
survi vor. The two women would take the victims to Al-Anon meetings
and counseling sessions and wipe away their tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we would cry with them,'' says Ryan, who today
mostly handles chief executive duties, such as securing funding,
and lobbies for stricter laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on how her life has changed, Ryan wants to provide
hope to other women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me. People told me it couldn't be done. They told me
what I had was a dream and they couldn't invest in a dream,'' Ryan
says. ``That's why we call it Faith House, because it was built on
faith.'' &QL;

7 TEENS ACCUSED OF RAPING GIRL, 15 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven Staten Island teen-agers have been accused of raping a
15-year-old New Jersey girl after luring her to a motel room in a
resort town on the south Jersey shore, where police said the young
men gave her alcoholic drinks and photographed the sexual assault,
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, whose name was not released because of the nature of
the crime, was attacked by the seven teen-agers on Sunday around 5
p.m., said Capt. John Harkins of the North Wildwood Police
Department. She was taken to Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital,
where she was treated and released, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, who range in age from 16 to 18 years old,
assaulted the girl shortly after meeting her and a friend on the
boardwalk that lines Wildwood Island, about 45 miles south of
Atlantic City, Harkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls were on a school trip and had been staying on the
island for the weekend, authorities said. They decided to sneak
away from the school group and were convinced by the boys to return
to their room at the Grey Manor Motel at 2100 Surf Ave. in
Wildwood, about two and a half miles from the motel where the girls
were staying in Wildwood Crest, Harkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Harkins said, the girls were given alcohol. The
group partied for a period of time before one girl left the room
and walked back to the motel where the school group was staying.
The girl alerted a chaperone, who telephoned police, Harkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The chaperone later found the 15-year-old disoriented and
wandering the Boardwalk, police reported. Authorities then went to
the Grey Manor Motel, where the boys were arrested and police
seized photos that were taken by the suspects during the assault,
Harkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-olds were identified as Jared McCleary Moore, a
resident of the Dongan Hills section of Staten Island; Gary Thomas
Stark and Marques Cardin Parker, whose addresses were not
immediately known. Police did not release the names of the other
four teen-agers because they are juveniles _ three are 17 years old
and the other is 16. All have been charged with aggravated sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday night, Moore was still being held in the Cape May
County Jail because he was unable to post the $15,000 bail, an
administrator at the jail said. Phone calls to his family's home
were not returned.

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ In one of the most vicious racial crimes in
modern Texas history, three young white men with a fetish for white
supremacy have been charged with murdering a black man by chaining
him to a pickup and dragging him for almost three miles on a
winding road through the East Texas woods.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, 49-year-old James Byrd Jr.'s head and right arm
were ripped from his mangled body.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are small-time criminals who live in the area, had
no history of violence but who may have recently become enamored
with the Aryan Nation and the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start the Turner Diaries early,'' one of the
suspects ominously declared, according to an affidavit released by
the FBI, which has joined local authorities in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous reference to a document that serves as a kind
of bible for white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode is a horrendous example of the rage that is out
there,'' said Joe Roy, head of the intelligence project of the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often than not, it's based on dehumanization of blacks,
whites, Asians, gays. There's a daily dose of hatred. They're
dehumanized: `This isn't a human being we're dragging behind a
vehicle, it's a thing, a target.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a window of what's going on in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there were 5,396 racial hate crimes were reported by the
U.S. Justice Department in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The crime that has stunned this prosperous timber town and
county seat of 8,000. While local lawmen and a small army of FBI
agents and some local residents express shock, others complain that
racial unrest is seething just below the quiet surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no organized KKK or Aryan Brotherhood groups here in
Jasper County,'' said Sheriff Billy Rowles, a declaration that
prompted whoops and catcalls from the black residents.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene, a line pointed to a broken culvert and the stark
word ``HEAD'' written in Day-Glo orange chalk in the ditch on the
side of Huff Creek Road, a twisty back road through the woods. His
torso was found more than a mile away and a line of dozens of
painted circles along the way point to the path that investigators
say three Jasper men took as they dragged Byrd behind their pickup
in the early hours of Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The three young suspects charged in Byrd's death may have had
connections with or at least been sympathizers of such white
supremacy groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Texas prisons system said there was nothing
to indicate the men were members of that group while incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said he didn't think the trio planned Byrd's grisly
murder before it happened. He also said he doubts it was in
retaliation of an earlier murder of a local white man by one of his
black former employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys aren't smart enough to retaliate,'' Rowles said of
the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23 and from
Jasper, and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs,
are being held without bail in the Jasper County jail. All three
have been charged with murder, but that may be expanded to capital
murder, officials said, meaning prosecutors can seek the death
penalty. Federal charges of violating Byrd's civil rights may also
be added.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit used to charge the trio, an investigator said
Berry told officers that he and the other two men were riding
around in his pickup sometime after 12:45 a.m. Sunday when they saw
a black man walking along a road.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents said Byrd _ known around town as ``Toe'' because
his toe had been cut off in an accident _ was frequently seen
walking around the eastern end of the town. He lived by himself in
a small apartment and received a small disability check.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that night he had been at a couple of gatherings of
friends and relatives. Famous locally for his fine voice and
trumpet and piano playing, he entertained at both get-togethers by
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he didn't know Byrd but recognized him as someone
from around Jasper. He said he offered him a ride in the back of
his pickup.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berry, this made King upset, who cursed and called
Byrd a racial epithet.
</P>
<P>
   With Byrd riding in the truck bed, Berry and the other two white
men drove to a local convenience store east of Jasper. At that
point, King takes over the wheel and begins heading out of town to
Huff Creek Road. Then he turned onto a dirt road and warned he was
``fixin' to scare the s--- out of this n-----.''
</P>
<P>
   They all got out of the truck, Berry said, and his companions
began beating Byrd. The affidavit gives no explanation for why the
men began beating their passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, the black male appeared to be unconscious to
Berry,'' the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he started to run away and then got back into the
truck when King drove up to him. ``Are you going to leave him out
there?'' Berry said he asked King.
</P>
<P>
   King answered, ``We're going to start the Turner Diaries
early.''
</P>
<P>
   King turned back onto Huff Creek Road, a winding, hilly back
road in the woods. Berry said Brewer looked behind the truck and
said, ``That (expletive's) bouncing all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who said he was unaware that the others had chained Byrd
to the truck, said he looked toward the rear to see Byrd ``being
dragged.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he asked to be let out of the truck and King said,
``You're just as guilty as we are. Besides, the same thing could
happen to a n---lover.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take investigators long to catch the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   At the point where Berry said Byrd was beaten, investigators
said they found a cigarette lighter with the word ``Possum''
inscribed on it along with a triangular symbol. Possum was the
nickname for King in prison, according to King's girlfriend, Kylie
Greeney, who was interviewed by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   They also found a torque wrench set, with the name ``Berry''
inscribed on it in cursive handwriting. They also found a compact
disc by the heavy metal rock group Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route up and down Huff Creek Road they found Byrd's
tennis shoes, shirt, wallet, keys and even his dentures. The trail
of dried blood indicated Byrd had been dragged three miles, Rowles
said.
</P>
<P>
   His head and right arm were severed when the body rolled into a
roadside ditch and slammed into a concrete culvert.
</P>
<P>
   A local resident told officers that he saw Byrd between 2:30 and
2:45 that morning walking along Martin Luther King Drive in east
Jasper. The resident said that he later saw Byrd riding in the back
of a gray or black stepside pickup. Inside the truck were two or
three white men.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m. Sunday Berry was arrested for several traffic
violations and his 1982 gray Ford truck was impounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the truck investigators found other tools inscribed with the
name ``Berry.'' They also found blood spattered on the
undercarriage on the passenger side. It also had red clay and
vegetation stuck to it similar to the clay and vegetation the
killers' truck had driven through.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said his officers found posters and other items at King's
apartment in western Jasper that indicated that he is in sympathy
with white supremacist groups. Berry and Brewer had been living in
King's apartment, investigators said. All three were unemployed,
Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Byrd's murder has upset many in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor R.C. Horn, who is black, said, ``I have been getting phone
calls all day.'' He and other leaders said they have been besieged
with calls from worried citizens who heard rumors that another
victim was dragged behind a vehicle and killed in nearby Woodville,
that a threatening sign was left on Byrd's body or on a black
church. Rowles and other lawmen denied those stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's just a random hate crime,'' Horn said. ``This does
not represent Jasper. I feel we can live amicably together,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Booker T. Hunter, president of Jasper's National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People chapter, said: ``This is not the
first time this has happened. People are watching to see how this
is handled.'' &QL;

ANALYSIS: BUDGET FEUD SEEMS HEADED FOR COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nasty skirmish that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
the speaker of the City Council, Peter Vallone, are engaged in
along the margins of a $34 billion budget will most likely end up
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, those on both sides say, the public will witness the
stuff that suffices for high drama in City Hall: The rare execution
of mayoral vetoes. The equally rare override of those
budget-related vetoes by a Council not known for inviting
confrontation. The eventual freezing of city funds. And the
possibility that the tensions between the city's two most powerful
leaders will have repercussions for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   All this will play out with a touch of the politically absurd,
given that the city enjoys a $2 billion surplus, more than enough
under normal circumstances to strike friendships among enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's tit-for-tat stuff,'' said Thomas McMahon, the
Council's budget director. ``And it's definitely unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   For those joining ``Budget: The Movie'' in midshowing, here is a
brief synopsis:
</P>
<P>
   Budget negotiations ended about two weeks ago, virtually before
they began, and the two sides cannot even agree on why. Council
leaders say Giuliani demanded that Vallone drop plans for a
referendum on whether city money should be used to build a
Manhattan stadium for the New York Yankees. The mayor's aides
counter that the Council was intransigent on negotiating various
tax-cut proposals _ although they acknowledge that, yes, Giuliani
has a thing about the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone quickly seized the opportunity created by the impasse.
For the first time since the city charter's revision in 1989, the
Council on Friday adopted its own budget _ one that was $49 million
less than the budget proposed by the mayor. This act of
independence presented Giuliani with the City Hall equivalent to a
schoolyard double dare: What are you going do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Vallone recently asserted that ``there is no politics in
adopting the budget,'' and that he wanted the City Council to be
seen as something more than a stable of amusing mayoral sidekicks.
But he is running for governor, his referendum plan would bring out
the vote, and he sorely needed to shed his image as a compliant
speaker who has acquiesced to the mayor's budgetary desires in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his aides argued that politics obviously motivated
Vallone; they also demonstrated that they were up to the
double-dare challenge. After some thrusts and parries over revenue
estimates and property tax rates, the mayor issued a line-item veto
Monday that would cut $4.6 million from the Council's allocation
for itself _ a warning of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the rest of the movie, one not written to have a happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Vallone will push his knife just a tad deeper by
introducing a bill to hold the stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Giuliani will use his own knife, in the form of
his veto power, to cut tens of millions of dollars from the
Council's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor declined Tuesday to say where he would cut, although
some possible places are libraries and cultural institutions, the
recycling program and parks. Tuesday night the Council issued a
helpful pre-emptive response to what the mayor might cut, warning
that they could be programs ``helping working families'' or
``helping vulnerable children.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the mayor vetoes those spending items that offend him, the
Council has 10 days to summon a two-thirds' majority from its 51
members to override the veto. Vallone should have no trouble
achieving that in the overwhelmingly Democratic Council. And his
aides said that they planned to put the vetoes to a vote as soon as
possible, to contain the mayor's opportunity to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was aware of the probable outcome. ``I'm
realistic enough to understand that whatever I do with the vetoes,
they're going to override,'' he said. ``It's largely symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most people follow the Gregorian calendar, those in
City Hall follow the fiscal calendar, and fiscal year 1998 _ the
Year of the Surplus _ will end on June 30. Like partners in a
marriage of necessity, both the Council and the mayor's offices are
required by city law to come together one more time for ``the
Close.''
</P>
<P>
   This means that the two sides must agree to budget modifications
that will balance the books for the fiscal year that has just
ended.
</P>
<P>
   But that brief moment of consensus does not mean that fiscal
year 1999 will bring peace to City Hall. Once his vetoes are
rejected, the mayor is required by the City Charter to begin the
new fiscal year by executing the budget given to him by the
Council. But the charter also requires him to be fiscally prudent,
and to keep the city's books balanced. And these are the
responsibilities he is likely to use to keep the Council's bravado
in check.
</P>
<P>
   The charter ``gives the mayor the power of impoundment,'' he
said. ``And it gives the mayor the power to set up accounts in each
one of the agencies and to hold back the spending of money until
we're sure that we're not going to have a shortfall in some part of
the budget, or the entire budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know I'll use those powers aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   How the mayor uses his powers to impound _ to freeze funds
selectively _ will be closely watched by the Council's leaders.
They say those drastic powers were meant for times of fiscal
crisis, and not for the mayor's political whims; the mayor's
advisers say that the charter language makes no specific
constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Council could say it's a misuse of the power, and even
though that may have been the intention, the charter doesn't spell
that out,'' said Frank Mauro, who was the director of research for
the commission that amended the Charter in 1989. ``Whether or not a
court would say that's a proper exercise of his power remains to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Mauro identified the only language on which both
the Council and the mayor agree: See you in court. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, has been
carving out some interesting political territory for the
Republicans. In recent days he has denounced legislation aimed at
curbing teen-age smoking and suggested that the best response to
school shootings was more guns. When both parties are supposed to
be pursuing the women's vote, it is unusual to see a politician
promote a survival-of-the-fittest theory of child rearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lott takes premises that most people agree with _ new taxes are
undesirable, adults should be allowed to own guns _ and elevates
them to immutable laws. Consistency is all, rationality is for
sissies. Defending the cause of states' rights recently, Lott spoke
out against a national drunk-driving standard by arguing that it
was wrong for the federal government to say ``do it our way or we
will punish you.''
</P>
<P>
   His gymnastics on tobacco legislation seem particularly peculiar
for a man whose political career depends on continued Republican
control of the House and Senate. The anti-tobacco bill, which is
targeted at reducing teen-age smoking, is probably the best-known
piece of legislation Congress is considering this year. The
Republican-controlled Senate Commerce Committee approved it 19 to
1. But Senate Republicans, led by Lott, are now denouncing it as a
big-government measure. ``It's a spending bill and it should be
pulled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking time out from these retrograde legislative efforts, Lott
marched to the National Rifle Association convention and vowed to
oppose any effort to tighten gun-control laws. Parents everywhere
have been horrified by the repeated scenes of weeping students at
schools shot up by classmates who have easily obtained
military-quality weapons. In response, many lawmakers have demanded
trigger locks and requirements that gun owners store weapons where
children cannot get at them. But Lott, whose own state has been hit
by schoolyard murders, told the NRA that the real key to change was
``a well-armed public.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislative leaders should be defining the agenda and
tone of this fall's campaign in a way that appeals to sensible
Americans. Instead Newt Gingrich is busy plotting against campaign
finance reform, while Lott is trying to protect the rights of
children to get their hands on guns and cigarettes. At least no one
can accuse them of pandering to the soccer moms.

JENNIFER CONVERTIBLES ORDERED TO COMPENSATE 780 PATRONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Convertibles Inc., one of the largest chains of
furniture stores in the New York region, has been ordered to
compensate more than 700 customers following what Attorney General
Dennis Vacco said was a flood of customer complaints since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The chain, which operates 200 stores across the nation _ 50 of
them are in New York City and on Long Island _ ``took money from
consumers but failed to deliver the furniture they ordered as
promised,'' Vacco said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jennifer had signed a consent order in which it agreed
to make full restitution to 780 customers who had complained of a
variety of improper business practices, including delivering
damaged furniture and refusing to honor warranties on its products.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said the company agreed to provide refunds to other
customers who make complaints to his office and to have those
complaints substantiated by his staff, within 180 days. Under the
consent order, handed down last week by the New York state Supreme
Court in Albany, Jennifer was also assessed a $70,000 fine and
ordered to pay $2,000 to defray part of the state's costs for its
investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office was flooded with horror stories from consumers who
said that their pleas to Jennifer about damaged couches, and
defective chairs _ even the delivery of sofas that did not conform
to the model they selected _ were met with deafening silence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Jennifer, based in Woodbury, N.Y., did not return
phone calls Tuesday. Bernard Wincig, a Manhattan lawyer who is a
director of Jennifer and who represented the company in
negotiations with Vacco's staff, and before the state Surpreme
Court in Albany, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vacco's staff, the complaints against Jennifer and
the order for compensation involve customers of its stores across
the nation. Because the company is based in New York, Vacco has
jurisdiction over its business practices in all states, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But while only 25 percent of Jennifer's stores are in New York
City and on Long Island, lawyers involved in the investigation said
700 of the 780 complaints that had been received were from
customers in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible amount of complaints to be coming from a
quarter of the company's stores, and it signaled to us that
something was very much awry,'' said Mollie Conkey, a spokeswoman
for Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Among the customers' complaints were that Jennifer had failed to
give timely refunds on defective or damaged furniture, failed to
make repairs, refused to let customers inspect furniture when it
was being delivered and failed to disclose estimated delivery dates
in its customer contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conkey said the investigation of Jennifer began in September
1995 when the attorney general's Consumer Protection Bureau noticed
an unusually high number of complaints coming in from New York City
and Long Island customers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, working with the state's Better Business Bureau, which
sent inquiries to its counterparts across the nation, she said
lawyers for the state documented the high number of complaints
across the nation and their concentration in the New York City
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   She said a smaller number of complaints had been received from
customers in New Jersey, Connecticut and other cities in New York,
including Scarsdale and Albany.

EDITORIAL: NIGERIA'S OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   The death this week of Sani Abacha, the corrupt and abusive
Nigerian military dictator, is an opportunity for an African giant
to begin to lift itself from poverty, fear and decay. Abacha so
discredited military rule that in recent months even many officers
began to join ordinary Nigerians in clamoring for a civilian
government. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who has taken over the
government, was one of those officers. He should put those ideas
into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, should also be the
most prosperous. Oil revenues alone, if not depleted by corruption
and mismanagement, should provide the basis for sustainable
economic growth. It is also a diverse, culturally rich land stunted
by years of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Abubakar should turn the government over to Moshood
Abiola, a civilian who apparently won Nigeria's last democratic
elections, five years ago this week. The military annulled the
election, and Abiola was imprisoned in 1994 and has suffered there
since.
</P>
<P>
   The military seems to have another plan in mind. A spokesman for
the government said on Tuesday that it would turn power over to
elected civilians by October. If the military holds free and open
elections, this would be acceptable as well. But military leaders
have repeatedly failed to deliver promised transitions to civilian
rule. Even though people who know Abubakar call him the least
corrupt and power-hungry of Nigeria's top generals, Nigerians are
right to be skeptical. His first task should be to release all
political prisoners and end the persecution of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can help with a clear call for democratic, civilian
rule. A high-level American delegation bearing such an unambiguous
message would be useful. Companies like Mobil, Chevron and Shell,
which profit from Nigerian oil, have done little in the past to
promote democratic rule. Abacha's death offers them a chance to use
their considerable influence to discourage continued dictatorship.
The one favor that Abacha may have done his country is to clarify
that military rule is misrule.

FATHER IS CONFUSED OVER APOLOGY IN RACIAL KILLING OF SON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The father of Yusuf Hawkins, the 16-year-old killed
in Brooklyn nine years ago because he was black, said Tuesday that
he felt conflicting emotions over a letter of apology he had
received from a man convicted in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This letter has really not quite sunken in,'' said Moses
Stewart, speaking at a news conference in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The letter _ three pages, penned by hand on notebook paper,
expressing ``deepest sorrow and regret for the tragic death of your
son'' _ was signed by Keith Mondello, who was released from Attica
state prison last week after serving 8 years of his 12-year
sentence for his part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart expressed confusion over the apology: ``My feelings are
crazy _ one minute I'm feeling this way, another minute, I'm
feeling that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside him at the news conference was Al Sharpton, who said of
the apology: ``It raises real questions. But clearly, it took him
nine years to write the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, Mondello's first apology to Hawkins' family, was
reported Tuesday in The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   A reply to it _ the reactions of Stewart and Diane Hawkins, the
mother of Yusuf, and Sharpton, the family's adviser _ are to appear
in The Amsterdam News, Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of apology was dated June 6, the day that Sharpton,
Stewart and about 100 supporters marched through Bensonhurst, in an
echo of the many impassioned marches there following the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said Mondello, who was convicted of rioting,
unlawful imprisonment, menacing and possession of a weapon, had
organized and led a crowd of white teen-agers who attacked and
killed Hawkins on Aug. 23, 1989. Hawkins was in the Bensonhurst
neighborhood with some friends to answer an ad for a used car.
</P>
<P>
   In the months afterward, eight of the 30 to 40 teen-agers who
had threatened Hawkins, who was shot twice in the chest, were
arrested. One, Joseph Fama, was convicted of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mondello's three requests for parole were rejected because he
was judged to be unrepentant and likely to commit more crimes, said
Tom Grant, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole.
</P>
<P>
   The apology letter was passed, unsealed and unaddressed, from
the writer to Frank Macchiarola, the former schools chancellor who
is Mondello's mentor, Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Albanese, a former City Council member, said he took it from
Macchiarola and delivered it to Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   The only public purpose to the apology letter, Sharpton said,
was that it ``removes all doubt'' that Mondello was the ringleader
of the attackers.

EDITORIAL: REMAKING SPECIAL EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew will be judged in no small measure
on what he does to repair special education, the troubled program
for disabled children that eats up a quarter of New York City's
education budget, graduates few of its students and has come under
federal scrutiny for potential violations of civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Crew acquired an important tool in this fight last year, when
the state legislature enhanced his powers to seize control of
failing schools and hold principals accountable for school
performance. He now intends to restructure the special-education
bureaucracy itself, an unwieldy system-within-a-system that
currently runs itself, accountable to almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan emerged on Tuesday in a report by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's task force on special education, consisting of Crew,
Peter Powers, the former deputy mayor, and Michael Hess, a lawyer
for the city. The details will need to be fleshed out. But the
impulse to make special-education workers accountable to both
school principals and district superintendents is basically sound.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have long criticized New York City for keeping
too many special-education students in self-contained classes
despite federal guidelines requiring that they join regular classes
as frequently as their needs permit. New York mainstreams far fewer
special-ed students than schools do nationally. The isolation is
most frequent for black and Latino children. These students are
frequently omitted from citywide tests, making it impossible to
determine if they are being educated at all. More drop out than
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The current system holds no one truly responsible for these
failings. A child being evaluated to enter or leave special
education is sent to a school-based team composed of a
psychologist, a social worker and a teacher trained in special
education. In some districts, the committees work swiftly and well.
In other districts they are slow and ineffective, and condemn
virtually every child evaluated to special-education classes where
they remain for the rest of their school careers.
</P>
<P>
   The task force plan would scrutinize committees closely and put
them under the authority of principals and local superintendents,
who would have more control over what special-education workers
actually do. Under the current arrangement they evaluate fewer than
two children per evaluator per week _ and can spend the rest of the
time reading newspapers if they wish to. To press the workers into
doing more, the task force has suggested that it will privatize
evaluations in areas where performance remains poor.

Rockets deal Willis for Rogers, picks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets' makeover has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal designed to reverse the aging process that had turned
them into one of the NBA's oldest teams, the Rockets on Tuesday
traded Kevin Willis to the Toronto Raptors for two 1998 first-round
draft choices and forward Roy Rogers, who missed virtually the
entire season with knee problems but was the 22nd pick of the '96
draft.
</P>
<P>
   The move means the Rockets have three selections in the middle
of the first round of the June 24 draft. Toronto conveyed the 16th
and 18th picks to the Rockets, whose own pick is No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   One Rockets insider said the possibility exists of more movement
before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still working,'' the source said. ``You can't rule out
the possibility of packaging some of the picks and moving up in the
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Willis' departure is not particularly surprising. On the day
after the Rockets' season ended, coach Rudy Tomjanovich promised
changes. Willis improved his stock around the NBA with his play
this season, when he averaged 16.1 points and 8.4 rebounds. The
7-footer did a solid job as a starter at center and power forward
when Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, 35, joined the Rockets as a free agent before the
1996-97 season and is scheduled to earn $2.1 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation grew Monday that the Rockets were working on a deal
to garner draft picks. One source in Chicago at the NBA Finals said
some sort of trade was imminent. Tuesday, Willis was dealt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation that was presented to us that we couldn't
pass up,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It was a tough decision, as these
things always are. But Kevin played so well this season that there
was a lot of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he could envision the Rockets doing something
with the three picks they possess in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're looking at,'' he said. ``Obviously,
this is the first move (of revamping the roster). We don't know
what else might be coming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets have started the process of transforming from an
elderly team by NBA standards to a younger, athletic team. Whether
Rogers will be part of that metamorphosis remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, 24, attended Alabama, the same school that produced
former Rocket Robert Horry. Like Horry, Rogers is 6-10, although he
is slightly bigger at 235 pounds. Rogers was drafted by Vancouver
in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also comes off a serious injury to his right knee that
kept him out of all but 15 games this season. As a rookie with the
Grizzlies, he averaged 6.6 points and 4.7 rebounds in 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he could have a big future,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He
has a knee problem, but we liked him before when he was with
Vancouver. He could be a big, big plus, if he gets healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers recently had surgery on his knee, and sources in Toronto
believe that procedure could allow him to resume his NBA career
next season, although it's unknown for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at him,'' Rockets executive vice president of
basketball Carroll Dawson said of Rogers. ``He used to come in when
we had Robert Horry here. He's always been around; we've known him
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets and Raptors came together on the trade quickly.
Willis' agent, Steve Woods, said the subject was brought up by
Toronto general manager Glen Grunwald, who also toyed with the idea
of trading for Willis in January.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed deal that would have brought Damon Stoudamire to the
Rockets for Willis, Mario Elie and others fell through after weeks
of talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Raptors liked Willis enough to rekindle the talks in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich spoke to Willis shortly after the trade was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did most of the talking,'' Tomjanovich said. ``There wasn't
much to say, except to tell him how difficult it was. I appreciate
all the things he's done for our organization and the city of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin came in here with a very solid attitude and work ethic.
He had to make adjustments, and he handled them well in going from
one role to the next. And you don't find a lot of people who can do
that. What made this difficult is that I like him as a person and a
player. But the bottom line is to look at where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets' situation is at the other end of the spectrum
from the Raptors' plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been interested in Kevin for some time,'' said Grunwald.
``Even though he's 35, we feel he has at least a couple of years of
good basketball left in him because he is such a fitness nut. We're
very happy we got this done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leader who I think will help us. I think Kevin sees
this as an opportunity where he can finish his career on a positive
note.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunwald added the trade makes sense from Toronto's side because
the Raptors have a young team, need a veteran leader and don't
believe they could get better players at the 16th and 18th picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the other players that might be available as free agents
or through trades, we felt for the next two years they were no
better than Kevin,'' Grunwald said. ``I think there are some good
players in the draft. But that's the one thing we couldn't predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some players we liked in this draft, some players
that might be there at 16 and 18. But that was beyond our control
as to who actually fell to those spots. And we weren't prepared to
face that uncertainty. To us, Kevin is more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets have been very good (in the draft). It reflects
more where the teams are. They're getting older and looking at
replenishing their roster.''
</P>
<P>
   For Willis, Toronto will be his fifth team since the start of
the 1994-95 season, having been traded from Atlanta to Miami to
Golden State and then signed as a free agent by the Rockets before
the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Willis could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But Woods said
his client would have no aversion to reporting to Toronto for camp
next season. Numerous players have said they would not play for the
Raptors or the Vancouver Grizzlies because of Canada's higher taxes
and lower temperatures, as well as the other inconveniences of
living in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's really disappointed,'' Woods said. ``But he's handling
it professionally. I think too many athletes react with righteous
indignation when they get traded. And that's flawed. Players
receive exorbitant compensation, and it's merely a component of
that compensation that they may be inconvenienced to fulfill their
contracts. If that means relocating, that's part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Woods said he knows the Raptors ``really,
really want Kevin. And they're eager to get Kevin up to Toronto.''

EDITORIAL: A BIG BANK MERGER, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   The wave of giant bank mergers, which continued this week with
the Norwest Corp.'s planned $34 billion takeover of Wells Fargo,
has mixed implications for the nation's financial system and the
civic well-being of many communities.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers reflect pressures on banks to gain competitive
strength in an era when they have been losing market share to
investment banks in corporate lending and to mutual funds in the
attraction of consumer savings. Mergers have also become more
feasible because a presence on the local corner is less and less
necessary as transactions by computer and ATM become easier and
less costly.
</P>
<P>
   It is argued that larger banks are safer because they are more
diversified. Wells Fargo was once tied closely to the California
economy, and thus vulnerable to that state's downturn earlier in
this decade. Now, as part of a banking operation stretching across
most of the West and Midwest, it will be less dependent on the
fortunes of any one region.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that as big banks get bigger and merge with
each other, there are fewer players. That makes it more likely that
a large financial blunder that affects most big banks _ such as the
widespread lending in the 1970s to less-developed countries that
ended up unable to pay their bills _ may affect a much larger
proportion of the financial system than would have been true in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of banking regulation thus becomes more
important than ever. Financial engineers have made it possible,
through a wide variety of derivative securities, for banks to take
on widely varying levels of risks. It is difficult for bank
managers to monitor the risks and even harder for bank regulators
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The newly merged bank will take the Wells Fargo name, and be
based in San Francisco. That spares California the indignity of no
longer having any major banks based in the state. That can be
important because a bank's bosses are more likely to be sensitive
to the needs of the regions where they live, and they are more
likely to have their banks support such local institutions as
symphonies, museums and boys' clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If mergers are well executed, they hold little threat to banking
customers, who might even benefit from the combined institution
being able to offer more services. But the threat _ amply
illustrated by some previous mergers _ is that efforts to save
money by making the combined company more efficient can backfire,
causing service to suffer and customers to flee to competitors.

   Wings skate away with opener 2-1
</P>
<P>
   Caps give defending Stanley Cup champs something to think about
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DETROIT _ For 35 minutes in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals
Tuesday night, the Washington Capitals skated as if they were
wearing ankle weights. Slow. Uninspired. Laboring.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were merely lulling the Detroit Red Wings to sleep.
They had just about everyone else at Joe Louis Arena feeling
drowsy. Even Ron Wilson, their coach, wondered where the spark was
early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was wired for sound by Fox Sports, barked: ``Let's
have a little more enthusiasm, boys. This is the final.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 2-0 in the opening period, the Capitals
came to life with a goal late in the second period. They dominated
play in the third period, so much so Wilson had changed his patter
midway through that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we dig in, this is a game we can win,'' Wilson shouted to
his team.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps did not win, falling short 2-1. But as Wilson predicted
before the game, a lot of people who were predicting an easy road
for Detroit to its second straight Stanley Cup were going to be
surprised. Indeed, the Caps put a scare into the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   After goaltender Olaf Kolzig allowed two goals in just more than
two minutes in the first period, he regrouped and showed why he has
been the best goalie throughout the playoff run. The Caps were
outshot 31-17, but they swarmed the Detroit net in the final
minutes and only excellent goaltending by Chris Osgood allowed the
Red Wings to avoid the upset in the first game of the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk all you want, now we see what it's all about,''
said Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman. ``I thought Washington played a
really good game. We started out pretty good, played OK in the
third, but we can play a lot better than we did in the second. We
seemed to be a little mixed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when the Red Wings get a two-goal lead, you might as
well warm up the bus. They normally are the masters of protecting a
lead, especially against a young team like the Capitals that, for
the most part, has players getting their first taste of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Capitals got a goal from rookie Richard Zednik at 15:57
of the second period to make it 2-1, changing the complexion of the
game. Zednik took a pass from Andrei Nikolishin and blasted a shot
that bounced off Osgood's pad, hit the post and went into the net.
</P>
<P>
   That was all the Caps could get behind Osgood, but their play in
the final period will give the hockey world plenty to chew on
before Game 2 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost 2-1 and they outshot us by a large margin, but I don't
think our players feel they were dominated by any stretch of the
imagination,'' Wilson said. ``We read the papers and see where we
are supposed to get blasted out of here 5-0 or 6-0. Now we know we
can play. I know we can play better. We'll take a lot out of this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Caps came close, the Red Wings hung on to get a win
in a game that didn't figure to be this difficult after they went
ahead 2-0 in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Caps convinced themselves they were not
going to be intimidated by the Wings or their raucous, chanting
crowd at Joe Louis Arena. But after a brief spurt at the start of
in the first period, everything the Caps didn't want to happen did
happen.
</P>
<P>
   One key to Detroit's game plan, according to associate coach
Dave Lewis, was to control play for the first 10 minutes of the
game and put the Capitals on their heels. Instead, Washington
carried play in the early going and had the first good scoring
chance three minutes into the game but the puck bounced off
Zednik's stick as he attempted a backhand shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps took the first three shots of the game and had Detroit
on the run for the first five minutes. But that changed quickly.
The Red Wings picked up their pace and, almost at the same time,
the Capitals lost their spark. By period's end, Detroit had a 2-0
lead and indeed had Washington on the run.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Wings, the last was indeed first. Detroit's fourth
line of Tomas Holmstrom, Doug Brown and Joey Kocur connected for
the first goal of the series, surprising Kolzig at 14:04.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom did the bulk of the work, pushing the puck into the
Caps' zone just as he was checked at the blue line. Brown caught
sight of Kocur streaking to the net and hit him with a backhand
pass. Kocur, who did not dress for four of the six games in the
Dallas series, tipped the puck behind Kolzig to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings continued to pressure Washington, winning nearly
every battle along the boards and delivering the majority of hard
checks. Their second goal in a 2-minute, 14-second span was the
result of hard work by Darren McCarty and Holmstrom.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty stayed with the puck on the boards behind the net and
survived a hit from Washington defenseman Mark Tinordi. McCarty
pushed the puck to Holmstrom, who passed to Steve Yzerman and
headed to the front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   With Holmstrom screening Kolzig, Nicklas Lidstrom's slap shot
zipped past Kolzig, putting Detroit ahead 2-0 at 16:18.

5 OFFICERS ACCUSED IN GUN BUY-BACK PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In seeking safer streets, police departments
across the country have increasingly asked citizens to turn in guns
in exchange for cash or gift certificates, no questions asked. But
in Newark, officials said Tuesday, the city's gun buy-back program
earlier this year took an unfortunate twist: Fancy weapons were
pocketed by some officers in the Police Department's East District.
</P>
<P>
   Four veteran police supervisors and an officer have been
suspended without pay amid allegations that they mishandled money
and stole two guns, the Newark police director, Joseph Santiago,
announced Tuesday. His face flushed with anger, Santiago clutched
the gold and silver badges that had belonged to the officer, three
lieutenants and a sergeant, and vowed to have them smelted _ just
like the 636 guns turned in to the program. ``These will never be
used again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at police headquarters, Santiago described
a sting in which undercover investigators turned in a German
9-millimeter Luger pistol as part of the buy-back program, which
ran from Feb. 9 to March 9. The Luger was never logged into
inventory, and an ordinary .32-caliber handgun was recorded in its
place, he said. In another instance, internal affairs investigators
determined that a Marlin shotgun surrendered by an unidentified
citizen had also been replaced with an ordinary .32-caliber
handgun, he said. Both the Luger and the shotgun are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago identified the suspended officers as Lt. Robert Russo,
40, a 17-year veteran; Sgt. John Zajkowski, 43, a 24-year veteran;
Lt. John Lavook, 55, a 33-year veteran; Lt. Milton Medina, 46, a
21-year veteran, and Police Officer Jose DaSilva, 33, who has been
on the force for three years. The officers have not been arrested,
but police said they had each committed several crimes, including
theft, official misconduct and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been turned over to the Essex County prosecutor,
Patricia Hurt, who will determine whether to ask a grand jury for a
criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bergrin, a lawyer representing Russo and DaSilva, said each
of his clients ``unequivocally and categorically denies any guilt
whatsoever in this case.'' Bergrin added: ``The Police Director and
the mayor drew conclusions without knowing all the facts and having
the benefit of a complete and impartial investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the other suspended officers either declined to
comment or could not be reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James, who stood next to Santiago throughout the
news conference, said the suspensions ``send a message to the city
of Newark that no one is above the law.'' James reiterated his
support of the gun buy-back program and said it would be offered
again, adding, ``We can't legislate morality but whenever we find
wrongdoing we try to eliminate it from government.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the sting operation was part of a new effort by
the Newark Police Department to conduct periodic ``integrity and
compliance'' tests. The undercover officers surrendered guns in all
four of the department's districts but only found misconduct in the
East District, Santiago said. The Luger was used twice in the sting
operation and stolen the second time that it was surrendered, he
said. The Newark buy-back program paid citizens $75 for each
handgun, $100 for each automatic weapon and $150 for each assault
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago also said money was mishandled, but would not give
details, saying only that there were financial ``improprieties''
surrounding the surrender of four different weapons in the East
District.

DETROIT _ Now playing at Tiger Stadium: Nightmare on Jones Street.
</P>
<P>
   Part II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe we're having this same conversation again,''
said Detroit closer Todd Jones, who blew a ninth-inning lead for
the second consecutive night as the Astros pulled off a 5-3 victory
over the Tigers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The script could hardly have been more identical for the Astros,
who on Monday had rallied from a one-run deficit to a 9-5 win with
five ninth-inning runs off Jones.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a little patience, a ball in the dirt, a clutch hit
from a catcher batting .212, and two home runs paved the way for
the Astros' fourth consecutive victory and sixth in their last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou's club-leading 13th home run of the season to lead
off the ninth against Detroit's Brian Moehler sliced the Tigers'
lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an Astros reliever from 1993-96, then entered the game
and retired the first two batters he faced before walking pinch
hitter J.R. Phillips. Phillips advanced to second base on a wild
pitch, but Jones (0-3) was still one strike away from redemption
before Ausmus sent a 1-2 pitch into right field for a game-tying
single.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio then sent a two-run homer into the upper deck in
right field to give the Astros their fourth ninth-inning comeback
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just killing me right now,'' said Jones, who had
converted 32 of his last 35 save opportunities dating to last
season. ``I could puke.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros closer Billy Wagner made things interesting in the bottom
of the ninth by starting it with consecutive walks to Bill Ripken
and Deivi Cruz. But Wagner fanned the final three batters,
including former Astro Brian Hunter on a failed third-strike bunt,
to earn his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   With their fourth win in five interleague games this season, the
Astros moved back into sole possession of first place in the
National League Central, one game ahead of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen very often that you are going to get to a
closer two nights in a row,'' Ausmus said. ``That's why there are
27 outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros needed every single one of them against Moehler. The
righthander, who entered with a 5-0 record and 1.87 earned run
average in his last six home starts, held the Astros to one run and
seven hits through eight innings and had seven strikeouts before
Alou's home run to lead off the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, seemingly everything the Astros hit landed in a
Tiger glove. Everything Detroit hit found a hole or bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moehler pitched a great game. He completely neutralized our
right-handed hitters,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``We did hit
some balls sharply that went to a lot of their infielders I was
noticing a lot of their balls went through and our went right
straight to the second baseman, short stop or third baseman. Until
Alou none of our righthanders were getting hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton (8-3) kept the Astros in the game just long enough
for his sixth road victory of the season. Hampton shook off a
three-run fifth inning by Detroit that saw the Tigers hit five
consecutive two-out singles to take a 3-1 lead. But Hampton showed
the mettle that has enabled him to compile a 20-6 record since last
July. He worked out of jams in the sixth and eighth inning that
left three Tigers stranded on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times it's better to be lucky than good,'' Hampton
said. ``I was lucky to be in there and get the win.''
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in their final at-bat, Dierker said he inserted
Phillips to pinch hit for Ricky Gutierrez, ``hoping he hit a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who had struck out 13 of his previous 28 at bats since
being recalled from Class AAA New Orleans, drew the walk off Jones
before advancing to second to put the tying run in scoring
position. He was replaced for pinch runner Tim Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting myself in a bad hitting position,'' Phillips
said of his recent inability to lay off pitches. ``I've been trying
to hit the ball too hard. That's why I'm striking out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker thought about another gamble in the ninth when he almost
had backup catcher Tony Eusebio bat for Ausmus. With Eusebio having
sat out the entire game, Dierker went with the game-ready Ausmus,
who drove in Bogar for the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to win, and it's exciting, but this could take a
toll,'' said Dierker, whose club is 4-18 when trailing after the
eighth inning this season. I had a feeling Brad would have a chance
and luckily it paid off. It gets to the point where you never feel
you are going to lose until the last out is made.''
