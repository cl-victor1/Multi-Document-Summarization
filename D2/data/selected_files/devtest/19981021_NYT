<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The day before the playoffs began, David Cone was
asked to pick one Yankee who might shine in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, Cone replied. ``He's got that glint in his eye,''
</P>
<P>
   And how. Brosius slugged two home runs Tuesday night in Game 3
of the World Series, including a three-run shot in the eighth
inning that gave the Yankees a 5-4 victory over San Diego and a
commanding three games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win the final
four games of a World Series. The Yankees' Andy Pettitte will try
to finish off the Padres Wednesday night and give the Yankees their
24th World Series title and second in the last three seasons.
Pettitte will be pitching against San Diego's ace, Kevin Brown.
Another victory for the Yankees would be their 125th over the
regular season and postseason, and could qualify the Yankees as the
greatest team ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed, 3-2, in the eighth inning, with San Diego
intent on delivering a lead into the hands of its dominating
closer, Trevor Hoffman. But with the left-handed hitting Paul
O'Neill leading off the eighth for the Yankees, Padres Manager
Bruce Bochy elected to start the inning with left-hander Randy
Myers on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Myers walked O'Neill, putting the tying run on base, and Bochy
then called for Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 save opportunities
during the regular season. But it was apparent immediately that
Hoffman, who hadn't thrown in a game in six days, was pitching at
less than his best. Typically, Hoffman throws a fastball at 92-94
mph. His first fastball to Bernie Williams Tuesday night was
clocked at 88 mph, and Williams drove a pitch to the base of the
wall in right field, a 355-foot out.
</P>
<P>
   With Tino Martinez batting, Hoffman began pitching passively,
throwing his slider and his changeup, and Martinez also drew a
walk. Dave Stewart, San Diego's pitching coach, went to the mound,
perhaps to ask why Hoffman wasn't going with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was next, having hit a single and a home run in three
at-bats. He tried checking his swing unsuccessfully on the first
pitch, a ball in the dirt, then took two more off-speed pitches for
balls, before fouling off an 89 mph fastball. Hoffman came back at
him with another fastball, 91 mph. Brosius swung, the ball soared.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego center fielder Steve Finley ran back to the wall,
Hoffman staring at the numbers on the back of his jersey. When the
ball carried over the fence, Brosius, halfway between first and
second, thrust both arms into the air.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored a run in the bottom of the eighth, shaving the
lead to 5-4. But the Yankees held on to salvage a gallant effort
from Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock baffled the Yankees at the start, allowing
only a hit and a walk in the first four innings. Contrary to the
advance notices, Hitchcock was more aggressive with his fastball
than the Yankees probably expected. They were unable to force him
deep into ball-strike counts, as they had done to Kevin Brown and
Andy Ashby, San Diego's starters in Game 1 and Game 2,
respectively. Hitchcock threw just 50 pitches in the first four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been to Cone's benefit: With the Yankees' at-bats
progressing rapidly, Cone didn't have to sit and wait at length on
the bench. He got stiff resting between innings in winning Game 6
of the American League Championship Series and nearly blew a 6-0
lead. He had reached the fifth inning with a relatively low pitch
count and had simply run out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is 35, two years removed from an aneurysm, a year beyond
shoulder surgery. He's been throwing a baseball for 10 months,
beginning his rehabilitation last December, and there have been
signs for weeks that his body has worn down. Cone stopped throwing
between starts in August, preferring instead to ``save as many
bullets as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone's stuff seemed quite ordinary Tuesday night, his first
fastballs clocked at 87-88 mph, and Cone seemed unable to command
his fastballs consistently; he would throw only 53 percent of his
pitches for strikes. After Tony Gwynn's first at-bat, in which he
lined out to left field, he returned to the dugout and told hitting
coach Merv Rettenmund that Cone didn't have a good fastball, and
Rettenmund agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone did manage to keep his pitches out of the middle of the
strike zone, out of the danger area, and when he reached two
strikes on any right-handed batter, Cone did not procrastinate,
immediately throwing his best pitch, his sidearm slider. Somehow,
he got through, keeping the Padres hitless and scoreless through
five innings. The Yankees had two hits and no runs against
Hitchcock.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cone led off the sixth inning and plunked a single into left
field, his third hit in eight career at-bats in the World Series.
In an odd way, reaching base might've been the worst thing to
happen for Cone; instead of being on the bench and resting, he
would have to run the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch bunted down the third base line and Cone hustled
to second on the single. Joey Hamilton began warming up in the San
Diego bullpen, as the Yankees began the third turn through their
lineup; all during the postseason, Padres Manager Bruce Bochy has
tried to avoid giving opponents a third look at Hitchcock in the
same game.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock struck out Derek Jeter on an inside fastball, before
Paul O'Neill grounded a single through the middle. Cone chugged
toward third, the coach Willie Randolph waving and waving _ and
then throwing up his hands, the stop sign. Knoblauch, perhaps 30
feet beyond second base, had to stop and retreat. Bases loaded and
one out. Cone stood at third, waiting for a chance to come home.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernie Williams whiffed and Tino Martinez popped out and
Cone went back out to pitch the bottom of the sixth, when his
evening would disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock looped a single over second base. Cone walked Quilvio
Veras on six pitches, and Gwynn pulled a grounder through the first
base hole for a single. Hitchcock ambled around third base, taking
home the first run of the game. The Yankees' right fielder O'Neill
threw back to the infield, between first and second, and the ball
rolled through the infield and into visitors' dugout. Veras was
allowed to walk home and Gwynn went to third, from where he would
score on Ken Caminiti's fly ball to the base of the wall in center
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drove Hitchcock from the mound in the top of the
seventh, Brosius bashing a home run and Shane Spencer lacing a
double. Joey Hamilton replaced Hitchcock, and Spencer moved to
third on a passed ball and scored one out later when Chili Davis'
ground ball rolled under Caminiti's glove for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch walked, pushing pinch-runner Homer Bush to second base
with only one out. Jeter smacked a hard liner through the middle,
the ball popping off the heel of the shortstop Chris Gomez _ and
into the air again. Gomez, in full stride, caught his own rebound
and flipped to second to double-off Bush and end the inning.

JC FOOTBALL ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Saturday will see a showdown between Long Beach City College
and El Camino College, the nation's top two ranked junior college
football teams.))
</P>
<P>
   Delvon Flowers is not Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The El Camino running back is not demanding the darn ball when
his Warriors face Long Beach City on Saturday. Flowers also refuses
to make predictions on the game (italics), which pitsthe nation's
top two junior college teams.
</P>
<P>
   After every leading question, Flowers defers. He doesn't say
anything resembling locker-roomtrash talk. Assumedly, he does not
want to provide extra motivation to LBCC.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game of this magnitude, a rivalry with implications of
whom has the best JC squadin the nation, Flowers need not worry
about stirring a controversy with LBCC. Both teams knowthe
importance of the game and will be ready for it, regardless of what
is said beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Flowers --- a graduate of Inglewood High --- appears
to be a difference in thegame. While LBCC calls on four capable
running backs, Flowers is obviously the Warriors'offensive leader.
Leading the Mission Conference in a variety of categories, Flowers
hasrushed for 14 touchdowns in five games. He averages 131 yards
per game and 10.4 yards percarry.
</P>
<P>
   That the Warriors average a first down when Flowers touches the
ball is a staggeringstatistic that even he finds hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, it was sort of always like that,'' he said.
``You get the ball, and thereyouhave it. Here, this is college
football, and I didn't expect it to be like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the running back remains cautious about the LBCC game out
of respect for the Vikings'defense. Flowers, whose test scores
didn't qualify him for Division I football out of highschool,
should be on his way a football powerhouse because Nebraska, USC,
Arizona State andothers all have expressed interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his level of play is high, however, so is LBCC's
defense, which has allowed justfour touchdowns this season and 199
yards per game. In addition, the Vikings' opponentsaverage just 64
rushing yards per game against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told him all week this is a great test for him,'' El
Camino coach John Featherstonesaid. ``Delvon knows this is a
Division I school, a Division I defense, that he's goingagainst.''
</P>
<P>
   El Camino's defense isn't too shabby, either. It is second in
the conference to LBCC, butadmittedly, is not as stocked as LBCC.
About the game in general, Flowers said, ``It'llprobably be won by
one of the defenses. I'm looking forward to the defense deciding
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   LBCC's secondary and linebacking corps is unmatched in the
conference, but El Camino mayhave an edge on the defensive line
because of DeLawrence Grant and Ladarias (cq) Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is no mistakes and no stupid penalties,'' Grant said.
``We've been practicing hardand this is the biggest game I've ever
played in. It's looks pretty even, so we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Featherstone expects to see is the unexpected.
While Flowers and the defensiveline look like El Camino's
strengths, the coach said in big games things always happen
thatcannot be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's experience may add validity to his theory. Two weeks
ago, he set an El Caminorecord for most wins. He is 101-39-1 in his
14 seasons and just edged Ken Swearingen, who had99 wins and
coached Featherstone in 1967 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've talked about the marquee players, the Delvon
Flowers and Sean Stein's,''Featherstone said. ``In games like this,
you watch, it's always the unsung heroes that decidethe game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, LBCC's Sean Stein and Markus Steele.

SPORTS COLUMN: PADRES FACE THE SWEEP OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It is no fun facing the prospect of becoming the
latter-day equivalent of the 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates, who were
drubbed by the Murderer's Row of Yankees in what legend insists was
something less than the minimum four games.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where the Padres are at the moment, after the 5-4
defeat to the inheritors of that 1927 uniform and all the mythical
powers within.
</P>
<P>
   This version of the Yankees was so potent that the normal No. 9
hitter, Scott Brosius, drove in 98 runs during the season. Tuesday
night Brosius was elevated to the sixth position in the lineup and
cranked up two homers that gave the Yankees their third straight
victory of this World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night, the Padres were walking the fine line
between respect and awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a great team,'' said Tony Gwynn, the gracious San
Diego hitter. ``When we beat them, it will be a pleasure to say we
beat a great team like the New York Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was talking like that because there was still space to
come back. Nobody wanted to be depicted by the slapdash historians
known as sportswriters as a team that was beaten before it even
started.
</P>
<P>
   The 1927 Pirates are conveniently remembered as the most
mismatched team in World Series history because they ran into what
may have been the best team in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that who the Yankees beat?'' Gwynn professed on Monday.
``See, I never knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those guys _ do the names George Herman Ruth and Louis Henry
Gehrig strike a familiar cord? _ had clubbed the league into
submission with 110 victories and only 44 losses. Then came the
World Series, then an attractive best-of-seven treat, played in
daylight in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth-making machinery now didn't even have to wait for a
game to take place,'' writes Leonard Koppett, in his new and
stimulating Koppett's Concise History of Major League Baseball,
published by Temple University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``America was told that the Yankees' batting practice at Forbes
Field the day before the Series so intimidated the Pirates that
they were beaten then and there,'' Koppett adds.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wonderful misty legend, of the Pirates standing around
the batting cage with their jaws hanging down to the letters on
their shirts, watching Tony Lazzeri and Bob Meusel whack balls into
the foliage behind the outfield walls.
</P>
<P>
   Koppett then debunks the legend somewhat by noting that the real
imbalance lay in the Pirates' starting pitchers being all
right-handed while the Yankee sluggers were left-handed except for
Earl Combs. He also notes that the Yankees hit exactly two homers
in the Series, both by Ruth, and that the fourth game ended with a
wild pitch: ``So much for intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe the Pirates were intimidated before it began. It
makes for a good story. The Padres were determined not to be
intimidated, and Gwynn surely did not want to waste time thinking
about 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you compare one team with another?'' Gwynn asked on
Monday. ``I've only been in baseball for 20 years and followed it
as a kid, but I can't compare today with those days.''
</P>
<P>
   He would, however, praise these current Yankees, who won 114 and
lost 48 during the regular season and have now won 10 of 12
postseason games. Nobody compares them to the 1927 Yankees, because
they do not always murder their opponents, sometimes merely
tenderizing them with their wooden mallets.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gwynn performed obeisance to the Yankee history by
trekking out to the monuments in Yankee Stadium, where he had never
been.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, shuffling in place in right field, Gwynn
observed every ball, every strike, every foul, of the 11-pitch
leadoff walk Chuck Knoblauch finagled. Gwynn understood that
Knoblauch had not only worn down Andy Ashby by some slight
increment but had also provided a guidebook for all the other
perceptive Yankee hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great piece of hitting,'' Gwynn was still raving on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had bedeviled the Padres in so many ways, overt and
subtle, that southern California dailies knee-jerked into the
convenient ritual of using verbs like ``Mugged'' and ``Battered''
in every headline, equating what happened to the Padres in Yankee
Stadium to what obviously happens to every innocent who wanders
onto the sidewalks of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gwynn's pilgrimage to the shrine of Yankee history will
one day be incorporated into legend, like the 1927 Pirates gaping
at the real-live Ruth and Gehrig. More to the point were the two
clutch hits by the gallant Gwynn Tuesday night, and how they were
overcome by these modern destroyers.

EDITORIAL: NO WAY TO HANDLE A PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Outrage and fear brought thousands of marchers into midtown
Manhattan Monday night to protest the brutal murder of a gay
college student in Wyoming last week. The death of 21-year-old
Matthew Shepard, who had been beaten and lashed to a fence near
Laramie, was worthy of what was billed as a ``political funeral''
in a major center of gay life.
</P>
<P>
   But both the marchers and the police mishandled the
demonstration, which ended with about 120 arrests. March leaders
should have planned more carefully and obtained a permit, and the
police should have acted with greater restraint.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher has said that
the organizers failed to get a proper permit. The march drew more
than 4,000 people, far more than expected. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said that for this ``worthy cause,'' the city could have worked
with marchers to craft a plan protecting free speech and minimizing
disruption for the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But once the protesters strayed into traffic, the police shifted
into excess. With mounted police and seemingly random arrests, they
refused to talk to march leaders, rounding up those seen as
troublemakers. Many were kept overnight, some apparently deprived
of crucial HIV and other medications.
</P>
<P>
   For New York City's Police Department, this is the third time in
recent months that a protest or rally has ended in trouble. First,
thousands of construction workers swarmed into midtown to protest
nonunion MTA contracts, landing a few dozen in jail. More recently,
a rally in Harlem ended with arrests when organizers went over
their allotted time limit and police tried to shut down the event.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police have won high marks over the past few
decades for dealing with large protests, the mayor and police
commissioner should review these three troubling cases to determine
if there are better ways to accommodate the needs of the city while
protecting the constitutional right to protest.

 BROSIUS POUNDS HOFFMAN AS YANKEES STUN PADRES  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They wouldn't voice the concern, but the San Diego
Padres privately wondered, ``What if we play an entire World Series
and we never get Trevor into a game?''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres would need a lead against the Yankees late in the
game to use Trevor Hoffman, perhaps the major leagues' premier
closer, and the latest they held a lead in the first two games was
with one out in the seventh inning of the opening game. That, in
the thinking of Manager Bruce Bochy, was a tad early to bring
Hoffman in.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night the Padres had a 3-2 lead in the eighth
inning, and when Randy Myers walked Paul O'Neill, the leadoff
batter, Bochy waited no longer. He summoned Hoffman, and the crowd
of 64,667 raised the roof with their thunderous roar of greeting.
Qualcomm Stadium doesn't have a roof, but the fans raised it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later Scott Brosius turned the deafening noise to
silence. With two teammates on base, he whacked a Hoffman fastball
over the center field fence for a three-run home run and,
eventually, a 5-4 victory that catapulted the Yankees one victory
away from the World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   That's how good the Yankees have been this year. Not even the
game's best reliever, the pitcher who secured 53 saves in 54 save
situations during the regular season, could stop their relentless
march toward their coveted goal. Hoffman had the lead, and the
Yankees rudely but determinedly snatched it out of the right hand
that has been so golden this year.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, as the prospect of a World Series without Hoffman
pitching loomed, the question was raised about Bochy's decision in
the first game. He made clear that he did not trust the other
members of his relief corps in the fifth game of the National
League Championship Series when he brought in Kevin Brown, his No.
1 starter, to protect a 4-2 seventh-inning lead in what could have
been the pennant-clinching game for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bochy said the next night, sometimes managers get carried
away with slotting their closers for the ninth inning only, but he
had brought in Hoffman in the eighth inning at times this season.
But the seventh? No. He had confidence in other relievers, Bochy
said, even though Donne Wall gave up a game-tying three-run home
run to Chuck Knoblauch in that seventh inning and Mark Langston
gave a grand slam to Tino Martinez later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees never saw Hoffman in that game, and they didn't
have the privilege the next night either because they scored seven
runs in the first three innings, and the Padres never got close
enough to use him.
</P>
<P>
   When they scored three runs in the sixth inning last night,
Hoffman became a distinct possibility. When the Yankees rallied for
two runs in the seventh, he became a certainty. It was just a
matter of when the Yankees would see him. But again, it wasn't the
seventh inning. It wasn't at the start of the eighth either.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Myers, who until the Padres claimed him on waivers from
Toronto in August was a closer himself, began that inning. But as
soon as he walked O'Neill, it was Hoffman time. Bochy slowly
emerged from the dugout and signaled for his last best hope. Bernie
Williams, the first batter to face the unbeatable one, put a
serious scare into the Padres and their fans by lofting a fly ball
to deep right field. But Tony Gwynn backed up all the way to the
fence and caught the ball as it fell in front of the fence and not
behind it. But then Hoffman walked Tino Martinez, and the Yankees
had two runners on base with Brosius coming to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who had hit a home run in the previous inning against
Sterling Hitchcock, was batting sixth in the order, high for him,
because the pitcher and not the designated hitter was hitting in
this game. The DH isn't used in World Series games played in
National League parks. Brosius, a remarkably productive hitter for
the Yankees this season, worked the count to 2-2, then drove a
fastball out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, he had stripped Hoffman of his invincibility.
Just like that, the Yankees had the lead, and Mariano Rivera, the
Yankees' closer, would not give it back. Hoffman, the Padres
desperately hope, could get another chance Wednesday.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The powerful encyclical issued last week by Pope John Paul II
will not be the subject of earnest debate like his calls for social
justice in a materialistic world. Nor is it likely to ignite
religious arguments over his unbending positions on church doctrine
or his stands against abortion, euthanasia and women in the
priesthood. Instead, this pronouncement in the 20th year of his
papacy is a missive from a religious philosopher to the world's
intelligentsia. It is a plea for an end to the separation of faith
and reason and an argument against the ``philosophy of nothing,''
as he calls the various forms of nihilism that have taken root in a
war-weary century.
</P>
<P>
   Written for the bishops of the Catholic Church, the decree,
called ``Fides et Ratio'' (Faith and Reason), argues that these two
strains of human endeavor need not exclude each other in the
pursuit of truth. Science and rational thought do not wipe out the
exploration of ``the fundamental questions which pervade human
life,'' as John Paul writes. Similarly religion, especially
Catholicism, needs the pursuit of rational debate to keep such
spiritual matters from ``withering into myth or superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the church, the encyclical undoubtedly signals a return
to the study of philosophy in the priesthood, a subject that has
often been downplayed in recent years in favor of sociology and
other more current fields. The pope also wants to bring the
questions of morality back into the pursuit of science _ an issue
that at once seems as medieval as Galileo and as modern as
Hiroshima. If science does not move beyond the utilitarian, he
argues, it could ``soon prove inhuman and even become the potential
destroyer of the human race.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the decree argues against the modern philosophies _
post-Enlightenment realism, Marxism, nihilism _ that see the search
as the goal, so that ``everything is fleeting and provisional,'' as
he writes. John Paul, in his 13th and most profoundly personal
encyclical, knows these philosophers and has argued with their
tenets. As a Pole, he also understands the troubles of his century,
including World Wars, the Holocaust, the Stalin years, the gaudy
capitalism that replaced Communism.
</P>
<P>
   This encyclical may not convert the nihilists, but it promises
that even if reason does not always lead to belief, a reasoning
person like a scientist or a philosopher can still be a believer.

HITCHCOCK SHOWS HE CAN USE A BAT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It is rare these days to find a major league pitcher
who can also hit. Rarer still, however, is the prep school pitcher
who is not allowed to hit.
</P>
<P>
   A high school team's best pitcher is usually its best athlete,
which often means he serves as the cleanup hitter as well. But even
when Sterling Hitchcock was the star left-hander at Armwood High
School in Florida, the designated hitter batted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in starting against a Cy Young award winner in each of his
four 1998 playoff starts, Hitchcock _ who has arguably been as
valuable to the San Diego Padres as Kevin Brown this post-season _
has helped himself with the bat his last three times out.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Hitchcock _ who had defeated Houston's Randy
Johnson and Atlanta's Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in his previous
three starts _ turned in six-plus strong innings in Game 3 of the
World Series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But it was what Hitchcock did with his bat in his first career
World Series start that helped knock David Cone out of the game.
The only difference from Hitchcock's previous outings this
post-season was that the Padres lost.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the bottom of the sixth inning in a scoreless game after
he had just pitched his way out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam,
Hitchcock slapped a single to left to break up a no-hit bid by
Cone, his former Yankee teammate and mentor. Hitchcock's hit opened
the way for a three-run rally, one that the Padre bullpen could not
protect as San Diego lost, 5-4. The Padres are one game from
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that I couldn't hit Little League pitching, and
then now I've got major league fastballs and sliders coming after
me, I'm still learning,'' Hitchcock had said Monday. ``It's a
battle. It's certainly not easy to do. And taking 11 years off
between swinging bats didn't help any. I think if you ask around,
I'm night and day from last year. But I still stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Maddux or Glavine. And please don't tell that
to Cone, who has three World Series hits in his career after
singling off Hitchcock to open the sixth. The difference was that
Cone was stranded at third, while Hitchcock eventually came around
to score.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3 of the National League Championship Series,
Hitchcock's fifth-inning single off Maddux led to a two-run rally
as the Padres took a 3-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's liner to left off Glavine was muffed by Danny
Bautista for a two-run error that gave the Padres a 4-0 lead en
route to their series-clinching victory over the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the sixth inning Tuesday night, Hitchcock and Cone had
faced the same number of batters _ 17, two over the minimum. Steve
Finley had made three exceptional plays in center field to help
Hitchcock out. But the Yankees had only two hits heading into the
sixth. And though the Yankees picked up three more singles in the
sixth, Hitchcock struck out Bernie Williams and got Tino Martinez
to pop to second with the bases loaded to preserve the scoreless
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was not so lucky in the bottom of the inning as the Padres
took a 3-0 lead. And even after Hitchcock surrendered a leadoff
homer to Scott Brosius and a double to Shane Spencer, Hitchcock
still had a 3-1 lead when he left the game. But Trevor Hoffman, in
his first appearance of the Series, could not hang on to a 3-2 lead
in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   And once Brosius drilled his second homer of the evening, a
backbreaking three-run shot over the center-field fence, the Padres
_ who could not do to Mariano Rivera what the Yankees did to
Hoffman _ had wasted both Hitchcock's efforts on the mound and at
the plate.

SPENCER'S FAIRY TALE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Shane Spencer keeps wondering what the next chapter
of his fairy tale of a season could possibly be. Getting recalled
to the Yankees for September was nice. Hitting a rash of homers as
the Yankees sealed their position as one of the best teams ever in
the regular season was nicer. Belting two homers against the
Rangers in the division series was still nicer.
</P>
<P>
   But, after becoming the forgotten Yankee for the last 10 days,
Spencer was back home for Game 3 of the World Series, and the
rookie was starting in left field Tuesday night. Spencer's story,
which was stagnant while manager Joe Torre started Ricky Ledee or
Chad Curtis, was pulsating again and Spencer wanted to add more to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just special to be up on the Yankees. And
then we made it to the World Series, so that was special,'' said
Spencer. ``Then the Padres made it. I don't know how much you could
ask for in one year. What do I do after this?''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer did a little more for the Yankees in their 5-4 victory
over the Padres. He was instrumental on a night when the Yankees'
offense struggled against a stubborn Sterling Hitchcock. Hitchcock,
who was in the Yankees' minor league system for parts of three
seasons with Spencer, made most of the Yankees look like minor
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But after Scott Brosius opened the seventh with the first of his
two homers, Spencer, who had struck out in his first two at-bats,
doubled to left to keep the Yankees churning. Spencer's hit also
caused the Padres to remove Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were relieved to see Hitchcock leave. Spencer, who
later scored New York's second run on Ken Caminiti's error, had
succeeded in giving the offense a late boost. That trend continued
when Brosius smoked a three-run homer off Trevor Hoffman in the
eighth that put the Yankees ahead and silenced a boisterous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it strictly on, hopefully, the ability of putting the
right guy in left field,'' said Torre, remarking on why he started
Spencer. ``It's tough not to pick Chad Curtis because of what he's
meant to us. The thing that made my decision more than anything is
the power threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 26-year-old Spencer wondered how difficult it would
be to play such a pivotal game in his back yard, he responded. In
addition to the double, Spencer nabbed Chris Gomez with a
one-bounce throw as the Padres tried to stretch a single to a
double in the seventh. That play loomed large after the Yankees
took a 5-3 lead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought about what my first hit would be like, my
first homer if I ever would have one,'' said Spencer. ``All that's
happened. Now I'm in the World Series in my first year. Now I'm in
San Diego, which is special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was talking fast, faster than a teen-age boy who was
trying to borrow his parents' car for a date that was supposed to
start an hour earlier. Spencer was relieved, not about starting in
the World Series and not about securing 14 tickets for friends and
family. He was relieved that the weather he has raved about was
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's spoiled out here,'' said Spencer. ``That's why I
live here. Everybody's got smiles on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially Spencer. The Padres were his team as a kid. The last
time the Padres snared a World Series game was a 5-3 victory over
the Tigers on Oct. 10, 1984, and Spencer, who moved to San Diego
from Key West, Fla., when he was 5, was shouting from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still pull for Tony and the Padres, but this week only I
don't want them to win a game,'' said Spencer. ``I really can't
describe it. Maybe after the game I'll be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was as much a fixture in the lineup as anyone in the
last two games of the division series and the first three games of
the American League Championship Series. But he stumbled into a
1-for-10 drought against the Indians and Torre benched him until
Tuesday night. When Torre was asked why Spencer sputtered, the
manager said: ``If he didn't, he would have caught McGwire. You
can't do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees worked out on Monday, Spencer rushed to his
friend Todd Holverson's apartment and watched the Jets-Patriots
game. Spencer slept on Holverson's couch free in the winters
following minor league seasons, so Spencer repaid him with airline
tickets for the division series in Arlington, Texas, and the ALCS
in Cleveland. But Spencer did not have to pay any air fare Tuesday
night so his benevolent landlord could see him in a World Series
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that has happened has been unbelievable,'' said
Spencer. ``But I don't expect anything less. I really can't say
this is a dream. That's what I always thought would be happening.''

BABY ABANDONED IN DAD'S SEARCH FOR CRACK BACK WITH MOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Eight-month-old Bianca Luna was reunited with her
mother after her father was arrested on suspicion of leaving the
infant with a stranger so he could hunt for drugs, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Francesca Rosales embraced her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy she is back,'' said the 24-year-old suburban
West Covina resident as she bounced Bianca on her lap. ``It is a
really great feeling to have her back. It is something I can't
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from her home for more than a day, it was clear that the
child missed her mother and grandmother after spending a night in
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bianca was really happy. When Bianca saw us she was touching
our faces and pulling our hair,'' said Rosemarie Romero, the
child's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca's father, 27-year-old Ray Luna, was arrested at 3:25 a.m.
Tuesday after officers say they found him driving near Columbus
Avenue and Parthenia Street -- a notorious neighborhood for drugs
-- in suburban North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Luna was arrested on suspicion of child endangering and is
expected to be arraigned today or Thursday in San Fernando
Municipal Court, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to express to everybody, especially his family, how
sorry he is,'' said Detective Cynthia Dragun.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal for Bianca and her mother began Sunday when Luna
dropped off Rosales at work and was supposed to take his daughter
to her grandmother in West Covina. Luna had told Rosales he was
going to make arrangements to get a truck so the couple could move
in with his parents in suburban Sylmar, police said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Rosales knew of the whereabouts of her child
until late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said Luna drove with the child to North Hills
in a desperate search for drugs. Out of money, the unemployed
27-year-old sold his food stamps and child restraint seats, leaving
his baby daughter unsecured in the back seat, Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna continued cruising the area police refer to as the suburban
San Fernando Valley's drug supermarket, reportedly looking for
money to buy more rock cocaine. ``When he got low, he desired
more,'' Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   He met a stranger at a minimart at about 11 p.m. Sunday and
began talking about drugs, police said. ``They briefly talked and
agreed to go to another location to obtain drug paraphernalia,''
Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   While Luna drove for about an hour, the baby lay in a blanket in
the back seat, without a child restraint device, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get any money, Luna asked the stranger to care for his
daughter for 15 minutes while he searched for rock cocaine, police
said. When the father did not return after 20 minutes, the stranger
called police, who later turned Bianca over to Child Protective
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs became more important to this individual than the
welfare of his own offspring,'' said Capt. Joe Curreri of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rosales had filed missing-person reports after she
did not find her husband and daughter at her parents' home as
agreed earlier in the day, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She began a frantic search for her child and Mr. Luna,'' said
Detective Gary Barthelmess, who supervises the Devonshire
Division's major assault crimes unit.
</P>
<P>
   After the infant's face appeared on televised newscasts, a
neighbor of Rosales' parents recognized Bianca, police said.
Rosales confirmed with police that the baby is hers.
</P>
<P>
   When Luna was arrested, no drugs were found and he displayed no
obvious signs of being under the influence, Barthelmess said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales and Luna also have a 3-year-old son, who was with Luna's
parents during the ordeal, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Children and Family Services is conducting an
investigation and will hold a dependency hearing later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the facts in this case and we are recommending that
this child be with her mother, (who) is going to live with
Grandma,'' said Schuyler Sprowles, a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Luna was being held at the Devonshire Division jail in lieu of
$50,000 bail on suspicion of child endangerment. But he also was
being held on no bail because of a nondrug-related parole hold from
a previous prison term, police said without elaborating.

SLUGGINGS KINGS HOPE THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE ROAD
</HEADLINE>

By ROGER PHILLLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ It's no secret Kings coach Larry Robinson has
not been overjoyed with the inconsistent play of his team in the
first four games of the season. On the surface, things appear fine,
given the Kings' 2-1-1 record. But they have struggled offensively
and Robinson has questioned some of his players' intensity.
</P>
<P>
   With this as a backdrop, the Kings begin a five-game trip
tonight against the Florida Panthers (2-0-1), and Robinson is
hoping his team can gel while away from home. After tonight, the
Kings visit Tampa Bay, Carolina, the New York Islanders and New
Jersey before returning to the Forum against the Lightning on Oct.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson can look back a year ago to a similar trip that came
only slightly later in the season. The Kings were 3-5-3 when they
began a five-game trip with a sluggish 3-1 victory in Tampa Bay
last Oct. 26. Two nights later, they tied Florida 2-2 in a game in
which they didn't manage a single shot in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up having to have a no-pucks practice in Florida to
get us going,'' Robinson recalled. ``That's not the way it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings finished the trip with one-sided victories over
Detroit and New Jersey sandwiching a loss to the Islanders. They
returned home with a .500 record, went 4-2 on a subsequent six-game
home stand, and were above .500 the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is hoping for a similar jump start for his team on this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of in this situation last year when we went on a
road trip like that,'' Robinson said. ``We weren't playing good,
grinding, working-hard hockey. If we're not prepared and we're not
playing well, we could be in deep (trouble) when we come back from
this road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   At least for the beginning of the trip, the Kings will be
relying on a rookie goalie, as Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr
recover from groin strains. Manny Legace, 25, is scheduled to make
his first NHL appearance tonight, with 18-year-old Alexey Volkov as
the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great way to do it,'' Robinson said of starting an
important trip with a rookie in goal, ``but what are you going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Legace, however, said he wants to make the most of his
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody who plays hockey wants to get to the highest
league they possibly can,'' said Legace, who had been playing in
the IHL for the Long Beach Ice Dogs. ``Hopefully I can play well
and stick around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Time needed: Look for Robinson to find playing time on the
trip for defenseman Garry Galley and forward Roman Vopat, neither
of whom has played in the first four games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 35-year-old Galley, whose absence from the lineup has
been something of a surprise, Robinson said, ``I'd certainly like
to get him in. Practice shape and game shape are two different
things. He hasn't played in a while. We're going to be playing a
lot of games on the road. I want to get everybody in, get them in
game shape.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Green's day: When their son's first NHL goal came Friday
against Boston, rookie Josh Green's father, Svend, was on a
business trip in Winnipeg, and his mother, Carol, was watching the
game in the family's hometown of Camrose, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom watched it at the neighbors' house,'' said Green, 20.
``The neighbors weren't home. She was watching it by herself in
their basement. She said she felt pretty weird jumping up and down
by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal seemed to get Green going, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really energized,'' he said. ``As soon as I got the
first goal, I felt better out there. I don't know what it was. I
was just really pumped up.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
After losing one of the biggest bargaining chips in their labor
battle with the NBA owners, the members of the National Basketball
Players Association will convene Thursday in Las Vegas for what can
be called the bargaining equivalent of a 20-second timeout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday, arbitrator John Feerick refused the players' grievance,
saying the owners were not obligated to pay 226 players their
guaranteed contracts during the lockout. With Nov. 15, the day
first paychecks are due, approaching, the players must figure out
their next tactic in an effort to get back on the court.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, the tactic being mentioned most often is
decertifying the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to think of what's best for the players now,
considering where we're at,'' said the Rockets' Brent Price. ``We
went for the gold, and we didn't get it. Now, we have to minimize
the losses. Realistically, I don't know how we're going to avoid
signing a hard (salary) cap at this point unless we decertify.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has been fighting the owners' demands for a hard
salary cap, which would fix the amount of money devoted to player
salaries. Unable to reach anything near an agreement, a vote to
decertify would remove the union as the official bargaining agent
for the players and open the door for the players to return to the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Labor laws allow the owners to lock out a body of players
represented by a union, but not individuals. Without the union, the
players would come back under rules set by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the next round of problems begins, said agent Steve
Woods, a professor of sports administration at the University of
South Carolina and Clark Atlanta University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once those new rules were established, the next mechanism
would be the players would sue based on antitrust provisions saying
the league was setting a system that limits individual income,''
Woods said. ``The only way you're able to suppress salaries, or
come up with an economic-income system, is within a mutually
agreed-upon collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like price-fixing. The tactic would be to take away the
union so the owners would have to do some sort of price-fixing,
which would open them up to the antitrust lawsuit. Then they would
be right back where they started.''
</P>
<P>
   But some advise the players to exercise caution when considering
a vote to decertify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel, as a whole, that if that's something you throw out
there, then you'd better be prepared to do it,'' said player agent
Tony Dutt, a member of the agents' advisory council, which is
advising the players during negotiations. ``You can't just say,
`Oh, yeah, we might just decertify.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're going to do it or you're not. I think that's
what we want to come out of this (the Las Vegas meeting) with _
some definites on what the next plan is. You can't afford to make
the wrong move at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the players are prepared to decertify the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually already signed decertification papers as
individual players,'' Price said. ``Each individual player had to
sign a paper saying whether they would decertify if it came to that
so the union could vote on it. We did that way back when as kind of
a last resort, just in case we ever had to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that would be the best answer. If you
decertified, there would be chaos _ you'd break up the union, and I
think you'd further delay the start of the season because there
would be a lot to be established and determined. I don't know all
the facts, so we have to see what all our options are. I don't
think that would be the best option for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the options being mulled by the players:
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the bargaining table and working out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to the owners' latest offer, which calls for a luxury
tax on all Larry Bird-exception contracts above the average salary,
which was $2.6 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   Decertification, but only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, NFL players opted for decertification after their
failed strike and fought a five-year battle in the courts before a
settlement was reached with owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to talk about the various options,'' said union
executive director Billy Hunter.``We'll make some determinations
about what we'll do from there.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern, who has canceled the first two
weeks of the season and said there might be more cancellations
announced next week, hopes the players vote to return to the
bargaining table rather than decertifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfair-labor-practice charges, arbitration, decertifications,
antitrust lawsuits don't get it done,'' Stern said. ``All they do
is cost the players more money, owners more money and the fans the
game. If the record to date doesn't demonstrate that the way to get
out of this is to negotiate, then I don't know what else to say.''

PRESS PAID TOO MUCH HEED TO SPECULATION ABOUT SCANDAL, STUDY
FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major news organizations, long under fire for their coverage of
the investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, showed reasonable care with facts but sometimes placed
unreasonable credence in investigators' speculation, according to a
new study by a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Committee of Concerned Journalists, found
that ``the press also ferried speculation, some of which could have
been construed as threats, from investigators into news accounts,
raising questions about whether the press was sufficiently wary of
being used by sources, especially law enforcement sources.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the report said, accounts _ later discredited _
that the prosecutors might have found a witness to a clandestine
sexual encounter, may indicate that ``investigative sources used
the press to float rumors, to put pressure on potential witnesses,
including Lewinsky, and to try out a prosecution theory that
included a possible conspiracy to cover up the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the general criticism that some news
organizations, including Newsweek magazine, gave too much credence
to investigators' version of evidence, Newsweek's Washington bureau
chief, Ann McDaniel, said, ``All along this was a difficult story
to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, for the first seven or eight months we only had
information that was coming from the accusers, whether witnesses or
sources close to Starr's office,'' Ms. McDaniel said, referring to
the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   She added that reporting was complicated ``by the fact that many
of the people involved on the president's side refused to talk and
the president himself lied.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on the press' coverage took special note of Starr's
contention, in a legal argument, that his office's contacts with
the press could be shielded from scrutiny by the ``informants'
privilege,'' which implied that Starr saw some reporters as
extensions of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he himself chose to defend his contacts that way
should raise a question in journalists' minds,'' said Bill Kovach,
the chairman of the committee and curator of the Nieman Foundation
for Journalism at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises a question about whether the prosecutors were
passing stories to a less-than-skeptical press,'' sometimes to
intimidate witnesses, Kovach said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervised by James Doyle, who was special assistant to the
independent counsels investigating the Watergate scandal, the
report analyzed particular aspects of coverage that have been
heavily criticized, including the reports, which were never
substantiated, of a witness to a sexual encounter between Clinton
and Ms. Lewinsky. The committee noted that ABC News' report about a
potential witness prompted a rash of press speculation about
corroborating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the president of ABC News, David Westin, said on
Tuesday that Westin could not comment on the report until he had
had a chance to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the news organizations was tempered with the
observation that ``the press was largely on the mark'' in reporting
that Ms. Lewinsky had saved a dress reportedly bearing DNA evidence
of an encounter with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the contention that ABC News was lucky when
it reported the dress ``may be too harsh.'' Reliance on a single
source can be justified, if the network ``had good reason to
believe its lone source,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The echo-chamber effect of such reports remains a troubling
aspect of the coverage of this investigation, said Michael Oreskes,
the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. ``It has
sometimes, in the minds of editors, replaced the need for a second
source or the need to double-check,'' Oreskes said.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at reporting from CNN, PBS, the three network
news broadcasts, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los
Angeles Times, USA Today, Time and Newsweek.

TODAY'S BEST QUARTERBACKS ARE AGING TO PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro football teams in recent years have been enamored of youth.
Youth usually means speed, quickness and an open mind that can be
easily molded. Youth has often meant a cheaper player, one who fits
more easily under the salary cap. Youth has meant freshness, a
bushel of players less prone to injury who often heal more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Through seven weeks of the National Football League season,
however, youth at quarterback is not being served.
</P>
<P>
   The six top-rated quarterbacks in the league are at least age 32
and have played at least nine pro seasons. Randall Cunningham of
Minnesota is first with a 121.3 passer rating. He is followed by
Vinny Testaverde of the Jets (108.8), Steve Young of San Francisco
(105.8), Neil O'Donnell of Cincinnati (102.2), John Elway of Denver
(100.7) and Doug Flutie of Buffalo (93.8).
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 35, is in his 13th pro season. Testaverde (35 next
month) is in his 12th, Young (37) in his 16th, O'Donnell (32) in
his ninth, and Flutie (36 on Friday) in his 14th, including eight
in the Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 30-something group with quite a few kicks left.
</P>
<P>
   These men have found their own version of a fountain of youth.
They still possess mobility to escape today's mad pass rush. They
have retained arm strength to deliver tight throws. But most of
all, they have seen enough, played enough, read enough coverages
and experienced enough heated game pressures to make quick and
efficient decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It is the decision-making, given any type of pro-level skill,
that is the essential extra ingredient that truly makes a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that the Randall Cunnigham that I have now is
a totally different one than the Randall Cunningham that was in
Philadelphia,'' said Brian Billick, Minnesota's offensive
coordinator. ``He is more mature. He is married and has children.
What I have now is a very serene and confident man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the rookies, Ryan Leaf and Peyton Manning, and
there is no question that those two guys have the physical skills
that match and even pass any of the top-rated quarterbacks today.
But playing quarterback in the NFL is doing a tough job in a very
unique atmosphere. No matter how good of a coach you are, and no
matter how much film you watch, and no matter what the physical
skill of the quarterback is, there is nothing like that game-day
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham replaced the injured Brad Johnson (broken right
fibula) in Week 2 and has thrown 12 touchdown passes and no
interceptions. He is averaging 9.37 yards gained per pass attempt,
by far the best in the league. He has a quality offensive line,
three dynamic receivers and a top running back in Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, he has perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit him in the pocket and give him maximum protection, and
he knows he will have time to throw; he has the arm to make it
happen,'' Billick said. ``I think his experience before in
Philadelphia was different from that. He was scrambling a lot and
tried to make a lot happen on his own. Here, he is part of the
scheme, not the whole scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to Brad. Randall knows that. First we have to
make sure that Brad is fully healed and conditioned. Randall does
have the hot hand and so this is a situation where, when the time
comes, the best decision will be made to not disrupt chemistry and
to also give this team the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota is 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are 3-3 and excited after showing the nation on Monday
night that Testaverde is not a backup-turned-starter who cannot
produce. Testaverde passed for three touchdowns in the Jets' 24-14
victory over New England, and he is leading the league in a
noteworthy category: red-zone completion percentage. In the red
zone, Testaverde is 71.4 percent (10 of 14 for 78 yards and 7
touchdowns). His closest competitor is Mark Brunell of Jacksonville
at 59.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Young is rolling. In each of the 49ers' six games, he has passed
for 300 or more yards, the first NFL player to accomplish that
feat. O'Donnell has thrown 1 interception in 165 pass attempts.
Elway is averaging 8.40 yards gained per pass attempt. Flutie beat
previously unbeaten Jacksonville last Sunday with his legs as much
as with his arm, on a 1-yard broken-play bootleg run for the
winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Flutie, each of the top passers is at least 6 feet 2
inches and weighs at least 214 pounds. Size matters. But experience
and decision-making matter more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care much about how we finish each year in total
offense,'' Billick said. ``We want at the end of the year to rank
in the top 10 in rushing and in passing. If you have that kind of
balance, you have an offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same goes for all of these quarterbacks. You are talking
about some guys who have a great deal of pride and professionalism,
who have played the game for a long time and who expect to play at
a certain level. When they get to the point that they can't, they
won't be there. They will make sure of it.''

 COMMENTARY: NBA LABOR WAR COULD LAST A LONG TIMEnbXXXXXXXX  
(sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As labor battles go, the current one between the National
Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports
standards. There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of
the coming season will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In this union battle it is the interests of the best paid, not
those who make union scale, that are dominating the discussion. And
here it is some of the workers, not the management, who are
considering trying to make the union disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The current arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of
immense proportions. Last year more players than ever before
received the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000
for veterans. The number of players making $1 million to $2 million
a year _ the middle class, in NBA terms _ fell sharply. But Michael
Jordan made $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment
business, not unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get
union scale.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have
failed. The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team
sign its own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When
that was adopted, it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more
than a rival could pay. But it has not worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the current negotiation, the league has offered to guarantee
that its payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four years,
from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and says it is open to proposals
to split that money any way the players want, whether by raising
the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans. The union
says it is worried about that middle class, but seems determined to
preserve the free market.
</P>
<P>
   The league got its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable
channels, to agree to pay this year's television fees whether or
not there are any games to broadcast. (They will be paid back in
later years, either through reduced fees or extra games to show.)
Owners hoped the players would think management was willing to wait
them out, and come to terms with only a small part of the season
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But the union is acting unhurried. It turned aside requests for
negotiations this week, saying the players had to meet first.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of union suicide, a tactic that was
rejected by the players in 1995. The idea is that if the players
had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws for the
owners to collude. The sky would be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic might fail. The courts could reject a union
decertification vote as a sham, and in any case some players may
fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union
minimum. But if the players go that route, it could be a long time
before real negotiations get going.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners
this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's
popularity. That was what all the seers said four years ago, when
baseball's World Series was canceled by labor troubles. But fan
memories are relatively short, and now baseball seems more popular
than ever. With that in mind, both owners and players may choose to
battle on for months.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ It takes eight men to capture a street-smart
cow, so the municipal cow catchers of New Delhi must squeeze
together tightly in the cab of their cattle truck. There are two
parts to their important job and only one is easy: finding the
cows. Getting the beasts into the truck is where these workers
really earn their $119 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 40,000 cows wander the streets of this
city, and most seem well informed of their sacred status. They are
a study in nonchalance, slowly crossing a highway or, as many
prefer, relaxing in the right-turn lane of a busy intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 or so cow catchers employed by the city have always
thought their occupation a merciful one, saving sanctified
creatures from a run-in with a front bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary if misunderstood work,'' said Raman Kumar
Sharma, a crew chief. ``Sometimes people do not realize we have the
cow's best interests at heart. We've had violence with the
crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, their mission has taken on added urgency because
the urban cow has encountered a vicious new enemy: the plastic
garbage bag. With little grass to graze on in the paved cityscape,
cows scavenge through trash that is increasingly packed into
polyethylene.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi's animal rights groups have recently begun campaigns
against the lethal packaging. Table scraps may be fine fodder, they
say, but the plastic wrapping is not digestible in any of the cows'
four famous stomachs. They want use of the garbage bags banned,
though as yet this appears unlikely. In modern India, the utility
of the garbage bag may be a force beyond even the spirituality of
the cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the cows we find glass, iron, wire, electrical cords,
shoes, shirts and razor blades, but the real killer is the
plastic,'' said Dr. Vijay Chaudry, a veterinarian who runs a refuge
where the cow catchers deliver the caught cows. ``We lose two or
three cows a day, and when we cut them open. It is terrible what we
find. For an animal so sacred, they die a bad death.''
</P>
<P>
   Cows are as common to big-city India as bright lights are to
Broadway, and revered though they may be, most live the life of
vagrants. They are either unwanted animals, turned out because they
are old and dry, or milk producers belonging to city dwellers who
do not feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows that are still productive belong to people who think,
`Why should I feed this cow, when the cow can feed itself?''' said
Sharma, 36, a bureaucrat whose official title is milk tax
inspector. ``These owners sometimes chase us when we take their
cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, there are many difficulties to this work. Old cows
are tired and sick, and these are easy to catch. Young, healthy
cows, well, this is something else. The cow is quick. The cow is
intelligent. The cow has learned to recognize our truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hindus venerate the cow as a symbol of motherhood and a giver of
life. It is certainly the mainstay of rural India, providing milk
and pulling carts. Dried cow dung is the slow-burning cooking fuel
favored by most village households. It also makes a good hard
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cow slaughter _ sometimes a volatile, violence-provoking issue
here _ is banned in most of India's 27 states, though there is no
shortage of juicy steaks for those who can afford them. Beef is
sold on the black market, and butchers casually deliver their prime
cuts door to door.
</P>
<P>
   This not-so-surreptitious killing is rarely discussed in a
nation where the hallowed cow seems quaintly familiar on boulevards
that are otherwise overpopulated with smoke-belching rattletraps.
</P>
<P>
   For the cow catcher, the animal's high approval rating is a
problem. As a crowd gathers, more people are always rooting for the
cow than the catcher. There is little use in talking to spectators
about plastic bags and clogged digestive tracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you quit torturing the poor animal!'' a man called
out as Sharma's crew took on its toughest challenge of the day, a
horned, formidable-looking white brute.
</P>
<P>
   Stealth is the cow catcher's principal tactic. Once a rope has
been slipped onto the animal's head, the techniques of the rodeo
cowboy usually work _ the headlock, the twisting, the tugging.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grab the ears and put your hand in its mouth, the cow
won't run,'' said Aji Ram, at 60 the most veteran of the crew.
``Then someone's got to hold on to the tail.''
</P>
<P>
   When the catchers sneaked up on her, the big white cow had been
enjoying the garbage beside a vegetable stand along busy Okhala
Road. Another, more alert animal had just bolted away, recognizing
the green rust bucket that serves as the cow catcher's truck. She
then agilely ran up a steep slope, eventually taking sanctuary in a
taxi stand.
</P>
<P>
   The white cow, however, had carelessly allowed herself to be
roped and there was little else for her do but use Gandhian tactics
of civil disobedience. Whenever the catchers shoved her near the
ramp of their truck, the beast went limp. If they wanted her so
badly, they would have to carry her.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes, the catchers used all their wiles. When these
failed, they used their poles, slipping the wooden prods under the
animal and hitting her belly. At the same time, Aji Ram pulled the
tail. Suresh Chand pushed the flank. Radha Krishna slapped the
butt.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma himself, dressed in a well-pressed blue shirt, never
touched the cow, but he did survey the crowd, which was ready to
declare the animal the winner. ``I don't think we catch this cow,''
Sharma said, calling off the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, they already had eight cows in their truck, a good
enough bounty for three hours' work. The animals were then driven
to the city's outskirts and set free in a gosadan, a sort of a
shelter for homeless cows.
</P>
<P>
   There, they could chew their cuds in relative tranquillity, and
while their diet may neither be as varied or as tasty as human
garbage, it would again be plastic-free.

YANKS' KNOBLAUCH KNOWS BASEBALL IS JUST A GAME

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Baseball has always drawn Chuck Knoblauch and his
father together, the time spent in the car going to Little League
and high school games, the hours of playing catch in the back yard.
So, after Knoblauch slugged a game-tying three-run homer in Game 1
of the World Series, he settled on the Yankee bench and thought of
his father, Ray, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Knoblauch was at his home in Houston for Games 1 and 2, but
he and Linda Knoblauch, his wife, are here for the next three days
as the Yankees try to win the World Series for the 24th time. David
Cone was to pitch against San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock Tuesday
night. Chuck Knoblauch was to bat leadoff and play second base for
the Yankees, duties he performed exceptionally in the first two
games. With four hits in seven at-bats, including his home run,
Knoblauch is a front-runner to be named the Series' most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, San Diego's perennial batting champion, said that
neutralizing Knoblauch was crucial for the Padres. ``He's the
feisty guy who will stand there and take pitches and foul pitches
and get hit by pitches,'' Gwynn said, ``and he can swing the bat.
He's got a great eye, and he gives them exactly what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Knoblauch's game were sown by his father, a former
minor league pitcher and well-known figure in Houston amateur
baseball as the coach at Bellaire High School. Ray Knoblauch built
a mound for his son behind their home, a strip of rubber across the
summit, regulation distance for Little League, and they would play
catch. Chuck shared his father's passion for the game and would go
on to be a star. In time, grass grew over the top of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Knoblauch began jumbling words years ago, began struggling
with certain phrases, to the point that his family wondered whether
he was all right. ``I remember talking to him at the time and
asking him how he felt, and he would say, `I'm fine,''' Chuck
Knoblauch said. But the son, playing for the Minnesota Twins then,
arranged for a doctor at the Mayo Clinic to examine his father
after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uncomfortable thing, trying to get someone to get
tested and go for a checkup,'' Knoblauch said. ``He was having a
hard time with it, because I don't think he really understood why
he was having tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests mostly ruled out possible problems, tumors or a
stroke, and Chuck Knoblauch was told that Alzheimer's can be
confirmed only by an autopsy. But he saw the results of a brain
scan done on his father, and there were dark spots, signs of a
larger problem. The doctor did not use the word Alzheimer's when
discussing the illness with Ray Knoblauch, but the doctor did tell
him he could not drive anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was, the son believes, perhaps the hardest part of the Mayo
process, for his mother and for his father, always extremely
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's advances in stages, and treatment aims to retard the
progression of the disease as long as possible with medication.
Although Ray Knoblauch's communication skills have been affected,
he recognizes Chuck, who believes his father comprehends what is
happening and can watch a baseball game and understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you struggle with, because some days you don't
know how to handle it,'' Knoblauch said. ``Being at the Mayo Clinic
helped, and you try to have some sympathy for what he's going
through and realize what my mom is going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a lot more difficult for me if I was seeing him on
a daily basis, if I was going through what my mom goes through
every day, not knowing what type of person you're going to get each
morning when they wake up. But still, it's a no-hope type of
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Knoblauch spent a week at spring training this year, ``and
he was pretty badly off,'' his son said. The father did not make
the trip to Arlington, Texas, when the Yankees went there in May,
the first time since his son has played in the big leagues that he
did not make that trip. But Ray Knoblauch, 70, did visit when the
Yankees went back to Texas in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I saw my dad as an old man,'' Knoblauch
said. ``In the 30 years I'd been alive, my dad always looked
exactly the same. In Arlington, he was walking around really
gingerly, like he might fall down, really tired, laying around.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then when I saw him again'' _ during the playoffs in Texas
earlier this month _ ``he was so much better. He was good, and he
was talking, and it was really good seeing him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made a mental blunder in Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series against Cleveland, arguing a call rather than
pursuing the baseball, as the Indians scored the decisive run in
the 12th inning. He acknowledged his mistake the next day and has
felt better since then, played better, saved from longtime ridicule
when the Yankees advanced to the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the clubhouse here on Monday, Knoblauch said: ``You
don't want to minimize this job we have; it's a professional thing.
But in the same sense, when you put everything in perspective, it's
just really very small considering all the trouble in the world.''
He mentioned Darryl Strawberry. ``There are people laying in
hospitals with cancer, people with Alzheimer's,'' Knoblauch said.
``What's going on with Strawberry, that's life and that's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch saw the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' and hopes he
always remembers what he felt as he walked away, his sense of
life's tenuous nature.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It was all set up for a big San Diego celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was the occasion of the first World Series game here in 14
years, and it was festive right from the start. A crowd of 64,667
had come to salute their newly beloved National League champs, and
everything was going the way it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The night had begun with a great national anthem sung by Trisha
Yearwood to the accompaniment of the San Diego Symphony as 240
white-clad sailors unfurled just about the biggest flag you've ever
seen. A tense pitchers' duel between Sterling Hitchcock and David
Cone turned into a 3-0 Padres lead. And things built up to the
appropriate climax when, at precisely 7:49 PDT, the gong that
commences AC/DC's ``Hell's Bells'' was sounded over the
loudspeaker, signaling that savemeister Trevor Hoffman would trot
in from the Padres' bullpen to preserve what was then a 3-2 lead
with a man on first and nobody out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, and then it wasn't there. Because Hoffman walked
Tino Martinez on a 3-and-1 pitch. And because Hoffman went to
3-and-2 on Scott Brosius, and Scott Brosius, having one of those
sweet-swing nights players dream about having but never even dare
to fantasize having in a World Series game, drilled that 3-and-2
pitch to dead center, the ball sailing over the 405-foot sign and
landing in the blue-covered seats for a three-run homer that gives
the Yankees a 3-0 World Series lead.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, a 1997 frog in Oakland, has turned into a
handsome prince in New York. This season he drove in 98 runs while
batting in the Nos. 7, 8, and 9 spots and played a spectacular
third base. Derek Jeter suggested, without a hint of facetiousness,
that on this team of anonymous stars, Brosius might very well have
been the MVP. Why, just the other day, Graig Nettles, a Yankee
third baseman of some repute, ambled in Brosius's direction and
delivered a classic Nettles line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trying to make them forget about me?'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles was the fielding star of the 1978 Series triumph over
the Dodgers, but he never had a night at the plate to rival one
that Brosius had at Qualcomm Stadium Tuesday night. They like to
talk about ``good at-bats'' in baseball. That being the case, let
it be known that Brosius had four very good at-bats Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Second inning: A fly to deepest center on which Steve Finley
makes a 1 1/2- and maybe even a 2-star catch.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth inning: A sharp single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh inning: A home run to left-center that got the Yankees,
trailing, 3-0, back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth inning: The Big One, a dramatic wallop that will make
sure, that, whatever happens to the memory of Nettles, no Yankee
follower will soon be forgetting the reality of Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to pick up the ball and put a good swing on
it,'' said the self-effacing Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came here, we didn't exactly know what Scott Brosius
was all about,'' said Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``But it didn't
take long in spring training for us to see what a versatile player
he is. He is such a force on our ball club. He has had som many big
hits for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius? Didn't he hit .200-and-change for the A's last
year? What exactly is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he stayed healthy, which he hadn't been able to do
in previous years. OK, fine. But 98 ribbies from the 7, 8, and 9
spots?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to drive in 90 runs,'' he was saying a couple of days
ago, ``there had to be somebody on base for that to happen. In this
lineup, I have said all along, there really is no bad spot to hit.
You can be anywhere, 1 to 9, and you are going to be in those
situations and have opportunities to drive in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending all season in what is officially known as the
lower portion of the order, he was placed in the rarefied air of
the No. 6 spot Tuesday night. Baseball being baseball,
circumstances transpired to bring the hot man to the plate at just
the right time. Who knows how this game would have turned out if
Brosius had not been up at that point in time with Paul O'Neill on
second and Martinez on first? But that's the way things have gone
for the Yankees this year. The right man always seems to be up in
the right situation. That's how you win 124 games.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is a great story, but the ultimate truth is that he is
part of an ultimate cliche. One day it's Chuck Knoblauch and
Martinez hitting home runs. Another day it's Jeter. The next day,
it's Shane Spencer. Then there's all that pitching. The Yankees
will soon be world champions, and no one agrees on who really is
the team MVP. It surely isn't Scott Brosius. Is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to go back to the old Celtics,'' suggested Torre.
``They'd have no MVP because they had all those guys scoring 16,
17, or 18 points a game. The only thing this team is interested in
is winning. They all want to get the winning hit, but they don't
want to talk about it. It's a very unusual team.''
</P>
<P>
   Very unusual and very uncaring, too. This was set up to be a San
Diego fiesta. But let's get this straight. In 1998, the only team
destined to celebrate is the New York Yankees.

ROQUES COMING THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ryan Roques' surname might be pronounced `rock,'
yet in his first three years at UCLA he'd been anything but.
</P>
<P>
   He was a baseball player who'd gone an entire season without a
hit. In football, he gave upon the idea of playing tailback. And
when it came to playing defense, well, it seemed like anawful lot
of work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, halfway through this season, Roques, a fourth-year junior,
has stepped from the shadows of the UCLA depth chart to play two
prominent roles: starting cornerback and punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   Count UCLA head coach Bob Toledo among the surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never made a commitment to football before,'' Toledo
said. ``He's kind of done this,done that; a little football, a
little baseball; and he's never done well in either of them.He
hasn't been an effort guy. We had two guys who didn't make the
commitment to work reallyhard in the summer one of 'em isn't with
us (Damian Allen) and the other is Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like all of a sudden a light switch went on that said,
`Hey, I'm tired of being abackup. I'm tired of not playing. I'm
going to go out and compete and go out and show theseguys I can
play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roques was handed the left cornerback job, ironically enough,
when someone else MarquesAnderson displayed a lack of effort. He
shows no sign of handing it back, either, as hisfour interceptions
lead the Pac-10 and are fourth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Roques became the punt returner last week, returning four kicks
for 38 yards (9.8 average),when DeShaun Foster sprained knee
ligaments that will keep him out at least two more weeks.The job
originally belonged to Freddie Mitchell, who broke his leg against
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's the type of play UCLA expected out of the 6-foot,
190-pounder when he was chosen theCIF Division IV Player of the
Year after leading Moreno Valley Canyon Springs to a CIF title.
</P>
<P>
   Roques, after redshirting in '95, was given a crack at running
back in the '96 opener atTennessee, but soon found himself buried
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fumbled at Tennessee and he didn't play hard,'' Toledo
said. ``He didn't carry theball well and then he proved he didn't
want to play offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Roques asked Toledo after the season to move to defense. By
playing baseball anoutfielder with excellent speed, he has been
used primarily as a pinch runner the past twoseasons there was
little time to learn his new position in football.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he played in only three games in the secondary last
year all in garbage time of routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel if I just focused on one sport, I'd improve
a lot faster,'' Roques said.``It's not something I have to do it's
something I chose to do because I like playing both sports and I'd
like to keep my options open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to get better, but last year it was really
difficult to make the transition from running back to cornerback so
quickly. I was probably improving with each practice, but it wasn't
at a level where you could really notice it because I was so far
behind in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no press conference or klieg lights when Roques was
given the starting job in the third game against Washington State,
but word got out quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Oregon have made it a point to test Roques. The
Ducks, in fact, threw five consecutive passes at him in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens,'' said UCLA free safety Larry Atkins.
``If you have a sub or a new guy, the next few plays you're going
toward that guy. If he keeps coming up with big plays,teams will
learn to stay away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Roques' four interceptions have indeed been big plays.
</P>
<P>
   His 19-yard return for a touchdown against Houston put the
Bruins comfortably ahead, 35-14.
</P>
<P>
   His first-quarter pick against Washington State set up a UCLA
touchdown that put the Bruins ahead, 21-0, less than 11 minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Roques' 39-yard return of an interception against Arizona set up
Chris Sailer's 41-yard field goal that gave UCLA a 24-21
third-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   His interception of Akili Smith's fourth-down desperation heave
killed Oregon's chance in overtime and the Bruins won on their
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really feel like you'repart of the game until you
get apass breakup or a nice tackle orsomebody might hit you,'' he
said.``Then it's like, `Now, I'm ready to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   And for that, the Bruins couldn't be more thankful.

RANGERS TOP OILERS, 3-2X 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ KRFor the first time this season, the New York
Rangers got effort, enthusiasm and scoring on the same night. And
for the first time this season, the Rangers got a victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, everything came together for the Rangers, who
beat the Edmonton Oilers, 3-2, at Madison Square Garden after four
losses and a tie.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was scored by the newest Ranger, defenseman
Mathieu Schneider, midway through the final period. The power-play
goal was Schneider's first of the season and first as a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   It was made possible by Todd Harvey, who was the Rangers' best
forward on Tuesday night. Harvey unleashed a blast that was stopped
by Oilers goalie Bob Essensa's quick glove. Harvey followed his own
shot and kicked the puck back to Schneider, who had been acquired
in a trade with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Schneider's wrist shot
beat the sprawling Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were dreadful early in the first period, falling
behind, 1-0, in the first two minutes after a power-play goal as
Bill Guerin, shooting from the slot, beat Mike Richter between the
pads.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely enough, the early deficit seemed to energize the
Rangers, who tied the game on a goal by Manny Malhotra, the team's
1998 first-round draft pick. Malhotra's first National Hockey
League goal came on the 18-year-old's second scoring chance of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra, who nervously fired into Essensa's chest earlier in
the period, scored by sliding the puck underneath Essensa, who
misplayed a dump-in by defenseman Jeff Beukeboom. Essensa's blunder
wound up on the stick of Malhotra, who was fighting off an Oilers'
defender as he tapped the puck. Malhotra reacted like a player who
scored an overtime goal in the Stanley Cup finals, pumping his
fists and excitedly jumping up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Malhotra told MSG Network after the first
period. ``It will give me the more confidence on the ice. It wasn't
the prettiest goal this league has ever seen, but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' inspired play continued into the second period as
they came up with numerous chances although they failed to score
against Essensa and the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers took a 2-1 lead when Josef Beranek knocked in a
rebound midway through the second period while the teams were
skating four men apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second period, the Rangers appeared to tie the game,
2-2. But Wayne Gretzky's rebound score was taken away when a replay
that revealed Adam Graves' skate was in the crease, which was
shortened this season for the purpose of cutting down on the
frequency of such calls.
</P>
<P>
   A power-play goal by defenseman Brian Leetch, the Rangers
captain, evened the score seconds after the puck was dropped to
open the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Weight, the Oilers' two-time All-Star center, was a
surprise addition to Edmonton's lineup, playing only one day after
ending his five-week holdout. Weight, who broke in with the Rangers
in 1991-92 but was traded to Edmonton for Esa Tikkanen, signed a
two-year deal worth $7.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Weight, 27, is easily the Oilers' most-talented offensive
player, leading the team in points in each of the last five
seasons. He had 26 goals and 44 assists last season. On Tuesday
night, he was used regularly skating on the Oilers' second line.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Smith, the Rangers' general manager, had expressed interest
in re-acquiring the 5-foot-11-inch, 200-pound Weight, but it seems
the Oilers do not want to trade him. Weight's signing on Monday
leaves Smith with few options, those being the Penguins' Petr
Nedved (who has held out for 18 months) and the Canucks' holdout
Pavel Bure. But acquiring either Nedved or Bure would come at a
high cost to the Rangers, who would be asked for youngsters like
Niklas Sundstrom, Malhotra and the backup goalie Dan Cloutier in
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was always a possibility,'' Weight said of being
traded to the Rangers. ``But I'm happy to be back with Edmonton.'' &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: CORPORATE AMERICA CUTS BACK; THE PENINSULA
REOPENS; SINGAPORE AIRLINES SCORES AGAIN; BARGAINS IN FLIGHT

<P>
   Business travelers can take some comfort that the typical
domestic business fare rose only 3 percent in the 10 months ended
in August, to $458, according to the latest American Express
Business Airfare Index. By contrast, comparable fares increased 16
percent in all of 1997 compared with 1996. Typical business fare
generally means the lowest fare available with the least
restrictions. But business fares last August, the latest month for
which data were available, were 9 percent higher than in August
1997, when the comparable fare was $421.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent survey, the Air Transport Association
reported on Monday that the average fare, which includes economy
and first-class fares, fell 1 percent in September, compared with
September 1997, and rose only 1.8 percent from January through
September 1998, to $138.74
</P>
<P>
   But whether because of the rise in business fares the last few
years, because of the recent economic downturn or both, corporate
America has begun to rein in spending on business travel. A survey
of 450 Fortune 1,000 companies by the National Business Travel
Association found that 56 percent have cut back the number of
employees who travel, 53 percent have replaced some travel with
video conferencing and teleconferencing and 40 percent have altered
corporate travel practices and policies to save money. On average,
the corporations surveyed will reduce overall domestic and
international travel by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   With New York City hotels jammed practically every night, the
242-room Peninsula New York hotel at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street
will reopen on Nov. 1, 10 months after closing for a $45 million
overhaul. Room rates are $535 a night, a junior suite is $800 and
the Peninsula suite is $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Managed by the hotel and marketing arm of the ultra-upscale
Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., the Peninsula, as those rates
suggest, is hardly your ordinary hotel. Amenities include built-in
remote-controlled televisions that can be viewed from the tub;
three telephones in the bathroom, including a hands-free unit at
the tub that automatically mutes the radio and television;
double-glazed windows and a personal fax number for the machine in
a nearby credenza.
</P>
<P>
   There are other specialties of the house, including a control
panel that displays up-to-the-minute temperature and humidity
readings from the hotel's own rooftop weather station.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast Winners
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines has done it again. The November issue of
Conde Nast Traveler rates the airline the best international
carrier for the 10th time in the 11 years the the magazine has
conducted its readers' choice awards. The best U.S. carrier was
Midwest Express, the rare airline that actually leaves a few inches
between passengers' knees and the seat back in front. Other winners
included the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans, voted the best
hotel in the world; Crystal Cruises and Silversea, the best large
cruise line and small cruise line, respectively; Sydney, Australia,
the top foreign city, and San Francisco, the top U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   Airline News
</P>
<P>
   Americans who buy the Europe Flight Pass can now add Paris,
Prague, Venice, Vienna and 25 other European cities for $90 a
flight. That is the result of three more airlines joining: Cityjet,
based in Dublin; Alpi Eagles, a regional carrier based in Venice,
and Croatia Airlines of Zagreb. Other airlines in the network
include Icelandair, Virgin Express and Spanair, a Spanish carrier
that for almost a year has been operating nonstop flights between
Washington Dulles International Airport and Madrid. Flight coupons,
sold in packets of three or more, are valid for 120 days. They are
available from travel agents or by calling (888) 387-2479.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate a year of flying to the United States, Spanair has
a $299 round-trip fare between Dulles and seven Spanish cities,
including Madrid, Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. The round-trip
fare to the Canary Islands is $369. Travel must be completed by
Dec. 14 and other restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Sabena Belgium World Airlines also has a bargain fare: $750 a
couple to Brussels from New York, Newark, N.J., Boston, Chicago or
Atlanta. The price includes round-trip fare, departure taxes and
two nights at the Brussels Hilton International or a similar hotel.
The package is good only over Thanksgiving weekend, Nov. 26-29, and
restrictions apply. In a refreshing break with the airline
tradition of never disclosing the number of seats available to
frequent fliers or in fare sales, Sabena said it was limiting the
number of seats for this promotion to 350, or 50 for each of the
seven flights _ including two flights each from New York and
Atlanta.

242-room Peninsula New York hotel at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street
will reopen on Nov. 1, 10 months after closing for a $45 million
overhaul. Room rates are $535 a night, a junior suite is $800 and
the Peninsula suite is $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Managed by the hotel and marketing arm of the ultra-upscale
Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., the Peninsula, as those rates
suggest, is hardly your ordinary hotel. Amenities include built-in
remote-controlled televisions that can be viewed from the tub;
three telephones in the bathroom, including a hands-free unit at
the tub that automatically mutes the radio and television;
double-glazed windows and a personal fax number for the machine in
a nearby credenza.
</P>
<P>
   There are other specialties of the house, including a control
panel that displays up-to-the-minute temperature and humidity
readings from the hotel's own rooftop weather station.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast Winners
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines has done it again. The November issue of
Conde Nast Traveler rates the airline the best international
carrier for the 10th time in the 11 years the the magazine has
conducted its readers' choice awards. The best U.S. carrier was
Midwest Express, the rare airline that actually leaves a few inches
between passengers' knees and the seat back in front. Other winners
included the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans, voted the best
hotel in the world; Crystal Cruises and Silversea, the best large
cruise line and small cruise line, respectively; Sydney, Australia,
the top foreign city, and San Francisco, the top U.S. city.

   Airline News
</P>
<P>
   Americans who buy the Europe Flight Pass can now add Paris,
Prague, Venice, Vienna and 25 other European cities for $90 a
flight. That is the result of three more airlines joining: Cityjet,
based in Dublin; Alpi Eagles, a regional carrier based in Venice,
and Croatia Airlines of Zagreb. Other airlines in the network
include Icelandair, Virgin Express and Spanair, a Spanish carrier
that for almost a year has been operating nonstop flights between
Washington Dulles International Airport and Madrid. Flight coupons,
sold in packets of three or more, are valid for 120 days. They are
available from travel agents or by calling (888) 387-2479.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate a year of flying to the United States, Spanair has
a $299 round-trip fare between Dulles and seven Spanish cities,
including Madrid, Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. The round-trip
fare to the Canary Islands is $369. Travel must be completed by
Dec. 14 and other restrictions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Sabena Belgium World Airlines also has a bargain fare: $750 a
couple to Brussels from New York, Newark, N.J., Boston, Chicago or
Atlanta. The price includes round-trip fare, departure taxes and
two nights at the Brussels Hilton International or a similar hotel.
The package is good only over Thanksgiving weekend, Nov. 26-29, and
restrictions apply. In a refreshing break with the airline
tradition of never disclosing the number of seats available to
frequent fliers or in fare sales, Sabena said it was limiting the
number of seats for this promotion to 350, or 50 for each of the
seven flights _ including two flights each from New York and
Atlanta.

BASKETBALL ON THE MENU  
 WHITNEY JEWELRY BRINGS HIGH BIDS  
 EXPENSIVE TEDDY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with C.J. Satterwhite

<P>
   The guests were handing the book to the author to autograph.
Squiggle, squiggle and flourish. Squiggle, squiggle and flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Then Michael Reiss, 14, approached. He was carrying not the
book, but a basketball. Bill Bradley autographed that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The party for Bradley's just-published ``Values of the Game''
was at a restaurant with a basketball connection: Michael Jordan's
Steakhouse on the balcony in Grand Central Terminal. And Bradley
was easy to pick out. He was the tallest guy in the crowd _ until
the 6-foot-10-inch Willis Reed arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bradley, a former forward for the Knicks and a former U.S.
Senator, and Reed, a former center, some of the other guests have
the word ``former'' in their titles, whether they made their names
in sports or politics. Red Holzman, the former coach of the Knicks,
was there. So were Geraldine Ferraro, the former representative who
ran for vice president in 1984 and for the Democratic nomination
for the Senate this year, and Sal F. Albanese, the former City
Councilman who ran for mayor last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's publisher, Peter Workman, said something into a
microphone about being a Knicks fan. But Grand Central's
public-address system was louder (``The 6:35 to North White Plains,
track 19'').
</P>
<P>
   Later Bradley wished Workman a happy birthday. How many candles
on his cake?
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I wonder if I'm supposed to say,'' a Workman worker said
later. ``I may be killed for telling you. He's 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Jewelry Brings High Bids
</P>
<P>
   As celebrity auctions go, the sale of the late Betsey Cushing
Whitney's jewelry at Sotheby's on Monday made for a low-voltage
evening, befitting a woman who was herself not given to extravagant
display, even though she had plenty of earrings, necklaces and
rings to show off.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the room was a dealer of one sort or other
(diamond, antiques, etc.) or a Whitney relative of one sort or
other. In the second category were two nieces of Mrs. Whitney's
late husband Jock, Payne Middleton and Sandra Payson. They smiled
when the auctioneer, John Block, declared, ``This is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This was after the bidding on a gold-and-enamel snuffbox had
reached $30,000, $5,000 more than Sotheby's top estimate. It
eventually sold for $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next lot, another snuffbox, must have seemed like more fun:
it sold for $200,000, nearly six times the top estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A platinum cultured-pearl-and-diamond bracelet by Verdura went
for $60,000 to a man on the aisle. When asked for his paddle
number, he called out, ``I don't have one.'' Block said, ``That's
okay. I think we know you.'' The bidder was Ward Landrigan, the
president of Verdura in New York and the former head of Sotheby's
jewelry department.
</P>
<P>
   John and Margo Catsimatidis walked in midway through the
auction. Mrs. Catsimatidis said later that her husband had wanted
to buy her something for their 10th wedding anniversary (``and who
am I to say no to that?'').
</P>
<P>
   But Catsimatidis, the chief executive of the Red Apple Group, a
supermarket chain that includes the Gristede's and Sloan's stores,
left empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't find exactly what he was looking for,'' Mrs.
Catsimatidis said.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive Teddy
</P>
<P>
   The $100,000 teddy bear is headed for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The handmade Gund with fur that ranges from mocha brown to
``warm mahogany'' was auctioned Tuesday at the William Doyle
Galleries. Gund, which said that money from the sale would go to
four children's charities, identified the buyer as Yoshirio
Sekiguchi, the founder of two teddy bear museums in Japan. He
wanted the bear for his third museum, scheduled to open next August
in Hakone.

SOUTH OF THE BORDER, THEY LOVE THE PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mexico)  (mk) 
 By SAMANTHA STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ When Carlos Hernandez crossed the border
Tuesday he brought his family, his barbecue and seven mariachis to
tailgate in the parking lot of Qualcomm Stadium. Having spent
$4,000 on tickets to Game 3 of the World Series Tuesday night,
Hernandez, an electrical engineer in Tijuana, said he didn't have
enough tickets for his wife and father. That's why he brought the
band _ to entertain them in the parking lot during the game.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I like all the Saturdays and Sundays,'' Hernandez said. ``When
I come to be with my team. I am a baseball manager for three Little
League teams and I bring them with me to enjoy the games. We come
on the bus or we drive. On the bus, we pack our lunch. When we
drive, it is expensive for a Mexican to come to the ballgame with
food and parking and beverage.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez participates in the Domingos Padres Tecate program
that the Padres established in 1996. It is a Sunday at the ballpark
for thousands of Mexican fans who pay $11 a ticket to have a bus
ride, a seat at the stadium, and a quick exit through a special
lane at the U.S. Border Inspection Station, one of the busiest
border crossings in the world. Tuesday, Hernandez and thousands of
other Mexican fans came in cars or crossed the border and took the
trolley to the stadium.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Padres estimate that on any game day during the regular
season, 7,000 to 8,000 fans _ roughly 23 percent _ are Hispanic,
either from San Diego or the Mexican states of Baja California or
Sonora. Padres officials use a polling system to come up with a
sampling of the diversity of their fans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, close to 1,000 fans participate in the Domingos
program. More than 2,000 tickets were sold for the World Series
game in the Padres Tienda de Beisbol store in Tijuana. Hundreds of
fans were turned away and a handmade sign indicated that all the
tickets had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have sold easily 10,000,'' said 27-year-old
Walter Manjarrez, the store manager. ``The fans here just want what
the players are wearing and they're willing to buy anything we
have. We can't keep stock of any hat that has ``SD'' on it _
especially the official player hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the World Series, well, the citizens here feel the Padres
are their home club. Tony Gwynn came here to do an autograph
signing and thousands showed up. I sold our last shirts from our
display. And this won't stop until after Christmas, whether they
win or lose. They are Padrisimo _ the coolest team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Morones was the first to convince the Padres' owner,
John Moores, and the club president, Larry Lucchino, that the
biggest untapped market was their neighbor to the south. A million
and a half people live in Tijuana, which is 30 minutes from
downtown San Diego, and is the biggest city in Baja and one of the
biggest in Mexico.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Padres belonged to San Diego,'' said Morones, the
director of Hispanic-multicultural marketing for the Padres. ``They
were the neighbor's team. Now the Padres are Tijuana's team. In a
philosophical sense, John Moores and Larry Lucchino have made a
bridge and eliminated the border. On game days, the border guards
make it a smooth transition for fans to show their documents and
come across. Baseball has no borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jose Osuna Millan is considered the common person's mayor
in Tijuana. He has been a Padre fan since the organization joined
the major leagues and has been known to hand out Padres hats to
city street workers. At his office near the border, Millan, who is
often at the Padres games, said he and his assistants were closing
up the city's business early to attend Game 3. Millan will be in
attendance at Tuesday's game with the governors from Baja
California, south and north.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the el equipo de casa,'' said Millan, who has thrown
out a pitch at a Padres game. ``The team of the house. The Padres
are our passion, they are our team. I love Greg Vaughn and Ken
Caminiti like many of our fans. We have the best economic situation
in Mexico. Even though the peso is weak, Tijuana is healthy. We
have less than 1 percent unemployment. If we had a parade for the
Padres after the Series, more than 100,000 people would line our
streets. More than a politician can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorana Padilla, 31, is a bookmaker at the Caliente Thoroughbred
Club in Tijuana. She came to the World Series with 20 other
bookmakers and spent thousands on tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While she admits to having a crush on Caminiti and spends most
of her time at the game with her eyes glued on third base, Padilla
said the Padres as a team were a big priority with Tijuana
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our home team,'' said Padilla, through a translator.
``It is easy to feel that San Diego is a part of Tijuana. We feel
together. We don't have a major league team in Tijuana, so the
Padres are it for us. We say yes for this team. We say keep the
faith.'' &QL;

WINTER OF DISCONTENT FOR NBA FANS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the owners and the players of the National Basketball
Association try to negotiate how to divide $2 billion worth of
revenue, fans across the country are growing disenchanted. They
view the labor dispute as a battle between rich vs. rich at the
expense of people who buy high-priced tickets and team merchandise
that has made the league flourish for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews throughout the country, people were
certain that the NBA would suffer at the box office when the labor
dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see Patrick Ewing say, `We're fighting for our lives,'
I want to throw up,'' said Craig Savage, a 50-year-old lawyer from
south Florida who owns season tickets for Miami Heat games. ``And
when I see Alonzo Mourning saying, `We're being fair _ there's a
luxury tax on making $18 million or more a year,' I feel ill.
Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, which canceled the first two weeks of the season and is
expected to cancel more games within the next week, plans to take
steps to appease its fans. One is to send season ticket-holders
refunds plus 6 percent interest for lost games. But it may be too
late to avoid a backlash. There are signs that fans, either
incensed or apathetic, are prepared to stay away from the arena,
much as they did after the major league baseball players strike of
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides are ridiculous,'' said Greg Pritz, 28, a financial
planner in Chicago who was interviewed on a street near Michael
Jordan's restaurant. ``They both have enough money, and they ought
to think about the fans a little more. They're the ones who put
them there in the first place. I think they ought to be worried
about a similar backlash that baseball had in 1994, especially with
how popular baseball is now.''
</P>
<P>
   It took one of the most compelling and entertaining seasons in
1998 to thaw the hearts of baseball fans, who turned away from the
sport in massive numbers, causing a 20 percent drop in attendance
in 1995. Even the drama generated this year by Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa's home run race and the Yankees' 114 regular-season
victories, baseball's attendance figures are still lower than they
were before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the resurgence baseball has enjoyed, the NBA's
owners could not have picked a worse time to lock out their
players. A disinterested fan may be worse than an angry one, and
with home runs, pitching duels and pennant races enthralling fans
for the first time in years, many have not paid much attention to
the NBA's labor dispute and are not concerned with missing the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think too many people care much anymore,'' said
Merrill Lamb, the 58-year-old president of a pizza chain in south
Florida. ``I talk to dozens of people a day, and I haven't heard
anybody say about the NBA: `Oh, they're not playing. I'm going to
miss it.' They say, `At least I get some money back.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the World Series ends, the national spotlight will be
directed on college and pro football and the National Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have hockey, football, pro and college, and you've got
baseball deep into October; so where's the void?'' Lamb asked.
``When baseball went out Aug. 12, 1994, there was no hockey, no
football and no basketball going on. I mean, there's nothing worse
than watching an NFL preseason game. So they had no competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some diehard basketball fans said that if the lockout continues
into the new year, they would get their hoops fix by watching
college games.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Gomez, 52, who controls more than a dozen Miami Heat season
tickets for BellSouth, and Thomas Tilson, 48, who has shared Heat
season tickets with a friend since the team's inception in 1988,
both said they would begin following the University of Miami more
closely. And Ron Teel of Lodi, N.J., said it would be April before
he and his three sons began missing the NBA
</P>
<P>
   ``College basketball is right around the corner,'' said Teel,
while watching his son Kevin, 12, participate in a basketball camp
run by Nets Coach John Calipari. ``And when March Madness comes
around, you'll never miss the pros. I wouldn't miss it until after
the college season, not until the playoffs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And some fans could turn to other sports. ``The longer they're
out, the less it will be missed because, then somebody who wouldn't
ordinarily watch a hockey game, might watch one,'' said John
Fiscina, a 43-year-old inventory coordinator from Lodi, N.J. ``I
don't watch hockey at all, but if it's a Wednesday night and
there's nothing else on TV and I'm flipping around, maybe I'll stop
and watch a hockey game, and maybe that will incite some interest
in me. Then I'll become a hockey fan rather than a basketball
fan.''
</P>
<P>
   While major defections among African-Americans, who are among
the game's staunchest supporters, seem unlikely, they do not
represent the majority of those who pay an average of $40 a ticket
to sit and watch games in the NBA's state-of-the-art arenas.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Chaney, an African-American fan from Paramus, N.J., said the
work stoppage in basketball could be more detrimental than the one
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race could be a factor because baseball has a lot of national
support,'' said Chaney, a sales representative for a pharmaceutical
company. ``It's the national pastime and, generally, baseball has
been accepted and embraced by everyone nationally. Basketball, for
the most part, has been a minority-driven sport. Now it's more
widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney said that some of the NBA's players are ``young kids who
it seems haven't had the best morals and do get in some kind of
trouble.'' He added, ``There are many reasons why those things
happen, but I do think that the league has had a black mark because
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While fans believe that a backlash is inevitable, some said the
NBA could lessen the blow by salvaging at least a 45- to 50-game
season, similar to the one the National Hockey League played in its
strike-shortened season of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the big reasons baseball suffered was because
they took away the World Series,'' said Mike Epstein, 35, a
co-owner of Gold's Gym in Paramus, where the Nets stars Jayson
Williams and Keith Van Horn work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey had a shortened season as well, and fans didn't really
hold it against them as much. Whereas in baseball, I think taking
away the World Series was a big mistake. That set the game back. If
basketball loses part of the season, but they still have a decent
season with playoffs and the world championship, I don't think it
will be as bad as it could be.''

L.A. CHARTER PANEL VOTE MAY BOOST VALLEY SECESSION EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Advocates of powerful neighborhood councils were
rethinking their strategy after Los Angeles' elected Charter Reform
Commission voted against creating councils with decision-making
authority over land-use issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, backers of cityhood for the suburban San
Fernando Valley said that if the vote stands, it could give
momentum to the drive for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major defeat short-term,'' said Richard Close, head of
the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association and Valley Voters Organized
Toward Empowerment. ``But it will probably be one of the major
reasons people will support cityhood for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they see that the whole process has been a game and a
ruse, I think even more people will start supporting the Valley
becoming a separate city. Without elected neighborhood councils
with authority, there is no charter reform. It's business as
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The elected charter commission voted late Monday, after hours of
debate, against neighborhood councils that could make land-use
planning decisions. Next week it is set to consider creating
neighborhood councils that are advisory on planning issues but can
make decisions over a small part of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a dead issue now,'' said Commissioner Bennett
Kayser, who sought 35 elected neighborhood councils. ``I think
basically we've made a decision to take the pragmatic view looking
at how the business community will be waging a campaign against it
as opposed to what the people want.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Powers of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San
Fernando Valley said it is unlikely that the 15-member commission
will change its stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood is they won't give decision-making power
because of fears of NIMBYism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's seven-hour meeting, the commission voted twice
to oppose plans that would allow councils to decide land-use
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kayser and Nick Pacheco were joined by Commissioners Janice Hahn
and Marcos Castaneda in supporting the proposal for decision-making
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Community members wanted to have a decision-making role in the
quality-of-life issues that affect their community,'' Castaneda
said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Hahn, ``If we don't give neighborhoods from one end of the
city to the other the ability to shape and craft their own
communities, their own destinies, we will have fueled the anger
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paula Boland said she might be able to support
decision-making power if there are incentives for councils to
approve development, including a share of the new tax revenue from
approved developments.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea drew strong opposition from commission Chairman
Erwin Chemerinsky, who said it would widen the gulf between poor
and affluent communities.
</P>
<P>
   Some commissioners want neighborhood councils with advisory
powers on land use but also five regional planning commissions,
appointed by the mayor and appealable to the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have a commission of five members in the Valley who
would know the Valley,'' said Commissioner Chet Widom.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Rob Glushon of suburban Encino said a strong system
of neighborhood councils is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people would be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by
the council,'' Glushon said. ``This is not neighborhood
empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky and Kayser said elected councils would have more
credibility. But others said elections leave out others who have a
stake in the community but are not residents -- including
noncitizens, business and property owners, and representatives of
nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those commissioners have proposed a ``self-selected'' or
participatory model in which the community would submit a plan for
selecting council members, possibly through a community caucus,
that would make sure most segments of the community are
represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the participatory model, they are inclusive of all the
stakeholders,'' Glushon said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco said citizenship should not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any human being living in the neighborhood could
participate,'' he said. ``No one is going to be checking green
cards. No one is going to check citizenship.''

   Famed gymnast, 17, files lawsuit &QL; 
to be independent of her parents
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RON NISSIMOV &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ In 1996, 14-year-old Dominique Moceanu showed an inner
strength that belied her age by refusing to let a stress fracture
keep her from competing in the Olympics Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But masked beneath her steely eyes, a different kind of stress
was taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of being driven by her parents to be an Olympic
athlete since she was 3 years old finally got to Moceanu this
weekend. On Monday, at age 17, she filed a lawsuit in state
district court in Houston asking to be declared a legal adult so
her parents would not have control over her _ or her money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Moceanu's father, Dumitru Moceanu, has
squandered the money she has earned in her professional career,
which started at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   A judge signed a temporary restraining order Monday, saying her
parents must stay away from Moceanu _ who ran away from her
parents' north Harris County home on Sunday _ until a hearing is
conducted Nov. 11 on her requested adult status. An attorney was
appointed by the court to represent her interests.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Tuesday, Moceanu said the problem is about
much more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a childhood,'' Moceanu said sadly, a change from
the intense confidence she normally projects from her 5-foot frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to compete when I was young, I always was in fear
because I would get yelled at by my father, and I would say to
myself, `I'm 13 years old, come on,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of talking to me, they're always yelling with me,
fighting with me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although such sentiments are probably those of any teen-ager,
she said her life has been far from typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' Moceanu said about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Moceanu said. ``We've been trying to keep things
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her father has hit her ``a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's father, who spent some of Moceanu's earnings opening a
gym last year, declined to comment. Her mother, Camelia Moceanu,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said her parents, who are Romanian immigrants, are very
upset about what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, declined to say how much
money she has made and how much they think has been lost. Her
lawsuit said a trust that had been established for her is all but
gone. Moceanu said her father has made some poor investments with
the money, such as buying property that is polluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she said. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said her parents have refused to answer his client's
questions about where her money has gone. He said all that she
needs to prove to receive adult status is that she is living away
from her parents and can support herself. Once she has the status,
Moore said, Moceanu will be able to demand through legal channels
to see an accounting of her money.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was born in Los Angeles in 1981, and she and her parents
moved to the Houston area in 1990 so she could train with famed
gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has been ``living like a fugitive'' the last couple
of days, moving from house to house to make sure her parents can't
find her.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, the only member of the 1996 U.S. gold medal women's
gymnastics team still competing in all gymnastics events, said
being away from her parents will help her focus on her training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to block it out, but with school and
everything I just didn't want this to affect me any more,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes to compete in the world championship games in
China next year and possibly in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. But
her plans to participate in a competition in Australia in two weeks
may have to be scrapped, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she reached her breaking point Saturday after her
father angrily said he would fire her coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26,
whom Moceanu credits with helping turn her career around. In
August, Moceanu became the first non-Russian to win the all-around
competition in the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said her father brought Miscenco from Romania early this
year so she could teach at his gym, but he became threatened by
Miscenco because she helped Moceanu understand she should be
concerned about her finances, the young gymnast said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moceanu, she told her father Saturday that she
would quit if he fired Miscenco, and he replied, ``Fine, you're
just going to have to quit gymnastics.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said her father threatened to take actions to have Miscenco
deported to Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `We're going to stick together, I'm not going to
let you go,''' Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she has been thinking about taking legal action for
some time. She said during a meet in Plano last summer, retired
gymnast Kurt Thomas told her she should think about where her money
is going. She said she called her mother to discuss the matter, and
her father immediately drove to the north Texas city to bring her
back.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, a senior at the private Northland Christian School,
said she has only had one chaperoned date in her life and has to
hide from her father when she calls friends on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that none of her actions had been motivated by any
relationship with a boyfriend and no one has pressured her, but
that she is doing it all on her own.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has a 9-year-old sister who is also training in
gymnastics, and doesn't want to see her sister have the same
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my parents,'' Moceanu said. ``I hope that after all
this is over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''

BROSIUS EPITOMIZES YANKEES' EMPHASIS ON PLAYING AS A TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ To adopt the sentiments of a banner displayed at
Yankee Stadium over the weekend:
``SupercalifragilisticexpialiBROSIUS!''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' underrated third baseman Scott Brosius sucked the
air out of Qualcomm Stadium with a shocking three-run homer off
Padres closer Trevor Hoffman in the eighth inning last night, and
in the ensuing sounds of silence, you could have heard a friar's
frock drop.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' hope-crushing home run, his second of the game, lifted
the unstoppable Yankees to a 5-4 victory in Game 3 of the 1998
World Series and a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat after me: No team has ever been down three games to none
and come back to win the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen have tried. Nobody's done it.
</P>
<P>
   The poor Padres, like every other team before them, are frozen
in the path of a machine as powerful and inexorable as a locomotive
under full steam. Even when the Yankees do something wrong, which
is rare enough, they find a way to come back and win.
</P>
<P>
   That it was the unassuming, workaholic Brosius, the Yankees'
hottest hitter in the postseason, who would provide the big blows
last night epitomizes a Yankees season marked by team effort.
</P>
<P>
   This is truly a team that is greater than the sum of its parts
and a blueprint for clubs with championship aspirations to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the thing that, as a kid, you dream about,'' Brosius
said. ``I've done it in my backyard a thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a little bigger than that. This was in the World
Series, in front of 64,667 screaming Padres fans. This writes his
name in the history books alongside Ruth and DiMaggio, Mantle and
Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enough of a student \Rof baseball history\S to know that
my name doesn't belong with theirs,'' Brosius said. ``Maybe
somewhere underneath them. I just feel fortunate to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   So, by the way, should the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   With their Southern California cool, their wonderful climate,
their beautiful beaches and their own vaunted pitching staff, the
Padres have been little more than a fish taco _ a San Diego
epicurean staple _ on the Yankees' dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   Tasty. Interesting. But gone way too fast and not very
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the Padres will send out their weary ace, the
always-sick-in-late-October Kevin Brown, on three days' rest in
hopes of stemming the Yankees tide, at least for a night, but they
must now win two in a row just to return the Series to Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the most pleasant of propositions, even if they can
somehow pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   That it was Hoffman who served up the game-losing home run after
the Padres had finally broken through off Yankees starter David
Cone for a 3-0 lead demonstrates the frustration of Padres manager
Bruce Bochy, who has been unable to find a way bridge the gap
between his starting pitchers and his closer.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, he tried to shorten that gap, by bringing in Hoffman
for his first appearance of the Series after Randy Myers walked
leadoff batter Paul O'Neill and the Padres clinging by their
fingernails to a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Great teams _ and this is one _ make pitchers pay for walking
leadoff hitters with a one-run lead, and the Padres paid dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Backed against the wall, Bochy waved in Hoffman, who hadn't
pitched in six days, since closing out Game 6 of the National
League Championship Series against Atlanta. Now Bochy was asking
him to get six outs. The rust showed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 64,667 fans held their breath when Bernie Williams' fly
ball backed Tony Gwynn to the fence in right field. Bochy gulped,
sensing that Hoffman might not have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez walked, moving O'Neill into scoring position and
bringing Brosius to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In a game in which both starting pitchers _ David Cone and
Sterling Hitchcock _ took no-hitters into the fourth, there was no
question that Brosius had been getting the best swings of anyone on
either team all night.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flied out to the warning track in center in the second,
singled sharply to left in the fifth and homered to left center
leading off the seventh, right after the Padres had broken through
for three runs off Cone in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With the tying run at second, all Brosius wanted to do was find
a way to get O'Neill home. He did.
</P>
<P>
   ``A home run is not something you go up there thinking about,''
he said. ``I wasn't trying to do anything in particular. I was just
trying to do my best not to jump out too fast because \RTrevor\S
has a great changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, bouncing his breaking ball and changeup in the dirt,
fell behind 2-1 and then got a pitch a little too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fastball, out over the plate,'' Brosius said, ``and I
got a good swing on it and got it up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres center fielder Steve Finley tracked it to the 405-foot
mark in dead center, then watched helplessly as the ball
disappeared over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   When it left the ballpark, the Padres' last chance to come back
and win this Series vanished, too.
</P>
<P>
   You suppose the Yankees' celebration champagne will go with fish
tacos?

   PASADENA, Calif. _ Los Angeles Galaxy players learned at a team
meeting Tuesday morning that Los Angeles Kings co-owner Philip F.
Anschutz is negotiating to join the Major League Soccer team's
operating group.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy chairman and lead investor-operator Marc Rapaport made
the announcement, acknowledging to players and coaches that rumors
of the team's impending sale had merit.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known whether L.A. Soccer Partners,
headed by Rapaport, is seeking to relinquish ownership of the
Galaxy or if Anschutz is merely interested in investing in the
team. Rapaport and team president Daniel Villanueva were involved
in a five-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon and did not return
numerous telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Rapaport and Villanueva) brought that issue (selling the
team) up today,'' Galaxy captain Dan Calichman said. ``We had heard
rumors of Anschutz thinking of buying the team, but we didn't know
for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if that means Rapaport and Villanueva will be
out, or if they would remain. We just don't know other than
something's going on. Hey, anyone that can come in and bring us a
training facility, instead of practicing in Lot H (of the Rose
Bowl), is OK by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the organization, who asked not to be
identified, said a deal could be finalized in a day to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz, a 58-year-old Denver billionaire, already has a
significant stake in Major League Soccer. He is the lead
investor-operator of the Colorado Rapids and Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Fire defeated the Galaxy, 2-0, in the Western
Conference Finals and will meet the winner of Wednesday's D.C.
United-Columbus Crew match in Sunday's MLS Cup at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Fire defeated the Galaxy, 2-0, in the Western
Conference Finals and will meet the winner of Wednesday's D.C.
United-Columbus Crew match in Sunday's MLS Cup at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of Anschutz' money could pay dividends to the Galaxy.
The team has long coveted a state-of-the-art training facility,
such as the one Anschutz proved for the expansion Fire. The Galaxy
currently practices in Area H, which is used as a parking lot at
the Rose Bowl, or Occidental College, which lacks a locker room
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz and Edward Roski bought the National Hockey League's
Kings in October 1995. Anschutz's Denver-based The Anschutz
Corporation has its main interests in natural resources,
transportation, real estate and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz serves as chairman of the board of Quest Communications
International, vice chairman of the board of Union Pacific
Corporation and is on the boards of Forest Oil Company, the
American Petroleum Institute and the National Petroleum Council.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Lamar Hunt, who heads franchises in Kansas City and
Columbus, Anschutz is the only investor with a stake in more than
one MLS team. If he joins the Galaxy's operating group, he would
become the first to invest in three.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other major professional sports leagues, MLS features a
unique ownership and operating structure -- a confederation of
individual franchise owners. MLS is structured as a single-entity
liability company. As such, each team operator owns a financial
stake in the league, not just their individual team. In addition,
player contracts are owned by the league, rather than by individual
teams.

BABY ABANDONED IN DAD'S SEARCH FOR CRACK BACK WITH MOTHER

   LOS ANGELES -- Eight-month-old Bianca Luna was reunited with her
mother after her father was arrested on suspicion of leaving the
infant with a stranger so he could hunt for drugs, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Francesca Rosales embraced her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy she is back,'' said the 24-year-old suburban
West Covina resident as she bounced Bianca on her lap. ``It is a
really great feeling to have her back. It is something I can't
describe.''
</P>
<P>
   Away from her home for more than a day, it was clear that the
child missed her mother and grandmother after spending a night in
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bianca was really happy. When Bianca saw us she was touching
our faces and pulling our hair,'' said Rosemarie Romero, the
child's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca's father, 27-year-old Ray Luna, was arrested at 3:25 a.m.
Tuesday after officers say they found him driving near Columbus
Avenue and Parthenia Street -- a notorious neighborhood for drugs
-- in suburban North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Luna was arrested on suspicion of child endangering and is
expected to be arraigned today or Thursday in San Fernando
Municipal Court, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to express to everybody, especially his family, how
sorry he is,'' said Detective Cynthia Dragun.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal for Bianca and her mother began Sunday when Luna
dropped off Rosales at work and was supposed to take his daughter
to her grandmother in West Covina. Luna had told Rosales he was
going to make arrangements to get a truck so the couple could move
in with his parents in suburban Sylmar, police said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last Rosales knew of the whereabouts of her child
until late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said Luna drove with the child to North Hills
in a desperate search for drugs. Out of money, the unemployed
27-year-old sold his food stamps and child restraint seats, leaving
his baby daughter unsecured in the back seat, Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna continued cruising the area police refer to as the suburban
San Fernando Valley's drug supermarket, reportedly looking for
money to buy more rock cocaine. ``When he got low, he desired
more,'' Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   He met a stranger at a minimart at about 11 p.m. Sunday and
began talking about drugs, police said. ``They briefly talked and
agreed to go to another location to obtain drug paraphernalia,''
Dragun said.
</P>
<P>
   While Luna drove for about an hour, the baby lay in a blanket in
the back seat, without a child restraint device, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get any money, Luna asked the stranger to care for his
daughter for 15 minutes while he searched for rock cocaine, police
said. When the father did not return after 20 minutes, the stranger
called police, who later turned Bianca over to Child Protective
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs became more important to this individual than the
welfare of his own offspring,'' said Capt. Joe Curreri of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rosales had filed missing-person reports after she
did not find her husband and daughter at her parents' home as
agreed earlier in the day, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She began a frantic search for her child and Mr. Luna,'' said
Detective Gary Barthelmess, who supervises the Devonshire
Division's major assault crimes unit.
</P>
<P>
   After the infant's face appeared on televised newscasts, a
neighbor of Rosales' parents recognized Bianca, police said.
Rosales confirmed with police that the baby is hers.
</P>
<P>
   When Luna was arrested, no drugs were found and he displayed no
obvious signs of being under the influence, Barthelmess said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales and Luna also have a 3-year-old son, who was with Luna's
parents during the ordeal, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Children and Family Services is conducting an
investigation and will hold a dependency hearing later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the facts in this case and we are recommending that
this child be with her mother, (who) is going to live with
Grandma,'' said Schuyler Sprowles, a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   Luna was being held at the Devonshire Division jail in lieu of
$50,000 bail on suspicion of child endangerment. But he also was
being held on no bail because of a nondrug-related parole hold from
a previous prison term, police said without elaborating.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The World Series moved across the country on Tuesday
night, but the owners of the teams playing in it acted as if they
were back on Broadway. Whether by design or coincidence, George
Steinbrenner and John Moores appeared to be performing a play
within a play.
</P>
<P>
   Using dialogue that was scripted or spontaneous, each insulted
the other's ball park, which ordinarily would offend the other. In
this comedy, however, they were actually trying to help each other
get a new park. Getting a new park is in vogue today.
</P>
<P>
   Until Moores spoke out about Yankee Stadium, New York City's
mayor, Rudy Giuliani, had been the only outspoken booster of a new
home for the Yankees. But Moores joined Giuliani on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, George Steinbrenner may have badly understated the
problems,'' Moores said in response to a question about Yankee
Stadium at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Moores had joined Larry Lucchino, the Padres' president, and
Mayor Susan Golding of San Diego at the news conference to talk
about the referendum that will be on the city ballot in two weeks
to provide money for a new park for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Moores might never have offered his comments on Yankee Stadium
had the question not been asked, but it was inevitable that the
matter would be raised because he had trashed the Stadium in
comments that appeared in The San Diego Union-Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after Moores expressed his views, Steinbrenner,
who never appears on the field before a World Series game, suddenly
burst into the Yankees' dugout and instantly made his pitch for a
new park for the Padres. Electioneering two weeks before the vote
can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on with this field?'' he said. ``It looks
terrible. They've got to give these people a new stadium. Or they
ought to move their team. They've done a magnificent job. The city
is behind it. That thing is like a cow pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was referring to the football game that was played
at Qualcomm Stadium on Sunday, the ninth professional and college
football game that has been played on the Padres' field this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give these people a new stadium like they deserve,'' the owner
said. ``John has done everything he could. I know football and I
know bad fields. That field is pretty well chewed up. If they don't
give him a new stadium, they're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was told that Moores had said New York City should
give the Yankees a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice of him; I appreciate it,'' he said. ``John has
done a magnificent job with this team, he and Lucchino, and they
deserve a new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres and the city want voters to authorize the expenditure
of $411 million on a downtown redevelopment project that would
include a $267.5 million ball park. A referendum on a new park for
the Yankees has been in the courts and may never reach the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Giuliani, Moores felt certain that if given the chance,
New York voters would agree to spend taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect anybody who's been to Camden Yards and then goes
back to Yankee Stadium would vote for something like Camden
Yards,'' Moores said after the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the cost? In San Diego, it's $267.5 million. In
New York, specifically Manhattan, which is where Giuliani and
Steinbrenner want it, a new park would cost more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the gross domestic product of San Diego and
compare that to New York's, I don't care what they have to spend on
a ball park there,'' he said. ``They can afford it, one way or
another. My feeling is that most citizens pay their taxes and don't
really expect that much back for it. They're passionate about their
sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   A minute later Moores said: ``It's hard for me to imagine that
the only superpower in the world cannot sustain the greatest
franchise on the planet in an appropriate way. That just doesn't
make a lot of sense. Dirt is expensive in New York. That's part of
the charm. If it weren't so expensive you probably wouldn't want to
build a ball park there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moores visited Yankee Stadium for the first time last week
during the first two games of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of the moist eyes and goose pimples that a tour of the
Yankee Stadium monuments evoked. ``Yankee Stadium is like a
cathedral,'' he said. But he added: ``Once the eyes clear and the
brain starts to work, you look around. Yankee Stadium is not very
adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was shocked and amazed at the myriad problems he
found, including aisles that are too small, an ``awful''
concessions situation, ``real tough'' parking and too many seats
upstairs and too few good seats downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South Bronx is a tough location,'' Moores said. ``I
suspect what ultimately will happen is there will have to be a lot
of redevelopment of the South Bronx to make it a better location or
they're going to have to figure out how to pay the tariff on
Manhattan or watch the thing go to New Jersey. The fans of baseball
are not being well served at Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in Moores' remarks as a subplot was a pitch for himself
and other owners of low-revenue clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era of revenue sharing, I sincerely hope George gets
something done sooner rather than later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a subsequent similar reference, he said: ``My guess is
New York City will get it done. They'll have the kind of ball park
that the city deserves and they'll carry on the Yankee tradition
and I hope there's a lot more Yankee money for revenue sharing.''

STEWART SAYS CLOSER LACKED HIS BEST PITCH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 and 
JOE HAAKENSON 
San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN DIEGO _ San Diego pitching coach Dave Stewart didn't like
the approach closer Trevor Hoffman was taking when he entered
Tuesday's game in the eighth-inning. The reason? Hoffman, who saved
53 games this year, couldn't throw his usually nasty changeup for
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The first batter Hoffman faced was Bernie Williams, who flied to
the wall in right. The second, Tino Martinez, walked. The third,
Scott Brosius, hit a game-winning two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't getting his changeup over, but he kept going to
it,'' said Stewart, who went to the mound just before the home run.
``To be successful, he has to work off his fastball. Everytime he
needed to get ahead, he went to the change and got burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The walk to Martinez was particularly painful to Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys (the Yankees) aren't going to swing at bad
pitches,'' Stewart said. ``They laid off the changeups in the dirt
(Hoffman) was so successful with this season. That is a mark of
their team. They never beat themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Pettitte hopes to clinch: Left-hander Andy Pettitte, bumped
from a scheduled Game 2 start due to recent struggles, is all set
to close out the Series tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will sleep great,'' Pettitte said. ``There is no reason to
have this go another game than we have to. And I want to be the one
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte will be facing the Padres' best in Kevin Brown, who
comes back on three days rest despite the flu. There is no reason
to hold him back.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte returned to the Yankees on Monday after spending a
couple days with his father, who underwent heart-bypass surgery
outside Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte struggled the last six weeks of the regular season,
pitched well in the division series against Texas, then was rocked
in Game 3 against Cleveland in the American League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   That game prompted manager Joe Torre to go with right-hander
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez in Game 2. He allowed one run in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   During his time in Texas, Pettitte threw at his high school. He
also pitched off a mound during Monday's offday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Streaking Rivera: Yankees closer Mariano Rivera allowed
three hits in 12/3 innings but upped his scoreless innings streak
to 12 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre doesn't like to bring in Rivera
to pitch in the eighth inning, but after Quilvio Veras doubled with
one out, Stottlemyre thought it was time even though left-handed
hitting Tony Gwynn was next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually is better on left-handers,'' Stottlemyre said.
``His arm was strong and he was our best option. If we have to use
him tonight, I know he will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; No Bronx cheer: Padres owner John Moores made his first
visit to Yankee Stadium last weekend for Games 1 and 2 and came
away with mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like a cathedral,'' he said. ``I went out and
looked at the monuments and got goose pimples and my eyes got
moist. At the same time, when your eyes clear you look around and
see that Yankee Stadium is not adequate. The aisles are too small,
it's hard to get around, the concessions are just awful. I think
(Yankees owner) George Steinbrenner badly understated the problem.
Unless there's massive redevelopment in the South Bronx, I could
see them relocating in Manhattan or New Jersey. I hope George gets
something done sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Election update: The citizens of San Diego who vote Nov. 3
will decide whether or not to pass Proposition C, which would allow
the Padres to build a downtown ballpark as part of a redevelopment
project in the city. But contrary to widespread belief, the
proposition does not call for the citizens to pay for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no tax increase,'' said Padres president Larry
Lucchino. ``It's being done as a part of the downtown-redevelopment
project. It is a function of the completion of the project. By
transforming downtown San Diego, we create new revenue streams to
help finance the new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Home again: San Diego native Shane Spencer got the start in
left field for the Yankees over Chad Curtis on Tuesday, even though
Curtis was 5 for 12 against Sterling Hitchcock, the Padres' Game 3
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough not to put Chad Curtis in the lineup because he's
done so much for us in the last year and a half,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre said. ``I just felt Shane was more of a power threat.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ This is how the heroes of baseball often come to
October, jumping out from behind a tree or hiding around an
unexpected corner like one of the goblins who haunt the end of the
month at Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know who they are until they sneak up from behind and
tap you on the shoulder and make you jump right out of your skin.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! Scott Brosius!
</P>
<P>
   He came to New York one year removed from the Yankees' most
recent World Series title and just months removed from the worst
year of his life in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He came to them from Oakland, a place that the writer Gertrude
Stein once summed up quite nicely by saying, ``There is no there,
there.'' And he came into a situation with the most famous team in
the game in the toughest town in which to play and knew there would
be no place there for him if he didn't quickly find a way to turn
it all around from the previous season, when he hit just .203.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know exactly what Scott Brosius was all about,''
admitted Yanks manager Joe Torre. ``He came into spring training,
and it was a time when we wanted to find out what was there. Could
he hit home runs? How was his defense?''
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, what has been there is everything. As this
Yankees team that is already being called in some corners the
greatest ever has opened up a commanding 3-0 lead in the World
Series, it has been Brosius, back from the brink himself, who has
boosted them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night inside the rock 'n' roll fantasy land that is
blaring, jumping Qualcomm Stadium, he grabbed the microphone and
belted out the loudest song of them all, belting back-to-back home
runs in the seventh and eighth innings to carry the Yankees to a
5-4 win over San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   So far in this series that is loaded with big-name Yankees
performers like Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez,
it is Brosius who has been the hammer pounding away on the Padres'
anvil.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' 3-for-4 effort in Game 3 raised his World Series
batting average to .538. He is hitting a scorching .418 overall in
the postseason with 14 RBIs. And for a guy who didn't know if he
would even be able to earn a regular place on the team, you wonder
how the Yankees would even manage to get along without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a force,'' Torre said. ``Guys on this team may not
have known a lot about him. But now, they look up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only for the way Brosius has bounced back from his nightmare
season of a year ago, but for doing it while dealing with the
personal burden of knowing that his father, Maury, has been
fighting a battle with colon cancer, the same disease that has
sidelined celebrated teammate Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Through the long, brilliant season of the Yankees, Brosius
rarely talked about the situation at home, and during his rare
slumps at the plate, he never used it as an excuse. Of course,
there wasn't much need for excuses in a year when he rebounded to
hit .300 with 19 home runs and 98 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He played defense at third base with abandon, diving to gobble
up balls and reminding many in New York of former great Graig
Nettles. Jeter went so far as to call Brosius the Yankees' MVP this
season.
</P>
<P>
   And that was all before he got to October and really turned up
the heat. He has been hitting most everything thrown his way. He
launched a three-run homer off Charles Nagy in the third inning of
Game 6 in the ALCS that gave the Yankees a 6-0 lead and sent them
on to the Series. He made spectacular diving stops on the Indians'
Omar Vizquel and Enrique Wilson to preserve that final win.
</P>
<P>
   Now on baseball's biggest stage, Brosius has taken his game to
yet another level. There does not seem to be a member of the
Padres' pitching staff who can get him out.
</P>
<P>
   After their first two losses in New York, the Padres wistfully
talked about how things would be different if their wretched middle
relief pitching could somehow get them to their iron-fisted closer,
Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they got there in Game 3. But not before Brosius blasted a
fastball from Sterling Hitchcock over the center-field wall in the
top of the seventh. That came just moments after San Diego had
taken a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the sixth, and it was another
example of how New York keeps coming at you. The Yankees are
slipperier than eels in a bucket of Jell-O, and no lead is ever
safe. It was only 3-2 when Brosius came back to the plate in the
eighth after Paul O'Neill and Martinez had walked ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he was facing Hoffman, who had entered the game to
the sound of the mission bells ringing and to blaring screams of
AC/DC's Hell's Bells.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the bells tolled for Hoffman, who struggled with
his changeup and eventually delivered Brosius a 2-2 fastball. It
landed 424 feet away, over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Brosius said. ``This is the type of thing that
as a kid you dream about. As a kid in my back yard, I probably did
that 100 times in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was in the World Series and Maury, his father, now
recovering, had made the trip down from Oregon and was in the
stands to see his son take this night by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, when I hit .200, I didn't know what went wrong or
how I did that,'' he said. ``I've told people that I think it might
have been harder to actually hit .200 than to hit .300. Now, the
batting stroke seems to be back. I'm seeing the pitches and making
good swings. It's one of those things; it kind of snowballs.''
</P>
<P>
   A snowball named Scott Brosius who is becoming a part of October
lore.

BOEING SCOURS PRODUCTION LINES FOR POSSIBLE DEFECTIVE PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE
 &HT;     c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Already struggling to meet its year-end production
forecast and turn a profit after last year's financial disaster,
the Boeing Co. is scrambling to find possibly defective parts in
airplanes now in production, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   No planes with suspect parts are in service, the company said.
Officials reached Tuesday night could not say how many planes in
production are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Except for classic model 737s, all Boeing airplanes in
production at Renton and Everett _ including those completed but
not yet delivered to customers _ are being inspected and the
suspect parts replaced when found.
</P>
<P>
   The part in question is called a ``Burndy block'' and serves as
a connection for various electrical wiring. It can be used to
transmit power voltage or as a ground.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Burndy blocks in a Boeing plane varies widely,
depending on the model. A 777, for example, has 380 Burndy blocks.
A 747 has only 10 and a 767 has six. But the next generation 737
has 570 Burndy blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal communications that went to several Everett
managers last week, Kevin Gould a wiring manager, said, ``I think
we have a severe problem with several lots of bad Burndy blocks.
... I am alerting you because I think this could have some
widespread production implications.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview last night, Wolf Glende, Boeing's chief
engineer for 777 systems, said the problem has resulted only in a
production ``disruption.'' Many planes have already been inspected
and the suspect parts replaced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know how many planes must still be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued last night in response to questions about
the parts problem from the Post-Intelligencer, Boeing said no
airplanes with the suspect Burndy blocks have been delivered to any
of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The statement read, in part: ``The Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group has received a formal disclosure of a defective part from an
approved Boeing supplier. ... All suspect parts are contained
within our production system and our investigation to date
indicates no suspect parts have been delivered to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said the company has not
experienced any late deliveries to customers as a result of having
to inspect planes and replace the suspect parts where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that might result in Boeing not being able to meet its
delivery schedule would be a serious setback to the company's
ongoing efforts to fix its production woes and return to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it expects to deliver 550 airplanes this year,
but it has fallen behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It delivered only 123 in the third quarter, about 14 fewer than
most analysts had expected. It delivered 368 planes in the first
nine months, including 137 in the second quarter. It will need to
deliver a record 61 planes a month for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will release its third-quarter earnings tomorrow morning,
and Chairman Phil Condit will give industry analysts and the media
a look behind the numbers at how well Boeing is is doing in meeting
its delivery schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Burndy blocks apparently was discovered
only in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing received a shipment of 18,000 of the blocks from its
sole-source supplier, and some of the parts failed testing in the
wiring shop before they were installed, Glende said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem involved cracking of a conductive plate inside the
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing later decided not to use any of the parts from the
suspect lot, but some had already been installed on planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of those 18,000, all have been quarantined,'' Glende said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Boeing is that it does not know which planes got
parts from the suspect shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to inspect every plane to make sure parts from that
shipment were removed,'' Glende said. The first to be inspected, he
said, were those already out the factory door and undergoing flight
testing.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated it takes about about five hours to inspect a 777
with its 380 Burndy blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspection process has gone well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact so far is not that great. ... The key thing is that
each plane is scheduled to be inspected. We are going to inspect
every plane and pull out the parts.''

PADRES' BEST IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ To the San Diego Union-Tribune religion writer who
proposed that baseball and the Padres' success have ``saved us''
from the plagues of White House scandal and Wall Street collapse
and ``the horrors of genocide abroad'':
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but doomsday dawns at 5:20 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   To the storekeeper who was already advertising half-price Padres
merchandise Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   It's no time to get greedy.
</P>
<P>
   To Padres fans who waited 14 years for this:
</P>
<P>
   Hey, 2012 really isn't that far away to an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, did somebody really write that the Padres had a chance
to win the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   He must have assumed a lot of things would go right.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is, Tuesday night EVERYTHING went right for the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   They got the pitchers' duel they wanted, the kind of game they
thought would favor them.
</P>
<P>
   They got the breaks that eluded them in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They got the ball to Trevor Hoffman with the lead in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are too good. They won 5-4 after Hoffman, the major
leagues' saves leader in the regular season, gave up Scott Brosius'
second home run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Padres are down 3-0 in the series. Wait 'till next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Devastating? somebody asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game,'' manager Bruce Bochy said, ``reaches in and grabs
your guts out.''
</P>
<P>
   This game was just what the Padres were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Not a slugfest like the 9-6 and 9-3 losses in New York. They
knew they couldn't hang with the Yankees in games like that.
</P>
<P>
   They believed they could win if one of their starting pitchers
could match one of the Yankees' starting pitchers long enough to
keep the ball out of the shaky hands of the Padres' middle
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really been our starters,'' general manager Kevin
Towers had been saying near the batting cage, talking about the
defeats in New York. ``It's been the middle relief, the sixth,
seventh, eighth innings.''
</P>
<P>
   They turned to Sterling Hitchcock, who'd beaten Cy Young Award
winners Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in the National
League playoffs, and asked him to beat Cy Young Award winner David
Cone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He did his part.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock delivered the game's first pitch at 5:22 amid the last
shafts of 72-degree sunlight. He needed barely 40 more minutes to
put himself in the upper echelon of Padres World Series pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   When he completed his third inning, having faced just nine
Yankees, Hitchcock had already done more than five of the seven
Padres to start World Series games before him, dating back to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock held the Yankees to a pair of singles through five
innings and stopped them with the bases loaded in the sixth,
battling just the way he'd learned by watching Cone when both were
Yankees a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was scoreless until the sixth, when the Padres made it 3-0
thanks to a Hitchcock base hit and a Yankees fundamental lapse.
</P>
<P>
   A hit by the pitcher. A Yankees blunder. Was everything going
San Diego's way or what?
</P>
<P>
   Count the breaks:
</P>
<P>
   __ Center fielder Steve Finley bobbles but catches Chuck
Knoblauch's leadoff blooper in the first inning _ catches it in his
lap while on his back.
</P>
<P>
   __ Yankee Paul O'Neill's hard one-hopper goes for a double play
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brosius' first swing of the game sends Finley to the
center-field wall in the second inning. Three more feet and it's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shortstop Chris Gomez is breaking to cover second base with
two Yankees runners going in the seventh, and Derek Jeter's
hit-and-run line drive goes right to him, causing Homer Bush to be
doubled off.
</P>
<P>
   This sure was different than New York, where an umpire missed a
strike call and the next pitch went for Tino Martinez's Game
1-breaking grand slam, where a Wally Joyner drive fell 18 inches
short of giving the Padres a 3-0 lead in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   This was one the Padres had to win and should have won.
</P>
<P>
   They had their fans, 64,667 of them, on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fans got what they came to hear, AC/DC's ``Hell's Bells,''
Hoffman's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   He came in with O'Neill on first, representing the tying run,
and none out in the eighth. An out later, struggling with his
changeup, he walked Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one to Brosius, he bounced a slider, a pitch Hoffman
later called the pivotal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put him in a hitter's count,'' said Hoffman, calmly
facing questions at his locker 15 minutes after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Boom: Fastball up, and Brosius clears the 405-foot sign in dead
center, heavy night air and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was (just) a fly ball, to be honest with you,''
said Tony Gwynn, who watched from right field. ``You just don't see
too many guys go out to center field (at Qualcomm Stadium).''
</P>
<P>
   The world needs a new savior.

BROSIUS, YANKEES PUT PADRES IN DEEP HOLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ ``Hell's Bells''?
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Brosius and the New York Yankees, San Diego's
head-banging paean to closer Trevor Hoffman wound up sounding like
``Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   And after Brosius's crushing three-run homer off the San Diego
reliever in the eighth inning Tuesday night lifted the Yankees to a
5-4 win over the Padres _ and a 3-0 lead in the 94th World Series _
there was only one tune left to play before they turn out the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same one that's been on top of the charts since April,
an oldie but goodie. Some might even call this year's version the
best rendition of a classic ever.
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the news ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't seen them in person, only on TV, but once you see
them firsthand, you see,'' said Tony Gwynn, the 38-year-old prince
of Padres, who may be watching his last, best chance at playing for
a World Series winner disappear in a pinstriped haze. ``Man,
they've got a great ball club. You can understand why they've won
so many games this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have lost just twice in a dozen postseason
games, all but assured themselves of their 24th World Series title
by maintaining a champion's composure in a crucible of
knee-buckling intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Stoked by the cheers of 64,667 fans in Qualcomm Stadium urging
them to stave off extinction in the best-of-seven series, the
Padres seized a 3-0 lead in the sixth against Yankee starter David
Cone, who had a no-hitter through five until opposite number
Sterling Hitchcock singled after pitching out of a bases-loaded jam
in the top of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were no-hit for five innings, finally put a hit up on the
board, and get three runs,'' Gwynn said. ``It was ugly, but we'll
take it. But it still wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius led off the seventh against Hitchcock with a home run,
and the Yankees added another run on Shane Spencer's double, a
passed ball by Jim Leyritz, and third baseman Ken Caminiti's second
killing error in two games, making it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   When the third San Diego pitcher, Randy Myers, walked Paul
O'Neill to open the eighth, the Padres went to Hoffman, who had 53
saves in the regular season and a win and three saves in the
postseason. Hoffman had been Tom Gordon, West Coast version, but
just like the Red Sox closer, he lost his aura of perfection when
the stakes were highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the World Series. This isn't a good situation to come
out on the short end of the stick,'' said Hoffman, who several
times bounced his changeup, his best pitch, but refused to blame a
six-day layoff for his blowup. ``I could have saved this game and
tomorrow you all would be asking better questions.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bernie Williams flied to the warning track in right,
Hoffman walked Tino Martinez before Brosius hit a 3-and-2 fastball
over the 405-foot sign in center, his second home run of the game
and fourth of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shock?'' Gwynn said. ``It's never a shock. Anything can
happen in this game, and I've seen a lot of it firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep saying, `It can't happen,' but you see tonight. I've
said before there are no guarantees in this game. As good as
Hoffman has been, and he's been unbelievable, you see what can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brosius had an unbelievable at-bat. That was a great piece of
hitting, and he hit a good pitch. And all you can do is tip your
cap to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Gwynn did. He took off the cap he was
wearing backward, tipped it to the absent Brosius, and put it back
on, bill forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is batting .395 (17 for 43) with a team-leading 14 RBIs
in the postseason. That kind of performance, someone mentioned to
Brosius, puts him in the company of the Ruths and DiMaggios. Was he
enough of a student of history to realize that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enough of a student to know my name doesn't go there,'' he
said. ``It goes somewhere under there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Brosius sucked the air out of Mission Valley, the
Padres did not go gently into the night. With one out in the
eighth, Quilvio Veras doubled off Ramiro Mendoza, prompting Yankees
manager Joe Torre to go to his closer, Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, whose single _ plus a subsequent throwing error by
outfielder Paul O'Neill _ had fueled the Padres' three-run rally in
the sixth, blooped a hit to left that sent Veras to third, and Greg
Vaughn hit a drive to right that was caught by O'Neill but was deep
enough to score Veras.
</P>
<P>
   Singles by Carlos Hernandez and pinch hitter Mark Sweeney with
two outs in the ninth gave them a final chance. But Andy Sheets,
who had entered in the seventh inning as part of a double switch,
struck out to end it. John Vander Wal, the Padres' best pinch
hitter, had been used the inning before as a pinch runner for
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``This game
reaches in and grabs your guts out. When you lose games like this,
sure, it's tough to take. But it's the hard part of this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is great, but losing, especially in the World Series,
it's tough. And now our backs are to the wall, we know that. The
only thing we can do is go and play our hearts out.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The day before the playoffs began, David Cone was
asked to pick one Yankee who might shine in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, Cone replied, adding, ``He's got that glint in
his eye.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he does. Brosius, who hit a home run in Game 1 last
Saturday night, slugged two more home runs in Game 3 of the World
Series on Tuesday night, including a three-run shot in the eighth
inning that gave the Yankees a 5-4 victory over San Diego in the
first Series game here in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The homer also gave the Yankees a commanding lead of three games
to none in the four-of-seven-game series. No team has ever come
back from that deficit to win the final four games of a World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Andy Pettitte will try to finish the Padres off on
Wednesday night, pitching against San Diego's ace, Kevin Brown, in
an effort to nail down the Yankees' 25th World Series title and
second in three seasons. A victory would give the Yankees 125 in
the regular season and post-season, more than any team has ever
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of thing that you've dreamt about as a kid,''
Brosius said. ``I've done this in my backyard a hundred times.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first time in the World Series, with 64,667
fans screaming at him, hoping he would fail, hoping the Padres
would hang on to to a 3-2 lead in the eighth inning and give them a
chance to even the Series in Game 4 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had been fighting uphill all night, it seemed. Cone
started and had not allowed a hit in the first five innings, but he
acknowledged later that he had been laboring. Cone managed to find
a way, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings on Tuesday night, Cone would throw his first
warm-up tosses lightly, stiffly, like a 10-year-old trying to throw
a snowball while wearing three sweaters and a parka in the winter.
With the long commercial delays between innings, most pitchers
throw 12 to 15 warm-ups. Cone rarely threw one or two more warm-ups
beyond the typical allotment of eight.
</P>
<P>
   His stuff seemed quite ordinary, his first fastballs clocked at
87-88 miles an hour, and Cone seemed unable to command his
fastballs consistently; he threw only 53 percent of his pitches for
strikes. After Tony Gwynn's first at-bat, in which he lined out to
left field, he returned to the dugout and told the Padres' hitting
coach, Merv Rettenmund, that Cone did not have a good fastball, and
Rettenmund agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In a scoreless game, Cone led off the Yankees' sixth with his
third hit in eight career at-bats in the World Series, and the
Yankees eventually had the bases loaded and one out against
Sterling Hitchcock. But Bernie Williams struck out and Tino
Martinez popped out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After having spent a half-inning running the bases, Cone allowed
a leadoff single to Hitchcock _ turnabout _ and a walk to Quilvio
Veras, ``the key to the inning,'' Cone would say later. Gwynn
pulled a single through the right side, and when the inning was
over, San Diego led, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But Brosius led off the Yankee seventh with a home run, spurring
a two-run rally that had the Yankees trailing by 3-2 in the eighth
inning, with San Diego intent on delivering a lead into the hands
of its dominating closer, Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   With the left-handed-hitting Paul O'Neill leading off the eighth
for the Yankees, Padres Manager Bruce Bochy elected to start the
inning with left-hander Randy Myers on the mound. Myers walked
O'Neill, putting the tying run on base, and Bochy then called for
Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 save opportunities and had allowed
only two home runs during the regular season. The Qualcomm Stadium
crowd roared, the loudest that Yankees Manager Joe Torre said he
had ever heard from a crowd, anywhere, any time.
</P>
<P>
   But it was apparent immediately that Hoffman, who had not thrown
in a game in six days, was pitching at less than his best.
Typically, Hoffman throws a fastball at 92-94 mph. His first
fastball to Bernie Williams on Tuesday night was clocked at 88 mph,
and Williams drove a pitch to the base of the wall in right field,
where it was caught, a 355-foot out.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams returned to the dugout, he mentioned to teammates
he was out in front of Hoffman's fastball, and word was passed down
the line. With Martinez batting, Hoffman began pitching passively,
throwing his slider and his change-up, and Martinez also drew a
walk. Dave Stewart, San Diego's pitching coach, went to the mound.
From the stands, Yankee scouts noticed that Hoffman wasn't throwing
his change-up for strikes, as he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was the next batter, having already got another late
briefing from the hitting coach Chris Chambliss: His change-up is
his best pitch, Chambliss reminded Brosius. Change-up, fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius couldn't remember for sure, but he thought he had faced
Hoffman in this year's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   His arm packed in ice, Cone stood in the middle of the visitors'
clubhouse in the eighth inning and watched Brosius bat on
television Tuesday night, like the rest of the world. Two runners
on base, the Yankees down a run.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius tried checking his swing unsuccessfully on the first
pitch, a ball in the dirt, then took two more off-speed pitches for
balls; later, Hoffman would lament the fact that he had thrown a
slider out of the strike zone and fallen behind in the count.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman threw a fastball, 89 mph, and Brosius fouled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman came back at him with another fastball, 91 mph. Brosius
swung, and on the television screen Cone watched, the ball soared
directly toward the lens. Oh, my, Cone said he was thinking, _ is
that going to make it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' players leaped off their bench, to follow the
ball's flight. Go, go, some yelled, as San Diego center fielder
Steve Finley ran back to the wall, Hoffman staring at the numbers
on the back of his jersey. When the ball carried over the fence,
Brosius thrust both arms into air halfway between first and second,
and some Yankees bounced happily and high-fived.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego scored a run in the bottom of the eighth, shaving the
lead to 5-4, and back-to-back singles gave them two out and two on
in the ninth inning, with the tying run at third, potential winning
run at first.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariano Rivera blew a high fastball past the swinging Andy
Sheets to end the game on a strikeout, and the Yankees burst from
their dugout once more, rushing to hug Rivera, and Brosius, with
the glint in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and twenty-four down. One to go. &QL;

BROSIUS UNLIKELY HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The 64,667 fans sat in their seats like children who
had just been scolded.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Sad.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Excited and loud throughout most of Game 3 of the World Series
between the San Diego Padres and New York Yankees, the fans at
Qualcomm Stadium slumped to their seats in stunned disbelief after
Scott Brosius belted a three-run homer off Padres closer Trevor
Hoffman in the eighth inning to lift the Yankees to a 5-4 win and
three-games-to-none Series lead.
</P>
<P>
   No team in major league history has lost a seven-game series
after leading 3-0. Game 4 is tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius both started and finished the Yankees' comeback from a
3-0 deficit, homering off Padres starter Sterling Hitchcock to lead
off the seventh inning, then smacking Hoffman's 2-2 pitch over the
center-field wall with two baserunners aboard with one out in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius was asked after the game what it will be like having his
name alongside such Yankee greats as Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enough of a student of the game to know that my name
really doesn't go there,'' Brosius said with a smile. ``It's kind
of underneath somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to do anything particular,'' Brosius said of
his at-bat. ``Just get something to hit and see it for a long time
because I know how good his changeup is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius got a good look at a fastball that Hoffman left up in
the strikezone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He crushed that ball,'' Yankees teammate Chili Davis said.
``You can hit home runs down the line in this place, but to hit it
to straight-away center, you've got to get all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Brosius was the hero Tuesday typifies the Yankees
season. He had 98 RBI during the regular season, hitting mostly in
the eighth spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back to the old Celtics, and you thought about all
those guys averaging 16, 18, 19 points a game, and they'd always
win as a team,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``But this
ballclub, they're going to take MVP votes away from each other.
They don't care who gets the winning hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was stoic after the game and made no excuses. He said he
felt good. When told Brosius recalled facing him in the All-Star
game this season, Hoffman shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struck him out on a curveball,'' he said. ``I guess he got
his revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 3-0 lead against Yankees starter David Cone (6
innings, 3 runs, 2 earned, 2 hits) in the sixth after Cone had
pitched five hitless innings. But the Yankees responded in the top
of the seventh with two runs and trailed, 3-2, heading into the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Hamilton had relieved Hitchcock (6-plus innings, 2 runs, 1
earned, seven hits) and handed the ball over to Randy Myers to
start the eighth. Myers walked Paul O'Neill, prompting Padres
manager Bruce Bochy to summon Hoffman, who had not made an
appearance in the first two games of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams flied out to right, but Hoffman walked Tino
Martinez, setting the stage for Brosius, whose homer made it 5-3.
Hoffman, who saved 53 of 54 chances during the regular season, has
now blown two save opportunities in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say he did a good job with the pitch he got,''
Hoffman said. ``I won't say he hit my best pitch. I would have
liked to put it in a different spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got to within 5-4 in the bottom of the eighth after
Quilvio Veras doubled and later scored on a sacrifice fly by Greg
Vaughn. In the ninth, the Padres got two-out singles by Carlos
Hernandez and Mark Sweeney. But with the tying run on third base,
Andy Sheets struck out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down three games,'' Bochy said. ``The odds are against
us, and there's not much else to say but go out there and play your
hearts out. This club will do it.'' &QL;

CASE ALMOST CLOSED AFTER HOFFMAN BLOWS SAVE

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ He spoke with his head held high. But the pain
raging inside San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman was obvious. He blew
the big one, and there is nobody to blame but himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was reminiscent of the Red Sox' Tom Gordon, who suffered a
similar fate in the American League Division Series. With San Diego
holding a 3-2 lead in the eighth inning Tuesday night, Hoffman
surrendered a three-run homer to the Yankees' Scott Brosius that
sent the Padres down to defeat, 5-4, and left them on the verge of
being swept in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pitch that you live and die with,'' said Hoffman of his
high fastball. ``It's gotten me a long way. So I'm not going to
overanalyze what happened. We played good baseball in Game 1 and we
played good baseball tonight. Once again, the bullpen just let the
team down. It was my turn tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother of former Red Sox shortstop Glenn Hoffman
had hoped to escape the curse that seems to follow anyone remotely
connected to Boston. He hadn't been needed in Games 1 or 2, which
the Padres lost, 9-6 and 9-3. He hadn't worked for six days but
took the ball from manager Bruce Bochy in the eighth inning
convinced that the layoff wouldn't make a difference. He had blown
only one save in 54 opportunities this season. All he had to do was
get six outs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he did.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and a runner on first, he walked Tino Martinez. At
that point, he had a conversation with pitching coach Dave Stewart,
who had a simple message for him: Your changeup isn't working
because the Yankees are patient. Be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a fastball over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   New ball, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was a home run at first,'' said Hoffman.
``But it had that certain crack off the bat. He hit it well. The
pitch was up in the zone. And he drove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say it was a bad pitch or a
mistake. He did a good job of hitting in that situation. He made
something happen. I would have liked to have it down and away more,
but it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Hoffman stood his ground while wave after wave of
reporters asked essentially the same questions. His answers were
consistent, as were those of Bochy, who chided those who suggested
he panicked by bringing Hoffman in an inning early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a case of too much rest,'' said Hoffman. ``I warmed
up plenty in the bullpen. I used my changeup, but it wasn't very
good tonight. Unfortunately, it was Game 3 of the World Series, and
people will remember this for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hang my head. It takes a lot of work to get
in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said he wanted to use lefthander Randy Myers against the
two lefthanders who were coming up _ Paul O'Neill and Martinez. But
a walk by O'Neill forced his hand. The call went for Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone this long without pitching before,'' said Bochy.
``We'd talked before and he said he'd rather come in to pitch in
his regular situation. Afterward, it was obvious that he didn't
have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's only human. But in a game like this, you had to win. This
was a huge game for us, and it just got away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said a quick visit to the mound does not guarantee that
the pitcher will make the necessary correction. Hoffman did try to
be aggressive, but his location was off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes with relief pitching,'' said Stewart. ``The Yankees
are a team of patient hitters. The thing that hurt us as much as
the home run was the walk by Myers. That's what made us bring in
Hoffman when we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean we've lost confidence in the bullpen? On the
contrary. I still have confidence in the guys who brought us to the
dance. We've got one dance left. We can't worry about coming back
from three down. We've got to worry about winning one game.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Padres are not quite done, but they're a
little brown on both sides, and it has nothing to do with the sun.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees poured rain on San Diego's biggest baseball
day in 14 years, and one particular raindrop kept falling on their
heads. There was plenty of thunder in Scott Brosius' bat, not to
mention the lightning bolt that struck down the Padres in the
eighth inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius' second homer of the game _ a three-run blast to center
field off Trevor Hoffman _ propelled the Yankees to a 5-4
come-from-behind win over the Padres before a stunned crowd of
64,667 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of thing you dream about as a kid,'' Brosius
said. ``That's something I've done a hundred times in my back yard.
You never know if you're going to get the opportunity to do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees increased their lead to 3-0 in the best-of-seven
series and can wrap up their second World Series title in three
years tonight. There hasn't been a sweep in the World Series since
Cincinnati beat Oakland in 1990. Andy Pettitte will start for the
Yankees; the Padres plan to pitch ace Kevin Brown on three days'
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win now,'' Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said.
``There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. Our backs are against
the wall, and all of you guys (the media) are writing us off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an explanation for why we haven't been
able to win a game other than the Yankees have just outexecuted us.
If (Yankees manager) Joe Torre had made a list of all the things he
wanted to see his team do before the World Series started, they
would be doing everything on that list. Those guys have done
everything they've needed to do to win these three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who is hitting .538 in the World Series, was 3-for-4
and drove in four of the Yankees' runs. Mariano Rivera pitched the
final 1 innings for his second save of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Sterling Hitchcock held his ground against a mound
opponent with Cy Young credentials. He locked up with David Cone
and left with a lead in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock's gritty effort wasn't enough to get his team a
win. The Padres had been waiting for a chance to use Hoffman, who
hadn't pitched in six days. But this was hardly the way they
imagined his first World Series appearance would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has converted 80 of his past 82 regular-season save
chances. But Tuesday, he was no more productive than any of his
relief mates have been in the Series. The Padres' bullpen, which
posted a 3.49 ERA during the regular season, has allowed 10 earned
runs in 11 innings in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to get outs, and I didn't do it,'' Hoffman said. ``I
didn't get the pitch (to Brosius) where I wanted it, and it cost us
the game. I didn't do my job. But give Brosius credit _ he put the
bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who singled to lead off the sixth, got a hit before any
Padre did. Chuck Knoblauch moved Cone to second with a bunt single
before Hitchcock struck out Derek Jeter for the first out of the
inning. Paul O'Neill singled up the middle, but third-base coach
Willie Randolph held Cone at third. Hitchcock struck out Bernie
Williams and got Tino Martinez to pop out to second to end the
Yankees' first scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real gutsy job of pitching by Hitchcock,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``He's done a good job for us throughout
the postseason, and he pitched another good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock broke up Cone's no-hit bid with a leadoff single in
the bottom of the sixth. After Cone walked Quilvio Veras, Gwynn
singled through the right side of the infield, scoring Hitchcock
from second. O'Neill's errant throw from right field cut across the
infield and into the Yankees' dugout, allowing Veras to score and
Gwynn to take third. Gwynn scored on Ken Caminiti's sacrifice fly
to the warning track in center field to give the Padres a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a dominating performance for me,'' Cone said. ``I
just made enough good pitches at the right time to get through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all the running took a toll on Hitchcock, who served up
a leadoff homer to Brosius in the seventh. Shane Spencer followed
with a double, prompting Bochy to motion Joey Hamilton in from the
bullpen. Spencer moved to third on a passed ball and scored when
pinch hitter Chili Davis' grounder to third rolled under Caminiti's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and runners on first and third, the inning looked
promising for the Yankees. But Padres shortstop Chris Gomez made a
fantastic leaping catch on a line drive by Jeter and flipped to
second base for an easy double play.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanded reliever Randy Myers opened the eighth inning for the
Padres and walked O'Neill before Hoffman entered. Williams flied
out and Martinez walked to set the stage for the biggest hit of
Brosius' career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like that all season long,'' Jeter said. ``If we've
got a runner on base, he (Brosius) is a tough guy to get out. He
gets big hits all the time. We have a very resilient team. We don't
think we've lost until we've made our 27th out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres pulled to within a run on Greg Vaughn's sacrifice fly
in the eighth, and they had runners on the corners in the final
inning, but Rivera struck out Andy Sheets to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game reaches in and grabs your guts out,'' Bochy said.
``Winning is great, but losing _ especially in the World Series _
is tough. The only thing we can do is play our hearts out
(tonight), and I know this team will do that.''

CONE'S NO-DECISION READS LIKE A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Yankees are one win away from immortality but
their 5-4 victory Tuesday over the Padres in Game 3 of the World
Series came with some regrets.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, whose pluck embodies the personality of the team,
pitched five no-hit innings and the thanks he got was very nearly a
loss. It took two home runs from Scott Brosius in the seventh and
eighth innings to restore the color to Cone's masterful
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame we didn't score (Cone) some runs while he
was no-hitting them,'' said second baseman Chuck Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees looked like they were going to break the game wide
open in the top of the sixth when Cone managed a leadoff single off
starter Sterling Hitchcock, Knoblauch bunted his way on and Paul
O'Neill loaded the bases with a single to set the stage for cleanup
hitter Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had hit a two-run homer in Game 2 but he struck out on
three pitches and Tino Martinez popped up to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had suffocated the Padres' bats for five innings,
smothering them with his slider, a necessity since he no longer can
scare anybody with his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   You can't spell confidence without C-O-N-E and on this night it
was clear why Joe Torre puts so much faith in his veteran pitcher.
On a night when he didn't feel in total command, Cone kept the
Yankees in the game with grit and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made just enough good pitches at the right time to get
through the first five innings,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the bottom line was this: not since Atlanta's Tom
Glavine in 1995 had a starter zip-locked a World Series opponent
for so long. San Diego didn't collect its first hit until Hitchcock
slapped Cone's 70th pitch, a fastball, into center to lead off the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   As if losing a no-hitter to a non-hitter wasn't lousy enough _
on Monday Hitchcock had admitted, ``I couldn't hit Little League
pitching (and) I still stink'' _ Cone walked the next batter,
Quilvio Veras, on a 3-2 change-up.
</P>
<P>
   Up to the plate stepped Tony Gwynn, and as crafty as Cone is he
couldn't outwit the game's best hitter. He threw what he thought
was a solid splitter and Gwynn sent it into the gap in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gwynn) did a great job of putting his bat on that ball,''
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill ran the ball down and then inexplicably threw it like it
was a bowling ball and first baseman Martinez and Knoblauch were
the 7 and 10 pins. It was only the fifth error of the postseason
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of airmailed it,'' Martinez charitably said of
O'Neill's effort, which stood in sharp contrast to the sparkling
catch he had made at Yankee Stadium in Game 2 to rob the Padres of
at least two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was backing up home plate on the play, which left him
perfectly positioned to watch Hitchcock and Veras score.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti then drove Gwynn in with a shot that Williams
flagged down at the warning track and just like that, Cone's
masterpiece was ruined, the Padres staking him to three runs, two
of them earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sixth inning was a huge turning point,'' said Cone, who
was in the clubhouse icing his shoulder by the bottom of the
seventh, his night done after throwing 88 pitches and walking three
and striking out four. ``Hitchcock did a great job of pitching out
of a jam and I went up there and gave up three runs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was silly for him to shoulder the full responsibility for the
Yankees' sorry sixth. The fact that he did without a hint of
hesitation speaks to why these Yankees have won 124 games. It shows
what a team can achieve when everyone shares the credit and hordes
the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballclub, they're going to take MVP votes away from each
other,'' Torre said. ``It's a great feeling for a manager to know
when these guys come to the field the only thing they're interested
in is winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, as Cone acknowledged, they're ``on the brink of
something really special.''

   SAN DIEGO _ As a team partial to palm trees and a warm breeze,
the Padres' take on the first two games of the World Series was
that New York was a mean, icky place.
</P>
<P>
   Not a scoop, really. But the excuse is a lot easier to deal with
than the aggravating reality of the greatness of the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Like a bunch of California tourists trembling in their first
visit to the Bad Apple, the Padres wrote off the pair of weekend
losses as a freakish scene awkward to the uninitiated and unlikely
to be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about going home and playing in front of the home
folks,'' said Padres All-Star Tony Gwynn before the game. ``I can't
remember being called so many different names out in right field.''
</P>
<P>
   Added teammate Ken Caminiti: ``It's definitely a hard crowd. It
will be kind of nice to get away from, `Caminiti, you suck,' every
few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rude, yes. But it is hard to fault the accuracy of the New York
fans regarding Caminiti, the Padres' cleanup hitter who in Game 3
Tuesday night delivered only a sacrifice fly and made two errors.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Gwynn's claim of virtue in playing in front of the
home folks, well, the song lyrics don't say, ``If I can make it in
San Diego, I can make it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres aren't making it, here or in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who would against these Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   At least the Padres made it close. If you could have heard the
sound that 64,667 fans at Qualcomm Stadium made with their their
hands over their mouths, you would know how much being close was
worth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks' 5-4 victory in Game 3 was as close as the series 3-0
gap is wide. Just to prove that they can win in ways no team can
scout for, the lineup's lowest-profile guy, veteran third baseman
Scott Brosius, the pride of Oregon's Linfield College, came up
Ruthian.
</P>
<P>
   His two home runs, four RBIs and .538 Series batting average are
merely the latest bits of evidence that the Yankees are a complete
team of quality players that doesn't require a massive, Reggie
Jackson-sized ego to stir their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to get the winning hit, but they don't really
want to talk about it,'' said Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``In all my
years in baseball, it's a very unusual club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back to the old Celtics, you go though about all those
guys averaging 16, 18, 19 points a game, and they'd always win
games as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The pre-game contention was that if the Padres could just get
some quality innings from a starting pitcher, matters would turn.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock provided, going six shutout innings to slow a
team that had scored nine runs in each of its last three playoff
games. He was the first left-hander the Yankees had faced in the
postseason, and every bit the stud he was in earlier playoff
matchups against Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Once called a ``fat boy'' by his first baseball boss, Yankee
owner George Steinbrenner, Hitchcock had the privilege of letting
his play say, ``Eat this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Mariner-turned-good even had the audacity to break up the
no-hitter of his counterpart, David Cone, with a sixth-inning
single, offering one of the most articulate arguments against the
designated-hitter rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's primary task was to get a lead to Trevor Hoffman,
saver of 53 of 54 regular-season chances and perhaps the National
League's premier pitcher this season. Deed done, even if Hitchcock
did surrender Brosius' first home run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Padres' most formidable strength that came
up weak. Against his third batter in the eighth, Hoffman was first
in the dirt against Brosius, then fat over the middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent three-run homer and 5-3 lead can't be blamed on
the flu, or bellicose fans, or Yankee history or any of the other
pre-Halloween goblins the Padres have offered up to explain how
their otherwise magnificent season has been stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of creating at least a hotfoot for the Yankees, one
swing relegated the Padres to a mere footnote in one of the great
single-season achievements in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of thing that as a kid you dream about,''
Brosius said after he fried the Friars. ``It's something I've done
in my backyard a hundred times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know if you're going to get the opportunity to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one in the baseball universe would have envisioned
Brosius as even having an opportunity, much less exploiting it. He
hit .203 last year for the wretched Oakland A's, yet the Yankees
offered up for him lefty pitcher Kenny Rogers and cash last
December.
</P>
<P>
   As a team whose success is frequently ascribed to unlimited
funds, the Brosius acquisition is an example of talent shrewdness
and development that has no source in cash. As a Yankee, he hit
.300 and was named an All-Star for the first time. Barring a highly
improbable Yankee collapse, he seems destined to be the Series'
most valuable player, an honor unique _ this is said without
research, yet with no fear of contradiction _ for a resident of
McMinnville, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   He even comes with his own personal-drama story _ his father,
Maury, flew in from Oregon yesterday after surviving a bout with
colon cancer, to witness his son become a Yankee World Series hero.
</P>
<P>
   One more story like this, and the Yankees graduate from a sports
team to a force of nature.

YANKEES STUN PADRES FOR 3-0 LEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Even the most automatic game-saver in the National
League during the regular season could not prevent the World Series
from taking a giant step closer to a four-and-over washout for the
San Diego Padres Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team gone overboard.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning eighth-inning at-bat that gave a loud Qualcomm
Stadium crowd instant laryngitis, Scott Brosius reversed a Trevor
Hoffman fastball and rocketed it over the center-field fence for a
game-deciding, three-run homer as the New York Yankees shocked the
Padres 5-4 before 64,667 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been the best team in the major leagues all
season and are on the verge of their second sweep this postseason.
One more win clinches the franchise's 24th World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are on life-support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the history of the teams who were down three games to
none,'' San Diego right fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``No one has ever
come back from being three games down and won, but we can either
roll over or come out fighting. I plan to come out fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder how much fight is left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game reaches in and grabs your guts out,'' Padres manager
Bruce Bochy said. ``When you lose games like this, sure it's tough
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   With better relief pitching, the Padres would be up 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   They blew a three-run, seventh-inning lead and lost Game 1
without getting to Hoffman. But when they turned to their save
master with a one-run lead and a runner on base in the eighth
inning Tuesday night, the automatic switch seemed to be turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hadn't pitched in six days, Hoffman said he felt
great.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling turned sour in a New York minute.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring Bernie Williams on a fly ball that drove Gwynn to
the fence, the command Hoffman almost always had when he saved 53
regular-season games in 54 opportunities deserted him. He bounced
pitches into the dirt. His fastball, usually in the low 90s, peaked
at 89 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander walked Tino Martinez, putting the go-ahead run
on base, and two pitches after bouncing another ball in the dirt,
this time with Brosius batting, Hoffman fired a fastball that had
more zip going out than coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1-and-1 pitch that I threw about 50 feet bothers me more
than the pitch he hit out,'' Hoffman said. ``That put him in a
hitter's count.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius fouled off one pitch, then clobbered the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to do anything in particular,'' said the
Yankee third baseman, who became only the third player this season
to hit a home run off Hoffman. ``Against Trevor, I was just looking
to try to get something to hit. Because of his changeup and how
good it is, I didn't want to jump out and spin off the ball. So I
was really just thinking, `Stay up the middle with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The home run gave New York a two-run lead, and three Yankee
relievers maintained the cushion despite allowing a run in the
bottom of the eighth on Greg Vaughn's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres threatened in the bottom of the ninth, putting
runners on first and third bases before Mariano Rivera struck out
former Mariner Andy Sheets for the game-ender.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 19th time in history that a team has grabbed a 3-0
lead. Fifteen of those Series ended in a sweep. Only three teams
have forced a Game 5, and they were eliminated in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will just give it our all, that's all we can do now,''
Bochy said. ``The odds are against us, and there's not much else to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy and the Padres got the kind of starting pitching from
Sterling Hitchcock that they needed to win Game 3. The left-handed
postseason star was superb, holding the Yankees scoreless through
the sixth inning and escaping a bases-loaded, none-out mess in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He was surprising with the bat.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Mariner broke up David Cone's no-hitter with a leadoff
single in the bottom of the sixth and scored the game's first run
as the Padres took a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Quilvio Veras walked, Gwynn lined a run-scoring single to
right field, and Veras also scored when Paul O'Neill uncorked a
wild throw to the plate, missing the cutoff man and catcher Joe
Girardi. Gwynn reached third base on the errant toss and scored on
Ken Caminiti's long fly ball to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees retaliated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who hit 19 homers during the regular season, led off
the seventh inning with a towering drive into the seats in
left-center field ib a full-count pitch, and Shane Spener doubled
into the left-center field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Exit Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   A passed ball and Caminiti's second error of the Series cut San
Diego's lead to a run before Derek Jeter lined into an
inning-ending double play to shortstop Chris Gomez, who leaped high
to deflect the ball, grabbed it on the rebound and doubled
pinch-runner Homer Bush off second base.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scantest of leads, when Bochy handed the ball to
Hoffman, almost everyone in the park, and probably a few in New
York, felt this game was history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anytime it doesn't work out with Trevor on the mound,
sure you're surprised,'' Bochy said. ``But he's human. The guy has
had a tremendous year, and I'll take my chances with him out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there aren't many chances left. Maybe only one.

MICROSOFT FIGHTS BACK WITH DEFENSE OF CHAIRMAN GATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Microsoft blasted the Justice Department's
antitrust charges Tuesday as an effort to ``demonize'' its
chairman, Bill Gates, and charged that rival Netscape
Communications elected to seek refuge in a government lawsuit
rather than compete for consumers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the second day of the momentous antitrust trial of the
software giant, lead Microsoft litigator John Warden described the
company as a tough but fair competitor that spends $3 billion a
year on research to maintain its edge.
</P>
<P>
   Warden belittled the government's case as ``long on rhetoric and
short on substance'' and chastised the Justice Department for its
focus on Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal attack on a man whose vision and innovation have
been at the core of the benefits that people are reaping from the
Information Age is no substitute for proof of anticompetitive
conduct and anticompetitive effects,'' Warden said in his opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also began his cross-examination of the Justice
Department's key witness, Netscape chief executive officer Jim
Barksdale, arguing that Netscape itself once had a monopoly on
Internet browsers _ it held 90 percent of the browser market in
1995 _ and that the company instigated the government's
investigation when it saw its own dominance threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence will show that the government's charges turn
antitrust law on its head,'' Warden said. With deep sarcasm, he
added, ``Netscape had what the government would consider a monopoly
in the market for Internet browsers until the great Satan,
Microsoft, came along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is the biggest monopoly case since the
breakup of AT&AMP;T and could shape not only the future of Silicon
Valley and the high-tech industry, but the lives of millions of
consumers who increasingly rely on computers and the Internet in
their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses Microsoft of illegally exploiting its
dominant Windows computer operating system to promote its own
products, particularly its Internet Explorer browser, and kill off
competitors like Netscape's Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Warden said the core of the government's case _ that Microsoft
``bundled'' Internet Explorer for free with Windows to drive out
Netscape _ amounts to ``semantic games.'' He said Internet Explorer
is ``not an add-on, like a flash on a camera or a car radio,'' but
an integral part of Windows, like ``a shutter on a camera or a
car's transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Ordinary consumers who buy personal computers at Wal-Mart
have no interest in piecing together an operating system from a
grab bag of separately marketed components,'' Warden said.
``Consumers want their new machine to come out of the box and just
work, and our position is that it's our right to provide consumers
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale calmly took the stand after submitting his written
testimony, often taking long deliberative pauses, parrying with
Warden and making wry jests.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Barksdale conceded that Netscape had
hired Palo Alto attorney Gary Reback in the spring of 1995 and that
Reback had provided what Warden called a ``detailed chronology of
Microsoft's dealings with Netscape'' to the Justice Department by
July of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Warden introduced an internal Netscape memo titled ``The
Situation'' that said the ``DOJ (Department of Justice) and court
actions create opportunity for Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the statement, Barksdale replied that the government
antitrust action was ``a way of protecting an opportunity we had
all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden and Barksdale sparred over one of Netscape's key
accusations: that Microsoft bullied computer giant Compaq Computer
into dropping Navigator and adding Internet Explorer to its
machines by threatening to cancel Compaq's license to use Windows.
Losing Windows would effectively destroy any computer maker's
market.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said Netscape ``learned that Compaq no longer intended
to put Navigator on the desktop shortly after Microsoft threatened
to cancel Compaq's Windows license.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden asked whether Microsoft threatened to withdraw its
license because Compaq wanted to remove Internet Explorer from
Windows _ and not because Compaq simply wanted to add Navigator.
Barksdale replied, ``as an original statement, that would probably
be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden asked Barksdale whether he had ``any basis whatsoever''
for suggesting that Microsoft threatened to cancel the license with
Compaq because the company included Navigator, and Barksdale
replied, ``No, that's not what I say here.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, lead government attorney David Boies said Barksdale
did not back off his testimony on Compaq, but ``said exactly what
he said in his statement. . . . The witness said all along that
Compaq tried to substitute Navigator for Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray insisted that the Compaq dispute highlights ``a
fundamental point. . . . Microsoft never attempted to withhold
Windows from Compaq or any computer manufacturer if it wanted to
ship Navigator.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden painted Netscape as a ``ward'' of the government that
chose to turn to the Justice Department to save its market share.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also suggested that the government is applying two
different rules, one for Microsoft and another for everyone else.
To make his point, he noted that Netscape added features demanded
by customers, such as e-mail, even if it drove stand-alone products
made by other companies off the market. Drawing the comparison to
Microsoft, Warden said the software giant created and marketed its
browser because it was ``forced to respond to competitive
challenges. The government cannot seriously come to this court and
contend that Microsoft should have its hands tied behind its back,
unable to respond to changes in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Barksdale credited Netscape co-founder
Marc Andreessen and a team of colleagues with inventing a
user-friendly Internet browser in 1993 while at the University of
Illinois National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Barksdale
said Netscape's commercialization of the browser set off the
Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale suggested that ``had Netscape not been willing and
strong enough to look Microsoft in the eye and bring the browser to
market, we would not have browsers (or anything like browsers) in
the marketplace at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden ridiculed that assertion. ``You don't really believe that
but for Netscape, Web browsing wouldn't exist,'' Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that from the bottom of my heart,'' Barksdale
retorted.

   1. DANCING IN HITLER'S SHADOW It's as unlikely an Oscar
candidate as they come : A comedy set in a German concentration
camp, written by, directed by and starring an Italian comedian. But
Roberto Benigni's ``Life is Beautiful'' has beaten the odds,
winning the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and is touted
for Oscar consideration. In this interview Benigni talks about the
new movie, why he doesn't worry that it will be taken in bad taste,
how Holocaust survivors have received the film and how his father's
grimly humorous tales of prison-camp life during World War II
provided the seeds for the film. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words +
photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
FACE VALUE: CAMP HUMOR - ROBERTO BENIGNI Artist Ricardo Castaneda
offers an intriguing cartoon of Roberto Benigni in ``Life is
Beautiful,'' his unique concentration camp comedy.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
THE FUNNIEST ITALIAN YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF Roberto Benigni
is Italy's Robin Williams, but he has never caught on big in
America. Maybe his new comedy, ``La Vita Bella'' (Life Is
Beautiful) set during the Holocaust, will do the trick. It is
already being mentioned as a prime candidate for Best Foreign Film
in the Academy Awards. By Alessandra Stanley. New York Times
Magazine. Full-length (3,100 words) + edited article available.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
WELLES AND THE 'WAR OF THE WORLDS' It was 60 years ago this month
that the world's most influential radio broadcast first aired :
Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre production of ``The War of the
Worlds.'' People panicked, believing that Martians were actually
invading Earth. This article examines the broadcast's impact and
discusses its effect on Welles' first film, ``Citizen Kane.'' By
Lige Rushing. From Diversion magazine. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
THE NOT-SO-SECRET LIFE OF PETER GALLAGHER Peter Gallagher has
appeared in a lot of hit movies - ``Sex, lies and videotape''
(1989,) ``The Player'' (1992,) ``While you Were Sleeping'' (1995) -
but he insists that his new TV series, ``The Secret Lives of Men,''
(about divorced men in Manhattan) is the most fun he's ever had. In
this interview Gallagher talks about the new show, why grim
subjects such as divorce make for the best comedies, and why men
will say things to one another on a golf course that they would
never tell the women in their lives. By Stephen Cole. From Canadian
TV Guide. 1,100 words + photo. 6. OPRAH GOES FOR THE OSCAR GOLD
Oprah Winfrey struggled for 10 years to bring ``Beloved,'' (the
Toni Morrison story about slavery) to the screen. In the process,
she says, she discovered ``the real meaning of life.'' By Ivor
Davis. 1,000 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
____________________________________________________________ 7.
JAMES WOODS, VAMPIRE FIGHTER James Woods has played heroes,
villains, lovers and lawyers, but in John Crow, the sardonic
vampire fighter in ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' he says he has
found one of the most enjoyable roles of his career. The film is a
cross between a Western and a horror film and Crow is ``the baddest
guy ever.'' Woods talks about the film, colleagues such as Clint
Eastwood and Oliver Stone, why he is as quick to do TV movies or
quirky independent films as he is to do Hollywood blockbusters, and
why ``Hercules'' may be the most mportant film he ever made. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
TURN TV INTO A POSITIVE INFLUENCE For most people, television is a
big part of family life. Here is advice on how to make it a more
positive influence in the home. By Kathy Sena. 900 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
HOLLYWOOD'S APT PUPIL Bryan Singer directed the crime thriller
``The Usual Suspects.'' Following the success of that film, the
young director found himself travelling in Hollywood's highest
circles. But finishing his next movie proved anything but easy. In
``Apt Pupil,'' based on the novella by Stephen King, an American
teenager discovers that his next-door neighbour is a notorious
former Nazi. The film, starring Sir Ian McKellan, has become almost
as controversial as its subject. ``The movie is about the
pervasiveness of evil and corruption,'' says Singer. By Joshua
Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 10.
THE DEVIL AND DEREK JACOBI Francis Bacon, one of the greatest
artists of the 20th century, led a life almost as harrowing as his
dark and violent paintings. In ``Love Is The Devil,'' Sir Derek
Jacobi gives a phenomenal performance as Bacon. The film focuses on
Bacon's long-term, often destructive relationship with his male
lover, the subject of his most famous paintings. To play Bacon,
Jacobi says he employed the same acting technique he would use to
portray Shakespeare's Richard III, as they both had a streak of
cruelty. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words + photo.

YANKEES CLOSE IN ON CHAMPIONSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. Sullivan 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The San Diego Padres aren't eliminated, but they
have nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   There are no weapons unused or bullets unfired. Manager Bruce
Bochy has tried everything, but the New York Yankees have taken the
Padres best shots, scoffed at the Padres and just kept on trouncing
their hopelessly outclassed National League opponent.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Trevor Hoffman, who was almost as invincible as
a reliever in the National League as the Yankees were as a team in
the other league. Bochy brought his All-Star closer into the game
in the eighth inning to protect a 3-2 lead, but, just like almost
every move he has made in the World Series, it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hoffman gave up a three-run homer to Scott Brosius that
carried the Yankees to a 5-4 victory against the Padres in Game 3.
A Qualcomm Stadium crowd of 64,667, whose screams reached
bloodcurdling levels when Hoffman trotted in from the bullpen to
the heavy metal sounds of ``Hells Bells'', left heartbroken as the
Padres fell behind three games to none.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius also led off the seventh with a home run, which
kick-started the Yankees' offense and allowed them to overcome the
Padres' 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of thing you dream of as a kid,'' Brosius
said. ``It's something I've done 100 times in my backyard as a
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will send Kevin Brown to the mound for Game 4
tonight, but, as they remember after winning the first three games
of the NL Championship Series against Atlanta, no team in
major-league history has come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a
best-of-seven playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   It would take an immediate and total collapse by a team that won
a league-record 114 games in the regular season and 10 of 12 games
in postseason. More likely scenarios would seem to include the
Yankees moving to Vermont, owner George Steinbrenner moving toward
total revenue sharing or the Dodgers moving back to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we have to face,'' Hoffman said. ``We just
have to pick it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres thought they had done that when they broke up a
scoreless pitchers' duel between Sterling Hitchcock and Yankees
starter David Cone with a three-run outburst in the sixth.
Hitchcock started the rally with a single to right, breaking up
Cone's five-inning no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees came back in the seventh when Brosius led off
with a homer to left-center and Shane Spencer doubled. Bochy
brought in Joey Hamilton to pitch, but Spencer, who moved to third
on catcher Jim Leyritz's passed ball, scored on third baseman Ken
Caminiti's error on pinch hitter Chili Davis' grounder.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the dramatic events of the eighth, an inning that
started with Padres reliever Randy Myers walking Paul O'Neill.
Bochy then brought in Hoffman, who was making his first appearance
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman got Bernie Williams to fly out, but Tino Martinez walked
to bring up Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not something I wanted to do, but I put myself
in a hole by not making quality pitches,'' Hoffman said. ``I paid
for it. What's so disappointing is the team battled so hard. We had
a lead, and I didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment of truth was a 2-2 fastball that Brosius crushed over
the center-field fence, giving the Yankees a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the clubhouse icing my arm and I jumped so high I
almost went through the roof,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only thing was trying to pick the ball up,'' Brosius said.
``I wanted to see him \RHoffman\S as good as I could and get a good
swing on the ball. As it was, it was a fastball over the plate, and
I hit it hard in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres made a valiant effort to come back, getting one run
in the eighth when Quilvio Veras doubled, then later scored on Greg
Vaughn's sacrifice fly. They also had runners at first and third
with two outs in the ninth before Mariano Rivera closed it out by
striking out Andy Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Padres' best chance, but against the best team in
baseball, nothing has worked.

FATHER OF THE RIDE: QUARTER HORSE'S OFFSPRING STILL DASHING FOR
CASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legendary quarter-horse breeder B. F. Phillips Jr. knew it from
the start. Moments after the newborn foal hit the ground on April
17, 1973, at Phillips Ranch in Frisco, he went into the house and
informed his wife that he had witnessed the birth of a special
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question he was going to be a great horse,''
Phillips later said. ``There was no mistaking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he strutted his stuff on the track, Dash For Cash made
believers of everyone else. And after he was retired to the
breeding shed, his reputation only grew.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is fitting that Dash For Cash was foaled only
weeks before Secretariat began his famed sweep of thoroughbred
racing's Triple Crown. In the world of quarter-horse racing, Dash
For Cash's legacy has surpassed even that of his thoroughbred
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   At Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, that legacy is honored this
week with two races in his name: The Dash For Cash Derby for
3-year-olds Friday and the Dash For Cash Futurity for 2-year-olds
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dash For Cash died May 20, 1996, but his presence is clearly
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 qualifiers for the Dash For Cash Futurity are his
great-grandsons. The Derby field includes five grandsons or
great-grandsons. One Derby qualifer, Four Six Dash, is his son,
from his next-to-last crop of offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Dash For Cash ``was the best runner I've seen,'' said his
trainer, C. W. ``Bubba'' Cascio of Weatherford. ``And he's
obviously the best sire ever, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As a racehorse, Dash For Cash won 21 of his 25 starts, finishing
second three times.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only horse to twice win the Champion of Champions _ an
important December race at Los Alamitos near Los Angeles. He was
voted world champion in 1976 and 1977, and was the first quarter
horse to earn $500,000 without benefit of victories in the rich
All-American Futurity or All-American Derby at Ruidoso Downs in New
Mexico. ``The thing I remember most about him is that I didn't have
to sweat many photo finishes,'' Cascio said. ``He beat good horses
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Cascio said Dash For Cash's stride was measured at 32 feet,
among the longest ever recorded. And like most champion horses, his
stride appeared fluid and effortless.
</P>
<P>
   Another ingredient in his success as a runner _ and later as a
sire _ was his temperament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got into the gate, he'd stand there and never move,''
Cascio said. ``He'd never bat an eye. You'd think the horse was not
gonna break, and then he'd explode.''
</P>
<P>
   With his career winding down in the fall of 1977 while residing
in the Southern California barn of then-quarter-horse trainer D.
Wayne Lukas, Dash For Cash was syndicated for stud duty for $2.5
million. Forty shares were sold for $62,500 each, with two
breedings allowed per share.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who died in 1987, set the price-per-share over dinner
one evening, and asked Cascio how well the shares might sell. When
Phillips visited Cascio's barn at 11 a.m. the next morning, the
answer was clear: Cascio already had a dozen signed contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Dash For Cash's first crop was a test breeding of fewer than two
dozen mares, and the results were conclusive. One became a
champion, a second was a major stakes winner, and several others
were talented runners.
</P>
<P>
   Dash For Cash quickly become such a hot commodity that ownership
of a single breeding share became as valued as Wal-Mart stock.
Within a few years, one of the shares was sold for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, Cascio brokered a deal in which California
quarter-horse breeder Liston Aluminum Brick Company wanted to buy a
breeding share. Cascio found a seller, but told the Liston
representative that the asking price was an unheard-of $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cascio, the immediate response was, ``Who do I make
the check out to?''
</P>
<P>
   That selling price for a single quarter-horse breeding share,
Cascio said, ``is a record that will never be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Such financial support proved justified.
</P>
<P>
   Dash For Cash has sired five world champions, and 17 divisional
champions that collected a total of 39 titles. One of his
daughters, Dash For Speed, co-owned by Bob Blakemon of Fort Worth,
took seven titles.
</P>
<P>
   Cascio later trained one of Dash For Cash's daughters,
Dashingly, who earned $1.7 million and won 21 of 24 starts. She is
the only quarter horse to earn a million dollars without winning
one of the All-American races.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 all-time leading money-winning quarter horses before
the 1998 season, seven are sons of Dash For Cash and another is a
grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Further down that list at No. 33 is First Down Dash, a son of
Dash For Cash who won 13 of 15 starts and became the pre-eminent
sire of the 1990s. Now 14, First Down Dash is the primary flag
carrier for the Dash For Cash bloodlines. He has sired five
All-American Futurity winners from only eight crops of offspring.
Five of the top 20 sires of 1997 are his sons, and last year's
world champion SLM Big Daddy is his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after his birth, Dash For Cash's family tree
has so many branches that on any given day, numerous runners with
``Dash'' and ``Cash'' in their names are seen at quarter-horse
tracks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And that is one trend that won't soon be changing.

GARRETT'S EXPLOITS SHOULDN'T BE EDITED OUT OF SEASON'S FINAL REEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eighth week is the natural midpoint of an NFL season. And
with the Cowboys' bye week coming after seven games, this is as
good a time as any to assess the first part of the 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond running back Emmitt Smith's resurgence, defensive tackle
Leon Lett's dominating play and cornerback Deion Sanders' utter
greatness, the best story of the first half was backup quarterback
Jason Garrett, who lived out a made-for-television movie right
before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Disney couldn't have scripted it better.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Sunday's loss to the Bears took some of the luster off
Garrett's performance. But that's what makes it better than some
hokey movie fantasy. The Jason Garrett Show was authentic, because
it came with the highs and lows of real life.
</P>
<P>
   What's funny is that some people are actually disappointed that
the 4-3 Cowboys finished ``only'' 3-2 with Garrett at the controls
in place of Troy Aikman. And they are right. The Cowboys should
have beaten the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, who is the NFL's third-ranked quarterback and is in
front of last season's Pro Bowl quarterbacks, Brett Favre and Trent
Dilfer, was performing that well. So well, in fact, that people
took a few things for granted. Think about it for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Here, we had a little-used and supposedly flawed backup, making
a minimum-wage quarterback salary of $300,000, being called on to
replace a $50 million hero in Aikman. Did we already say that
Garrett went undrafted out of Princeton, was slight of build and of
arm strength?
</P>
<P>
   Did we also say that Garrett was cut by the Saints, the
now-defunct World League San Antonio Riders and CFL's Ottawa
RoughRiders before being signed by the Cowboys in 1993. And in the
past five seasons he had never been more than a third-string
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   If you knew before the season that Aikman would go down with an
injury and the basically unproven Garrett would be handed the keys
to the Cowboys' season for five games _ including road matchups
against the defending NFC East champion Giants, Redskins and Bears
and home games against the Raiders and Panthers _ what would your
expectations have been?
</P>
<P>
   2-3? 1-4?
</P>
<P>
   Most people would have been happy _ no, ecstatic over a 3-2
mark.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard now to be satisfied with 3-2 because the two losses
were each by one point and Garrett's shortcomings played large
roles in the outcomes of both games.
</P>
<P>
   However, considering this crazy season _ in which the almighty
Packers have lost back-to-back games and the 49ers lost to the
Bills _ there is no guarantee that the Cowboys would have gone 5-0
or even 4-1 during that same stretch with Aikman at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that when Aikman returns from his broken
collarbone after the bye for the Philadelphia game, the Cowboys'
preseason goals remain intact. The Cowboys stand atop the NFC East
by one game and the possibilities are endless.
</P>
<P>
   And Garrett is a big reason why. He combined a sharp knowledge
of the game and his own limitations with a bombs-away flair; he
can't throw the 15-yard out, but he can throw the deep ball. And
when he played mistake-free, as he did in victories against the
Giants, Redskins and Panthers, Garrett was surprisingly the best
quarterback on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that if/when the Cowboys do realize their
potential and return to the playoffs after a year's hiatus,
Garrett's contribution won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clint Longley's legendary relief job for Roger Staubach
on Thanksgiving Day in 1974, which was called by one teammate as
``the triumph of an uncluttered mind,'' Garrett's play was not born
of luck or happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   His improbable five-game run was the story of a lifelong
football junkie and the son of a football coach, who was not
blessed with great physical skills. However, Garrett loved the game
and prepared himself every day on blind faith for an opportunity
that was never promised.
</P>
<P>
   Nine long years after graduating from Princeton and at mature
age of 32, Garrett finally got his chance and made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy'' was a fantasy. The Jason Garrett story was genuine.
Kevin Smith standing strong
</P>
<P>
   It's been well documented that cornerback Kevin Smith is having
a tough time. What's not been told is how Smith _ though hurt by
criticism _ has not shied away it.
</P>
<P>
   Some players outright duck the media when they have bad games.
But not Smith. He faces the music like a man, answering every
question whether he agrees or not.
</P>
<P>
   It's that attitude that gives defensive backs coach Mike Zimmer
hope that Smith will bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people that believe in him are the people in the
defensive locker room,'' said Zimmer, who pointed out that Smith is
the same guy that the Cowboys used to hang out in single coverage
during the Super Bowl seasons of 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just lost his confidence,'' Zimmer added. ``I believe in
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer added that the Cowboys are also going to stop giving
Smith a lot of safety help and just trust that he will get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were screwing everybody else up,'' Zimmer said. ``That's
why we were getting the long balls thrown on us. He's just going to
line up and cover the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To know Smith _ he has tangled with former defensive end Charles
Haley in the past _ is to know that he won't go down without a
fight.

 &HT;    After census, statehouses to reapportion Congress seats
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ With legislative reapportionment likely to
determine control of Congress in the new millennium, some of the
fall's most competitive and expensive elections are unfolding in
state legislatures around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Well beneath the radar of the congressional campaigns, the two
national parties are spending millions of dollars in about a dozen
states where a gain or loss of a few seats could give one party
control of the state house or senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hand-to-hand combat out there,'' says Kevin Mack,
director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
``Partisan control is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Term limits, creating an unprecedented number of open seats in
some states, is also feeding the frenzy. Here in the Razorback
State, half of the 100-member House is open because of term limits,
giving Republicans the best opportunity to pick up seats in the
Democratically controlled Legislature ``since Union troops left
Little Rock and allowed the former Confederate soldiers to vote
again,'' says Arkansas GOP director Richard Bearden.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, where Democrats are clinging to a four-seat
majority in the state House, 64 of the state's 110 House seats are
open this year because of term limits. The state parties and
related committees there are spending ``millions and millions of
dollars'' for control of the chamber, says Mark Brewer, chairman of
the Michigan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans, of course, have immediate objectives
in wanting to control state legislative chambers. But the
overarching impetus at the national level is the redistricting that
will take place in 2001 as a result of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The parties that control the legislatures and the governor's
offices after the 2000 elections will redraw the district
boundaries for Congress. How the lines are drawn can determine
which party will be able to send more of their members to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The national parties aren't waiting until 2000 to launch their
offensives on legislatures, figuring that it will be easier for
their members to win in 2000 if they are running as incumbents
elected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three states that send the most members to Congress _
California, Illinois and Texas _ all have legislative chambers that
could change hands with the gain or loss of a few seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending a ton of money in California,'' says Rep. John
Linder (R-Ga.), chairman of the National Republican Campaign
Committee, which spearheads the House GOP campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Linder's NRCC is spending nearly $2 million in state
legislative races. Linder sums up the reason for the investment:
reapportionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be huge to control one or both bodies and even
better if we control the governors' offices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who coordinates the Democratic Party's effort from
Washington, declined to disclose what the DLCC is spending this
year. ``People are just working as hard as they can to keep these
legislative chambers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically talking about setting the rules of the game
for the next 10 years,'' says political scientist Gary Moncrief at
Boise State University, who teaches state legislative politics.
``Whoever controls that has really got a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who control a majority of the nation's legislative
chambers, have the most at stake. With the GOP now controlling both
houses of Congress and 32 of 50 of the nation's governor's offices,
state legislatures are the last repository of Democratic strength.
</P>
<P>
   And that strength has been eroding steadily, thanks in a large
part to the huge Republican gains in the South. In 1974, Democrats
controlled 68 percent of all state legislative seats. Now they
control just 53 percent. In the South, the erosion has been even
more dramatic. In 1974, Democrats controlled 86 percent of all
legislative seats in the region. Today, they control 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also facing some bad precedent. The party of the
president has lost legislative seats in every midterm election in
the past 20 years except one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans have a realistic chance of gaining
control of a majority of the nation's 7,424 legislative seats for
the first time since 1952, says Tim Storey, research analyst for
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the final act of realignment,'' says Storey.
``Democrats really dominated state legislatures if you look at the
last 20 years. Now you have a number of states where Republicans
are optimistic and have realistic shots to take state chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the NRCC is spending about $100,000 to erase the
Democrats' 10-seat majority in the state Senate. ``We've got a real
shot,'' says state GOP chairman Rusty Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is a good example of another trend that is reshaping the
way state legislative battles are fought. In the past, strategic
planning and fund-raising was a largely parochial affair, with the
respective party leaders from the House and Senate calling the
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, legislative campaigns have become centralized in the state
parties, with strategic advice and money flowing directly from the
national parties. This year in Georgia, for example, the state
Republican Party is coordinating statewide television advertising
for its candidates for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   The result are campaigns that are far more professional than the
candidates could have ever undertaken on their own, Paul says.
</P>
<P>
   The DLCC, founded in 1993, this year is providing professional
support to 37 legislative chambers, from polling to fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in the past is these have been lackluster
operations with legislative leaders raising $10,000 to $15,000 and
passing out $500 checks to incumbents,'' Mack says. ``Now they are
$500,000 to $1 million efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BALANCE OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Control of one or both chambers of many state legislatures is up
for grabs in the November election. A gain or loss of a few seats
in many cases will mean a change of partisan control. The number in
center column indicates how many seats the minority party must win
to gain control.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 21. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 ( istributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House's passage Ttesday night of the $500 billion federal
spending bill leads at USAT, the LAT and the WP. The papers report
that the Senate is expected to approve phe bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT leads with the continuing Mideasu talks, stashing the
budget story inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Times says the particitation by Jordan's King Hussein
appears to have created some optimism. The paper also reporvs two
sticking points: 1) the Israelis want to put a specific number of
Palestijians _ including some Palestinian Authority cops _ on trial
for terrorist attacks against Israelis, and 2) the Palastinians are
insisting that safe passage rights for their people between the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip extend to making the trip in private
cars, not just$mass transportation.
</P>
<P>
   All the majors' fzonts except the LAT's report Day 2 of the
Microsoft trial, at which the company's lawyer made his opening
statement, comxaring the`government to 19th kentury Luddites going
around smashing machines with sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   The papers all nnte what a kludge the budget process has become.
For instance, the NYT points out that the House bill incorporates
numerous polhcy dechsions that Congress never debated. And they all
tick off examples of its extremities. The LAV, for example, reports
that iv includes negislation to carry out the Chemical Weapons
Convention (previously passed by the Senate, but not kmplemented)
as well as a measure to keep the world safe for airborne peanuts.
Ritually, everybody but USAT mentions some of the bill's phYsical
dimensigns _ the WP gives the most stats of this sort: weicht, 40
pounds; height, 16 inches; pages, 3,825.
</P>
<P>
   All the papers mentikn that Jewt Gingrich dismissed critics of
the bill as perfectionists. But USAT never explains that it was the
GOP's hard-core conservatives who were complaining. The WP does
mention this, but it's the LAT and the NYT that play the point
high, explaining that by the conservatives' lights, the bill spends
too much and cuts taxes too little.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT even goes out of its piece saying that the vote revealed
a severe split in the Republican Party that may be hard to patch
up.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT budget story notes a last-minute deal in which Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato won approval of a provision requiring health
insurance companies to cover post-mastectomy reconstructive
surgery, and explains it this way: D'Amato was trying to undercut
his election opponent's strong support among women voters. This is
a bit brisk for a news story: Isn't there any chance that D'Amato
is concerned about women not being able to afford reconstructions?
</P>
<P>
   The NYT front and the WSJ front-page business news box report
that according to the latest government figures, the U.S. foreign
trade gap for August reached the highest level _ $16.77 billion _
recorded since the present method of calculation was adopted in
1992. The Journal says a government analyst estimates the deficit
is actually now the biggest since December 1985. The two papers
attribute the weak exports and strong imports behind the gap to the
global economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT fronts high a story about the emerging tension between
the makers of legal, medical and financial software on the one
hand, and lawyers, doctors and investment professionals on the
other, as the software nibbles away at the professionals'
traditional turf. The piece reports that in Texas, a committee of
lawyers is trying to ban self-help legal software via a statute
barring anyone _ or anything, the paper wryly notes _ from
practicing law without a license. One of the attacked programs,
Quicken Family Lawyer, features Arthur Miller, who while not a
member of the Texas bar, is a professor at Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The paper notes that the power of the Internet will only expand
professional software's reach. An example the LAT gives is the
recent spate of web sites that facilitate the sale of Viagra to
those logging on and filling out a questionnaire. In telling this
story, the paper makes an interesting choice: deciding to publish
the web address for one Viagra site. This is tantamount to free
advertising. Does the LAT also intend to start publishing the phone
numbers of lawyers and doctors in stories about them?

NETWORKING COMES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For computer-owning families, the machines sometimes seem to fit
Ogden Nash's description of martinis: ``One is too few. Two is too
many. Three is never enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families started out with one computer. Fast when it was
bought, it became ``slow'' when the newer models were brought out.
So it sits on one desk, probably used for less demanding tasks, and
the family's new one sits on another. And, to use another famous
line, ``Never the twain shall meet.''
</P>
<P>
   For most uses, that's fine. When the need arises, the files from
one computer can be put on a floppy disk and taken to the other _
unless it's a file of a photograph that is too large to store on a
floppy. If both machines have a Zip, or similar drive with high
capacity, the ``sneakernet'' transfer system can still work.
</P>
<P>
   But things can become more complex. Say both computer users want
on the Internet _ at the same time. The additional expense of
bringing in another phone line can be expensive for installation
and continuing for a monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   The time to network has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up two computers isn't as complicated as it used to be.
If you have Macs, the machines were designed to be linked easily.
In most households with two PCs, the two are probably running some
version of Windows. In the past year or so, networking computers
has become easier, thanks mainly to kits that direct home users
toward the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary, depending on the system used and whether you or a
computer store does the work. Plugging in two network cards and
running a cable between them is the quick and cheap way to do it
yourself and costs less than $100 for the network cards. Other
methods can start driving up the costs. Lugging the two computers
to a computer store and having technicians do the work is an
option, although the labor cost is a factor to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Once connected, two computers can share hard drives. One printer
can work for both computers. A scanner on one computer can capture
images that can be transferred to the second computer.
</P>
<P>
   If the computers are in the same room, the job will be less
daunting. If not, you may have to venture into the attic to run
wires or drill through a wall to install a telephone-like
receptacle to make the passthrough to the next room.
</P>
<P>
   However, some companies offer systems that work over a home's
electrical wiring. Particularly intriguing is a simple hookup from
a company that uses a wireless system that plugs into the printer
ports of the computers and can thus connect two computers located
up to 125 feet apart. I haven't tried the Aviator Wireless Network
yet, but will be testing it shortly.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible for the piggyback computer to use the
Internet as long as the main computer is online, not all Internet
service providers _ including AOL _ allow two screen names to be
logged on at the same time under the same account.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of Family PC magazine answers 20 questions
about home networking. It explains the alternatives and lists the
advantages (which I've touched on here.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also has an article on seven ways to upgrade an
existing computer, how to surf the 'net with children, and sites to
make Halloween even more spooky: www.unversalstudios.com/horror for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also has an Internet site: www.familypc.com.

PUSH TO BUY PALM SHOWS MICROSOFT'S AGGRESSION IS CONSISTENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a recent move that indicated he has no
intention of backing away from his company's aggressive business
tactics, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, has proposed
acquiring the software business behind 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm
Pilot hand-held computer, according to people who have been briefed
on the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, made in an August meeting with 3Com's chairman, Eric
Benhamou, was not accepted by 3Com executives, those people say.
</P>
<P>
   But certainly, Gates is said to have dangled an alluring
kingmaker's deal: If 3Com were willing to sell off its software
business, a market favorite compared with Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system, Gates would make the company's remaining Palm
Computing hardware business, ``the Compaq Computer of the hand-held
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny word of
the meeting at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, at which
the two executives discussed a variety of strategic possibilities
between the two companies, according to several people privy to the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposal was unsuccessful, the approach provides
graphic insight into Microsoft's business tactics. As in its
abortive 1995 deal to acquire the financial software maker Intuit,
which was rejected not by Intuit but by the Justice Department,
Microsoft is increasingly looking to buy its way into markets where
its own products are not competitive enough to unseat established
brands.
</P>
<P>
   And the Palm Pilot offer would appear to indicate that Microsoft
has not scaled back its ambitions in the face of the Justice
Department's antitrust suit. The antitrust suit, initiated last
October, originally focused on Microsoft's linking of its Internet
Explorer World Wide Web browser with the industry-dominant Windows
95 operating system. But more recently, the Justice Department has
begun to examine a wide range of the company's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations to control development and production of the
software that powers the most popular hand-held computer, the Palm
Pilot, are significant, analysts said, because hand-held devices,
from note-taking aids to cellular telephones, are one part of the
market where Microsoft does not appear to be quickly gaining
ground. The market is seen as growing more quickly than the
computer industry over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bill Gates was trying to get rid of a competitor,'' said
Andrew Seybold, a computer and communications analyst and publisher
of his own newsletter, based in Boulder Creek, Calif. ``I don't
think the Windows CE products have slowed them down at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Microsoft officials did not directly dispute word of the
overture to 3Com, they rebutted suggestions that they had lost
confidence in the Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any statement suggesting that Microsoft would license or buy
the Palm software in lieu of Windows CE is flatly false,'' said
Greg Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com is a great partner and we have frequent discussions with
them,'' he added. ``But it would be inappropriate to comment on
those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for 3Com simply said the company would not comment
on any of the discussions the company had held with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two companies have had a broad set of partnerships in
other areas of computing, they have been bitter enemies in the
market for hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, 3Com filed suit in Germany after Microsoft
introduced a clone of the Palm Pilot, which it called the Palm PC.
Microsoft backed down, renaming its hand-held unit the Palm-sized
PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Computing business of 3Com has shipped more than 1.5
million copies of its hand-held device, making it the dominant
player in the market for so-called personal digital assistants
after earlier efforts like Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton failed to
gain broad acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, only about 750,000 Windows CE-based hand-held
systems have been shipped, according to Rob Enderle, an analyst at
Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.

SUCCESSFUL LISTINGS MAGAZINE IS WARY OF THE INTERNET

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Looking for the latest anti-apartheid protest or Jethro
Tull gig? Thirty years ago _ before history claimed such events as
its grist _ the place to look was Time Out, then a start-up
listings magazine produced by a 21-year-old British college
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as Time Out celebrated its 30th birthday with a
noisy bash for 3,000 people at south London's Brixton Academy, the
same publication _ now with earnings of some $34 million a year _
could tell you about a whole lot more than gigs and demos. Where to
find sex in New York, for instance, was on the cover of its
3-year-old New York edition; and, symbolically enough, the
anniversary issue in London featured a long interview with the
British rock star Ian Dury, who, despite a personal battle with
cancer, has metamorphosed into a plumper, slicker version of
himself, albeit with a lingering irreverence _ rather like Time
Out.
</P>
<P>
   For a publication that likes to promote itself as being at the
cutting edge, though, Time Out has been slow to commit
wholeheartedly to the Internet. A plan to expand its World Wide Web
site this month to include the entire output of the magazine was
postponed. Instead, a radically re-designed Web site
(www.timeout.com) is supposed to provide an international look at
events in 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Elliott, owner and founder of Time Out Group, said he had
considered putting the magazine on the Internet to mark the 30th
anniversary, but shelved the idea because of the $1.6 million cost.
Not only that, the very accessibility of the Internet raises a big
question in his mind not just about the nature of a delivery system
but also about how information is valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known since the 1970s that Time Out's future is
electronic but I don't like the idea of it being for free,'' he
said. ``We sell a major package which people are prepared to spend
cash for and I think the idea of making it free, willy-nilly,
overnight, would be irresponsible. And I think the Europeans will
show the Americans that people will pay for content.''
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations show how far the magazine has come from its
birth in a London basement as a fold-out sheet that sold for what
would now be five pence _the equivalent of eight cents.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's name now adorns not just editions in London and
New York, but also franchises in Rome and Paris, along with an
array of eating, drinking and shopping guides. In conjunction with
Penguin Books, the magazine publishes guides to 20 cities from
Amsterdam to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of constant expansion and brand extension, one
question about the publication is where it goes next. One part of
the answer is: further into the United States. Of the 3,000 people
at the Oct. 9 party in Brixton, 79 had been flown in from New York
_ virtually the entire New York staff, which prides itself on
having pushed circulation to more than 85,000 (compared with the
parent magazine's 98,839 in London) following a 31 percent jump in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The performance in New York has encouraged Elliott, 51, to toy
with another U.S. edition _ either in Los Angeles or San Francisco,
Chicago or Washington _ even though the New York start-up cost more
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge expectation that Time Out will go to Los
Angeles,'' Elliott said, but added that no decision will be made
until he is ``sure that New York is paying its way,'' a
breakthrough he forecasts for next year. That will doubtless
hearten Elliott's backers in the New York project _ The Clark
Estates and William Louis Dreyfus _ who, along with Elliott, put up
something between $10 and $30 million (Elliott refused to be more
precise) to start Time Out New York in September 1995, in an
uncertain market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said there was no hope for us,'' said Cyndi Stivers,
editor of the New York edition.'' But, she continued, ``one of the
reasons we succeeded in New York was that we really did it on a
shoestring.''
</P>
<P>
   The austerity, she said, led to ambitious staff members moving
to better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While the New York edition has grown, though, the circulation of
the London version has shrunk by some 11 percent during the same
period, reflecting inroads by listings magazines distributed free
in several British newspapers. Even so, advertising revenue has
risen by a fifth over the same period to the equivalent of around
$14.7 million, or roughly two-thirds of the London magazine's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott says he has turned down inquiries from would-be buyers
for the magazine. ``I have no interest in selling,'' he said. ``I'm
not particularly motivated by having tons of cash in the bank. I
would rather really, really, really enjoy what I'm doing and have a
good living from it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman
Act, as passed by Congress in 1890. As the foundation on which
federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended
several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the
fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for
corporations convicted of violating it. In the case of Microsoft,
the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit
that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a
criminal suit that seeks financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   An Act to Protect Trade And Commerce Against Unlawful Restraints
and Monopolies:
</P>
<P>
   Section 1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to
be illegal. Every person who shall make any such contract or engage
in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine
not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion
of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Section 2. Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade of commerce among the
several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion
of the court.

A CASE MORE ENDURING THAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (A sidebar to running trial coverage)  (ART ADV: A photo of lawyer Norris Washington is being sent to NYT
photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft,
the world's largest independent software company, has spanned
Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds of
government lawyers and investigators. But it has by no means been
an example of consistent, coordinated public policy. Nor, by all
accounts, of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like the software industry itself, the government's
pursuit of Microsoft has taken leaps, hit dead ends and evolved in
ways no one could have controlled or predicted back when it started
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It was in November of that year, on a hot afternoon at a
computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, Nev., that Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, looked like he'd been dragged to the news
conference with a senior executive from IBM _ which at the time
dominated Microsoft and the entire computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies _ IBM, then the leading maker of personal
computers and Microsoft, the leader in PC operating system software
_ were collaborating on the design and marketing of a new operating
system called OS/2. But Microsoft was also beginning to sell a
competing product, Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The industry trade press was full of worried articles: which
system was going to become the new standard?
</P>
<P>
   With Gates standing uncomfortably at his side, James Cannavino,
an IBM divisional president, said that the two companies wanted to
``clear the air.'' OS/2 was the future, he said. As for Windows, he
added, it would remain a niche product for under-equipped
computers. Windows, he asserted, would never receive all the
advanced features of OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   Gates certainly did not look happy. But he did not disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference got little attention, just a few articles
deep inside newspapers and trade publications. But a few weeks
later, Norris Washington, a senior antitrust lawyer with the
Federal Trade Commission, happened to read one of those articles,
in Byte magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM and Microsoft have now defined their unified vision of
graphical operating environments,'' the article said, ``and it
looks sort of like a U.S. economic model,'' divided into lower-,
middle- and upper-class products.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington saw it, IBM and Microsoft were colluding to divide
the operating-system market _ a potential violation of antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation of Microsoft and IBM
And since that small first step, Microsoft has been under
unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators for a
constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month after
month, year after year, for the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the antitrust trial scheduled to begin on Monday, with
a multiplicity of charges woven of threads drawn from more than a
dozen different investigative inquiries during that nine-year span.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, today the most feared company in the software
business and carrying a stock-market value of nearly $234 billion,
presents a huge and highly visible antitrust target.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the company's allies ask, ``What is the Clinton
administration's political agenda in going after Microsoft?'' the
answer seems to be there is none.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior
antitrust officials _ whether friends of the government or of
Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a
natural outgrowth of the previous investigations. As for politics,
all the officials agreed that the antitrust division operates
independent of the administration's political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rule was the assistant attorney general who headed the
antitrust division during the Bush administration, and he is now a
Washington lawyer who serves as an adviser and advocate for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there,'' Rule said of his Justice days, ``the White
House was punctilious in terms of never getting involved in
whatever we decided to do. There was no communication between
antitrust and other branches of government.'' Asked if he believed
that policy had changed under the Clinton administration, he said:
``Not really. I've seen nothing to suggest it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joel Klein heads the antitrust division now, and in an interview
dealing with his division's role in the Clinton administration's
technology policy, not specifically relating to the Microsoft case,
he said: ``There is no statutory restriction, but as a practical
matter, civil and criminal prosecutions are invariably carried out
without any political contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said, by way of examples, that he might discuss merger
cases involving military or aviation industries with the Defense
Department or Transportation Department. ``But never the White
House,'' he said. ``For a significant case, we might call the White
House and say `An hour from now we are going to hold a press
conference.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time there was any interference,'' he added, ``was
the Dita Beard-ITT case.'' Mrs. Beard, a lobbyist for ITT Corp.,
was accused in 1972 of having written a memo saying that a $400,000
donation to the Republican National Convention had ``gone a long
way'' toward settling antitrust suits brought against the company
by the Nixon administration's Justice Department. The authenticity
of the memo was never proved, and Mrs. Beard always denied writing
it. In any case, Klein says, ``since Watergate, it's been
immaculate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Microsoft, neither President Clinton nor Vice
President Al Gore has ever volunteered a comment. In answer to a
question during a news conference in May, just before the suit was
filed, Clinton said: ``I have taken the view that I should not
comment on matters within the Justice Department. At this time, I
do not think I should depart from that policy on this case, even
though it obviously will have a big impact on an important sector
of our economy. But I have to say, based on what I know to date, I
have confidence in the way the antitrust division in the Justice
Department has handled the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Clinton has said nothing else about the case,
publicly at least. And Gore, who generally represents the
administration on technology issues, has never commented at all.
</P>
<P>
   In Rule's opinion, the administration would be foolish to
involve itself, even if it were politically acceptable to do so.
``It would be a little odd for the administration to push the
Justice Department in this suit,'' he said. ``It would be a policy
mistake and a political mistake. I would be hard pressed to explain
why they would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking sides in the highly charged technology world is
dangerous, particularly since the Democrats rely on Silicon Valley
companies for political donations and support. In fact, the present
and former government officials all said the suit was simply a
natural extension of the inquiries conducted during the last nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   They began at the FTC. Soon after Washington read that article
in Byte, the FTC staff opened an investigation of the Windows-OS/2
question. But as has happened so often in the following years,
turns in the market made the initial inquiry irrelevant. Microsoft
abandoned its agreement with IBM, and Windows quickly grew to be
the industry standard, while OS/2 remained a cipher.
</P>
<P>
   But as that issue faded, once government investigators began
looking at Microsoft they found other things that troubled them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Washington, who still works for the FTC, informed
Microsoft that the investigation was being expanded. The agency,
his letter said, was now trying to determine whether Microsoft was
using its dominant position in operating-systems software to stifle
competition in other areas. That general idea lies at the heart of
the present suit.
</P>
<P>
   One former senior FTC official said the commission staff had
confidence in the case but realized that the Reagan-era
commissioners, who had to approve any suit, might have a different
view. ``We knew the commission might have difficulty with a
monopolization case,'' the former official said. ``They hadn't
brought a case in years.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, in 1993 the commission voted 2-2 on the question of
whether to file formal charges. The deadlock served as a dismissal.
Then, a few months later, the Justice Department decided to pick up
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was farther along than most cases we got,'' recalled Robert
Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division who is now at the Brookings Institution.
``Usually a case would be two or three people complaining and a few
documents,'' he said. ``But this was a fully researched record.
They gave us the files and briefed us on what they had done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lawyers picked up the same thread. ``The
general idea behind our inquiry,'' Litan said, ``was that they
should not be allowed to use their monopoly in operating systems to
cement a monopoly in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent
agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers
to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer
sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating
system, MS-DOS or Windows, was installed. The company also agreed
to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of
another. The charges in the present suit are similar in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the agreement, the government investigations
continued. That same year, Justice Department investigators showed
up at the offices of Netscape Communications Corp. for the first
time to ask questions about their next line of inquiry. ``America
Online had been complaining,'' a senior Netscape executive
recalled, ``because Microsoft was bundling the Microsoft Network,''
a competing online service, ``with Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Once more, market forces overtook the investigation. The
Microsoft Network never grew particularly popular while America
Online prospered and grew. But, not surprisingly, new complaints
filled the void. In May 1995, Anne Bingaman, the assistant attorney
general who headed the antitrust division, remarked: ``We get
complaints about Microsoft all the time. We have become a kind of
Microsoft complaints center. And we take them very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Netscape's first complaint arrived. In a letter to the
Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its
dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or
persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, used to
explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape. The
next year the Justice Department formally charged Microsoft with
violating the consent agreement by tying sales of Windows to
installation of the company's Web browser on new computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a slam-dunk violation of the consent decree,''
a natural extension of that case, recalled Litan, who had left the
department by then.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal District Court judge agreed, but an Appeals Court
panel overturned that ruling this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state
attorneys general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is
scheduled for trial on Monday. It contends that Microsoft has
engaged in bundling, tying and other predatory behavior similar in
many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations
of the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good part of this case is just Round II of the case we dealt
with in Round I,'' in the early in the 1990s, Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the former senior FTC official put it, ``there's
certainly a common thread that runs all the way through here.'' But
through the years that thread has been twisted, pulled and spun by
hundreds of different hands.

Avoiding terminal problems with your PC not hard 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are at least 12 ways to kill your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of PCs, I spent a lot of time urging people to
be experimental and reassuring them that nothing they could do to
their PC _ short of giving it the 10-foot drop test _ could wreck
it. Reassurances like that were needed because, in those days,
operating a PC was something akin to being the first on your block
to have an automobile back in the days of the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Now that computers are so much a part of the family, we may have
gotten too comfortable with them. While PCs are fairly sturdy
beasts these days _ certainly more so than they were five or six
years ago _ there is a limit to the abuse a PC can take. So today
we'll look at some of the fairly common mistakes that can destroy
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most common way to ruin a computer is through
voltage surges. If you don't have a good voltage surge protector,
get one. And if you do have one, please don't rely on it during an
electrical storm. Unplug your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Heat can also kill a computer. And there are several simple
precautions that you can take to avoid overcooking your machine.
For one, make sure the covering for the exhaust fan is not clogged
with dirt and dust. It is fairly easy to remove the cover and
gently vacuum the dust away (I avoid using compressed air to blow
it away since you're likely to blow all the dirt onto the
motherboard, where it can do even more damage). Also check to make
sure there is at least four inches of clearance on all sides of
your machine, especially at the rear, where the exhaust fan is
located.
</P>
<P>
   While we're talking about heat, let's cover one of your most
expensive computer accessories, the monitor. Not too long ago I was
sitting in the newsroom, typing happily away when I smelled smoke.
I looked down the row of desks and saw a monitor smoking like a
cowboy with a hand-rolled cigarette. The reporter at that desk had
used the top of the monitor as a shelf _ loaded it down with old
newspapers and magazines. That blocked the air circulation from the
vent holes at the top and, over time, generated enough heat to
actually start a fire. If you want a fire, rub two sticks together.
Monitors make expensive kindling. Obviously the same rule applies
to your computer itself: Don't use it as a place to pile stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The next mistake won't immediately wreck your computer. Instead
think of the harm it does as similar to what smoking cigarettes
does to humans. It slowly destroys.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about turning your computer on and off many times a
day. Each time you do that, the components inside the computer get
a little jolt of electricity. I couldn't get technical about this
if I tried, but several bad things can happen to the components _
including your processor chip _ as they receive this jolt.
Eventually you can destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take this advice to mean you should never turn your
computer off. Instead, it's a good idea to turn it on when you
start using it after work and then turn it off before going to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most of us are comfortable performing small tasks under
the hood of a computer _ changing the modem card, adding memory or
changing some other plug-in component. You probably already know to
turn off the power before you do this. But you also need to know
that static electricity is a real killer when chips and other
delicate components are involved.
</P>
<P>
   _ So make sure you're not carrying a static charge before you
open that package with the new memory chips, or touch any component
inside the computer. It's easy to do that. Simply touch the metal
exterior of the computer case before getting started on your work.
And if you are working over a carpeted surface, especially in the
winter (not a good idea), discharge any static repeatedly as you
work.
</P>
<P>
   _ These tips should help you keep your computer running at least
as dependably as a Model T.

Itty-bitty video great for enclosing in e-mail 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company called AVerMedia has given me a new way to bedevil my
friends. Now I can send them little movies of my dog, my guinea
pigs, my wife or myself (I may be mean but I'm not a sadist).
</P>
<P>
   The AVerMedia InterCam kit consists of a peripheral card, a
microphone and stand, and a little camera the size and shape of a
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up this little video system is about as easy as it can
get. The card requires a PCI slot. If you have a Pentium computer
of fairly recent vintage, it will have plenty of available PCI
slots unless you have been buying some very sophisticated stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Once the card is installed, all that remains is to plug the
camera into it and the microphone. If you want talkies, plug into
the mike input on your sound card, and install the software, which
is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   One does not expect much from a video camera the size of a
baseball that comes in a $120 package. The key to enjoying InterCam
is having fun.
</P>
<P>
   The InterCam camera has two controls: an on-off switch and a
focusing ring that surrounds the lens. When you call up the
InterCam program, it presents you with a video box about 2 inches
wide and an inch and a half high. You can enlarge this all the way
to full screen, but you don't want to. It becomes extremely fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with the camera is its shape. It sits in a
depression in a soft plastic support, and the cable tying it to the
capture card is annoyingly stiff, fighting you every time you
adjust the camera's position.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn the camera on, it gives you a view of what it
sees, but it doesn't begin recording until you click the record
button in the software. When you turn off recording, you can view
the video you just recorded. Once you save it to disk, however, you
can no longer view it through the AVerMedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The video is saved as an AVI file, and you can
view it just fine through the Video for Windows or the Active Movie
feature found in Media Device in the Accessories group of Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no experience with digital video, you need to know
that these files can be huge. They have to be compressed, and the
software allows a selection from among a number of video
compression formats. I chose the Microsoft decompressor, on the
theory that everybody to whom I would send a video would have it,
and set the quality to 75 percent. Choosing 100 percent quality
greatly increases file size.
</P>
<P>
   I also selected 50 frames per minute in the software, rather
than the default 20, which tends to be rather jerky.
</P>
<P>
   A video 10 or 15 seconds long is going to be about 10 megabytes
in size. You won't make any friends sending 10-megabyte e-mails.
But trying to make two- to three-second videos is extremely
difficult in some cases, such as making videos of my piggies. I put
the camera down in their enclosure and waited for them to come
around.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to handle this, since the AVerMedia software has no
editing features, is to keep your videos to a reasonable length _
15 seconds or so _ save them to disk, and then call them up in the
Video for Windows feature mentioned above. Using this, you can make
a selection of a few seconds from anywhere in the video and copy it
into a file.
</P>
<P>
   This way you can get a file down into the 200K range, attach it
to an e-mail message and send it out without becoming Attila the
Geek.
</P>
<P>
   As these things go, $120 is pretty cheap, and AVerMedia's
InterCam is the best cheap thrill I've had in a long time.

Let your Mac do the Windows 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtual PC is one of the most amazing pieces of software I've
ever seen. Apple Computer should include it on every G3 model it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Why the enthusiasm? Because Virtual PC delivers as advertised.
It seamlessly simulates a Windows computer on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though this hasn't been tried before. Insignia
Solutions still sells its Windows emulator called SoftWindows. But
SoftWindows is a clunker compared with Virtual PC.
</P>
<P>
   With Virtual PC, you can run anything from Microsoft Office to
the latest multimedia game on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Virtual PC will run PC games. I tested it with a
very demanding one called ``Sid Meier's Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, a real-time simulation of the famous Civil War battle,
ran fine. There was a slight loss of speed, and the video and sound
were jumpy at times. But I played the game on a G3 PowerBook for
hours without a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is easy to install and use. Switching back and forth
between operating systems is a breeze. Just click on the desktop,
and you jump back to the Apple Computer's operating system. You
click inside the Virtual PC window to go back to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, running Windows 95 and Apple Computer's operating
system side by side really showcases the Mac. Windows 95 seemed
awkward and unintuitive compared to the Mac operating system. But
that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   What's amazing about Virtual PC is it's all software. In effect,
Virtual PC is tricking the Mac into believing it's a PC. Virtual PC
emulates not only Windows 95 but Windows 3.1 and DOS. You can also
buy a version that handles Windows 98, Microsoft's latest operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   While Virtual PC emulates any PC operating system, it won't work
on just any Mac. You need one with a powerful microprocessor.
Developer Connectix, for example, recommends Apple Computer's new
G3 models.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but Virtual PC will not work on Macs with chips
pre-dating the PowerPC microprocessor. Its performance is sluggish
on early models of the PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC is a storage and memory hog. You need at least 32
megabytes of RAM and 150 megabytes of storage to run Windows 95.
Despite its requirements, Virtual PC is worth the money. It retails
for $149.

It's a snap to convert figures on Web 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Wide Web has made the world smaller and friendlier.
And, nowadays, it is certainly easier to chat with friends from
Brazil in the morning and acquaintances from Australia at night.
But all this worldwide chat and e-mail has also added some
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when your friend in Sao Paulo tells you it is a
lovely day with temperatures hovering around 30 degrees, you may
feel a little shivery here in the land where the Fahrenheit
standard for expressing temperatures reigns. But in Brazil (as they
do in Europe), temperatures are most commonly expressed on the
Celsius scale. So, if you can remember the formula and have a
calculator, you'll know that it was a lovely 86 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, just one example of the conversions that are
necessary to keep in tune with people from around the world. You
can buy reference books, or even computer programs, that will help
you perform the calculations. But since you have access to the Web,
you don't need them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with temperatures. You'll find a page at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .valdosta.peachnet.edu/vsu
</P>
<P>
   /dept/aux/animation/degree.html that will do all the math for
you. Just enter the temperature in either F. or C. and click on the
page. In fractions of a second, you'll have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful conversion page is called Measurement Units
Translation at http://www.ur.ru/(tilde)sg/transl/. Lets say you
want to convert 1,000 square yards into acres. Just fill in the
blank and click. Before long you'll know, perhaps with a degree of
accuracy that surpasses your needs, that figures out to be
0.20657991628077077 of an acre.
</P>
<P>
   A matter of time
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about time. Suppose you have been working at a
project for three weeks and you'd like to express this fact to your
boss in more graphic and impressive terms. Just mosey on over to a
page called Measurements Units _ Time at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/timeconv.htm. Then type the numeral ``3'' into the
correct box and click. Now you can brag that you've been working
for 30,390 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the cars measure speed in kilometers an hour, instead
of miles an hour. So you may want to bookmark the conversion page
at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .text-trieve.com/products/
</P>
<P>
   references/speedconv.htm. That way, when a friend explains they
drove to grandmother's house at an average speed of 120, you'll
know that they were traveling at 74.5643262 miles an hour. Still
pretty fast but a lot safer than 120 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next conversion table has nothing at all to do with foreign
relations. It's more domestic. Now that interest rates are lower
than they've been in years, you may be thinking of buying a house,
or financing some other big purchase. But you'll want to know what
the mortgage payments will be.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of resources for this on the Web, but one good
one is the Mortgage Calculator at http://www.by-owner-ol.com/
</P>
<P>
   mortgage.html. Let's say you are borrowing $100,000 at 6.5
percent interest for a term of 30 years. Just fill in the blanks,
and soon you'll know that your payments (for the loan amount, not
including insurance and taxes that probably will be added in) will
be $632.07.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I cannot find a single site on the Web that will
transfer the money you need for a down payment at the click of a
mouse.

EDITORIAL: GIRLS AND COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the American Association of University Women
shows that a troubling gender gap in computer use exists in high
schools. Girls make up only a small percentage of students who take
high-level computer courses that might lead to technology careers.
Yet they are more likely than boys to take data-entry classes, the
high-tech equivalent of typing.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that girls tend to use computers in
limited ways, such as for word processing, while boys are more
likely to use computers to solve problems or to develop their own
programs. In one study, girls consistently rated themselves as less
competent in computers than boys. This suggests that many girls are
starting to see the high-tech world as a masculine domain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the gender gap is created outside the classroom.
Computer toys are more heavily marketed to boys, and most computer
games and even educational software have more male characters than
female characters. But teachers sensitive to these issues could
help turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the association raised the nation's awareness of a
gender gap in enrollment in math and science courses in high
school. In less than a decade, that gap has been narrowed because
educators worked to increase girls' participation. Now educators
must insure that girls are not inadvertently left out of the
computer revolution.

WOMAN REUNITED WITH FATHER SHE FOUND ONLINE AFTER 50 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SONIA GIORDANI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Since Sharon Sylchak found her long-lost
father through the Internet recently, she's waited anxiously to
complete the puzzle of her life _ to meet him in person.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the 53-year-old Simi Valley woman's wait ended as she
watched her father, Earl Papkie, enter the terminal at Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I felt like I had half an identity. Now that I've
found my father, I feel like I can know who I am _ the whole
story,'' Sylchak said.
</P>
<P>
   She was a little girl, not quite 4, when she last saw him.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded airport terminal, 75-year-old Papkie embraced his
only child as tears streamed down their faces. With their own eyes
welling with tears, spectators watched as Sylchak introduced her
father to the grandchildren and great-grandchildren he had never
known before.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in an airport wheelchair with his 2-year-old
great-granddaughter, Miranda, in his lap, Papkie said he still
couldn't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have known I have all these beautiful kids?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sylchak had dialed up operators in Michigan, where
she was born and thought her father might still be living. When
nothing turned up, she tried writing to the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She had nearly given up when she received an America Online
start-up disk in the mail and hooked up to the Internet. It was
there she would track down her dad's phone number in St. Helen,
Mich., and leave him a message on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard it, I thought, you've got to be joking. I tried
for 30 years to find her,'' said Papkie, a former rancher who wore
a black cowboy hat and boots to look his best for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Before even making it to the car to go home, Papkie couldn't
resist opening up his carry-on bag and digging out an armful of
photographs of Sharon as a little girl and showing off the
portraits of her he has kept in his wallet all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Papkie and Sylchak's mother had been married for less than two
months when their relationship ended. When Sylchak was born, her
mother gave the baby to Papkie's parents because she already was
raising two children from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Papkie _ then in his early 20s _ helped his own
parents raise the child. But Sylchak's mother reclaimed custody of
the girl, and Papkie never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about this moment. He talked about her the
whole flight,'' said Edie Mazurek, a resident of Northbrook, Ill.,
who sat next to Papkie on the flight to Los Angeles. ``He was also
very nervous _ this was his first flight, and I think he knew what
would be waiting for him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Local television stations as well as ``Inside Edition'' had
their cameras rolling when Papkie arrived, trying to catch every
moment of a touching story about Sylchak's family and about the
persistence it took for their reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew he was alive,'' said David Boyer, one of
Sylchak's four children who, with his two daughters and brothers
George and Charlie, met Papkie at the airport. ``My grandmother
died when I was young. So this is exciting for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members would spend the rest of the day in Sylchak's
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he must be exhausted, so we'll let him rest. But then
we'll get around to telling our tales from the last 50 years,''
Sylchak said.

WEB ADVERTISERS GET NEW TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROL EMERT   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A top consumer research firm is launching a service today
designed to give Web advertisers highly detailed, statistically
significant data about who is seeing their ads.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a bottled water company advertising on the Web will be able
to figure out how many of the ads it sent into cyberspace were
viewed by its target audience _ for example, women aged 35 to 44
who drink bottled water and live west of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The service, Millward Brown Interactive's Voyager Profile,
recruited 50,000 consumers who filled out a lengthy questionnaire
on the Web detailing their demographic information and consumption
habits.
</P>
<P>
   These volunteers received an electronic identification tag that
identifies them as Voyager panelists. When they visit a Web page,
ad servers _ companies that broadcast ads to various Web sites _
recognize them as Voyager panelists and keep track of which ads
they've seen.
</P>
<P>
   That information is sent back to Millward Brown, which can tell
the advertiser the demographic profile of all the panelists who've
seen their ads.
</P>
<P>
   The servers are not privy to the personal information disclosed
by the panelists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something Internet advertisers have been crying out
for,'' said Michael Tann, a vice president with AdForce of
Cupertino. ``This fundamentally brings the same kind of credible
market research that's used in the established media into the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mracek, vice president of marketing for AdKnowledge, an ad
server in New York, said he sees the service as an adjunct to
ratings services such as New York's Media Metrix, which uses a
panel of 40,000 computer users to project the demographics of
visitors to different sites.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix tracks visitors to sites, but they don't know which
ads every visitor sees because people visiting the same site at the
same time may see different ads.
</P>
<P>
   Voyager is designed to make up for that anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Once an ad campaign runs, planners can use Voyager to fine tune
the mix of sites where they buy ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if 60 percent of the people who viewed the campaign
are women and the advertiser was trying to reach 75 percent women,
planners will know to buy more ad space on female-oriented sites
the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   Millward Brown will charge advertisers $1,500 to $2,000 per
report.
</P>
<P>
   One other service, NetRatings of Milpitas, is attempting to
measure ad audiences. But that company, which also provides site
ratings a la Media Metrix, uses a panel of only 3,500 consumers,
which is not big enough to provide statistically valid data about
many Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Meadows, vice president of marketing for NetRatings, noted
that Voyager reports are largely limited to ads that have been
distributed by ad servers that are working with Millward Brown,
including AdKnowledge, AdForce and industry leader DoubleClick,
which serves about 30 percent of Web ads.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Briggs, a Millward Brown Interactive vice president, said
the sample of panelists is large enough to provide statistically
significant data on the vast majority of Web ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The panel represents about 1.5 percent of the total Web
population of 61 million, which is a larger percentage than most
samples used by ratings services in other media, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   Voyager panelists are recruited by random telephone calls and
don't receive anything except the chance to win free prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Millward Brown is based in Chicago; its interactive division is
based in San Francisco.

 How to Transfer Documents to A New iMac  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: I have a lot of documents on my old Macintosh that I'd
like to transfer into my new iMac. But how can I do this, since the
iMac has no floppy drive?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Good question, which you really should be asking Apple's
grand pooh-bah, Steve Jobs, since it was his idea to leave out the
floppy. It's clear that he cares more about aesthetics than about
making life easy on customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to get the job done. You can
transfer files from your old Mac to the iMac by running a phone
cable between the computers' modems. Or, if your old Mac has an
Ethernet networking card, you can transfer directly into the
Ethernet port on the iMac, which is faster than using modems.
</P>
<P>
   For detailed instructions on both of these methods, go to the
Tech Info Library on Apple's Web site at til.info.apple.com. In the
box labled No. 1, open the drop-down menu and choose Find Article .
The modem instructions are in article number 22229. The
instructions for Ethernet are in article 43015.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to use FreeDrive (www.freedrive.com), a
free service that lets you store information (up to 7.5 megabytes)
on the Web. You can upload files from your Mac, and download them
into your iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to purchase one of the new sub-$1,000 computers. Is
there any reason to choose among Celeron, Cyrix M II and AMD K6-2
processors? I don't do a lot of computer stuff. I mostly use
e-mail, do some Web browsing (not games) and I would like to learn
to keep financial records on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   A: For your needs, any sub-$1,000 should do the job. The
differences in these chips only start showing up when you need lots
of processing power, as with video and 3-D graphics. If you're
looking at a PC with a Celeron chip, make sure it's one of the
second-generation Celerons. The first ones didn't have second-level
cache, a form of memory that speeds up processing. As a result,
they were chronic underachievers. The new Celerons have a small
cache built right onto the chip, and reportedly they're pretty
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I upgraded to Windows 98 a few weeks ago, I selected the
option that allows me to keep a Windows 95 backup on my hard drive.
Now that I see that Windows 98 is going to work fine, I want to
delete Windows 95, which seems to gobble up a lot of disk space.
Can this be done safely?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right. The backup for Windows 95 is taking up as much
as 80 megs on your hard drive. To get rid of it, go to the
Add/Remove Programs feature in the Windows Control Panel and select
Delete Windows 98 uninstall information. (To get to the Control
Panel, click the Start button and point to Settings.)
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason that doesn't work, you can always just delete
winundo.dat, a hidden file that contains all the Windows 95 system
files. Winundo.dat is stored in your root directory (usually the C:
folder). You can remove it using Windows Explorer, but first you'll
have to configure Explorer so you can see hidden files. To do that,
choose Folder Options from the View menu, tab over to View in the
Folder Options window and choose Show All Files.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed that a lot of new mice have a little roller
between the buttons. What does it do, and is it worth my while to
buy one when my old mouse works perfectly well?
</P>
<P>
   A: The roller _ also called a wheel _ lets you scroll vertically
through directories and documents. You also can press the roller
till it clicks, then scroll simply by moving the mouse forward and
backward. It saves time and also helps minimize the movement of
your arm, hand and elbow, all of which come into play when you use
regular scroll bars. Mice with rollers are made by Microsoft,
Logitech and others and start at around $30.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MORE TRY: A while back I mentioned a feature on the 3Com Web
site that lets you determine whether your telephone line is capable
of using a 56K modem. The address I gave came out wrong in some
newspapers that carry this column. So here's a sure-fire way to
find this feature. Go to www.3com.com. Under Select a Product
Category, choose 56K Connectivity. Then select What do I need for
56K? One of the options will be Test Your Phone Line, which ends
with a link to the Line Test Tool.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The latest upgrade of America Online's software _ version 4.0 _
lets you switch between screen names without signing off. That way,
you can easily use one screen name for personal mail, and another
one for business stuff. You'll find the Switch Screen Name option
in the Sign Off menu.

COMPULSIVE COMPUTER USERS TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE REAL WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By CAROLYN POIROT  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe, like one addict, you believe your $400 phone bill must be
paid before the $40 water bill.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you don't have time for the people you love but who just
seem to take so much effort, and you'd rather connect with new
friends on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's simpler. Maybe you just find your fingers
anxiously making typing movements when you're away from your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   If any of this is true, it may be that you're addicted to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some people find themselves sneaking online in the middle of the
night or calling in sick so they can stay home and surf the Net,
says Jim Landers, a counselor with Family Service in Fort Worth.
Still, they don't recognize that what has gotten hold of them is a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get called mostly for relationship problems,'' Landers
says. ``They don't come in for help with an Internet addiction, but
when they call for help with a relationship problem, we sometimes
find an addiction to the Internet behind it. I've talked with men
who say they spend 10 hours a day on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet addiction is a psychological dependence on the Internet
or compulsive computer use to the point that it causes family and
relationship problems, job loss, physical exhaustion or failure in
school.
</P>
<P>
   With more people gaining access to the Internet daily,
increasing numbers of people are becoming involved with strangers
they ``meet'' in chat rooms, sometimes throwing away the lives they
have for a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, people are simply becoming so mesmerized by the
Internet that they are neglecting other areas of their lives, such
as their families or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kimberly Young, assistant professor of psychology at the
University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, Pa., and director of the
Center for Online Addiction, presents workshops to train counselors
to deal with Internet addicts. Her book, ``Caught in the Net''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $22.95), offers information on how to recognize
signs of Internet addiction and strategies for recovery. (Addicts
note: Young can be reached through her Web site
www.netaddiction.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of the Internet can definitely disrupt one's academic,
social, financial and occupational life,'' Young says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet Addiction Disorder is not yet listed in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, counselors
say it is often linked with other addictions, especially sex, work
and gambling addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Young conducted an online survey that found that, in well over
half the cases, Internet junkies suffered from prior addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, says Landers, what we call an Internet
addiction is really a sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty to ninety percent of the time it's a sexual addiction.
The Internet amplifies the problem. You can act out your fantasies
and not have to deal with the shame you would feel otherwise
because no one knows who you are. You do things you wouldn't do
otherwise. There are no checks and balances,'' Landers says.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy relationships are easy, he says. You think, ``I've found
my soul mate.'' The problem is that you've really just found a
superficial connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look up someone to meet online with the exact
inclinations and quirks you are looking for _ but you might be
getting a woman who is really a man or something else you don't
bargain for and are not expecting,'' Landers warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say they are addicted to the Net, it's not to
their computer or the information highway itself, but to some way
they can use it for satisfaction they are not finding elsewhere,''
the counselor says. ``Usually there are relationship problems they
are not dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some people who say they recognize their addiction
turn back to the Net for solutions, a measure critics liken to
Alcoholics Anonymous groups meeting at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Online support groups, such as Webaholics and Interneters
Anonymous, say they'll help Net surfers who want to overcome their
addictions to cybersex or information overload. Virtual clinics
promise assistance for those who need immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that these kinds of computer-centered resources may
simply gratify the same need for undemanding, unrealistic
connections that are the basis of many Internet-born relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Landers cautions that one danger of the Web is that people who
don't make friends well in person may suddenly start to feel
falsely connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is about connections,'' he admits. ``But most of
the problems I see are about disconnections.''

 Battle Over Cybersmut Set to Begin Again  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of civil liberties groups plans to file a lawsuit
this week challenging a controversial online pornography amendment
that is part of the $500 billion omnibus spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ink dries on President Clinton's expected signature
of the bill, the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Privacy
Information Centerand Electronic Frontier Foundation will file a
joint lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia, alleging the bill
stifles the free exchange of ideas and could be interpreted
differently in various jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the suit will mirror an earlier suit that last year
successfully killed off the Communications Decency Act, Congress'
first attempt to limit cybersmut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this becomes law, the Starr report would be illegal,'' said
Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
in San Francisco. ``The same people who pushed the Starr report are
pushing this legislation. In its haste to make that extremely
graphic report available to millions of people online, Congress may
be the most successful pornographers in the history of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping $500 billion appropriations bill is sprinkled with
high-tech-friendly legislation that liberalizes limits on foreign
visas, places a three-year moratorium on new local and state
Internet taxes and extends a research-and-development tax credit
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pornography amendments are considered a black eye
for the industry amid the flurry of last-minute legislative
victories. They are still opposed by free-speech advocates and
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions would impose criminal penalties on commercial Web
sites that allow anyone 17 or under to access pornographic material
deemed ``harmful to minors.'' Violators would face up to $50,000 in
fines and six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, they mandate that adult-oriented sites require a
credit card or personal ID number to ensure that only adults can
access them; if not, the sites face state and local taxes. Internet
service providers would be required to provide information on
filtering software to block salacious content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' said an ACLU spokeswoman.
``We've gone through this before, haven't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the original
Communications Decency Act trampled free-speech rights. That
legislation, ironically, was also added at the 11th hour to a much
larger bill, the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the new legislation, scornfully called CDA II, ``suffers
from the same constitutional problems as the first CDA,'' said
Chris Hansen, senior staff counsel of the ACLU in New York. ``In
the name of protecting children, it tries to ban speech which is
constitutionally protected for adults.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to narrow the bill in accordance with the Supreme
Court's CDA decision, the new anti-pornography measures apply only
to commercial Web sites instead of the entire Internet and use a
``harmful-to- minors'' standard instead of a broader indecency
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The ``harmful-to-minors'' standard would allow access to
material that had redeeming social, political or artistic value,
such as Web sites on breast cancer or AIDS awareness. That
standard, its defenders claim, has been upheld in federal and state
courts for decades and is the legal basis for pornography statutes
in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the Supreme Court decision (on the original CDA)
closely and rewrote (the proposed legislation) to apply the
principles of pornography law to the Web,'' said Peggy Peterson,
communications director for Representative Michael Oxley, R-Ohio,
who authored portions of the bill. ``It's not legal for a child to
go into a video store and buy an X-rated film. Those materials are
placed behind a wall or under a table. We're trying to apply that
same standard to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scoffed at arguments that the Starr report violates the
new anti-porn bills. She said the government document was released
for noncommercial reasons, did not contain graphic images and ``was
not designed to appeal to prurient interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties groups ``complained the CDA was too broad.
Now they're complaining this bill isn't broad enough,'' said Shyla
Welch, communications director at Enough is Enough, a Fairfax, Va.,
nonprofit organization that wants to restrict online pornography.
``Is there anything that will make these people happy? I think we
know the answer.''

 Turning Around Sybase _ CEO Found Strategy Through Golf  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Chen joined Sybase as president a little more than a
year ago, he had a mystery to solve: How could a company with loyal
customers and a billion dollars in sales fail to make a profit?
</P>
<P>
   Chen, now chief executive of the ailing database software-maker,
found the answer in one of his chief passions: golf. Sybase was
like a player on a difficult course who used the same club no
matter what hole or hazard he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play a round of golf with one club, you don't really
maximize your chances of success,'' said Chen, who has hit the
links with the likes of Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a string of money-losing quarters and a plunging
stock price. Sybase shares, which traded as high as $54 a share in
early 1995, closed Monday at $6.25, up 63 cents,before the company
announced third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After five consecutive quarterly losses and a break-even second
quarter, the Emeryville, Calif., company posted a $2.2 million (3
cents a share) profit for the three months ended September 30. That
reverses a third-quarter loss of $6 million (8 cents) the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected a break-even quarter, according to IBES
International. It was the second-straight quarter that the company
beat analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues climbed nearly 10 percent to $233 million from $210.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the improved third quarter is a sign of better things
to come as he works to pull Sybase out of its three-year losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged at everything we've done. We made money,
and we generated cash. I'd like to see revenues go up faster, but I
think we achieved what we set out to do,'' said Chen, who jets to
Singapore today to open a new development center intended to build
business in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase once was a leader in the market for database software _
software used to keep track of things like hotel reservations and
financial transactions. The company has been struggling to recover
from a strategic stumble in the mid-1990s, at the same time the
database industry has been mired in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 43, took over as CEO from Mitchell Kertzman last month
after the two had shared the job for about seven months. Chen's
first move was to create a division to make and sell database
software for laptops and other portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the company's businesses, which include selling
electronic-commerce software and consulting, will operate as a
single division, Chen said, which he hopes will provide the
flexibility and accountability the firm needs to succeed. In the
past, Sybase ran these disparate businesses as one _ selling costly
corporate databases the same way it was selling small, portable
databases, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Software for mobile and so-called embedded computers _ computing
devices that help run cars, cellular telephones, pagers and small
appliances _ has been Sybase's fastest-growing business, though
Chen declined to disclose sales figures. He's counting on the new
unit to jump start revenue growth and raise the company's profile
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street isn't convinced. Mobile databases, which
sell for $25 to $100 apiece, won't bring in enough revenue to turn
Sybase around, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems difficult for a company to make its fortune selling
databases that run on machines powered by AA batteries, which is
what Sybase seems to be focused on these days,'' said Merv Adrian,
database analyst at Giga Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tholemeier, who follows the database industry for First
Albany (and is one of the few analysts with a ``buy'' on Sybase
stock) said he believes that the strategy is all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going after niche markets, Tholemeier thinks that the
company should focus on existing corporate customers, selling them
consulting services, software tools and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is going to stay low as long as these guys aren't
making a profit,'' he said. ``The company needs to make money and
support the existing universe (of customers). All these other
agendas are not going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said analysts aren't seeing the whole picture, but he won't
reveal any more of his strategic plan until December, when he plans
to meet with analysts in New York, San Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Chen agrees that keeping customers happy is
important _ and he said he's doing that by working with developers
to boost the number of applications that run on Sybase databases.
More than 350 developers have built applications for the company's
mobile database, up 30 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the company added Web-based customer service
and it opened a technology center near Wall Street where its
financial-services customers and software developers can work
jointly on new applications.
</P>
<P>
   Chen hasn't played the role of turnaround artist before, but he
has proven that he knows how to rise to the top. He surged from
executive vice president to chief operating officer at Pyramid
Technology, a Unix workstation vendor, in 1993 and later negotiated
the sale of the company to Seimens Nixdorf Group, a German
high-tech giant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running Pyramid as a Seimens Nixdorf subsidiary,
Chen rose through the ranks to become a member of the German parent
firm's board.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, golf provided the link to Sybase _ he heard
about the job during a round with his Blackhawk neighbor, John
Acosta, Sybase's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong native, Chen came to the United States at age 16 to
attend high school because a teacher had told him it would give him
a better chance of getting into an Ivy League college. (He later
attended Brown University.) Chen was one of three Asian students at
his 1,200-student preparatory school. His English was only so-so.
Ignorant about U.S. holidays, he failed to make Thanksgiving plans
one year and spent the weekend in an unheated dorm, dining on
vending-machine food.
</P>
<P>
   But he succeeded, he said, because he had ``never learned to be
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   He's applied that same determination to the formidable task of
guiding Sybase's recovery. Chen said he had other offers after
Siemens Pyramid but chose struggling Sybase because he likes to fix
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gravitated toward Sybase because it's very complicated and
very big,'' Chen said. ``I like to solve problems.''

SOCCER ROBOT: NOT EXACTLY LOST IN SPACE

   For the soccer mom whose offspring is also a technophile, the
MIT Museum Shop catalog, offering wares found at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, has the Soccer Robot.
</P>
<P>
   The six-legged walker, 3-inches high by 5-inches long, runs
forward, backward and turns a full 360 degrees. Each
build-it-yourself kit comes with Soccer 'Bot, control box (the
machine is connected by a wire) and a soccer ball. The only
disappointment: You have to provide your own field and mini-goal to
make your set-up look like the catalog picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Soccer Robot kit, suggested for ages 10 and older, requires
basic tools for assembly. One robot costs $42.95, or $79.95 for
two. Call 617-253-4462 to order or to request a Museum Shop
catalog.

   AS THE WORLDS TURN: Globes are cool. We've recently been
thinking about and looking at different kinds of globes because,
well, we like them.
</P>
<P>
   Two of our recent favorites are a black globe with a Machine
Age/Art Deco metal base, from the Levenger (``Tools for Serious
Readers'') catalog and the wowing World of Gems Globe, in the
holiday issue of The Smithsonian Catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   Levenger's black globe is simple and striking; the equally
striking gems globe (pictured), as you might imagine, isn't simple.
Each country is hand-cut from precious materials, such as jasper,
jade and mother-of-pearl, and inlaid in a sea of lapis, all atop a
lapis stand. The 12-inch-diameter black globe costs $149; call
800-544-0880 to order.
</P>
<P>
   The gems globe, 8 inches in diameter, costs $2,800, on sale from
$3,200; call 800-322-0344 to order.

<P>
   WINE STEWARDS: Whimsy wins out over wine snobbery when you
present your favorite vintage with the Bottle Butlers.
</P>
<P>
   The humorous, hugging helpers, clad in formal wear, are a
variation on those simple wine holders that use gravity to balance
a bottle horizontally a few inches above the tabletop. Simply stick
the neck of a bottle into the butlers' arms and they stand up,
proffering the wine. Because they're only 8-inches tall and made of
plastic polymers, it's not quite the same as having hired help to
attend to dinner-party duties.
</P>
<P>
   But go ahead and promise guests that ``our butlers will be
serving the wine'' and watch their laughter bubble up when they see
the dapper dudes. Call the International Wine Accessories catalog
at 800-527-4072 to order the $25 Bottle Butlers.

`ANTEHM' IS A ROAD TRIP BEST AVOIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the long history of meandering, self-centered, badly written
books about being on the road, you will be hard put to find one
that's more meandering, self-centered and badly written than
``Anthem: An American Road Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the book, by Shainee Gabel and Kristin Hahn
(Avon Books, New York, $14, 394 pages), was to take to the road to
explore the question, ``What does it mean to be an American
today?'' The two Hollywood women, both 26 at the time, would
crisscross the country, writing a book and making a film about
their findings. The film has already come out, to lukewarm reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The initial concept wasn't bad _ search for the answer through
interviews with a broad section of interesting Americans, including
filmmaker John Waters, author Studs Terkel, journalist Hunter S.
Thompson, novelist John Irving, former Sen. George McGovern, rap
artist Chuck D, actor Robert Redford, singer Willie Nelson,
desegregation champion Charlayne Hunter-Gault and former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   But the book needed an editor and didn't get one. The writing
veers between insufferable prattling and schoolgirl giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the book is given over, not to interviews, but to
the authors talking about how hard it was to get the interviews, or
the trouble they had in finding an address, or how a nagging
stomach ache wouldn't go away. Reading ``Anthem'' is like sitting
in the waiting room of a doctor's office, listening to someone blab
on about liver troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing _ nothing _ is so insignificant that Gabel and Hahn
leave it out. Want to know what they ate on a newsless night?
They'll tell you. Want a description of how hard it was to get an
audience with Thompson? OK, how about half a dozen pages worth?
Want to know how stoked Gabel and Hahn were when they met Thompson,
or Redford, or Jimmy Santiago Baca, or Ferraro? They'll tell you,
moon eyes shining.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a road book. This is the diary of two
celebrity-stricken women who had enough chutzpah to arrange
interviews with people worth listening to, then decided their views
on things were just as important as the people they were
interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, uneven as it is, offers considerably less horseradish
than the book. You're better off renting the movie.

<P>
   Herbie Hancock. Verve. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   American vernacular dressed up as tuxedo music, this spiffy
songbook threatens to choke the listener in its high-concept
cologne. Jazz great Herbie Hancock's contribution to the George
Gershwin centennial boasts as many guest stars as a Puff Daddy
production. Though it could have wobbled under the weight of all
those egos, serendipity reigns. Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder
rhapsodize along with Wayne Shorter's soprano on ``Summertime''; a
corps of percussionists led by Cyro Baptista stir an Afro-Caribbean
undertow on ``It Ain't Necessarily So'' and ``Here Come De Honey
Man,'' to which trumpeter Eddie Henderson also lends a muted,
Milesian air. Orchestral interludes, a stride duet with Chick Corea
and a Kathleen Battle cameo complete a ritzy package.

   ``Prolonging the Magic''
</P>
<P>
   Cake. Capricorn. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you talk to, California combo Cake is a prime
example of what's good or what's bad about the alternative music
scene. Gleefully non-cerebral, the group sets smirky,
centimeter-deep lyrics to seemingly tossed-off grooves augmented by
trumpet and occasional theremin. Critics scoff, but the college
party brigade scarfs this stuff up like so much ... well, let's
just say the band's nutrition-free name is perfect. If Cake
sometimes sounds as if it's coasting on its third album, there are
enough angst-free ditties and goofy sing-alongs (``Sheep Go to
Heaven,'' ``Never There'') to keep the frat houses rockin'.

</P>
<P>
   The movie this soundtrack accompanies took top prizes at
Sundance and Cannes, and the album comes appropriately loaded with
rap stars (Q-Tip, Pras). But it's newcomer Black Rob _ the first
Bad Boy artist not afraid to talk violence since labelmate
Notorious B.I.G. was killed _ who's sure to hit the charts with a
bullet. And if there were a trailer for this album, it would be
smart to tout the couplings of Goodie Mob and Esthero (``The World
I Know'') and Big Pun and Next (``Sex, Money &AMP; Drugs''), the
dynamic duos in an otherwise only decent set.

   MCCOY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The story of Margaret Garner _ the
slave woman who killed her 2-year-old daughter in 1856 in
Cincinnati rather than let her be taken back into slavery _ lit a
match in the souls of three very different women, in three very
different ways. The first two women are famous. They are Toni
Morrison and Oprah Winfrey, and Garner's story provided the seed
for Beloved, the 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and the current
movie. The third woman _ Joanne Caputo of Yellow Springs _ is
hardly famous, but her obsession with the case led to the discovery
of the Boone County, Ky., farm where Garner worked as a slave.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The other day a friend's
four-year-old grandson climbed onto my lap, took my face in his
hands, and declared: ``You're going to die pretty soon, you know?
You're really getting old.'' Fortunately for the kid and my
relationship with his grandmother, I overcame the urge to dump him
on his head. Instead, I suggested he go climb another person. But
I've been thinking. A lot. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Here it is, just three days after
the winner was announced, and acrimony and discontent have rocked
this newspaper's Tallest, Truest Texan Contest. Eric ``Tex''
Simonsen thinks Mark McLendon, the winner, is too much of a
``redneck'' to hold the title. Simonsen thinks somebody else should
have won: him. McLendon's qualifications for winning the contest
included being in the Too Damn Friendly Bar in Johnson City every
night last year and having once done his Christmas shopping at a
truck stop. Simonsen, who entered the contest, thinks he would have
been a better choice. ``I know in my heart that I truly am the
'Truest Tallest Texan,' '' Simonsen wrote. (Kelso, Austin

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ VAL D'ISERE, France _ Even if I die on this

and knees beating myself with a mesquite branch before I suffered
through another train ride in Europe. (Nethaway, Waco

</P>
<P>
   Then I saw her latest political ad. It's a glossy photo of Lois
. . . now get this . . . posing with a horse. Really. The big black
horse is standing there, wide-eyed next to Frankel, who is smiling
broadly as her left hand nestles affectionately under the horse's
muzzle. Given the current political climate, my first impression
was that the photo was some tawdry smear campaign by her Republican
challenger, Rick Heers. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    ``Beloved'' a story of the unimaginable
 &HT;    By Mary McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The story of Margaret Garner _ the slave woman
who killed her 2-year-old daughter in 1856 in Cincinnati rather
than let her be taken back into slavery _ lit a match in the souls
of three very different women, in three very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The first two women are famous. They are Toni Morrison and Oprah
Winfrey, and Garner's story provided the seed for Beloved, the 1987
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and the current movie.
</P>
<P>
   The third woman _ Joanne Caputo of Yellow Springs _ is hardly
famous, but her obsession with the case led to the discovery of the
Boone County, Ky., farm where Garner worked as a slave.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's inspiration came from a brief reprinted article about
the case. The novelist learned only the barest facts: On Jan. 28,
1856, as white federal marshals burst into a shack near
Cincinnati's Mill Creek, the 23-year-old pregnant mother gripped a
knife and shouted that she would rather see her children dead than
returned to slavery. Before she could be subdued, Garner slit the
throat of her daughter, Mary, and attempted to kill her three other
children.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison intentionally avoided further research. She told the
New York Times in 1987, ``The rest is sheer novel writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Caputo, 43, had never read Beloved when she came across a brief
mention of Margaret Garner's story in 1994 while conducting
research for another project. Caputo couldn't rest until she
learned everything she could about Margaret Garner.
</P>
<P>
   `` Beloved is a novel,'' says Caputo, who is working on both a
screenplay and a non-fiction book about Margaret Garner. ``I was
real compelled by the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Compelled, but also baffled. The tragedy was far from the
reality of this mother of two boys and president of the Yellow
Springs PTO. ``Because I was a mother I couldn't understand how she
could do it,'' Caputo said. Over the next several years, her
research brought her to a very different feeling. ``Margaret
symbolizes maternal love,'' she says, ``because of the depth to
which she is willing to go to protect her children from slavery. .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the daughter who died was her special child, her
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Caputo began by searching the Cincinnati Enquirer archives in
the public library in downtown Cincinnati. She squinted over a
flurry of microfilm until she found something that gave her
goosebumps: the Jan. 29, 1856, edition of the Enquirer with the
headline : ``Stampede of Slaves: A Tale of Horror!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city was thrown into much excitement yesterday morning by
the information that a party of slaves, sixteen in all, had made a
stampede from Kentucky to this side of the river. Other
circumstances, however, which afterward transpired, have imparted a
degree of horrible interest to the affair different from that which
usually attends a stampede of negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The story in the 1856 pro-slavery Enquirer goes on to relate
federal marshals' pursuit of the Garner family, including Margaret,
known as Peggy, her husband Simon, their four children, and Simon's
parents. Simon fired a revolver from the window of their hideout,
nearly severing the finger of one marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The marshals burst in and seized the weapon, the story
continues, ``But a deed of horror had been consummated, for
weltering in its blood, the throat being cut from ear to ear and
the head almost severed from the body, upon the floor lay one of
the children of the younger couple, a girl three years old, while
in a back room, crouched beneath the bed, two more of the children,
boys, of two and five years, were moaning, the one having received
two gashes in its throat, the other a cut upon the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Beloved, the Garner case went largely unnoticed in the
20th century, but it attracted national attention, and considerable
controversy, in 1856. In January of that year, the Garner family _
slaves on the Maplewood farm of Archibald Gaines in Boone County,
Ky. _ escaped across the frozen Ohio River and hid in the home of a
freed slave in Cincinnati. After their capture, abolitionists
argued that Garner should be tried in Ohio for murder, but as a
free woman. Instead she was tried on federal charges of being a
runaway slave.
</P>
<P>
   An article from the Cincinnati Gazette describes Garner's
demeanor during the trial: ``The child in her arms is a little
girl, about nine months old, and is much lighter in color than
herself _ light enough to show the red tinge in her cheeks. Her
eyes, during the trial, were generally cast down. She would look up
occasionally, for an instant, with a timid, apprehensive glance, at
the strange faces around her. The babe, with its little hands, was
continually fondling her face, but she rarely noticed it, and her
general expression was one of extreme sadness. Only once, when it
put its hand to her mouth, we observed her smile upon it, and
playfully bite its little fingers with her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the left side of her forehead, just above the outer
extremity of her eye-brow is an old scar, and on the cheek bone of
the same side, another. We asked her how those scars came there.
She said, 'White man struck me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beloved is set in Reconstruction-era Cincinnati, and the main
character, Sethe, is haunted by the ghost of the daughter she
killed two decades earlier. In real life, Margaret Garner lost her
infant daughter less than two months after the trial, and lived
only two more years, dying of typhoid fever in Mississippi in 1858.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Garner been convicted and sent back to Kentucky
than Ohio governor Salmon P. Chase (later chief justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court) issued a warrant for her arrest on murder charges.
Gaines, probably tipped off by Kentucky authorities, spirited the
slaves away the night before the warrant was to be served.
</P>
<P>
   The Garner family was on board the New Orleans-bound Henry Lewis
when it collided with another steamer along the Ohio River near
Troy, Ind. Fifteen of the 40 passengers drowned _ among them
10-month-old Silla, the rosy-cheeked infant described in the
newspaper accounts of the trial. ``The mother exhibited no other
feeling than joy at the loss of her child,'' reported the March 11,
1856, edition of the Cincinnati Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The more Caputo learned, the more she empathized with Garner.
Her screenplay won an Ohio Arts Council fellowship and praise from
one judge who called the story ``America's Sophie's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Caputo searched for months through Kentucky court records and
old newspaper clippings. At last a local historian directed her to
an undeveloped 15-acre farm that was part of the original 200-acre
estate. She came to the designated intersection and there it was: a
landmark plaque declaring the property ``the home site of Major
John P. Gaines.'' Caputo knew John Gaines was Archibald's older
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Goosebumps again.
</P>
<P>
   A cook house and smokehouse still stand on the property.
Officials with Kentucky's historic preservation agency have
confirmed the farm is the site where Garner worked, although
they're not sure the buildings date to the1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Caputo feels sure. She has erected an impromptu altar in the
hollow of a tree she says is shaped like a woman with her arms
upraised, her skirts lifted. There she has placed symbols of
mothering _ baby blankets, a bowl of rice, a bar of soap _ as well
as a pretty handkerchief (''Margaret never had anything nice'') and
a photo of Martin Luther King, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Caputo knows she can only imperfectly place herself in Garner's
world. ``All parents know that panicked feeling when you're in a
department store and you can't spot your child,'' she says. ``Her
sons were close to the selling age. Imagine what it would be like
if your child could be sold or raped or whipped until the skin was
bleeding, right in front of you.''
</P>
<P>
   None of us can imagine it, really. It's a tribute to the story's
enduring power, its profound symbolism, that such soaring
imaginations have made us try.

 &HT;    The can-dos outweigh life's utter impossibilities
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The other day a friend's four-year-old
grandson climbed onto my lap, took my face in his hands, and
declared: ``You're going to die pretty soon, you know? You're
really getting old.'' Fortunately for the kid and my relationship
with his grandmother, I overcame the urge to dump him on his
</P>
<P>
   head. Instead, I suggested he go climb another person.
</P>
<P>
   But I've been thinking. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen those T-shirts that, in a fit of cute announce:
``I'm not 30, I'm 29.95?'' There's one for 40, one for 50, and one
for 60...and then there are no more. Is that an omen? Is someone
suggesting that folks over 60 are too old to advertise? Life is
tough enough without some twerp of an entrepreneur reminding me
that I'm ready for the next T-shirt _ the one that's stamped:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 65 and I'm turning into my grandmother'' which, when you
think about it, is not all that bad, considering the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   But I have begun to ponder my future. Time's a wastin' and
before it runs out completely, I have to decide what I'm going to
be when I grow up. Funny how these little decisions sneak up on us
when our backs are turned.
</P>
<P>
   First, I had to cull my list of possibilities and separate the
``HU (highly unlikely)'' from the ``UI (utterly impossible because
either my feet are too big or I was born 20 years too late or 50
years too soon).'' Following are the results:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ballerina (so full of graceful moves that the audience would
throw flowers rather than fruit and I would be the toast of at
least two rural counties) _ UI.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid I was so clumsy my father nicknamed me ``Grace,'' and
my mother was forever running interference between me and the
breakables hollering, ``Watch out! The furniture!'' I even went to
dancing school for a couple of years until the teacher closed her
studio and moved away. My mother said it was fate. My father
labeled it self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blues singer (known for my tear-wrenching rendition of ``I
Loves You Porgy'' while draped over a piano in some disreputable
waterfront dive) _ HU.
</P>
<P>
   One late evening last week, a rude friend informed me that my
voice, the one I've always thought of as sultry, kind of a Marlene
Dietrich-like baritone, is highly irritating to anyone not
profoundly hard of hearing and/or drunk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fighter pilot (carrier based) _ HU.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been many years since I've flown an airplane, I
clearly remember the odd behavior of my instructor, particularly
during landings. I wasn't sure, but I doubted that all pilots
clapped their hands over their eyes and rattled off a ``Hail Mary''
just before touchdown. Later, I began to suspect he drank.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my grandmother Parker's impeccable UDC (United Daughters
of the Confederacy) credentials could land me a spot in the CAF
(Confederate Air Force) if war between the North and South ever
breaks out again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playboy bunny _ HU.
</P>
<P>
   Ever worn a push-up bra?
</P>
<P>
   _ President _ UI.
</P>
<P>
   My unspectacular past would hardly support an investigation by
independent counsel. The nation would be faced with four long years
of uninterrupted business as usual. Except maybe for that one time
in Peoria. ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Astronaut _ HU.
</P>
<P>
   Even though John Glenn has paved the way for non-traditional
astronauts (geezers in space), I couldn't make it. Motion sickness
... unless maybe they'd let me ride in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, chances of accomplishing more than one or two
items on my list seem remote, so I've decided to add a third
category: CD (can do).
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit in the front pew and blubber as I watch my son marry the
lovely lady it took him 30 years to find.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marvel at the wonder of a grandchild who will knock my socks
off with his or her beauty and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ride trains.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finish the book.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spend time with my friends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire a new flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Even though my son has a problem with the last item, life is
looking good. I think I'm really going to enjoy this old-age
schtick.

 &HT;    Does boxing need Mike?
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ America can breathe a sigh of relief. Mike Tyson
has been ruled mentally fit to fight, which I'm sure has kept you
up nights.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that decision means he is mentally capable of
delivering a maelstrom of fury on another human being, or sub-human
being, for that matter, in a controlled environment _boxing ring,
not a fender-bender on a street corner _ for millions upon millions
of pictures of dead presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he was judged to have full grasp of all his
faculties even as he prepares to relieve opponents of theirs. Only
in boxing is logic totally illogical. We can presume, then, that if
he were judged mentally unfit to box, Tyson would have to change
careers and become, what, a librarian?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Monday's ruling by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission puts him in a category with any guy who's ever laced up
a pair of gloves and sparred in a dimly lit gym, every red-blooded
American postal worker, and me. I'm as mentally fit as the next
sportswriter (insert own joke here), but I'd get in a ring with
Tyson for $20 million. Wouldn't you? I'm still relatively quick for
my age, emphasis on the relatively, and I can certainly take a dive
as well as Roberto Duran.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Troy Aikman's had his skull beaten in time after time,
and he still has the majority of his cerebral powers.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, just who is unfit to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson didn't get a second chance. He got a second hundredth
chance, which made it all the more comical when he pleaded with one
commissioner to stop torturing him. Excuse me? Did that lone voice
of dissent use Evander Holyfield's ear for an appetizer and then
the main course? Where was the accountability, the deeply felt
humility? This was charade, total and irrefutable, played out on a
national stage. Tyson's camp wisely trots out the perfect PR folks
_ Muhammad Ali, the greatest boxer ever, and Magic Johnson, the
worst talk show host ever _ to speak on his behalf. I can only
assume Billy Graham was tied up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may have been credited with his best assist. But if he
and Ali are really to help this troubled man, maybe they should
convince him to take full responsibility for his actions and quit
blaming others. All Tyson really needs to do is take a long, hard
look at the trembling Ali and see the ravages of this vicious sport
on a man sadly inflicted with Parkinson's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a career hoodlum, an admitted wife-beater, a convicted
rapist, a notorious bad guy telling a commissioner to quit
humiliating him. What else should we expect from a fellow who
claimed he was misquoted in Playboy magazine when he said he could
explode at any time? Misquoted in a Q&AMP;A article. Who does he think
he is, Charles Barkley?
</P>
<P>
   For several million reasons, the former two-time heavyweight
champion had his boxing license restored. According to Bloomberg
News, Vegas tourists spent $9 million on housing and meals the
weekend 16 months ago when Tyson gave boxing a black eye and a
bloody ear.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Tyson gave a weak apology. With Clintonesque remorse,
Tyson sounded as if he were sorry he had to be there, not sorry for
biting Holyfield. After all the psychological testing, Tyson said
he was being humiliated by this process. That's like blaming his
orthodontist for inflicting the damage on Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, however. Mike Tyson is boxing. No name is a
bigger draw in the profession now, no name brighter on Las Vegas'
marquees, even with the erosion of his once considerable skills.
There likely has been no fighter before or since Tyson with the
same inner demons, the uncontrolled fury, the anger that spills
into the ring. You get the distinct impression Tyson is fighting
his neglectful father, his alcoholic mother, his greedy,
electric-haired promoter, his greedier handlers with every blow he
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   But for every cheeseburger-inhaling George Foreman and low
blow-throwing Andrew Golota, there is but one Tyson. Boxing needs
Mike Tyson. It needs more than that _ like stronger restrictions,
better medical safeguards, and a scoreboard without subjective
judges _ but if boxing has any hope of regaining its feet, a
rejuvenated Mike Tyson is essential.
</P>
<P>
   But what does Mike need? He even said he's not sure if he will
fight again, a premise no one believes, particularly the IRS, which
says Tyson owes it millions. Does Tyson need boxing to survive?
Without it, will he spiral ever downward, sink further into the
mental depression that he apparently cannot escape and finally meet
an untimely end? Does anyone really care about Mike Tyson? Should
anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Athletic Commission gave him yet another chance.
Let's see if Tyson gives himself one.

 &HT;    Frankel's a little bit country
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ State Rep. Lois Frankel has gone country
on us, a shocking development.
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought of Frankel as more lox than Loxahatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw her latest political ad.
</P>
<P>
   It's a glossy photo of Lois . . . now get this . . . posing with
a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Really. The big black horse is standing there, wide-eyed next to
Frankel, who is smiling broadly as her left hand nestles
affectionately under the horse's muzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Given the current political climate, my first impression was
that the photo was some tawdry smear campaign by her Republican
challenger, Rick Heers.
</P>
<P>
   I like Lois, and so naturally, I was prepared to defend her.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the print advertisement revealed that this
mailing was even more bizarre than I had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It was Frankel herself who had distributed the horse photo to
voters in House District 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Friend,'' it said. ``On Sunday afternoon, October 18, I
will be riding through your area with some of your neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Frankel on a horse! Riding!
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's the daughter of a Brooklyn mother and Bronx father.
She grew up in Long Island, where horses are considered only by
riot-control policemen and gamblers trying to hit the trifecta.
</P>
<P>
   I called Frankel on the phone, thinking maybe I had missed
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, what kind of experiences did you have with
horses?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry-go-rounds,'' Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   Just what I thought.
</P>
<P>
   It's not her fault. She didn't know that Georgetown Law School
would lead to playing buckaroo down washboard roads in Palm Beach
County's rural suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   If only she would have known that one day she'd grow up to be a
politician who would find herself in a district that includes, not
only condos packed with aging former New Yorkers _ her bread and
butter _ but also rural communities, where voters live in homes
that have horses as lawnmowers.
</P>
<P>
   If only she had known, she might have made sure she had more
experience with horses of the non-Calliope variety.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't have to suddenly, at middle age, enter a rushed and
awkward cowboy phase.
</P>
<P>
   Her Lois L'Amour period.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Frankel was square dancing with the Loxahatchee
Groves Landowner's Association, and Sunday she was riding a horse
through the Acreage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knees hurt,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking about the riding, not the dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been on a horse before?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son was younger, we tried doing the cowboy thing,''
she said. ``I took him to a dude ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to be on the safe side, Frankel wore a helmet for Sunday's
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Her equestrian antics made her challenger, Heers, compare it to
him showing up at ``bingo parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play bingo in the condos,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No, the poor guy would have to learn mah-jongg if he wants to
make headway there. That's even worse than riding a horse.
</P>
<P>
   The election is on Nov. 3, which means that Frankel has two more
weeks before she goes from horseback to horseradish.
</P>
<P>
   If Frankel's knees don't heal soon, she'll have to give up her
riding and come up with other country-styled campaign events.
</P>
<P>
   So, if I were you, I'd start looking for her to show up at
Moroso Motorsports Park with a mouth full of chaw and a mottled
hound on a short chain. Frankel will be the one wearing the Dixie
T-shirt, eating beef jerky, and riding the big-wheeled mud buggy
with the gun rack on the back and Hank Jr. on the stereo.

   MCCOY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The story of Margaret Garner _ the
slave woman who killed her 2-year-old daughter in 1856 in
Cincinnati rather than let her be taken back into slavery _ lit a
match in the souls of three very different women, in three very
different ways. The first two women are famous. They are Toni
Morrison and Oprah Winfrey, and Garner's story provided the seed
for Beloved, the 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and the current
movie. The third woman _ Joanne Caputo of Yellow Springs _ is
hardly famous, but her obsession with the case led to the discovery
of the Boone County, Ky., farm where Garner worked as a slave.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The other day a friend's
four-year-old grandson climbed onto my lap, took my face in his
hands, and declared: ``You're going to die pretty soon, you know?
You're really getting old.'' Fortunately for the kid and my
relationship with his grandmother, I overcame the urge to dump him
on his head. Instead, I suggested he go climb another person. But
I've been thinking. A lot. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Here it is, just three days after
the winner was announced, and acrimony and discontent have rocked
this newspaper's Tallest, Truest Texan Contest. Eric ``Tex''
Simonsen thinks Mark McLendon, the winner, is too much of a
``redneck'' to hold the title. Simonsen thinks somebody else should
have won: him. McLendon's qualifications for winning the contest
included being in the Too Damn Friendly Bar in Johnson City every
night last year and having once done his Christmas shopping at a
truck stop. Simonsen, who entered the contest, thinks he would have
been a better choice. ``I know in my heart that I truly am the
'Truest Tallest Texan,' '' Simonsen wrote. (Kelso, Austin

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ VAL D'ISERE, France _ Even if I die on this
mountain, it still beats traveling through Europe on a Eurail

and knees beating myself with a mesquite branch before I suffered
through another train ride in Europe. (Nethaway, Waco

   CERABINO-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ State Rep. Lois
Frankel has gone country on us, a shocking development.
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought of Frankel as more lox than Loxahatchee.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw her latest political ad. It's a glossy photo of Lois
. . . now get this . . . posing with a horse. Really. The big black
horse is standing there, wide-eyed next to Frankel, who is smiling
broadly as her left hand nestles affectionately under the horse's
muzzle. Given the current political climate, my first impression
was that the photo was some tawdry smear campaign by her Republican
challenger, Rick Heers. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    What's Magic thinking, trying to replace sorcery in Tyson camp?
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Quick, somebody, find something for
Magic Johnson to do with his time.
</P>
<P>
   To see him in Las Vegas, acting as Mike Tyson's adviser,
promising Nevada boxing regulators that Iron Mike will make them
proud if only he's allowed to pummel people professionally again
instead of as a hobby, well, it's just about the most misguided and
muleheaded use of celebrity sparkle since a young Jane Fonda went
to Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Magic's influence cuts across the whole of American culture,
touching people in ways as unpredictable as they are unprecedented.
Who else could contract the HIV virus and tell the world about it
with a smile? Who else could admit to sleeping around
indiscriminately with female groupies during his days as an NBA
superstar and still retain the more pleasing popular image of a
devoted family man? Who could invest huge amounts of risk capital
in the heart of our nation's crime-ridden inner cities, as Magic
has with his downtown movie and entertainment centers, and make it
work?
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in with Tyson now raises a disturbing question, one
that eventually must be faced by all such wizards. Has Magic grown
bored using his astounding powers only for good, and not evil?
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali can be forgiven his participation in the tawdry
``Free Iron Mike'' crusade. In recent years Ali has come to
represent harmony and healing on an international scale. Even
Saddam Hussein agreed to see the champ on the eve of the Gulf War,
sending 15 U.S. hostages home safely with Ali before the shooting
started. That's the kind of pull that makes a man believe he can
change the world, one obnoxious bully at a time, just by showing up
and making a personal appeal for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Magic should know better, especially when it comes to Tyson.
There is no demonstrated capacity here for learning from life's
mistakes. If there were, one chunk of Evander Holyfield's ear would
have been enough. Tyson lives in a tumult of his own creation and
the only way he knows to come out of it is fighting mad. Call it an
instinct, identified and nurtured by all the bad apples who
overflow boxing's putrid barrel, and perhaps it is a nobler
instinct that draws Johnson near. Magic, after all, specializes in
lending his strength and optimism to seemingly hopeless situations.
He might actually feel sorry for a high-school dropout so
ill-equipped for the demands of a superstar athlete's lifestyle
that he couldn't even keep himself out of prison, much less money
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Merely mixing with this crowd, however, impugns Johnson's
integrity. Proposing to lead them, with all the boxing business
above board and Tyson as the appropriate object of Magic's
boundless energy, is lunacy. This is Don King's court. Magic
doesn't even have next.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed here is another mission for Magic. Something
spectacular and specially suited to his powers of persuasion, like
a seat at the Mideast peace talks, with autographs aplenty to charm
the principals. Or a national bus tour to remind people that the
NBA still exists and hopes to be back in action before the WNBA.
Maybe a space shuttle shot, generating valuable research on the
effects of zero gravity on the immense.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, anything at all, would be preferable to this Tyson
farce. Magic may be enjoying a second life, churning on in robust
health seven years after HIV detection, but he's only got one
reputation.

 &HT;    No longneck, no redneck: Mr. Congeniality
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here it is, just three days after the winner was
announced, and acrimony and discontent have rocked this newspaper's
Tallest, Truest Texan Contest.
</P>
<P>
   Eric ``Tex'' Simonsen, 28, who grew up in Northwest Hills,
thinks Mark McLendon, the winner who keeps his snuff in his denim
shirt pocket, is too much of a ``redneck'' to hold the title.
</P>
<P>
   Simonsen, who is working on a master's degree in business
administration at the University of Texas at Dallas, thinks
somebody else should have won: him.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon's qualifications for winning the contest included being
in the Too Damn Friendly Bar in Johnson City every night last year
and having once done his Christmas shopping at a truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   Simonsen, who entered the contest, thinks he would have been a
better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my heart that I truly am the 'Truest Tallest Texan,'
'' Simonsen wrote in an e-mail to me after McLendon was named the
winner on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Simonsen's favor, no one ran harder to win the coveted title
than he did. Several relatives and friends sent e-mail in
Simonsen's behalf. Shortly before the contest deadline, Simonsen
went to the trouble to send me, by overnight mail, a fancy
promotional kit about himself.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity packet pointed out that Simonsen is ``known as Mr.
Texas, Tex and Texas Boy.'' It included color photos of himself
dressed in western clothing at various spots around the world.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite picture is the one of Tex standing in front of the
Sphinx, and I'm not talking about the professional wrestler. I'm
talking about the actual Sphinx in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In the photo, Tex is the one in the cowboy hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled at your choice for the winner of the 'Truest
Tallest Texan' contest,'' Tex wrote in his e-mail. ``I can
understand why you might have picked Mr. McLendon as the biggest
redneck in Texas, but how can someone like that truly represent
Texas and the great things this state stands for?
</P>
<P>
   ``While I don't want to appear to be a sore loser, I do feel
extremely slighted. I have done more throughout the world to
promote the 'Great State of Texas' than any of the people you gave
honorable mentions to. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of people all over the world that have been
made aware of the great things Texas has (to) offer thanks to my
zeal for sharing Texas culture. I feel that not only have you
degraded me personally, you have also degraded the thousands of
Texans that are truly proud of our state and the great place it is
to live in. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   So, OK, Tex has done a passel to spread Texas culture hither and
yon. While a student at Brigham Young University, he started a
barbecue place called Texas Pride Barbecue in Provo, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was up there I realized there was no barbecue, and
that's one of my favorite things about Texas,'' Tex told me Tuesday
over the phone from Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Also while in Provo, Tex promoted the Lone Star State by
throwing an annual Texas block party. Even though it was dry, it
attracted upwards of 350 people.
</P>
<P>
   No beer? That's not a block party. That's a congested area for
no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Tex says that whenever he travels, he serves as a Texas
ambassador by telling people what a great place Texas is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always talk about Texas and tell them that it's not a
desert,'' he said. ``That's the biggest misconception people
have.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an honorable thing to do. And we don't want anyone to go
away mad because of this contest, which was supposed to be fun. We
want everyone to walk off into the Texas sunset with big ol' smiles
on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   So because of all the trouble Tex has gone to to win this
fandango, I've decided to name him Mr. Congeniality of the Tallest,
Truest Texan Contest.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that if McLendon is unable to perform his
duties as the winner of the Tallest, Truest Texan Contest, Simonsen
will take over and perform them for him.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, I'd like to name Simonsen the contest's
official designated driver.

 &HT;    Sanity _ or the lack thereof
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAL D'ISERE, France _ Even if I die on this mountain, it still
beats traveling through Europe on a Eurail Flexipass.
</P>
<P>
   After that last train trip from Barcelona, Spain to Nice,
France, I knew that I would crawl back to Texas on my hands and
knees beating myself with a mesquite branch before I suffered
through another train ride in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Nice, I rented a new 5-speed Renault and launched European
Trip Plan Two, which was to explore the back roads and mountain
villages in the European Alps.
</P>
<P>
   For months, I had been looking forward to Plan One, which was to
travel around Europe on a first-class Eurail pass with a long-time
friend, colleague and experienced world traveler. As a child, I
enjoyed riding American passenger trains and sleeping in Pullman
beds. European trains are nicer, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   To better enjoy our first train ride from Paris to Madrid _ a
13-hour overnight trip _ we paid an extra $100 apiece to upgrade
our $500 Eurail passes so we could kick back in our own private
sleeping compartment.
</P>
<P>
   There was no kicking back. We sat shoulder to shoulder in two
seats that faced a beige plastic wall inches from our knees. I've
been in outhouses with more room. We had the bunk beds unfolded so
we could straighten our legs.
</P>
<P>
   The day-trip from Madrid to Barcelona was better. The train was
not sold out, the scenery was interesting and I was learning to
accept rude treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next train trip, from Barcelona to Nice, that put me
in a car in a shrieking blizzard on a narrow, ice-covered mountain
pass in the French Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of that trip was on a packed, smoke-filled,
rattle-trap commuter train. With no accommodations for travelers
with luggage, simple survival required constant fist-fight
brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The second leg was supposed to be on a first-class, non-smoking
coach with reserved seats. Our reserved seats had been sold at
least twice, which led to more unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   After the conductor disappeared, I watched through the glass in
the locked doors that separated first-class from economy class as a
middle-aged man jimmied the locks. This, I thought, must be how the
Romanovs felt when angry, starving peasants breached the palace
walls.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately all empty first-class seats were taken. The doors
were propped open. The new arrivals yelled, joked and filled the
coach with cheap cigarette smoke. By the time we arrived in Nice, I
had not slept in more than 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The car gave me back my freedom. I went where I wanted to go and
stopped when I wanted to stop. In mid-October, the hardwood trees
in the French, Italian and Swiss Alps are decked out in yellows,
reds and oranges. Back-road villages and farms appear little
changed from the Middle Ages. Farmers drive cows with big, musical
bells around their necks down the middle of roads. No one is rude.
</P>
<P>
   Small, twisting Alpine roads are a blast to drive, until I got
to this one that became little more than a paved mule trail that
winds its way up over a mountain pass next to a glacier.
</P>
<P>
   A villager on the south side of the pass said I could make it if
I drove slowly. No snow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the top, snow blew horizontally so hard that it threatened
to push the car off the tiny icy road with no guard rails. I could
see only a few feet in front of the car. I plowed through snow
drifts and inched around switchbacks.
</P>
<P>
   I unbuckled my seat belt to make it easier to jump if the car
started to go over the side.
</P>
<P>
   But even at it's scariest worst, which was slipping down the
north side of the pass, I knew that I would rather lose my life on
this mountain than my mind on another European train.

A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Many are the mysteries of the Paula Jones case,
and I'm not just talking about why she doesn't sic her lawyers on
that plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   In a written brief in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the
president, Jones' lawyers say she ``continues to feel fearful and
embarrassed, and is unable to watch Mr. Clinton or read an article
about the case without experiencing mental anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why don't all Americans deserve a million-dollar settlement
from President Clinton? Why doesn't she just drop the suit, since
she's helping create the articles she reads with such anguish?
</P>
<P>
   Weirdest of all, how come Clinton apparently is willing to give
her money but adamantly refuses to apologize? That goes against guy
logic. Guys hate throwing away money on lost-cause women, but are
always willing to say ``I'm sorry,'' because in guy dialect it
means ``Go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Paula, I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the ``I'm sorry'' department is the race for governor in
California. During a recent vacation, I had so much time to waste I
actually spent an hour in front of the television watching the
debate at San Francisco State University between Gray Davis, the
Democratic candidate, and Republican Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the so-called issues, like whether Gray is Brown (as
in Jerry) or whether Lungren is Reagan. He started off by basically
claiming to be the Gipper, not the Ripper we think we know.
</P>
<P>
   My wife the former surfer had Lungren cold on the all-important
presentation-of-self factor: ``He's a greasy hodad,'' she said,
easily the worst thing one Southern Californian can say about
another.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what she said about Davis when he said California
wasn't ready for gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   For crying out loud, Gray, look at the divorce rate. California
isn't ready for straight marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Lungren offer a clear choice, at least. One is a
conservative who will kill people and the other is a liberal who
will kill people. Oh, yeah, and then they'll teach our children
well.
</P>
<P>
   Also during my recent vacation, Macy's in San Francisco opened
its Christmas displays on Oct. 1, with only 30 shopping days until
Halloween. What ever happened to the Christmas season's traditional
start 30 days before Thanksgiving?

A LINEMAN NOW TRIES TO TACKLE COLLEGE BINGE DRINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It wasn't as if Carl Eller had never been knocked
down before. When you're a defensive lineman, you routinely find
yourself on your back, your butt or your belly.
</P>
<P>
   You get up, though. That's what you do when you play defensive
end. And few men _ maybe no one, actually _ ever played that
position as well as huge, hulking Eller.
</P>
<P>
   He has 134 career sacks; 23 fumble recoveries and nine blocked
kicks. Rookie of the year. Six times all-pro. Twice the National
Football League's most valuable lineman. Four Super Bowl
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but he'd been part of what some football nuts _
including this one _ feel was the best defensive line in NFL
history. Eller, Alan Page, Gary Larsen, Doug Sutherland and Jim
Marshall were the Minnesota Vikings Purple People Eaters.
Collectively, they sacked the quarterback 400 times, recovered 70
fumbles and won 176 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain? The New York Giants' goal line squad
of Robustelli &AMP; Co. of the early 1960s? The Deacon Jones-Merlin
Olson combo in Los Angeles? Too Tall Jones, Randy White &AMP;
Associates in Dallas 15 years ago. All good. All very, very good.
But the Purple People Eaters were, quite simply, the very best
ever.
</P>
<P>
   And then 16 years in the NFL had passed for Eller. He'd lost a
few steps, which is all it takes. It all ended for him. Booze and
coke had him by the throat. And then Eller was really down, and he
didn't have a clue as to how to get up. And, after contemplating
suicide, Eller finally found a way to stand on his own two feet
again.
</P>
<P>
   Through sheer force of will, he got clean and sober and has
stayed that way for 18 years. Tuesday, he sat in front of me in a
little office on the campus of the State University of New York at
Albany, his inch-thick fingers folded on the table before him,
grayer and thicker at 56 than when he'd been playing. But still
Carl Eller. Still as big as a milk truck. And, now, a smarter,
calmer, more serene Carl Eller than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He was on one of the two dozen or so visits he makes every year
to college campuses across the country. You might not have heard,
but these college kids have huge booze problems. According to the
Harvard School of Public Health, only one in five of them stays
dry. Two in five are blind drunk at least one night a week.
</P>
<P>
   No other cohort in the population drinks so recklessly, and
college administrations fret over this. This is Alcohol Awareness
Week, and the administration of SUNY-Albany hopes that some of
their kids, at least, pay attention to what Carl Eller has to say.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially that's this: If it can happen to him _ a
disciplined, elite athlete living a severely regimented life _ then
it can happen to anybody. He worries that college kids seem to
believe that drinking on this monumental scale is harmless, merely
a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   But Eller can tell them from painful experience that serious
boozing _ any substance abuse, really _ has a corrosive effect on
virtually everybody. He knows that he's in an uphill fight, that
he's dealing with young people who feel they're simply entering
into adulthood and partaking of its myriad pleasures. He knows that
the popular conception is that drinking is normal and that
teetotaling is deviation.
</P>
<P>
   But these are smart kids, Eller was saying. Some will get the
point that eluded him until he was 38. Because he came here to warn
them, some will escape the agony he endured.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe _ just maybe, if they listen _ they won't get knocked
down to begin with.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the hotly contested race for U.S. Senate in
New York, incumbent Alfonse D'Amato and his Democratic challenger,
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, are both actively soliciting the Jewish
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In political circles, Jews are courted as a large and powerful
constituency who can make or break candidates in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And in this year's race, which could cost a combined $40
million, every vote counts; polls show D'Amato and Schumer neck and
neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important,'' pollster Lee Miringoff said of the
Jewish vote. Miringoff works at the Marist Institute, an
independent college polling organization in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been in close races before and has eked out
victories because of Jewish support. Six years ago, the senator
edged former Attorney General Robert Abrams, who is Jewish, by a
slim 80,000 votes, garnering 40 percent of the Jewish vote. Any
substantial shift in Jewish voting would have cost D'Amato
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Schumer is carrying the bulk of the Jewish
support, according to the independent Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute in Connecticut. A poll showed Schumer ahead 65 percent to
28 percent among Jewish voters, up from 57 to 34 in mid-September.
Schumer has the advantage of being a Jewish member of Congress from
a Brooklyn district rich in Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Schumer) is doing more of what he ought to be doing,''
said Maurice Carroll, Quinnipiac's polling director. ``He's Jewish.
He's from Brooklyn. He's liberal _ not terribly liberal, but
liberal enough. The Jewish vote tends to be from New York City and
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, no member of the Senate is more pro-Israel
than D'Amato, who fought hard for the return of assets stolen from
Jewish victims of the Holocaust and deposited in Swiss banks. The
3-term incumbent has long counted on the Jewish vote to repeatedly
defeat Democrats in a state where Republicans remain heavily
outnumbered, particularly in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator D'Amato needs to hold the traditional upstate
Republican vote,'' said Republican consultant Thomas Slater. ``At
the same time, he needs to find constituencies among enrolled
Democrats to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's downstate ads feature former Mayor Ed Koch endorsing
him. Koch, a Democrat, touts the Republican senator as a ``real
mensch,'' praise meant to draw support from the millions of Jewish
voters in New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato has been visible in our community,'' said Rabbi
Matthew Cutler, president of the Capital District Board of Rabbis
in Albany. ``I hear more about this race than any, head and
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cutler said there was ``a great feeling of distrust
with Alfonse D'Amato ... a degree of skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato's downstate ads focus on the Koch endorsement,
some of the upstate ads with which he is associated have turned off
some Jews. Upstate ads run by D'Amato and the GOP characterize
Schumer and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, also a Jew, as
money-grubbing New York City liberals who have different values
than those outside the New York metropolitan area. The ads, which
run only outside of New York City, exploit tensions between upstate
and downstate.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the ads deliver an anti-Semitic message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's subtle for the non-Jew, hard to prove for the real Jew,''
said Stephen Silberfarb, deputy executive director of the National
Jewish Democratic Council. ``It feeds into the stereotype of the
New York (City) Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Chartock, a political scientist and commentator in Albany,
doesn't find the ads _ particularly one that suggests Schumer
should stay in heavily Jewish Brooklyn _ in the least bit subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say `go back to Brooklyn' to a Jewish candidate, it
has to have some repercussions that these very smart people
(Republican political operatives) are aware of,'' Chartock said.
``Those kinds of tactics will always be effective among certain
people.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides and Republican powers deny there is an
anti-Semitic intent to the ads. They contend, and some observers
agree, that they are meant only to cast the downstate Democrats in
a liberal light upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to isolate him as a downstate politician,''
said Miringoff, a Jew. ``I assume the intent of the ad is to deal
with a clear regional difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Jewish Coalition, a pro-Republican group, points
out that D'Amato is the biggest booster of military spending for
Israel. The group is convinced that a senator so friendly to their
interests would not allow his name to be associated with bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Israel isn't the only issue of interest. Jews traditionally are
also interested in support for education, reproductive rights, gun
control, social justice and other issues that have long been high
on Schumer's agenda.

LONG STRUGGLE OVER COMMUNISM IN ITALY ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The long struggle over communism's challenge for power
in Italy ended this week when a former Communist Party leader was
asked to become premier and form the next government in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Massimo D'Alema marked a milestone not only in
Italian but also in European history.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the premier-designate, who will head Italy's 56th
government since World War II, appointed a 25-member Cabinet that
includes eight holdovers and doubles the number of women to six.
The parliament is expected to vote its approval on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, widely regarded as one of his country's most
intelligent politicians, no longer calls himself a communist. He
heads what is called the Party of the Democratic Left, composed of
remnants of the old Communist Party and some extreme left-wing
socialists.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, he has been the real power behind Prime
Minister Romano Prodi's socialist-leaning government although
holding no cabinet post. Prodi fell Oct. 9 after a parliamentary
vote of no-confidence in a budget dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It had long been thought that D'Alema's communist background
precluded him from leading the government. But Italy's president,
the moderate Oscar-Luigi Scalfaro, who is responsible for choosing
the prime minister subject to parliamentary approval, decided
otherwise. And Pope John Paul II's audience with D'Alema Tuesday
gave him the church's seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   The new leader is not, of course, about to impose a Marxist
regime on Italy. He couldn't even if he wished to.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his coming to power ends the postwar saga in which
the United States expended huge financial and political resources
to block a communist takeover in Rome and even prevent the
communists from becoming members of the government. However, for
decades they formed Italy's second most powerful party and were the
largest communist movement in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The communist-anticommunist duel raged almost to the end of the
Cold War in 1991. It deeply damaged Italian society since the
ruling Christian Democrats, who were guaranteed unconditional
American support because of the communist threat, became hopelessly
corrupt and wholly unresponsive to the country's pressing social
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The situation grew so drastic that by the early 1990s, the
Christian Democrats and the other mainstream parties finally
collapsed. Since then, Italy has been struggling to regain
political equilibrium _ with only scant success. It remains the one
major western nation lacking a satisfactory political system.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's ascent also recalls a far more important piece of 20th
century history.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Benito Mussolini's Fascist movement and its eventual
seizure of power in 1922 was largely in response to the menace of a
communist revolution in Italy after World War I. Mussolini's most
assiduous admirer and imitator was Germany's Adolf Hitler who based
Nazi ideology mainly on the Italian dictator's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   So the story of communism in Italy goes back a long way. It has
now reached its denouement with the coming to power democratically
and undramatically of the mild-mannered, former trade unionist
D'Alema.

1998, A VINTAGE YEAR FOR BUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's been a banner year for bugs in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's a good chance that these creatures have been
wriggling, crawling and boring into your home.
</P>
<P>
   Chillier temperatures and shorter days have signaled that it's
time to hole up for the winter. Most of the invaders swarm to the
sunny side of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge is the 19-spotted Asian ladybird beetle, or
Harmonia axyridis, sometimes dubbed the Halloween ladybug.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bartholomew, consumer horticulturist with the Cornell
Cooperative Extension of Albany County, said he received 50 calls
within the last two days of people complaining about another pair
of pests: box elder bugs and western conifer seed bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insects apparently use the siding as a place to rest and
soak up the sun, which brings their body temperature up to where
they are active enough to fly and crawl,'' said Michael Birmingham,
a New York Department of Environmental Conservation forest
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them are leaving their mark. ``The box elder bugs have
been terrible this fall. They get stepped on and body fluids create
stains on rugs and flooring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beverley Lyon began noticing the grayish-black bugs with red on
their backs in the spring, but she paid little attention to them
until recently hundreds showed up at her house in Scotia, a town
north of Schenectady, N.Y. Now, getting rid of them stinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you kill them, they smell horrible,'' she said. The
Halloween ladybug is a mercenary of sorts. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture brought the strain into the country as early as 1916 in
the fight against aphids, one of their favorite foods. The beetles
didn't seem to take hold, however, until the last few years when
they have become abundant in the Albany area. The mild winter and
summer gave all bugs a boost in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Barnes, a curator of the insect collection at the New
York State Museum, said it's nearly impossible to give a precise
head count. ``I don't want to give an impression that there has
been a population explosion,'' he said, ``but we have had real
appropriate conditions for great survivorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladybugs are welcomed by those who hold to the old superstition
that they bring good luck. But these creatures also can leave a
stain and stench when you swat them into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes suggests people try to get rid of the ladybugs by
catching their sharp legs on a tissue or vacuuming them up.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, heated houses are less than ideal habitats for
bugs. They need to slow down and hibernate, but the warmth of the
interior instead speeds their metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally they would overwinter in tree cavities or rock
crevices, and that's where the successful populations will end
up,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that enter homes are ill-fated,'' Barnes added with a
chuckle. ``They generally find not only irate homeowners but
unfavorable conditions in heated homes.''

 By KATHY SENA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Here are four ideas for terrific Halloween costumes that require
minimal effort and no sewing.
 ``TALKING GHOST''  
 &HT;    Add sound effects to your ghost costume this year. It's easy. Be
sure to have the camcorder ready for this one.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    White sheet
 &HT;    White belt or length of white rope
 &HT;    Mini tape recorder with cassette tape and batteries
 &HT;    Packing tape
 &HT;    Pots and pans
 &HT;    Chains (you can use the chains on the swings at the park)
 &HT;    Fanny pack
 &HT;    Before Halloween, fill a cassette tape with haunted, spooky
noises. Just turn the recorder on and create creepy sounds: rattle
chains (try shaking the chains on the park swings), scrape together
pots and pans, scream, moan and groan. Let the whole family get in
on the act.
 &HT;    To create the ghost costume, simply cut holes for the eyes,
making them large enough for the child to see through easily.
Secure the cassette player (with cassette inserted) in the fanny
pack and place it around your child's waist.
 &HT;    Place the sheet over his or her head, aligning eye holes and
allowing hands to stick out. Secure sheet at waist with white belt
or white rope.
 &HT;    ``Blouse'' sheet over belt to shorten length, and to disguise
fanny pack, if needed. Turn on cassette player and get ready to
scare the neighbors.
 PAIR OF DICE  
 &HT;    This is a great costume for siblings.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Large cardboard box
 &HT;    Black non-toxic poster paint
 &HT;    White paper and glue
 &HT;    White glow-in-the dark fabric paint
 &HT;    Cut head and arm holes in a large cardboard box. Cut flaps off
of bottom of box and leave open for child's legs. Paint box black.
 &HT;    When dry, glue on circles of white paper to resemble the dots on
a pair of dice. Add white glow-in-the dark fabric paint to the dots
for a more dazzling after-dark effect.
 FLOWER POWER  
 &HT;    Here's a simple but cheerful costume.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Adult-sized stretchy headband
 &HT;    Two or more different colors of felt
 &HT;    Hot-glue gun
 &HT;    Green turtleneck
 &HT;    Black or green leggings or sweatpants
 &HT;    Black or green shoes
 &HT;    Washable fabric glue
 &HT;    Cut felt into petal shapes. Using a glue gun, attach petals to
the headband. Allow glue to set.
 &HT;    Place headband around child's face to make a flower. Have the
child put on the green turtleneck, green leggings and brown shoes.
Glue additional petals to bottom of sleeves of turtleneck with
washable fabric glue, so turtleneck can be washed and worn again.
 SCARECROW  
 &HT;    Your trick-or-treater will be ready for the yellow brick road in
this costume.
 &HT;    Supplies:
 &HT;    Big long-sleeved T-shirt or flannel shirt
 &HT;    Jeans or sweat pants
 &HT;    A flannel or straw hat
 &HT;    Brown burlap or fabric for around head
 &HT;    Black or brown felt for ``booties''
 &HT;    Iron-on patches
 &HT;    Rope or twine for waist and wrists
 &HT;    Straw
 &HT;    Stuff straw in the wrists of the shirt, either taping the ends
on the inside of the shirt sleeve or using a loose rope around the
child's wrist. Do the same around pants legs.
 &HT;    Stuff clothes with more straw. Use black or brown felt or fabric
to make ``booties'' to cover up sneakers. You can also arrange
straw to stick out of holes cut in the jeans or sweat pants.
 &HT;    A dark flannel or straw hat tops the look.

long,'' begins Glicksman in this humorous essay. She fondly recalls
the days when ``a laptop was where you sat a child'' and ``a
compatible interface was what you hoped for on blind dates.''
Echoing the frustration of many a PC user, she wonders, ``Why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian
novel?'' (slugged:

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;

   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS -- FIRST OF TWO PARTS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio that Joe DiMaggio was supposed to throw
out the first ball in the opening game of the World Series. But
Sammy Sosa got the honors instead. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner had let it be
known that he wanted DiMaggio to toss out the ceremonial first
pitch. But Chicago Cubs slugger Sosa filled in because DiMaggio,
83, was still hospitalized in Hollywood, Fla., recovering from a
lengthy bout with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about U.S. Supreme Court decisions said the court
rejected the cruel-and-unusual punishment appeal of a Florida
inmate. But no details were given. What was that case all about,
and what was the claimed cruel-and-unusual punishment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved William D. Elledge, who has spent 23 years
on death row after being convicted in three murders in a weekend
crime spree in August 1974. He pleaded guilty in March 1975 to
murdering and raping Margaret Strack in Hollywood, Fla. After
disposing of her body, Elledge fatally shot Edward Gaffney, a night
watchman at a Hollywood grocery store. He then took a bus to
Jacksonville, where he shot and killed Paul Nelson, owner of a
Jacksonville Beach motel. He was sentenced to death in the Strack
killing and life terms for the Gaffney and Nelson murders.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy execution delay constituted Elledge's
cruel-and-unusual punishment appeal. Justice Stephen Breyer, who
wrote a strongly worded dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court's
rejection of Elledge's appeal, said the prisoner's claim is a
serious one. ``Not only has he, in prison, faced the threat of
death for nearly a generation,'' Breyer wrote, ``but he has
experienced that delay because of the state's own faulty procedures
and not because of frivolous appeals on his own part.''
</P>
<P>
   Three successful appeals by Elledge account for 18 of the 23
years in the delay of his execution. The Florida Supreme Court and
federal courts overturned his three previous death sentences for
the Strack killing because of errors by Broward County Judge Dan
Futch, now retired. A fourth appeal, which ultimately failed when
the Florida Supreme Court voted against him 4-2, accounts for the
additional five years of delay.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the nation's worst rivers for fish with high levels
of toxic chemicals?
</P>
<P>
   A: Various stretches of different rivers are toxic with
different chemicals. Rivers with significant contaminants affecting
fish tissue, as tested by the Environmental Protection Agency,
include the Monongahela, measured at Clairton, Pa.; the
Chattahoochee, at Whitesburg, Ga.; the Haw, at Saxapahaw, N.C.; the
Fox, at Portage, Wis.; the Missouri, at Kansas City, Mo.; the
Mississippi, at Natchez, Miss., and West Alton, Mo.; the Des
Plaines, at Lockport, Ill.; the Nishnabotna, at Hamburg, Iowa; the
Great Miami, at New Baltimore, Ohio; and the Ohio, at West Point,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that Mississippi requires all its
casinos to be on water, floating either on the Mississippi River or
its tributaries, or in the Gulf of Mexico. What about the Silver
Star Resort and Casino near Philadelphia, Miss.? Isn't it on dry
land?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but there's an explanation. By Mississippi law, all
licensed casinos operating in the state are required to be on
water, said Charles Patton, executive director of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. ut Indian tribes, through federal law, can put
casinos on tribal reservations, he added, saying that the Silver
Star falls into that category. It's operated under the auspices of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and is regulated by ``the feds,''
Patton said. It isn't licensed or regulated by the state of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Nancy Fowler of Conyers, Ga., who reported
again recently on her vision of the Virgin Mary, said believers
could get further information on the Internet. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's www.conyers.org. A woman answering the telephone at Our
Loving Mothers Children, Fowler's organization, said the lines
often are jammed, and asked people ``not to despair'' if they can't
get to the Web site immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an ad on TV for a video about Mark McGwire's and Sammy
Sosa's great home run season, but I didn't get the number. Do you
have it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Major League Baseball Productions at 1-800-537-7070. The
tape, ``Race for the Record,'' costs $19.95 plus $4.95 for shipping
and handling, with delivery expected to take four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Parade magazine mentioned a poem, ``For Those I Love,'' by
Isla Paschal Richardson, read at Frank Sinatra's funeral mass by
Gregory Peck. Can you print it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   If I should ever leave you/ of whom I Love/
</P>
<P>
   To go along the Silent Way/ grieve not,/
</P>
<P>
   Nor speak of me with tears,/ but laugh and talk/
</P>
<P>
   Of me as if I were/ beside you there./
</P>
<P>
   (I'd come _ I'd come,/ could I but find a way!/
</P>
<P>
   But would not tears and grief be barriers?)/
</P>
<P>
   And when you hear a song/ or see a bird/
</P>
<P>
   I loved, please do not let/ the thought of me/
</P>
<P>
   Be sad . . . For I am/ loving you just as/
</P>
<P>
   I always have . . ./
</P>
<P>
   You were so good to me!/
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things/ I wanted still/
</P>
<P>
   To do so many things/ to say to you . . ./
</P>
<P>
   Remember that I/ did not fear . . . It was/
</P>
<P>
   Just leaving you/ that was so hard to face . . ./
</P>
<P>
   We cannot see Beyond . . . / But this I know:/
</P>
<P>
   I loved you so _ 'twas heaven/ here with you!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I say a residential mailbox is the property of the U.S.
Postal Service and cannot be used for anything other than mail. A
friend says it's the homeowner's property and can be used for
anything. Who is right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're both right, in a sense, said U.S. Postal Service
spokeswoman Sandra Harding in Washington. The outside of the
mailbox is the homeowner's property. But the inside, which is
restricted to mail for pickup or delivery, is the domain of the
Postal Service. This means that only mail bearing postage can be
inside the mailbox. In places where curbside delivery is offered,
the mailbox must be of a type approved by the Postal Service. The
homeowner is responsible for installing it properly. For more
information, check with your postmaster, Harding advises.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a Japanese pilot who, in World War II, dropped
bombs on Oregon in an attempt to start forest fires. What kind of
plane did he use, and from what base did he operate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Nobuo Fujita, who died at age 85 on Sept.
30, 1997, in Japan. He didn't fly from a land base. On Sept. 9,
1942, a Japanese submarine carrying a crew of about 100 slipped
across the Pacific to the unprotected waters off the Oregon coast.
In the predawn darkness, the sub came to the surface and a catapult
launched Fujita's plane, a Yokosuka E-14-Y, into the air. It had
folding wings and was assembled by the sub's crew when it surfaced.
He flew back and landed on the plane's floats beside the sub, which
took him and the plane back aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita flew two missions in which he dropped fire bombs over
wooded areas in Oregon. None caused much of a blaze, but they did
provoke some alarm. Fujita's missions may not have been the only
Japanese bombing attempts on the U.S. mainland, however. Some
reports said another mission was aimed at an oil refinery in
southern California, but it failed to spark the desired nationwide
panic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports said a number of people were killed by floods
and mudslides when Typhoon Zeb swept through the Philippines. Where
exactly in the Philippines was the most destruction?
</P>
<P>
   A: Zeb was of ``super typhoon'' status when it made landfall
Oct. 14 near Palanan town in Isabela province (a storm gains that
status when its maximum sustained winds reach 138 mph; some of
Zeb's gusts were clocked at 184 mph). As it continued to pound the
northern Philippines, deaths were reported in Solano town in Nueva
Vizcaya province; southeastern Taitung; Benguet province; and
Antipolo, just outside Manila. By Friday, reports said at least 74
people were dead, mostly by drowning or in mudslides, but the
casualty figure was expected to rise because several northern
villages remained isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Barbara Jane Mackle, the heiress who was
kidnapped for ransom in Atlanta some years ago? Where was the place
she was buried alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mackle, who was kidnapped in 1968, tries to live a normal
life with her family in Florida. She does not grant interviews. The
site where she was buried in a plywood box, fitted with two pipes
to provide air, was about a mile from the City Hall at Berkeley
Lake, Ga., in Gwinnett County near Atlanta. Mackle, then a
20-year-old student at Emory University in Atlanta, spent about 3
1/2 days buried about two feet underground before she was rescued.
She went home to Miami; her captors, Gary Steven Krist, a
University of Miami researcher known by an alias, and his
accomplice, Ruth Eisemann-Schier, were caught. The FBI chalked up
the case as a success.

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand that only eight states do not have a hate crimes
law of some type. What are those states?
</P>
<P>
   A: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, New Mexico, South
Carolina and Wyoming have no hate crimes laws for anyone, according
to the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign. Laws in Maryland,
Texas and Utah are ``unclear,'' the organization says. The District
of Columbia and 21 states have hate crimes laws that include sexual
orientation, and 18 states' hate crimes laws do not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton recently flew to California on Air Force
One to raise money for Democratic candidates and to visit daughter
Chelsea. How much did this cost, and who pays?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clinton White House, like those before it, doesn't
calculate or publicly disclose the full scope of the operations _
military, security, transportation, communication and political _
involved every time a president goes on the road. But the White
House has said previously that Air Force One costs $35,300 an hour
to operate. So a 10-hour round-trip flight between Washington and
the West Coast would cost $353,000. The president's trips basically
are federally funded, which means U.S. taxpayers foot the bill, but
when trips such as the one to California include official business
on behalf of the Democratic Party and local political campaigns,
they share some of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned last year about the propriety of partisan
fund-raising tours, Democrats countered by saying they are proper
and even helpful. ``I think it's part of being president,''
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said. ``That's just a necessary part of
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans occupied the White House, the GOP followed a
similar practice using Air Force One, and also encountered
questions. In April 1992, for example, Sen. Dennis DeConcini
(D-Ariz.) said he saw ``something wrong'' about President George
Bush using Air Force One to mix politics with official business.
But Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, pointed out that even
when traveling for political purposes, Bush couldn't escape his
duties as commander in chief, requiring a coterie of security and
other personnel as well as communications, transportation and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Ricky Williams, the terrific running back for the University
of Texas, pays homage publicly to the late Doak Walker. Can you
give us a history of Walker's athletic accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: A great fan favorite at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas, Walker was a 5-foot-11, 170-pound single-wing tailback who
was named a consensus All-American three years in a row, starting
in 1947. He won the 1948 Heisman Trophy as college football's
outstanding player. The ``Doaker,'' as he was called, was so
popular at SMU that a deck of seats was added to the Cotton Bowl,
SMU's home field, to accommodate all the fans who wanted to watch
him play. His coach, Matty Bell, said of him, ``Some called it
luck, others called it destiny, but Doak has a natural knack for
pulling off great deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker joined the NFL's Detroit Lions in 1950. Despite his size,
he promptly led the league in scoring with 128 points and was named
both rookie of the year and an All-Pro at halfback. A remarkably
versatile player, he scored 534 points during his six-year NFL
career, during which the Lions won two NFL championships. Although
the Lions offered Walker a big contract to return in 1956, he chose
to retire to pursue business interests in his native Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams honored Walker by wearing his No. 37 Oct. 10 in the
Texas-Oklahoma game at the Cotton Bowl. Williams and Walker became
friends last season when Williams received the Doak Walker Award,
which goes to the nation's best running back. Just weeks after the
two met, Walker was seriously injured in a skiing accident in
Colorado that left him paralyzed. He died last month at 71 from
complications from those injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the Bilderberg group? The New York Times refers to it
as ``the most elite of the establishment clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bilderbergers include about 100 of Europe and North
America's most influential bankers, economists, politicians and
government officials. They meet yearly for a three-day conference,
always conducted in a rigid atmosphere of security, that
occasionally gives rise to various conspiracy theories about the
group's aims. But the Bilderbergers say the required pledge of
delegates not to discuss what goes on at their meetings is simply
to provide a private, informal environment in which those who
influence national policies and international affairs can get to
know each other and discuss, without commitment, their common
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The conferences were initiated by Prince Bernhard of the
Netherlands in 1954. Meeting locations vary. This year's session
was held in May at Turnberry resort in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an address where we can send donations and messages
of condolence to the family of Matthew Shepard, the gay student
from Laramie, Wyo., who died after being savagely beaten?
</P>
<P>
   A: Donations can be made to: Matthew Shepard Fund (1926083), c/o
1st National Bank, P.O. Box 578, Fort Collins, CO 80522. Poudre
Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, where the student died, has set up
an e-mail address for Shepard's family: mshepard(at)libra.pvh.org
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article mentioned an apparition in Portugal in 1917 in
which the Virgin Mary told three secrets to some children. Is it
known what the secrets were?
</P>
<P>
   A: The secrets, revealed by the Virgin Mary to three Portuguese
cousins in a series of visions while they were tending sheep in
Fatima, Portugal, were written down by Lucia dos Santos _ the sole
survivor of the three and now a 91-year-old nun _ and passed to the
Vatican in 1944. They are held in the Vatican and have never been
published.
</P>
<P>
   But a report last year in The Times of London offered some
information, saying the Vatican was seeking to reassure Italians
about widespread fears that Umbrian earthquakes presaged a
premillennial disaster, possibly the end of the world. That
apocalyptic doom was said to be the third secret of Fatima, to
which only the pope and his closest advisers have access.
</P>
<P>
   The Times went on to disclose speculation about the first and
second secrets. The first is said to offer a hellish vision of
``charred bodies in an ocean of fire,'' a possible forecast of
World War II, coupled with a message to the world to repent. The
second, disclosed in 1942 by Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster of Milan,
Italy, was that Russia, which was in the grip of its Marxist
revolution at the time of the visions, would ``spread her errors
throughout the world, causing wars and persecution,'' but ultimate
disaster would be averted if Russia reconverted to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Oct. 21, Loris Francesco Capovilla, the
former secretary to Pope John XXIII, said the third secret
contained no ``deadline of doom,'' adding that it is not linked to
the end of the millennium as people have claimed. He told the
Italian newspaper La Stampa that he couldn't reveal what the third
secret was, but talk of ``millions of deaths'' was inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that Georgia ranks as one of the
worst states in the nation in a survey on the amount of ozone
pollution. What states have the least ozone pollution?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington
analyzed air quality data from most states and the District of
Columbia and ranked them by the number of ``unhealthy smog days.''
Nine states were not included because there's little or no publicly
available data; 14 other states were included, even though only
partial data was available. Of the remainder that were ranked,
these were found to have the fewest violations of the stricter
ozone pollution standard issued last year by the Environmental
Protection Agency: South Carolina (lowest), followed in order by
Oklahoma, Illinois, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Colorado,
Maine, Massachusetts and Wisconsin.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that food stamps can be used only for food or
food products for human consumption. I once overheard a grocery
store manager saying they could be used only for foods grown or
processed in the United States. Virginia ham was acceptable, for
example, but canned Polish ham was not. Is that still true?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are no restrictions on the origin of the foods that can
be purchased with food stamps, said Susan Acker of the Department
of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. But that wasn't always
the case. When the food stamp program was a pilot project between
1961 and 1964, the stamps were restricted to foods or food products
either grown or processed in the United States. However, when the
program officially started, that restriction was dropped and
recipients could use stamps for foods from anywhere: Caviar from
Russia or peanuts from Georgia were equally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there an e-mail address for the national Democratic party?
</P>
<P>
   A: To contact the Democratic National Committee by e-mail, go to
its Web site _ www.democrats.org/contact.html _ and sign the guest
book form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Rose Mary Woods, the personal secretary
for Richard Nixon who was involved in the infamous Watergate tape?
</P>
<P>
   A: Woods, 80, who remained on Nixon's staff until 1976, has
lived in Alliance, Ohio, since retirement. Her biggest claim to
fame involved a mysterious gap of 18 1/2 minutes in a crucial
Watergate tape recording. In testimony before Chief U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica on Nov. 8, 1973, Woods reacted angrily to
suggestions that she might have accidentally altered or erased any
of the conversation on the tapes she was making transcripts from.
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony soon afterward, she had a different attitude,
explaining that when the telephone rang while she was transcribing
from the tape, she ``must have pushed the record button, which is
right next to the top button (on the recording machine).'' The
result was a gap of four or five minutes. She always denied that
she could have caused the full 18 1/2-minute gap, but White House
files made public in 1995 indicate that Nixon White House lawyers
blamed her for the full gap, and believed she caused it
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Articles last year tracing the whereabouts of a number of
Watergate figures included only a brief mention of Woods, who
apparently doesn't talk to reporters. She said only that she
doesn't get asked about Watergate much anymore.

SEMINARY REVISES FACULTY GUIDELINES: TEACHERS MUST SIGN SUBMISSION
STATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Board members of Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary have changed a bylaw to require faculty
members to sign the updated version of the denomination's statement
of faith that includes a passage stating that women must ``submit
graciously'' to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Tuesday endorses an administrative move made weeks
ago that has brought strong opposition from some faculty members.
Some are concerned that the seminary is changing the rules of
employment, others worry that being required to sign the statement
could be a move toward curtailing academic freedom and others fully
support signing the updated statement, said Dan G. Kent, a
professor who specializes in the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has caused a great deal of heartache and concern,''
he said. ``The faculty has been carrying a terrible burden for the
past several weeks. I hurt for them. I wish there was some way it
could have been avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, who has taught at the seminary for 19 years, said he would
not sign the updated statement. Friday, he handed in a letter
announcing his retirement, but he declined to discuss his reasons
for retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think something that significant is ever based on one
issue,'' Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote came without discussion as the board, meeting for
its biannual session, approved an amendment to a section of bylaws
referring to the statement of faith that faculty members must sign.
Instead of calling it the 1963 Baptist Faith and Message, the rules
now identify the document as the Baptist Faith and Message, which
includes an article on the family that was approved by the Southern
Baptist Convention in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of conviction and conscience, as an SBC
institution, we gladly teach according and not contrary to the
Baptist Faith and Message,'' seminary President Ken Hemphill said
in a prepared statement. ``We are under the patronage, general
direction and control of the SBC which established the Baptist
Faith and Message and amended in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The request for faculty members to sign the updated statement
came from the seminary administration in September, seminary
spokesman David Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said that there is no deadline for faculty members to
sign the statement and that the administration will not seek out
professors for their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who cannot teach according to the statement will be
expected to contact the department dean and may have to step down,
Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our faculty manual specifies that when a faculty member can no
longer subscribe to the seminary's articles of faith, he or she
would voluntarily sever relations with the institution,'' Hemphill
said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   The family addition to the Baptist Faith and Message states that
``the husband and wife are of equal worth before God.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also includes a section stating that ``a wife is to
submit graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as
the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the statement was approved by convention delegates, there
are some in the Southern Baptist community who have concerns about
the updated message, said Joe E. Trull, professor of Christian
ethics at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Some fault the process by which the document was developed.
Others are concerned that the added article represents only one
interpretation of certain passages of the Bible, Trull said.
</P>
<P>
   The Baptist Faith and Message is not a creed, said Jeff B. Pool,
a former seminary professor who is a lecturer in theology at Brite
Divinity School in Fort Worth. It is ``a guide in interpretation,
having no authority over the conscience,'' he said, quoting the
preamble of the faith statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that the practice of the seminary and the
convention itself of enforcing these things as creeds contradicts
the very document they are using to do the enforcing,'' said Pool,
who left the seminary in part because of a conflict with the
administration over the Baptist Faith and Message statement.

WAGING WAR, IN AND OUT OF THE RING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: American pundits and politicians seem to be
in near-unanimous agreement that the slow pace of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks is the fault of Netanyahu. The
Israeli prime minister is too rigid, they say, too reluctant to go
the extra mile in his dealings with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is looking out for the best interests of his people _
and those interests do not include giving away the farm just to
create the illusion that peace has been achieved. Arafat and the
Palestinians have vowed to destroy Israel and there is no reason to
believe they won't do it if given half a chance. Here's hoping
Netanyahu hangs tough in the face of Palestinian hostility and
American meddling in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: Meddling? Did I say meddling? Surely, the
president of the United States wouldn't compromise Israel's
security for the cynical purpose of pressuring Netanyahu into an
agreement that the White House PR machine could trumpet as a
foreign policy triumph. Would he?
</P>
<P>
   As long as Clinton has this impeachment cloud hanging over him,
darn near anything he does in the arena of international relations
will look like some sort of ``Wag the Dog'' scenario. It may not be
fair, but it's what can happen when a president squanders his
credibility _ and this president is a charter member of the
Credibility Squanderer Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   MIKE MCCURRY: Clinton's former press secretary made his debut on
the lecture circuit the other night and promptly capitalized on his
newly won independence _ McCurry quit the White House Oct. 1 _ by
taking a shot at his ex-boss.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``is an enormously gifted and richly qualified leader
for our nation but someone who is exasperatingly stupid in his
personal life,'' McCurry said in a speech at the University of
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: ``exasperatingly stupid.'' A CNN news anchor
quipped that McCurry must have already cashed that White House
severance check.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KASICH: Most of the political deep-thinkers who've been
speculating about the 2000 presidential race list Texas Gov. George
W. Bush as the front-runner for the Republican nomination. And they
figure his toughest competition _ if any _ will come from the likes
of Steve Forbes, Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle ...
</P>
<P>
   You know, the usual suspects, a lackluster covey of proven
losers and assorted retreads.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if Bush runs he will win and none of the has-beens or
never-weres will make him break a sweat. The only Republican who
might be capable of giving Bush an anxious moment or two is Ohio
Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee and
Congress' most dynamic crusader for balanced budgets. Kasich is an
emerging star of the Republican Party and could very well lead the
pack of also-rans as Bush cruises to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Kasich would be a terrific running mate for
Bush. A Bush-Kasich ticket could set up the GOP to control the
presidency for 16 years _ maybe enough time for the Democrats to
live down Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   MIKE TYSON: The Nevada Athletic Commission made the right
decision Monday when it voted to give the ex-heavyweight champion a
license to box. The commission had revoked Tyson's license in July
1997 after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears in one of the most
bizarre spectacles in the history of the bizarre sport of prize
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The biting incident shocked and horrified the nation _ an
interesting reaction in view of Tyson's well-established reputation
as a bloodthirsty head-hunter in the ring and a violent sociopath
on the street. How could anyone be surprised that the most brutal
of sports is populated by the most brutal of humans?
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the occasional gentleman fighter _ Holyfield
being the most admirable example these days _ but the truth is,
plenty of professional boxers are just plain thugs. Tyson has as
much right as any other thug to pursue a livelihood in the Sport of
Thugs.

JUST SAY KNOW ... 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I guess I always knew that, someday, everything I learned in the
pursuit of my liberal arts degree would become completely useless
when it came to helping my kids with their academic development. I
suspected that this would happen during their high school years as
they delved into logarithmic equations and beyond-DOS computer
programming. But now I see I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know that it's all over by second grade.
</P>
<P>
   In second grade, a child enters a stage of inquisition. Lying in
wait on his lips at all times are those dreaded words: Who, What,
When, Where and _ most irritating _ Why.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 years of age my son, Jack, became an intellectual
velociraptor, devouring the knowledge he ripped out of my mind,
leaving me exhausted in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to dread the signs of his reasoning mind.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it began with a deceptively simple question. But as
Jack considered my response, his eyebrows would furrow together and
then one would rise slowly, cynically, and I would know it was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to learn that I didn't know a thing.
</P>
<P>
   To the best of my recollection, Jack's Age of Reason began one
Independence Day. On the way to a parade, I made some comment about
how much fun it was to celebrate the nation's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by birthday, Mom?'' asked Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, on this day, in 1776, the leaders of our country signed
the Declaration of Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who were they, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Thomas Jefferson. And John Hancock, and....'' My voice
started to trail. Did he expect me to remember more? He did.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Washington, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ummmmm...'' Uh-oh. I was an American history major, true, but
couldn't we talk about societal patterns between the two world
wars?
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the declaration say, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   My mind started to reel: Four score and seven years ago ... no,
that wasn't it. We the People. ... No, no. Anyway, he didn't need
the exact wording. Just the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said,'' I said with confidence, ``that we were no longer
going to be ruled by England. That's what started the Revolutionary
War...''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, what about Lexington and Concord, I wondered. Did the
Declaration come during the war? While I was feeling stupid, Jack's
brow was furrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they like England, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   The phrases ``tea party'' and ``taxation without
representation'' floated through my mind, but the details weren't
there. Luckily, though, the parade was. So we dropped the
discussion and launched into flag-waving.
</P>
<P>
   Matters grew worse in the fall. This questioning-and-thinking
thing seemed to be actually encouraged in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does a microchip work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it in China right this now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does Pluto change places with Neptune?''
</P>
<P>
   I began to wonder just what it might be that I do know.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how to form my letters in the D'Nealian style. I
don't know how many books Eric Carle has written. I don't why
koalas are not bears.
</P>
<P>
   After one particularly agonizing afternoon, I told Jack I was
going to seal his mouth shut with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's duct tape, Mom?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah-ha. An easy one. I had just heard a radio program on the very
topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Jack, it was a brown tape invented for soldiers who
needed a tape that wouldn't get weaker when it got wet. They called
it `duck tape' because water ran right off it, like water runs off
a duck's feathers. After the war, they changed the color to silver
and used it to repair air-conditioning and heating units. The name
was changed to `duct tape.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jack's brow furrowed. I was ready for the ``What's a duct?''
question. I got this: ``Which one is powerfuller, duct tape or red
tape?''
</P>
<P>
   When, in the course of human events a man or woman should decide
to rear a child, accept this truth to be self-evident: You'll never
know as much as a second-grader.

   ``JOHN FRANKENHEIMER TESTS HIS METTLE WITH `RONIN.''' From W
magazine. One B&AMP;W photo. Director John Frankenheimer is
refreshingly forthright about the ups and downs of his
motion-picture career: It peaked with such major films as ``All
Fall Down,'' ``Birdman of Alcatraz,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,''
``Seven Days in May'' and ``Black Sunday,'' and then went into a
slow decline over the last two decades. In recent years, the
downturn was reversed by an unlikely savior: cable television. Now,
Frankenheimer will test his mettle on the big screen once again
with the film ``Ronin,'' starring Robert De Niro, Jonathan Pryce,
Jean Reno and Natasha McElhone. An interview.

DESIGNERS LACK DIRECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As the spring 1999 ready-to-wear collections spin from
one ``arrondissement'' to the next, hither and yon across this City
of Light, the view of fashionable women in the year before the
millennium grows dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Often, figuring out fashion is like looking through a
kaleidoscope, then putting the bits and pieces together to form the
image of a woman a la mode for the next six months. But here, now,
the pieces do not connect. Each designer has his or her own vision
and, except for a few loose trends, the twain not only don't meet,
they don't even exchange e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chanel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is a direction, it might be the fuzzy one found in Karl
Lagerfeld's collections for Chanel. They left editors and buyers
scratching their heads _ surely a signal that fashion is indeed in
flux.
</P>
<P>
   Held at the Opera National de Paris Bastille (many call it the
``new opera''), the show consisted of models winding their way down
multiple stories in the foyers. Guests on the lower levels heard
end-of-show applause before laying eyes on two-thirds of the
garments.
</P>
<P>
   Those they could see were bound to have been confusing. Only one
ensemble, the white woven wool suit with tiny cropped jacket and
hip-hung skirt that began the show, bore any resemblance to a
traditional Chanel suit. The model carried a cute, coral miniature
version of the ergonomically shaped 2005 bag.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a coral suit, with ribbons of glittering metallic
threads woven through its wrap-and-shrug jacket and plastic cuff
bracelets stacked up the model's arm.
</P>
<P>
   There was a backless blouse; an orange leather jacket; shiny
nylon pants; a large group of silvery, pearlescent Space Age
sportswear separates; and chiffon-hooded sweat jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts and pants trailed ribbons and panels. Finished seams on
lacquered cotton garments were turned to the outside. Chiffon tops
were worn over denim pants and skirts. And beige was dotted
throughout the collection _ not basic beige, in which a woman could
seek security, but a buff tone, more like a pale flesh color.
</P>
<P>
   Evening wear might be a different matter, however. Taffeta
skirts in purple, brown or navy, with panels sewn to overlap like
petals, were some of the more pleasing designs (but the same
executed in white tulle looked too young for the Chanel customer).
But then, with music that ran from ``Disco to Disco'' to ``Funk
Soul Brother,'' who is to say what woman will begin saving her
francs to buy into a new Chanel image?
</P>
<P>
   Sequins in black, coral, baby blue and white dripped down a
skirt like paint, making a piece so nice you might want to hang it
on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld has shaken fashion to its roots in the past, and he is
sure to do it again. Is this collection a bellwether or only a
blip? Lagerfeld's greatest asset is his unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Givency &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other designers also sought the emerging modern woman, trying to
take their designs past the Space Age modernity of the '60s _ some
with greater success than others. Alexander McQueen, fresh from
rave reviews of his signature collection in London, cut some ersatz
modern shapes, including draped cape-back jersey dresses and
black-gray-white cubist sequined-top dresses and tunics.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen did a fine job of turning out pieces more fluid than the
stiff suits he has produced for Givenchy so far. But the collection
lacked direction and the sense of importance one might expect of
the label.

   Thierry Mugler's collection, on the other hand, flew straight as

pants with huge bites taken out of the front legs. Froufrou and
colorful ruffled chiffons, which closed the show, were fun to watch
but a tad young for the Mugler customer. &QL;

   HOUSTON _ If there's an animal that could use an image
consultant, it's the bat. Hollywood hasn't helped, portraying the
winged critter as a bloodsucking vampire and a dark, moody
superhero.
</P>
<P>
   But the world would be very different without these creatures of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Benson of the Austin-based Bat Conservation International
detailed the economic and ecological importance of bats as the
first speaker in the Zoological Society of Houston's 1998-99 Shell
Oil Co. Foundation Lecture Series on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Without bats, many plants would not get pollinated, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bats are also one of Mother Nature's best pest controllers: A
small brown bat can catch up to 1,200 mosquito-size insects in just
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In his lecture, titled ``Champions of the Night: The Amazing
World of Bats,'' Benson dispelled popular misconceptions about
bats.
</P>
<P>
   One common fallacy is that bats are filthy; in reality, they're
among the cleanest of animals and very resistant to disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats are definitely among the most misunderstood animals,'' he
said. ``Like ... snakes, spiders and sharks, there are a lot of old
myths and stereotypes associated with bats.''

ANALYSTS SAY LOSSES FORCED BANKER TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Analysts believe the sudden resignation Tuesday
of BankAmerica Corp. President David Coulter was prompted by losses
due to speculative investments, and that he was not forced out by
the bank's new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in its first earnings report since its merger last
month with NationsBank of Charlotte, N.C., the new BankAmerica
startled investors by writing off $372 million of a $1.4 billion
loan to the D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co. in New York, a hedge fund that makes
speculative investments. The bank also took a $238 million loss on
Russian government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, a big supporter of the hedge fund, ignored warnings
from his risk-management executives and stayed loyal to the hedge
fund, one investment manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coulter promoted and oversaw the D.E. Shaw transaction, and
when it blew up in his face, he's the one responsible for it,''
said Brian Edgar, director of research for the Sife Trust Fund in
Walnut Creek, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to start off on a bad note like this. There has
always been speculation as to whether Coulter would remain, but no
one expected him to leave within 30 days of the merger,'' Edgar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter said he would remain at the bank through Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts interviewed for this story doubt that Coulter, a
22-year veteran of BankAmerica, was forced out by Hugh McColl, the
bank's new chairman and the chief executive of NationsBank before
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, Coulter and the new bank's board of directors had a
powerful, vested interest in making the merger of equals work, the
analysts say. Furthermore, they say, Coulter commanded respect in
the industry as a hands-on executive who oversaw several successful
sales and acquisitions and division makeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was imperative for both sides to succeed and blend their
strengths into a universal bank,'' said Jay Tejera, a banking
analyst at Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. ``That was the spirit of
the deal, and how it came together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief resignation statement released Tuesday from
Charlotte, Coulter said: ``The decision was extremely difficult for
me, both personally and professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter praised BankAmerica as ``a strong, stable and sound
financial institution'' with a rich heritage and thousands of
``talented and dedicated'' employees.
</P>
<P>
   McColl called Coulter ``a man of the highest integrity.'' He
added: ``It is very painful for me personally to accept his
resignation. We wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   During a shareholders meeting last month to vote on the merger,
McColl defended Coulter's actions. NationsBank announced earlier
this year that it was acquiring San Francisco-based BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   According to one angry BankAmerica director, McColl misled the
old BankAmerica board about Coulter's future earlier this year. In
private meetings before the merger agreement was signed, McColl,
63, vowed that he would retire in two years, so Coulter, 51, could
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad situation,'' the board director said Tuesday.
``Dave is a great guy, a very good strategic thinker who knows the
business. You can't find a better CEO than that. But perhaps he
trusted a guy by the name of McColl whom he shouldn't have
trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter's pink slip stunned BankAmerica employees. Just last
month, Coulter had reassured workers in a companywide voice mail
that he wouldn't abandon the bank in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about the market turmoil in Asia and a couple of
other matters,'' said one veteran bank executive who asked not to
be named. ``But the key thing was he indicated his intention to
stick around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and fund managers said that Coulter was well-regarded
in banking circles for reigning in the big, slow-moving
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous respect throughout the industry,'' Tejera
said. ``He really got the ball rolling after a long period of
stodgy profitability and growth for BankAmerica.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coulter will depart with a golden parachute of $29
million, he also was due to be awarded 300,000 BankAmerica shares
over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the losses were announced, BankAmerica was sued by
shareholders, who alleged that the bank failed to disclose its
hedge-fund exposure while shareholders were voting on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., called for an
inquiry into whether the Office the Comptroller of the Currency
encouraged BankAmerica to delay disclosure of a multimillion-dollar
loss to a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Tejera said the hedge fund issue wasn't the only problem for
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a quarter for the banking Hall of Fame,'' Tejera
said. ``There are a number of smoking guns you can point to:
Securities trading. Investments in emerging markets. Mortgage
banking issues. All of those played a part in the weak quarterly
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts anticipate more writeoffs in the coming fiscal quarters
for BankAmerica. The bank had estimated $1.6 billion in
merger-related charges, including severance pay for executives,
writing off old software, paying for new advertising, and
stationery costs.

BATS IN YOUR BELFRY? CALL A BAT MAN  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAI HUYNH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Phillip Lindhurst is a bat man.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't look anything like Hollywood's Michael Keaton or
George Clooney, though. More like Tim Allen's ``Tool Time'' helper,
moonlighting in the bat exclusion business.
</P>
<P>
   While most bats prefer safe havens such as trees, caves or the
undersides of bridges, as a last resort they may inhabit attics or
walls, getting in through tiny crevices in roofs or eaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This occurs more frequently than people think,'' Lindhurst
said. ``Chances are the bats have been in the homes for years, but
the people don't know they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   A general contractor by trade, Lindhurst excludes bats in his
spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't get rich,'' he said. What he does get is a lot of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bats are so misunderstood,'' said Lindhurst, 44, pointing out
their importance as pest controllers and pollinators. ``They're
beneficial, but you don't want them living in your house.''
</P>
<P>
   There are six species of bats found in the Houston area,
including brown bats and the Mexican free-tails. Although bat guano
makes a great fertilizer, it can bring tears to the eyes from its
overpowering and earthy ammonia scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very offensive, but I'm used to it,'' said
Lindhurst, who is one of only a few bat excluders in the Houston
area.
</P>
<P>
   Bat excluders ``are the people who are knowledgeable about ways
to get bats out of buildings that don't harm the bats,'' according
to Barbara French, information specialist for Bat Conservation
International. To find a bat excluder in your area, call the
Austin-based group at 800-538-2287.
</P>
<P>
   October is a busy time for Lindhurst. Baby bats, which are
usually born in June, are now grown and able to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't exclude them until then,'' he said, explaining that
the mothers would be unable to return, and the babies would die
from starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Lindhurst uses no chemicals, and the bats suffer no physical
harm thanks to a simple exclusion technique that he demonstrated
one afternoon on the roof of a southwest Houston condo.
</P>
<P>
   Using a utility knife, he cut soft wire mesh to size, then
draped and stapled it over a hole the size of a golf ball in an
angle of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can stick your pinky in the hole, the bats can get
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun sets, the bats will crawl out for food, but the
wire mesh will prevent them from flying back in. Later, after all
the bats have vacated, he will caulk the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Along with excluding bats, Lindhurst wants to build a large bat
house that would accommodate thousands of the creatures. He's
currently rallying support for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all we're doing is just chasing them from house to
house. My goal is to see a refuge for the bats established in a
nonresident area within the city. This way we can enjoy the
benefits of bats, but without the inconveniences they cause in the
home.'' &QL;

MITCHELL BELIEVES PEACE WILL ENDURE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After more than three years spent brokering a
historic peace accord in Northern Ireland, George J. Mitchell had
not fully comprehended the courage of the Irish people until he met
15-year-old Claire Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mitchell accompanied President Clinton and Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain to meet grieving families who lost
loved ones in an August bomb blast in Omagh that killed 29 people
and wounded more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell told the story to a hushed, sold-out crowd of 1,200
people Tuesday night in the gymnasium of the College of Saint Rose
in Albany. He said the gym reminded him of the one in Omagh where
he tried to comfort yet more innocent victims of a three-decade
cycle of sectarian violence that has pitted Protestants against
Catholics and claimed 3,500 lives in British-ruled Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallagher girl was ``tall, gangly and lovely,'' Mitchell
said. She is an aspiring pianist who had both of her eyes blown out
in the blast and she wore ``two large patches where her eyes had
been.'' And still the disfigured girl ``poignantly, trying to be
courageous, spoke of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Senate majority leader and Northern Ireland
peacemaker always returned to the touchstone of ordinary people as
the bedrock of international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the May 22 public referendum on the Good Friday
peace accord was the first all-island vote in 80 years, and that 85
percent of those who voted _ both Catholics and Protestants _
supported peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have spoken,'' said Mitchell, who represented Maine
in the Senate from 1980 to 1994. ``The people do not want to go
back to the bitterness and violence of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He said splinter groups that seek to derail the peace process _
such as the offshoot of the Irish Republican Army, the Real IRA,
that planted the Omagh bomb _ had no broad support. ``The Real IRA
was not speaking for their communities,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Mitchell told the editorial board of the Albany
Times Union he remains ``cautiously optimistic'' that the fragile
peace will move forward and that disputes will arise in the coming
months and years, but ``compromise and cooperation'' will carry the
day.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the notion that the outstanding issue of disarming
the IRA will destroy the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he did not take it as a personal slight that he
was not named a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement
in the Northern Ireland peace process. The prize was awarded to two
other players in Northern Ireland, David Trimble, Protestant head
of the Ulster Unionist Party, and John Hume, head of the Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   But he would have liked to make Nobel recipients out of the
leaders of all eight political parties involved and the Irish and
British governments, too. ``It made sense to me to include
everybody who took the risk for peace,'' Mitchell said.

FLAVORS OF FALL TITILLATE TASTE BUDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're younger than 25, you may never have eaten a turnip, a
rutabaga or a beet. But new generations are discovering these and
other somewhat obscure vegetables thanks to adventurous cooks and
restaurants. And they're learning just how delicious root
vegetables can be with pures, baked and roasted vegetables, slaws
and salads.
</P>
<P>
   October signals the beginning of the fall harvest season. Many
crops were affected by the drought earlier in the year and the
devastating floods that followed, especially in West Texas and the
Rio Grande Valley, but there will be a good supply of squash,
turnips, rutabagas and carrots, says Michael Marx, assistant
produce merchandiser for Kroger in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   David Asher, produce category manager for Randalls in Houston,
says many drought-plagued farmers didn't plant seasonal crops
because of water restrictions. Since grocery chains fill in with
produce from other areas, especially California and Florida, and
Asher doesn't foresee shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that prices should be about the same or a
little cheaper because of last year's bad winter, which drove
prices up. Because the hot weather has extended into October, many
recently planted winter crops are already sprouting. That may mean
they will peak earlier and that some will be harder to find around
their normal time, the holidays, so prices may rise.
</P>
<P>
   Look for good buys in hard-shell squash and locally grown greens
and herbs, Marx said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small but consistent demand for turnips, rutabagas
and beets, generally in October and November, Marx said. People
often ignore root vegetables because they require more preparation
and cooking time than convenience products such as packaged carrots
and salad mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Before old-fashioned vegetables become an endangered species,
give them a try. Roast turnips, rutabagas and potatoes for a
vegetable platter. Add beets to a salad. Make carrot soup. Stuff
squash or bake a sweet potato for a vegetarian entree. Enrich a
comforting stew with chunks of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Turnips, rutabagas and beets should never be boiled vigorously.
Put them in cold water to cover, bring to a boil, cover, reduce
heat and simmer until tender.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEETS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beets, which come in different sizes, varieties and colors, are
a love-hate vegetable. You either love them or hate them. They can
be roasted, steamed, boiled or microwaved. Beets also can be cooked
whole, sliced, cut in chunks or pickled.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy beets with greens attached, remove much of the greens
if you plan to store them in the refrigerator more than two days,
but leave about 1 inch of greens attached.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cooking: Cut off greens, leaving about 1 inch of stems
attached. (If you cut off stems completely, beets will ``bleed.'')
Place in pan, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, reduce heat,
cover pan, and simmer 20 minutes (for baby beets) to 1 hour or
until they can easily be pierced with a sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, add water to keep beets covered as they cook. When
done, drain, cool until you can handle them, and slip off the peel
or pare with a paring knife. Cut off the root. To microwave beets,
see the recipe that follows. To peel baby beets, scrub with a brush
before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sliced cooked beets provides 26 calories, 5.7 grams
carbohydrates and 42 milligrams sodium. Key nutrients: Vitamin C
and folacin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TURNIPS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Vegetables'' (William Morrow, $35), author James Peterson
said that he so dreaded turnips growing up _ their reputation had
preceded them _ that he never tried them until he was in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't discover that a turnip could be something good until
I lived in France,'' Peterson said of the food he once loathed and
feared. At a famous restaurant in the French countryside, he
discovered turnips were a great delicacy when served a plate of
sliced ones that had been gently caramelized in port wine and
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Turnips seem to be best when served with meat or cooked in meat
juices, Peterson said. Avoid turnips with wrinkled skins or those
that are beginning to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To store turnips with greens in the refrigerator, place in
perforated plastic bags. They will keep for several days. For
longer storage, remove greens about 1 inch above the turnip.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cooking: Remove wax if any; peel. Cook small turnips
whole, or dice, quarter or cut in strips. Place in cold water to
cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 15 to 20
minutes, until tender. Drain and season as desired.
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup mashed turnips provide 21 calories, 5.6 grams
carbohydrates and 58 milligrams sodium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUTABAGAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutabagas look like giant turnips and can be cooked the same
way,'' Peterson said in ``Vegetables.'' Turned vegetables are
carved with a knife into large garlic clove shapes. Store unwrapped
in the refrigerator as long as two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup mashed rutabaga provides 41 calories, 1.3 grams
protein, 9.3 grams carbohydrates and 22 milligrams sodium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SWEET POTATOES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes are not related to white potatoes or yams. Look
for potatoes of uniform shape that taper from the middle and have
smooth skin. They bruise more easily than white potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cooking: Scrub well; dry. Pierce skin with a fork or
skewer to allow steam to escape. Bake whole sweet potatoes in their
skins in a 400-degree oven 40 to 45 minutes or longer. Bake in a
shallow pan to catch sticky juices.
</P>
<P>
   To microwave: Pierce potato once or twice and microwave on high
(100 percent) 5 to 8 minutes. Turn over once; turn a quarter-turn
twice if microwave has no turntable. Let potatoes rest after
microwaving to allow them to finish cooking and soften. To cook 4
medium potatoes, pierce, arrange in a circle and microwave 13 to 17
minutes, turning as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   One medium sweet potato, baked in skin, provides 118 calories, 2
grams protein, 27.7 grams carbohydrates and 12 milligrams sodium.
Key nutrients: Vitamins A, B6, C and beta carotene.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CARROTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carrots add color, crunch, sweetness and flavor to everything
from soup to cake.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid carrots that are limp or have cracks along the sides. Buy
fresh carrots with green tops, but remove tops (2 inches above
carrot) before storing in the refrigerator. In a tightly sealed
plastic bag, carrots may be stored for weeks. Peel them or not,
depending on the use and the esthetics of the dish. As an
alternative to peeling, scrub carrots with a nylon scrubber or
vegetable brush.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cooking: Wash well with a stiff vegetable brush or
scrubber; trim ends. Cook whole, slice into rounds, cut diagonally,
or in strips or sticks. Boil, covered, in a small amount of water.
Remove cover a few minutes near end of cooking time. Cook until
tender.
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sliced boiled carrots provides 25 to 30 calories,
8.2 grams carbohydrates and 52 milligrams sodium. Key nutrients:
Vitamin A, betacarotene and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SQUASH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winter (hardshell) squash, such as acorn, buttercup, butternut,
Hubbard, Kabocha, spaghetti and turban, make delicious soups and
vegetable entrees _ plain or with stuffing or sauces. Hardshell
squash can be baked, steamed or microwaved.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cooking: Wash; cut in half; discard seeds. Bake, cut side
down, in a shallow baking dish at 400 degrees until fork-tender, 30
to 60 minutes depending on size. To microwave, place halves, cut
side down, on microwave platter and cook on high (100 percent)
until tender, 5 to 15 minutes. Let sit about 5 minutes and test for
tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   For large whole squash, such as Hubbard, pierce in several
places with a skewer or ice pick so steam can escape. Microwave 6
minutes per pound. Let stand 5 minutes, then peel. Or cut squash
into large pieces and microwave with a little water, covered, 10 to
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup baked cubed winter squash provides 44 calories, 8.9
grams protein and 2.9 grams fiber.  &QL;

HAZELNUTS ENHANCE AUTUMN VEGETABLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN STEINER 
and CICI WILLIAMSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bit of crisp in the air signals harvest time for apples,
winter squash and hazelnuts. Like the basil and fresh tomatoes of
summer, fall's flavors meld tastefully.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, food editors and writers from across the country
converged in Portland, Ore., for the Association of Food
Journalists' annual conference. There we toured some of Oregon's
hazelnut groves that produce 99 percent of the U.S. crop.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelnuts found their way to Oregon with a Frenchman who planted
a grove of 50 trees in the lush Willamette Valley. Cultivation of
these flavorful nuts began more than 4,500 years ago in China.
According to an ancient Chinese manuscript, hazelnuts were one of
five sacred nourishments God bestowed to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their role as a snack, hazelnuts can be made into
pesto, combined with honey to make a filling for fruit, chopped and
scattered on the surface of soup, and used in many other creative
ways. For fall soups, hazelnuts and squash are a natural marriage
of flavors. Apples, too, benefit from being paired with hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   As desirable as the nutmeats are, the skins are not. To roast
hazelnuts in the microwave, spread a layer of shelled hazelnuts in
a glass pie plate and microwave on high 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
midway through roasting. To remove skins, rub the hazelnuts while
they are warm with a rough cloth or between your hands. &QL;

CULTURE WARS ARE FODDER FOR FOOLS _ HERE'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (WITH CANON-SIDE)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In 1632, the young English poet John Milton, just out
of college, took up residence at his father's country estate at
Horton, near Windsor. And for the next six years he managed to read
everything that had ever been written and was extant, in all
languages living and dead, that a European scholar of the time
might have heard of. That included literature, history, biography,
philosophy, science, mathematics _ the whole throatful of it.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Everything that had ever been written. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   It boggles the mind. Today, we cannot even keep up with the
magazines we subscribe to; most of human knowledge falls off the
edge of the Earth, where the map of our erudition shows nothing but
serpents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of human knowledge, at least in such magazines
as ``People'' and ``TV Guide,'' is utterly trivial, and it would be
a crime to stuff our brains with it.
</P>
<P>
   But not all knowledge in this information age is trivial. There
is still a core of useful literature _ and I use the word in the
broadest possible sense _ that it behooves us to be acquainted
with.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that there is an argument over this. In the
imbecilic culture wars that currently ravage the intellectual
countryside, the lines are drawn between ignorant armies.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, you find right-wing reactionary fossils fighting to
maintain the canon of mainly European classics. On the other side,
there is a cadre of victimization that wants to eliminate anything
written by dead white males.
</P>
<P>
   A pox on both their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Milton didn't have to worry about the canon. For him, the canon
encompassed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, though, we have had to become more selective.
Those items we have, as a culture, thought worth perpetuating we
have called ``classics'' and added them to the list _ the canon _
of ``required reading.''
</P>
<P>
   But we misunderstand the very idea of culture if we believe the
world froze solid with the publication of the Harvard Five Foot
Shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The canon is a garden that must be weeded and tended, and each
season may call forth a different harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the conservative view is that it values a
former ``golden age'' that our own time never measures up to. It is
a sentimental view of life and history, and deaf to the fact that
we live now, not in the imaginary ``then.'' It is the voice of
Cato, of Corneille, of William Bennett _ a man of whom it is said
he cannot sleep a-nights if he suspects someone, somewhere is
having fun.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view of an idealized perfection that we have
disastrously fallen short of. It is one form of imbecility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem from the other side is an egalitarianism that is
just as moronic. According to them, nothing is better than anything
else. Either it is merely a question of personal taste, or it is
one of cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   By their standards, it is elitist to prefer Pablo Neruda to Rod
McKuen. Let them, I say, let them renew their subscriptions to
``Us'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   They can deconstruct its gossip to death and find the parallels
with Plutarch _ if they only knew who Plutarch was.
</P>
<P>
   By their logic, a culture that condones slavery is just
different, not worse, than a culture that outlaws it. By their
logic, no discernible difference can be found between, say, Hitler
and Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they perversely maintain that, although there are no
standards for cultural quality, there are rigid standards for
political purity. The two sides of their argument are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   For them, politics overwhelms aesthetics _ overwhelms reason,
emotion, common sense and experience. For them, everything has a
party line. Ah, but they forget, politics answers no question worth
asking.
</P>
<P>
   It also worries me that behind the masks of intellectual
argument, I sense a fascism on one side and a laziness on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a priggishness to both sides that any
reasonable human finds dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, the problem is that both sides make the mistake of
believing the canon immutable and fixed. They see the canon as an
end, one side blindly despising it and the other defending it like
Texans at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   But the canon, properly seen, is a beginning, not an end; a
foundation, not a roof.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ABC of cultural literacy, the cardinal numbers of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   There is a body of culture that one ``should have read.''
Familiarity with it makes the rest of culture comprehensible. It is
a key to understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you cannot read Thoreau without recognizing the King
James thundering behind his prose, how can you understand Jacques
Derrida without standing firmly on the firm ground of Kant's a
priori? How can you read Isabel Allende without sensing the
spirituality of Calderon behind her words?
</P>
<P>
   The so-called canon in reality is not exclusionary, but
inclusive. It wants new excellences. It clamors to add Toni
Morrison to the list, not shut her out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a side issue that bothers the left on this issue, and
that is what they call the ``hegemony'' of European thought.
</P>
<P>
   And the canon, as defended by the right, tends to be heavily
weighted by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   That pre-eminence, the left says, discriminates against African,
Asian and Latin writers and thinkers. European thought _ which they
numbingly see as monolithic rather than infinitely diverse _
somehow squats upon victim cultures and squelches their natural
expressivity.
</P>
<P>
   I would be the last one to defend five centuries of European
colonialism; that continent has a lot to account for.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth of the matter is that European culture, filtered
through America, has become the closest thing to a world culture as
there has ever been. For good or ill, the Chinese aspire to learn
English, Hindus boot up Windows and Hawaiians spin a diatonic
Michael Jackson in their CD players.
</P>
<P>
   There are European seeds at the base of medicine, physics,
technology, democracy and French Post-Structuralism.
</P>
<P>
   But the world culture is not simply Euro-culture. It is deeply
changed and inflected by every local culture it comes in contact
with. It is not, after all, Mozart that the world dances to, but
rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   So let us learn as much as we can in the short span of life we
have. And let us not think of the cultural canon as something we
inflict on others, but as something we are open to that opens us up
yet further.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of education is not to reinforce our provincialisms
but to open a large, bright world of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   I wish to promulgate the notion of ``serious-mindedness.'' That
is, the notion that some ideas are better than others, that
rigorous tests of truth and authenticity are better than feel-good
ego massages, that we should aspire upward toward those things that
are better than what we have now, and recognize shortsightedness
for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   By serious-mindedness, I by no means mean humorlessness. One of
the greatest works in the canon, after all, is the ``Divine
Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious-mindedness is not puritanism, not the schoolmarmish
rigidity of Bill Bennett or Ken Starr. That is rather
small-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   No, I mean that when we pick up something to read, we should
prefer something by Czeslaw Milosz, Wole Soyinka or Anna Akhmetova
to drivel by Stephen King, Tom Clancy or Danielle Steel. And the
more we read upward instead of downward, the deeper our ultimate
pleasure will be.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewise, we sell ourselves short. &QL;

   ROME _ Like shipping rice to China, coals to Newcastle, steel to
Pittsburgh .... Viagra to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra in Italy?
</P>
<P>
   What use could there be for the little blue ``love pill'' in a
country renowned for its romantic ardor and sexual prowess?
</P>
<P>
   This is the land that bred the likes of Casanova, Marcello
Mastroianni and Alberto Tomba. Trying to sell Italians on the need
for Viagra must be like trying to convince them to drive slower.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, just below the front-page story in my Rome
newspaper about Viagra's October debut is this headline: ``Drivers
Urged To Slow Down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country that gave us the Lamborghini and the Maserati, a
new public-service campaign wants motorists to ease off the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Check the plane tickets, did I land in the right country?
</P>
<P>
   I did. Here's the News Flash: Italians are not great lovers, at
least not ALL of them. And they may like to drive their sleek
sports cars like the wind, but speed kills them, just as it does
Americans in their Fords and Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the facts get in the way of long-cherished
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   With no one else to hold accountable, I blame the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the coalition of countries has brought stability to the
continent, eliminating the grave worries of earlier this century --
things like the march of fascism and world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the EU also is serving to homogenize Europe -- creating
uniform standards, open borders and, in the near future, common
banknotes and coins. Brussels is to Europe what Washington is to
America, telling them how they should live and what's good for them
and not.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, Italy becomes less Italian, needing the help
of modern science to make love and driving Ferraris at a
school-zone crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they'll tell us that the French no longer find Jerry Lewis
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet images die hard and Italians have an abiding taste for the
good life, and not necessarily what's good for them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that only 20 percent of Italian motorists
regularly buckle up a decade after the mandatory seat-belt law was
introduced. One entrepreneur has made a small fortune manufacturing
white t-shirts printed with a black stripe running diagonally,
meeting one that runs horizontally at the bottom -- to fool police
into thinking the belt is buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Such evidence suggests that Italian motorists will not be
slowing down anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Viagra, never underestimate the power of sexual
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities say there are some five million impotent
Italians who could use the drug. But they fear there are millions
more who simply may want it as a hedge against performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the pressure on Italian men, who have an entire national
identity to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll earlier this year found -- to the
disappointment of the Italian food company which commissioned it --
that female tourists from Europe and the United States cite hopes
of ``passion'' as their number one reason for visiting the country.
Enjoying the pasta and chianti were second place.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Alicico's pharmacy in downtown Rome has been flooded
with calls from men who mistakenly think the pill is an
aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Italians, they feel very macho. The sexual persona they
feel very much,'' Alicico says of the callers he has turned away.
``It is clear Viagra will have higher sales in Italy because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the myth lives.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also remains firmly Italian in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The country resolutely lacks anything resembling a consensus on
how the place should be run. In Rome this week, they are trying to
form a new coalition government after the last one fell earlier in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 56th change of leadership since World War II, and
actually prompted some political pundits in Rome to express concern
that Italy's European partners will not take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Italy should be Italy, the European Union be damned.
With 40 different political parties, serial governments have become
a way of life and yet another icon of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Corriere della Sera commented: ``Heaven only knows
what new political concoction will be dreamed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Roma ... that's more like it.

CULTURE WARS ARE FODDER FOR FOOLS _ HERE'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In 1632, the young English poet John Milton, just out
of college, took up residence at his father's country estate at
Horton, near Windsor. And for the next six years he managed to read
everything that had ever been written and was extant, in all
languages living and dead, that a European scholar of the time
might have heard of. That included literature, history, biography,
philosophy, science, mathematics _ the whole throatful of it.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Everything that had ever been written. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   It boggles the mind. Today, we cannot even keep up with the
magazines we subscribe to; most of human knowledge falls off the
edge of the Earth, where the map of our erudition shows nothing but
serpents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of human knowledge, at least in such magazines
as ``People'' and ``TV Guide,'' is utterly trivial, and it would be
a crime to stuff our brains with it.
</P>
<P>
   But not all knowledge in this information age is trivial. There
is still a core of useful literature _ and I use the word in the
broadest possible sense _ that it behooves us to be acquainted
with.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that there is an argument over this. In the
imbecilic culture wars that currently ravage the intellectual
countryside, the lines are drawn between ignorant armies.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, you find right-wing reactionary fossils fighting to
maintain the canon of mainly European classics. On the other side,
there is a cadre of victimization that wants to eliminate anything
written by dead white males.
</P>
<P>
   A pox on both their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Milton didn't have to worry about the canon. For him, the canon
encompassed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, though, we have had to become more selective.
Those items we have, as a culture, thought worth perpetuating we
have called ``classics'' and added them to the list _ the canon _
of ``required reading.''
</P>
<P>
   But we misunderstand the very idea of culture if we believe the
world froze solid with the publication of the Harvard Five Foot
Shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The canon is a garden that must be weeded and tended, and each
season may call forth a different harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the conservative view is that it values a
former ``golden age'' that our own time never measures up to. It is
a sentimental view of life and history, and deaf to the fact that
we live now, not in the imaginary ``then.'' It is the voice of
Cato, of Corneille, of William Bennett _ a man of whom it is said
he cannot sleep a-nights if he suspects someone, somewhere is
having fun.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view of an idealized perfection that we have
disastrously fallen short of. It is one form of imbecility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem from the other side is an egalitarianism that is
just as moronic. According to them, nothing is better than anything
else. Either it is merely a question of personal taste, or it is
one of cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
   By their standards, it is elitist to prefer Pablo Neruda to Rod
McKuen. Let them, I say, let them renew their subscriptions to
``Us'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   They can deconstruct its gossip to death and find the parallels
with Plutarch _ if they only knew who Plutarch was.
</P>
<P>
   By their logic, a culture that condones slavery is just
different, not worse, than a culture that outlaws it. By their
logic, no discernible difference can be found between, say, Hitler
and Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they perversely maintain that, although there are no
standards for cultural quality, there are rigid standards for
political purity. The two sides of their argument are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   For them, politics overwhelms aesthetics _ overwhelms reason,
emotion, common sense and experience. For them, everything has a
party line. Ah, but they forget, politics answers no question worth
asking.
</P>
<P>
   It also worries me that behind the masks of intellectual
argument, I sense a fascism on one side and a laziness on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a priggishness to both sides that any
reasonable human finds dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, the problem is that both sides make the mistake of
believing the canon immutable and fixed. They see the canon as an
end, one side blindly despising it and the other defending it like
Texans at the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   But the canon, properly seen, is a beginning, not an end; a
foundation, not a roof.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ABC of cultural literacy, the cardinal numbers of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   There is a body of culture that one ``should have read.''
Familiarity with it makes the rest of culture comprehensible. It is
a key to understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you cannot read Thoreau without recognizing the King
James thundering behind his prose, how can you understand Jacques
Derrida without standing firmly on the firm ground of Kant's a
priori? How can you read Isabel Allende without sensing the
spirituality of Calderon behind her words?
</P>
<P>
   The so-called canon in reality is not exclusionary, but
inclusive. It wants new excellences. It clamors to add Toni
Morrison to the list, not shut her out.
</P>
<P>
   There is a side issue that bothers the left on this issue, and
that is what they call the ``hegemony'' of European thought.
</P>
<P>
   And the canon, as defended by the right, tends to be heavily
weighted by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   That pre-eminence, the left says, discriminates against African,
Asian and Latin writers and thinkers. European thought _ which they
numbingly see as monolithic rather than infinitely diverse _
somehow squats upon victim cultures and squelches their natural
expressivity.
</P>
<P>
   I would be the last one to defend five centuries of European
colonialism; that continent has a lot to account for.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth of the matter is that European culture, filtered
through America, has become the closest thing to a world culture as
there has ever been. For good or ill, the Chinese aspire to learn
English, Hindus boot up Windows and Hawaiians spin a diatonic
Michael Jackson in their CD players.
</P>
<P>
   There are European seeds at the base of medicine, physics,
technology, democracy and French Post-Structuralism.
</P>
<P>
   But the world culture is not simply Euro-culture. It is deeply
changed and inflected by every local culture it comes in contact
with. It is not, after all, Mozart that the world dances to, but
rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   So let us learn as much as we can in the short span of life we
have. And let us not think of the cultural canon as something we
inflict on others, but as something we are open to that opens us up
yet further.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of education is not to reinforce our provincialisms
but to open a large, bright world of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   I wish to promulgate the notion of ``serious-mindedness.'' That
is, the notion that some ideas are better than others, that
rigorous tests of truth and authenticity are better than feel-good
ego massages, that we should aspire upward toward those things that
are better than what we have now, and recognize shortsightedness
for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   By serious-mindedness, I by no means mean humorlessness. One of
the greatest works in the canon, after all, is the ``Divine
Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious-mindedness is not puritanism, not the schoolmarmish
rigidity of Bill Bennett or Ken Starr. That is rather
small-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   No, I mean that when we pick up something to read, we should
prefer something by Czeslaw Milosz, Wole Soyinka or Anna Akhmetova
to drivel by Stephen King, Tom Clancy or Danielle Steel. And the
more we read upward instead of downward, the deeper our ultimate
pleasure will be.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewise, we sell ourselves short. &QL;

   TILE-DESIGN (Undated) _ Tile has always been long on service,
but it's no longer short on style. Subway-white may still be their
basic black, but after 50 years of an institutional lull, tile
makers are rediscovering tile's fabled power to please and inspire.
Thanks to a new market of colors, sizes and materials, the simple
tile wall has become a world of options. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   TILE-LEARN (New York) _ No one doubts tiling can be poorly done,
especially veterans of their own attempts. ``When I started out 18
years ago, my first 40 calls were repairs,'' said Stephen
Spretnjak, a New York artist and tile worker. ``I learned how to
tile by going over somebody's mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   SANDRA-BERNHARD-MOM (New York) _ It was mom to mom: an actress
with a 16-week-old baby, a reporter with a toddler. Is the baby
sleeping well? How's she eating? ``I don't get caught up in the
cliches of being a mother,'' snapped Sandra Bernhard, in bare feet,
a B-movie A-line skirt and not an ounce of baby fat. Ms. Bernhard
is back in town, taking her improvisational one-woman downtown
show, ``I'm Still Here ... Damn It!'' to Broadway. By Julie Iovine.

</P>
<P>
   FERGUSON-ARCHITECTURE (Bridgewater, Conn.) _ For every architect
there is an ideal client. When Peter May met his architect, Mark
Ferguson, his estate consisted of a gray saltbox house here on 11
acres overlooking a valley and mountain in western Connecticut.
Ferguson wasn't the King of Limestone then. He was a young man
fresh from Parish-Hadley, the chintz-strewn interior design firm,
setting up practice with two others who billed themselves as
Traditional Architects; men who belived firmly in the vocabulary of
classical times. May was only the first in a series of well-to-do
men and women to seek out Ferguson, though this first commission
would hardly compare to the grandeur of the architect's later
designs. By Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   LASERS-TEENS (Undated) _ The path from technological miracle to
public nuisance is often a direct one. Witness the descent of the
laser, the pure, steady light that can cut diamonds or could, in
theory, carry all the world's electronic information simultaneously
on a single beam. The laser has found its lowest-common-denominator
use in the form of the pointer. More recently, these devices, some
of which can project little red dots 800 yards or more, have become
the newest playthings of mischievous teen-agers. By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-CATALOGS (New York) _ These days, as the holiday season
approaches, postal bags swell to Santa-size proportions with
mail-order catalogs. This week, there will be two new arrivals in
the mail _ both from small downtown design stores that are new to
the mail-order business. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-AGNELI (Undated) _ A new book, ``The Agnelli Gardens at
Villar Perosa'' (Harry N. Abrams, $75), is filled with fuzzy
pictures of very beautiful gardens in the Piedmont region of Italy,
virtually secret gardens that have never been opened to the public.
They cover 25 acres surrounding the Agnelli family seat in the
village of Villar Perosa 30 miles north of Turin. The beautiful but
impressionistic pictures hint at more than a taste for witty
abstraction. They underline a consistent attempt to gauze-wrap any
critical focus on a family that, in Italy, is seen as comparable to
the Kennedys. By Mac Griswold.

 &HT;    As the evidence has mounted against President Clinton, I

 &HT;    President Gerald Ford's recommendation that Clinton be publicly
rebuked in the well of the House of Representatives is not the
answer. It would only further diminish Clinton's effectiveness at a
time when we need a strong, respected president _ not a man whose
reputation has been totally destroyed by an embarrassing public
rebuke on the House floor.
 &HT;    By now, Clinton has been reduced to attending political
fund-raisers and making endless phone calls to friends seeking
their advice on his pitiful personal crisis.
 &HT;    More than 180 newspapers have called for Clinton to resign. Many
have editorialized that his inexcusable actions in the Oval Office
threaten to seriously erode the integrity of the nation and damage
the standards, morals and ethics of our young people.
 &HT;    History teaches us that for any free society to survive and
thrive it must rest on a strong moral and ethical base. The issue
is not, ``Did he lie under oath?'' The issue is, ``Did he lie?''
And the answer is yes.
 &HT;    Clinton has taught our children to lie. Clinton has taught our
nation that a man does not have to be faithful to his wife and
family and can repeatedly devastate them by his irresponsible
actions. Clinton has taught our students in high school and college
that anything goes in their sexual behavior.
 &HT;    No wonder at least seven Boy Scouts in Utah who won Eagle awards
for observing the oath of honor and duty to God, country and self _
the highest commendation boys age 11 to 17 can earn _ refused their
certificates with Clinton's signature as honorary president of the
Boy Scouts of America.
 &HT;    Our children learn the words of our first president, George
Washington, who said, ``I cannot tell a lie.'' Two hundred years
later we have a president, Bill Clinton, who cannot tell the truth.
 &HT;    Any person who observes Clinton's behavior _ ranging from
intelligent to clever to wildly reckless and juvenile _ can only
conclude that he is emotionally unstable. And he shows a complete
inability to learn from the ill-chosen experiences of his youth,
from promiscuity to ``experimentation'' with drugs to evading the
draft.
 &HT;    Again and again, as a married adult, he has taken advantage of
women _ whether it's Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky
or others whose names are not in the public record. He has earned
their disrespect and destroyed their lives. Any business executive,
high school principal or police chief who repeatedly lied and had
sex with an employee would be fired.
 &HT;    Why should we accept a lower standard from Clinton, who as
president is charged with life-and-death responsibilities?
 &HT;    Any member of the military who lies will be court-martialed,
without regard to whether he was under oath. Any military person
who is involved in sexual harassment or adultery will be
court-martialed.
 &HT;    Clinton, as commander in chief, surely must be held to these
same standards. He has the ability to order our precious sons and
daughters off to war to fight and die. Yet the motivation, wisdom
and rationality of his judgment are highly debatable in matters of
domestic and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Clinton has lied to the people he loves the most and he has
repeatedly devastated them _ his immediate family and closest
colleagues and friends _ and yet the pattern persists. He is
willing to inflict serious long-term damage on the Democratic
Party, our nation and millions of people throughout the world just
to stay in power.
 &HT;    As a young man campaigning for Congress in Arkansas in 1974,
Clinton repeatedly included references to President Richard Nixon's
predicament. ``I think it's plain that (Nixon) should resign and
spare the country the agony of this impeachment and removal
proceeding,'' Clinton said, according to the Arkansas Democrat on
Aug. 6, 1974. ``There's not any point now in (Nixon) putting the
country through an impeachment since he isn't making any pretense
of innocence now,'' Clinton said, according to the Little Rock
Gazette on Aug. 8, 1974.
 &HT;    After making these demands on Nixon, why doesn't Clinton hold
himself to the same standard of accountability and resign?
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't understand duty, honor, country or faith,
courage, service or truth _ and honor beyond all. He certainly does
not understand the Navy's ethic: ``When principle is involved, be
deaf to expediency.''
 &HT;    We cannot take the privileges and freedom we have in this great

 By MICHAEL HIRSH  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

 &HT;    
 By DAVID S. BENNAHUM  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    For the few of us into computers at Horace Mann in 1982, the
computer room on the third floor of Tillinghast Hall was the
greatest place at school. With its lead-paned windows overlooking
the football field, its polished floor and rows of terminals in
tidy rows, the computer room existed as our private library and
club room.
 &HT;    During free periods, when other kids might go outside to play
touch football or gossip in the cafeteria, I could be found
upstairs at a terminal, playing games and programming with my
friends. There, amid the silence, interrupted by the clicking of
keys and the soft tapping of chalk on the blackboard, we competed
fiercely to be the best programmers. It was a place where things
happened quietly, but explosively.
 &HT;    Pranks were a natural part of the room. I'd written programs
that fooled seventh-graders into thinking our shared computer, a
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11, was conscious. Others had
found ways to fool skilled programmers into thinking the computer
could no longer add properly (2 + 2   5!).
 &HT;    Creativity ran rampant. The walls were covered with elegant
``ASCII art'' _ pictures of Snoopy and the New York skyline we'd
made from collections of letters that from a distance assembled
themselves into an image. A few had mastered the eight-pen color
plotter, learning to produce marvelous geometric shapes, swirling
vortices and rippling landscapes.
 &HT;    The computer room was also a safe haven, a family of sorts. We
were mostly boys _ though a few girls spent time there _ and many
of us came from families with divorced parents.
 &HT;    I faced turmoil at home, living between my mom and dad,
separated from my sister. Another boy, Misha, faced such acrimony
at home as his parents underwent a particularly bitter breakup that
he threw himself into programming with relentless intensity,
eventually creating an after-school business writing programs for
Wall Street corporations and earning enough money to pay for
college himself.
 &HT;    In the computer room, all the worries of the real world faded
away, replaced by the exhilaration of the quest, a gleeful sense of
discovery and the joy of being best at something.
 &HT;    I was exposed to a remarkable computer curriculum, and nearly
everything I know about computers and technology comes from those
years on the third floor of Tillinghast. My friends and I were
among the first at our Bronx, N.Y., school, and in America, to have
computers at home. At 13 I owned an Atari 800 with 48K of RAM;
another pal, Jeremy Bozza, had an Apple II; Misha had a TRS-80;
others had Commodore 64s and VIC-20s.
 &HT;    It was a unique time, the Golden Age for computer and kid. The
machine was available to us unconcealed, stripped to its component
parts, at the same time when most adults barely understood what we
were doing. The evolution of the machine briefly matched the
evolution of our adolescent selves, becoming a vessel and partner,
a co-conspirator in our coming of age.
 &HT;    One of the rare adults who did understand computers was our
teacher, Mr. Moran. He was a big man with a red beard, red hair and
heavy forearms like a lumberjack's. His eyes were luminous
gray-blue, and he always wore silver glasses, which softened his
appearance, giving him an intelligent presence, as if he noticed
everything. He existed in my mind as a descendant of Vikings, a
benevolent warrior, at the helm of our ship, guiding the room
through waters of knowledge.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran left Horace Mann in 1988. Today he doesn't teach kids;
he teaches adults through the Global Knowledge Network, an outfit
that provides continuing education to corporate employees. For Mr.
Moran (his first name is Ed, but I still find it impossible to call
him anything but Mr. Moran), who has taught for 23 years, computer
education has shifted from learning how to program to a form of
digital bricolage where prewritten subroutines are linked together
to form programs.
 &HT;    Computers are now infinitely more powerful than they were when I
mastered them. They're also far more opaque. For a kid now, getting
beneath Windows 98 or Mac OS 8.0 is nearly impossible. Our priority
has shifted to teaching people how to be Power Users: dexterous at
using software, rather than creating it.
 &HT;    But using computers ``out of the box'' is a lot easier than it
used to be. Clicking on an icon requires less study than going into
a Basic programming environment. These ``friendlier'' systems have
broadened access and turned what was mostly a hobbyist subculture
into a part of mass culture.
 &HT;    What is lost is the idea that kids can ever learn to understand
computers, or that any of us, as computer users, can have
fundamental control over what they do. We're supposed to know how
to use the tools, not make the tools.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran taught us to make things, using the elements of
computing as our tools. The notion that we would become merely
educated consumers would have seemed ludicrous and unworthy as a
goal. I grew up feeling I really understood computers.
 &HT;    Back in the early 1980s, when computer education was in its
infancy, student-crafted software was essential to the curriculum.
Schools nationwide hadn't begun to invest in computer courses, and
few companies provided software environments for teaching below the
university level.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran, through organic evolution, trial and error, created
an open system, both in the way the computer functioned and in the
social fabric of the computer room. The machine and the kids
existed in symbiosis, each a part of the other.
 &HT;    Without the student system administrators writing programs,
updating software, managing the younger students, answering their
questions, Mr. Moran would have been incapable of being teacher,
guide, administrator and sometimes policeman. More important,
centralized control by one teacher was antithetical to the ethic of
exploration and gleeful discovery fostered by access to computers.
Mr. Moran recognized this and promoted a communal ownership of the
computer system.
 &HT;    This whole philosophy reflected the belief that for kids to be
well-educated, responsible citizens in the digital age, knowing how
computers worked would not be enough. Their education would be
incomplete without a genuine understanding of the moral and ethical
questions brought up by information technology. Who owns software?
Where does someone's electronic property or territory begin and
end? At what point do shared systems become public?
 &HT;    I couldn't have expressed these convictions outright back then.
They were ingrained in us as we went. As was a certain pride _
encouraged by Mr. Moran without any fanfare _ in what we were
accomplishing. We were not covering well-worn paths in our
learning. We were striking out, sometimes wildly, into a
little-known territory.
 &HT;    While I don't program anymore (the last time I programmed was in
1993, when I wrote databases for a management consulting company),
the experiences I had at home with my Atari and in the computer
room with Mr. Moran and my classmates have given me a perspective
that, no matter how opaque and turbocharged computers become, lets
me use them without feeling bewildered and dominated.
 &HT;    When I entered the computer room, as a student, I felt the
future was hidden there, waiting to be discovered. Today there are
moments between people in that room that stick in my mind as
permanent testaments to the kind of learning we experienced.

 By DAVID S. BENNAHUM  
 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    For the few of us into computers at Horace Mann in 1982, the
computer room on the third floor of Tillinghast Hall was the
greatest place at school. With its lead-paned windows overlooking
the football field, its polished floor and rows of terminals in
tidy rows, the computer room existed as our private library and
club room.
 &HT;    During free periods, when other kids might go outside to play
touch football or gossip in the cafeteria, I could be found
upstairs at a terminal, playing games and programming with my
friends. There, amid the silence, interrupted by the clicking of
keys and the soft tapping of chalk on the blackboard, we competed
fiercely to be the best programmers. It was a place where things
happened quietly, but explosively.
 &HT;    Pranks were a natural part of the room. I'd written programs
that fooled seventh-graders into thinking our shared computer, a
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11, was conscious. Others had
found ways to fool skilled programmers into thinking the computer
could no longer add properly (2 + 2   5!).
 &HT;    Creativity ran rampant. The walls were covered with elegant
``ASCII art'' _ pictures of Snoopy and the New York skyline we'd
made from collections of letters that from a distance assembled
themselves into an image. A few had mastered the eight-pen color
plotter, learning to produce marvelous geometric shapes, swirling
vortices and rippling landscapes.
 &HT;    The computer room was also a safe haven, a family of sorts. We
were mostly boys _ though a few girls spent time there _ and many
of us came from families with divorced parents.
 &HT;    I faced turmoil at home, living between my mom and dad,
separated from my sister. Another boy, Misha, faced such acrimony
at home as his parents underwent a particularly bitter breakup that
he threw himself into programming with relentless intensity,
eventually creating an after-school business writing programs for
Wall Street corporations and earning enough money to pay for
college himself.
 &HT;    In the computer room, all the worries of the real world faded
away, replaced by the exhilaration of the quest, a gleeful sense of
discovery and the joy of being best at something.
 &HT;    I was exposed to a remarkable computer curriculum, and nearly
everything I know about computers and technology comes from those
years on the third floor of Tillinghast. My friends and I were
among the first at our Bronx, N.Y., school, and in America, to have
computers at home. At 13 I owned an Atari 800 with 48K of RAM;
another pal, Jeremy Bozza, had an Apple II; Misha had a TRS-80;
others had Commodore 64s and VIC-20s.
 &HT;    It was a unique time, the Golden Age for computer and kid. The
machine was available to us unconcealed, stripped to its component
parts, at the same time when most adults barely understood what we
were doing. The evolution of the machine briefly matched the
evolution of our adolescent selves, becoming a vessel and partner,
a co-conspirator in our coming of age.
 &HT;    One of the rare adults who did understand computers was our
teacher, Mr. Moran. He was a big man with a red beard, red hair and
heavy forearms like a lumberjack's. His eyes were luminous
gray-blue, and he always wore silver glasses, which softened his
appearance, giving him an intelligent presence, as if he noticed
everything. He existed in my mind as a descendant of Vikings, a
benevolent warrior, at the helm of our ship, guiding the room
through waters of knowledge.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran left Horace Mann in 1988. Today he doesn't teach kids;
he teaches adults through the Global Knowledge Network, an outfit
that provides continuing education to corporate employees. For Mr.
Moran (his first name is Ed, but I still find it impossible to call
him anything but Mr. Moran), who has taught for 23 years, computer
education has shifted from learning how to program to a form of
digital bricolage where prewritten subroutines are linked together
to form programs.
 &HT;    Computers are now infinitely more powerful than they were when I
mastered them. They're also far more opaque. For a kid now, getting
beneath Windows 98 or Mac OS 8.0 is nearly impossible. Our priority
has shifted to teaching people how to be Power Users: dexterous at
using software, rather than creating it.
 &HT;    But using computers ``out of the box'' is a lot easier than it
used to be. Clicking on an icon requires less study than going into
a Basic programming environment. These ``friendlier'' systems have
broadened access and turned what was mostly a hobbyist subculture
into a part of mass culture.
 &HT;    What is lost is the idea that kids can ever learn to understand
computers, or that any of us, as computer users, can have
fundamental control over what they do. We're supposed to know how
to use the tools, not make the tools.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran taught us to make things, using the elements of
computing as our tools. The notion that we would become merely
educated consumers would have seemed ludicrous and unworthy as a
goal. I grew up feeling I really understood computers.
 &HT;    Back in the early 1980s, when computer education was in its
infancy, student-crafted software was essential to the curriculum.
Schools nationwide hadn't begun to invest in computer courses, and
few companies provided software environments for teaching below the
university level.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran, through organic evolution, trial and error, created
an open system, both in the way the computer functioned and in the
social fabric of the computer room. The machine and the kids
existed in symbiosis, each a part of the other.
 &HT;    Without the student system administrators writing programs,
updating software, managing the younger students, answering their
questions, Mr. Moran would have been incapable of being teacher,
guide, administrator and sometimes policeman. More important,
centralized control by one teacher was antithetical to the ethic of
exploration and gleeful discovery fostered by access to computers.
Mr. Moran recognized this and promoted a communal ownership of the
computer system.
 &HT;    This whole philosophy reflected the belief that for kids to be
well-educated, responsible citizens in the digital age, knowing how
computers worked would not be enough. Their education would be
incomplete without a genuine understanding of the moral and ethical
questions brought up by information technology. Who owns software?
Where does someone's electronic property or territory begin and
end? At what point do shared systems become public?
 &HT;    I couldn't have expressed these convictions outright back then.
They were ingrained in us as we went. As was a certain pride _
encouraged by Mr. Moran without any fanfare _ in what we were
accomplishing. We were not covering well-worn paths in our
learning. We were striking out, sometimes wildly, into a
little-known territory.
 &HT;    While I don't program anymore (the last time I programmed was in
1993, when I wrote databases for a management consulting company),
the experiences I had at home with my Atari and in the computer
room with Mr. Moran and my classmates have given me a perspective
that, no matter how opaque and turbocharged computers become, lets
me use them without feeling bewildered and dominated.
 &HT;    When I entered the computer room, as a student, I felt the
future was hidden there, waiting to be discovered. Today there are
moments between people in that room that stick in my mind as
permanent testaments to the kind of learning we experienced.

<P>
   The shock of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in 1995 overshadowed, in some measure, Israel's celebration of its
50th anniversary three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was not merely the country's leader but one of the pillars
of its survival: a hero in the 1948 War of Independence, the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in the 1967 Six Day War
and the man who as defense minister masterminded the withdrawal
from most of Lebanon after the debacles of 1982-83 and is said to
have ordered his troops to break the bones of the youthful
stone-throwers of the intifada. He was also the Nobel Peace
Prize-winner who presided over the opening to the Palestinians. His
life spanned the full half-century of his country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, was no marginal man, no
fantasist like John Wilkes Booth, no lonely oddball like Lee Harvey
Oswald. He was, rather, the product of some of Israel's finest
institutions: the elite Golani infantry brigade, a prestigious
religious nationalist yeshiva, and arguably the best law school in
the country. He was religious but not a member of the
ultra-Orthodox extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin assassination inflicted a wound on the Israeli polity
that will take decades to heal. It revealed, as in one horrible
flash of lightning, the gap between religious and secular, between
zealots for the land and those willing to sacrifice it, between
those willing to take large risks for peace and those who view such
gambles as trifling with survival.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the murder of Rabin struck a blow at yet another myth
_ that no matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade Israeli
politics, in the end these are merely words, and the nation will
stand together.
</P>
<P>
   That myth, like most myths, rested on a very considerable
element of truth. When a series of suicide bombings this decade in
the hearts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv caused horrible carnage,
secular Israelis glued to their televisions saw squads of bearded
ultra-Orthodox men magically appear to collect, with reverent care,
every dismembered limb, every scrap of human flesh, every drop of
clotting blood for decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   These unpaid volunteers, responding within minutes to pagers
summoning them, were of the same ilk as those who throw rocks at
cars driving on the Sabbath. Indeed, in some cases they were the
same people. For a few moments, these grisly acts of mercy
suspended the ferocity of disagreements about state subventions to
seminaries, draft exemptions and Saturday road closures.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's success in thwarting the very real threat to its
existence in its first decades requires little retelling. In a
series of wars _ some short, some long, some marked by desperate
clashes of tens of thousands of soldiers, some by ambushes and
raids by mere squads _ Israel managed to convince its enemies that
it could not be defeated by conventional means, that prolonged
insurgency or guerrilla struggle would not bring it down and that
even unconventional threats would only elicit cunning and violent
preemption or the most terrible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal assumption of Israeli statecraft _ universal and
implacable hostility on the part of its immediate neighbors _ was
never entirely accurate (Jordan, in particular, often found itself
in clandestine alliance with the Jewish state). But by the 1990s,
it had become completely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   An Israel at formal peace with Jordan and Egypt, in negotiations
with Palestinians who a few years before would never have
considered sitting down with representatives of the Zionist entity,
and with a foreign service stretched to maintain legations in all
the countries eager for ties is not the embattled Israel of old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israel's existence in a state of perpetual siege had
its terrors, but to a large extent it had simplifying comforts as
well. It relieved Israel of the need for a complex statecraft
toward the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The siege helped ensure solidarity within a diverse population,
sympathy from without, and support from Diaspora Jewry. Above all,
it relieved Israel of the need to wrestle with the original and
most durable conflict of all: the contest with the Arabs of
Palestine for a small plot of land to which both peoples had a
powerful claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel may not be at peace,'' remarks Reuven Gal, a sturdy
former paratrooper and onetime chief psychologist of the IDF, ``but
Israelis have decided that they are at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   When they voted in 1996 for the Likud's Netanyahu, they did not,
as some outsiders feared, vote to end the peace process but merely
to slow it down and get a better deal than they expected from
Shimon Peres' dreams of a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself has, without fanfare, given up his party's
ideology, which once stood foursquare against relinquishing
territory to the Palestinians. The prior quarrels within Israel and
between Netanyahu and the Clinton administration have really been
over percentages, pace and details.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud government will probably witness the birth of a
Palestinian state _ and will accept it because most Israelis will
wish it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to forge a new and more subtle statecraft. If
it fights more wars (and it well may, for it still has real
enemies), it must fight them in a political world that has known
formal peace and to which peace may return.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can Israel's internal problems be subordinated to what
Israelis still call ``ha'matzav'' _ ``The Situation'' _ the daily
and enduring security threat. It endures in the form of Hezbollah
ambushes, Hamas bus bombs, Palestinian Authority guerrilla warfare,
or Iranian or Iraqi missiles armed with weapons of mass
destruction. But serious as each of these are, they no longer loom
over Israel in quite the same way security threats did for the last
70 years of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By now, that Israel is the most pro-American country in the
Middle East goes without saying; it has, after all, benefited from
American friendship and largesse and fought its battles using
American weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americanization of Israel goes far deeper. English is so
much Israel's second language that one can live quite comfortably
without knowing a word of Hebrew. American fashions fill the stores
and American academic fads sweep university departments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful arguments for direct election of the
prime minister (an innovation introduced in 1996) was that it would
give rise to American-style political decorum and stability (which,
of course, it did not). But when Netanyahu gave a gracious victory
speech after ousting Peres in 1996, commentators noted proudly that
he had spoken just the way a successful American pol would have.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Israel's fascination with America mirrors the
general extension of American culture throughout the world. But it
also reflects the natural intertwining of two very different
societies _ one tiny, one vast _ in which Jews can without mental
tricks or self-deception feel comfortably at home.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree unthinkable for Israel's founding generation, their
country has already become dependent on the United States for
matters as diverse and vital as defense and finance. And it
 &UR; has done so, by and large, cheerfully and wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever material successes they have had, Israelis can
never achieve what so many of them crave _ the benign normalcy that
now characterizes Western societies and the United States above
all. Small wonder that hundreds of thousands have emigrated over
the years, most to the United States, which remains a mythic land
of opportunity and forgetfulness to those who find the cramped
confines of Israel and the tormented destiny of the Jews an
intolerable burden.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Israel _ and the catastrophe of the Holocaust, in
a quite different way _ has understandably overshadowed the miracle
of Jewish survival and creativity over the centuries of the Jews'
dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have dismissed or even despised that experience.
Ironically, however, they find themselves increasingly forced to
wrestle with the questions that agitated the Jews in their
wanderings: Who are we, and what is our mission?
</P>
<P>
   More than for any other state, a spiritual question lies at the
heart of Israel's self-definition and, indeed, its very existence.
Few prosperous peoples, in this age of superficial entertainments
and instant gratification, confront such ultimate questions. As one
that does, the Israelis have every reason to be proud.

   Scene from a funeral in Laramie, Wyoming:
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church where hundreds of mourners have gathered to
remember gay murder victim Matthew Shepard, protesters hold signs
that say, ``Matthew is Going to Hell,'' ``No Tears for Queers'' and
``No Fags in Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters is a man of the cloth who has made it his
mission to show up at the funerals of deceased gays and condemn
their immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Scene from just outside a bar in Buffalo, New York:
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trzaska, 41, a gay man, is attacked by three men who beat
him so hard nearly every inch of his body is bruised and almost
every internal organ is damaged. Trzaska dies from the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Washington, D.C.:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas) calls Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) a
``homo.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) says homosexuality is a
``disease,'' not unlike kleptomania.
</P>
<P>
   Scene from Halsted Street in Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   A 37-year-old man suffers critical head injuries when he and two
friends are jumped by men shouting, ``Faggots!'' The brutal beating
is the worst such case based on sexual orientation in Chicago in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Scene from a TV commercial airing in Honolulu:
</P>
<P>
   A tuxedo-clad groom on the beach runs toward a beautiful young
bride _ but then brushes past her and embraces _ shock! _ another
man.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is designed to drum up support for the proposed state
constitutional amendment banning gay marriages in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from dozens of cities across the USA and Canada this past
weekend:
</P>
<P>
   Candlelight vigils mark the passing of Matthew Shepard, that
young man who was killed in Wyoming _ the crime allegedly committed
by two men who pretended to be gay to lure Shepard into their
truck.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, in New Jersey, in Maine, in Texas, people who
never met Shepard mourn him and pray for a day when gays will not
be attacked for being ``different.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and we're still debating whether an attack on a gay _
based at least in part on the victim's sexuality _ constitutes a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and ``religious'' people are still showing up at
funerals to spit on the graves of deceased gays.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and politicians are still moralizing about the gay
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and we're still not comfortable with two people of
the same gender living together as a legally married couple.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998: Do we know where our compassion is?
</P>
<P>
   I've never understood the fear and hatred some straights feel
for gays. (Right about now is when I start hearing from anonymous
cowards who leave me phone messages like, ``I always knew you were
a fag, Roeper!'' For the record, again, I'm a raving heterosexual.
Who cares.) They get more worked up talking about the immorality,
the depravity, the sick and twisted nature, of gays, then they ever
do about murderers, rapists or child molesters. Somehow they're
threatened by the mere existence of homosexuals and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Let me try this out on the gay-bashers. Imagine living in a
world where 90 percent of the population is homosexual _ but you're
as straight as you are now. You like the opposite sex, you've
always liked the opposite sex, and the idea of feeling romantic
toward someone of your own gender just grosses you out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are those in the gay majority who feel they have the
right to dictate your life. They say what you're doing is wrong.
They say you can't marry outside your gender. And a tiny but
terrorizing percentage of them would like to kick the crap out of
you just for being straight.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be a lousy way to go through life, wouldn't it? Hearing
political leaders saying you're diseased; reading news stories
about straights who are killed for no reason other than sexual
orientation; wondering if someday you'll be victimized by some
thugs who will shout, ``DAMN HETERO!'' while beating you to a
bloody pulp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you wouldn't change your ways because of all this hatred
and ignorance and prejudice, would you? You're straight! It's who
you are, for God's sake; it's not a lifestyle choice. All you
really want is equal treatment, and to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now we return to the real world, dominated by straights. A world
where the gays want only to be treated as equals, and to be left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Explain to me again why you feel you have the right to deny
those wishes.

WHITTIER IS OUT, BUT MILES DAVIS IS IN  
 (WITH CANON) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The cultural canon should prepare us to better and
more deeply understand the times we live in. It should provide
context and background for our understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece of literature we read, each dramatization we see has
in it the reflection of the thoughts that have gone before it, like
a great hall of mirrors down which we walk and see ourselves a
thousand times on each side. We have to remember that when we read,
we are also reading everything that author ever read. When we
recognize that, the literature becomes more meaningful, speaks more
complexly _ and hence more truthfully _ to us.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the canon is the list of those things we ``should have
read.'' No one can read all of it, but a familiarity with it
enlightens our lives and makes us more satisfied inhabitants of the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not a list of deified heroes: These are not gods. The
list needs constant pruning. I'm willing to chuck ``Mill on the
Floss.''
</P>
<P>
   The dropping of dead wood is necessary to make way for new
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the PC crowd, I'm not willing to drop Homer. But I'm more
than willing to add Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather,
Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready to give up Whitman, but I'm there pushing John
Greenleaf Whittier out the door to make room for Sylvia Plath and
Derek Walcott.
</P>
<P>
   Let's add Matsuo Basho to the canon; let's add Richard Wright,
Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks I'm talking about lowering the standards for
entry has not read these authors.
</P>
<P>
   You still need to know Beethoven's symphonies and Mozart's
``Marriage of Figaro,'' but you had better also know Louis
Armstrong playing ``Struttin' With Some Barbecue,'' Charlie
Parker's ``Cherokee'' and Miles Davis' ``Kind of Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to make a short version of my own canon, I came up with
this minuscule list. This is not a list of the ``best,'' but of the
most influential, the things without which you cannot understand
what followed.
</P>
<P>
   It is very short. Too much worthy is not here for lack of space.
But these are things I could not do without. Everything on this
list gives me great pleasure. It's a place to start. &QL;

   And it is not a list of deified heroes: These are not gods. The
list needs constant pruning. I'm willing to chuck ``Mill on the
Floss.''
</P>
<P>
   The dropping of dead wood is necessary to make way for new
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the PC crowd, I'm not willing to drop Homer. But I'm more
than willing to add Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather,
Gertrude Stein.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not ready to give up Whitman, but I'm there pushing John
Greenleaf Whittier out the door to make room for Sylvia Plath and
Derek Walcott.
</P>
<P>
   Let's add Matsuo Basho to the canon; let's add Richard Wright,
Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks I'm talking about lowering the standards for
entry has not read these authors.
</P>
<P>
   You still need to know Beethoven's symphonies and Mozart's
``Marriage of Figaro,'' but you had better also know Louis
Armstrong playing ``Struttin' With Some Barbecue,'' Charlie
Parker's ``Cherokee'' and Miles Davis' ``Kind of Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to make a short version of my own canon, I came up with
this minuscule list. This is not a list of the ``best,'' but of the
most influential, the things without which you cannot understand
what followed.
</P>
<P>
   It is very short. Too much worthy is not here for lack of space.
But these are things I could not do without. Everything on this
list gives me great pleasure. It's a place to start. &QL;

RESEARCHERS SAY BEERS ADS TEMPT CHILDREN TO DRINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lively advertisements inspire young Americans to
drink beer, but experts attending a medical conference here say
there are ways to inoculate children against the influences of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Grube, of the Prevention Research Center in Berkeley, told
the American Academy of Pediatricians Tuesday that his research
established a direct relationship between awareness of beer
commercials on television and the propensity to drink among 470 San
Francisco-area students in grades seven through 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who said they liked the ads that they saw and paid more
attention to the alcohol ads were more likely to drink,'' Grube
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two attributes that seemed to be getting kids' attention
were humor and ads that had youth-oriented music _ rock,
country-western or, in one case, hip hop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter DeBenedittis, of the New Mexico Media Literacy Project in
Albuquerque, told the pediatricians that alcohol advertising
``targets children and encourages them to be alcoholics.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``the whole point of alcohol ads is to make them believe
that it's perfectly normal to be a binge drinker. This is why you
see small dogs and frog puppets and comedians.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBenedittis, who said he has lectured more than 10,000
schoolchildren on how to ``deconstruct'' advertising and see how
they use symbols to lure children, contended that such teaching can
reduce the tendency to drink.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a Washington State University study that he said showed
``media training for third-graders significantly reduced their
intention to drink'' and made them less likely to collect
promotional products, like clothing, that advertise alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The beer industry has consistently denied that it aims
advertising at under-age drinkers, a topic currently under
investigation by Congress. The Federal Trade Commission, at the
request of Congress, is studying whether alcohol advertising and
consumption of booze by minors are related.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the FTC ordered eight major alcoholic beverage
companies to turn over information on their advertising practices.
The FTC plans to review the alcohol industry's self-regulatory
codes on advertising to under-age consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Beer Institute, a Washington-based lobbying organization for
beer manufacturers, features a lengthy segment on its World Wide
Web site titled ``Beer Industry Initiatives to Address Under-age
Drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web page cites industry-sponsored programs for home, school,
college campuses and retailers purportedly designed to prevent
minors from abusing alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our critics tend to assume an awful lot about the power of
advertising when, in fact, the reality is quite different,'' Beer
Institute spokesman Jeff Becker said. ``Over the last 10 years,
we've seen a decline in beer sales of 6 percent. Advertising
clearly isn't effective in getting people to drink more beer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grube said tricks such as using cute mascots _ the talking
frogs used by the maker of Budweiser beer, for example _ are
effective in establishing brand identification with young
television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to one study by a Berkeley researcher that found
grade-school children ``were more familiar with the Budweiser frogs
than they were with Tony the Tiger,'' the symbol of a cereal
marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in 1993, Grube discovered a similar
awareness of Spuds Mackenzie _ a canine mascot for Budweiser _
among fifth- and sixth-grade students. That research indicated a
correlation between awareness of beer ads and ``positive beliefs
about beer drinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBenedittis noted that characters in beer ads ``are all young
adults _ you don't see crusty old people drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``the main message (is fulfillment of) the adolescent
male fantasy: All these beautiful babes that will come to me if I
just get sloppy drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Grube nor DeBenedittis called for a ban on televised
beer commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to be looking at what to be doing about the
ads so they don't appeal to kids,'' Grube said. ``Get them in time
slots where the kids are not exposed to them, and let the alcohol
advertisers take a little more responsibility.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the Justice Department's lawsuit against Microsoft
Corp. comes to a close, the government will have spent millions of
dollars on its effort to punish the software company for its
``predatory'' behavior. To defend itself, Microsoft will have spent
millions of dollars as well. But consider how great a difference
there is between the government's money and Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Every dollar that Microsoft pays its lawyers is a dollar it
earned by providing something a customer desired. The company's
revenues, around $11 billion annually, come from selling and
leasing products that people choose to pay for. Every one of its
moneymaking transactions is voluntary: Microsoft has never used
force to confiscate money from the public.
</P>
<P>
   The government, by contrast, acquires nearly all of its revenues
_ more than $1.5 trillion a year _ by force. Fail to pay your
taxes, and armed government agents are liable to confiscate your
property or lock you behind bars. Or both.
</P>
<P>
   There are many differences between government and business, but
none more basic than this: Governments depend on coercion,
businesses depend on freedom. Yet, perversely, it is the government
that accuses Microsoft of coercive practices.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Justice Department's case against Microsoft is
that the company has made Internet Explorer, its Web browsing
software, an integral part of Windows, its overwhelmingly popular
operating system. Microsoft doesn't charge for Internet Explorer _
the price of Windows didn't go up when the Web browser was added _
and it doesn't supply it separately. Computer makers wanting to
load Windows into their desktop PCs have to take Internet Explorer
as part of the package. This is the ``coercion'' which the
government is spending millions of dollars to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forcing PC manufacturers to take one Microsoft product as a
condition of buying a monopoly product like Windows,'' says
Attorney General Janet Reno, ``is ... plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then it is plain wrong for the publisher of this
newspaper to force you to take the sports section as a condition of
getting the news and the op-ed page. It is plain wrong for Chrysler
to force car dealers to take vehicles with Chrysler engines and
radios already installed as a condition of selling Jeeps and
Eagles. It is plain wrong for Visa to force its cardholders to take
rental-car insurance as a condition of receiving a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's lawsuit boils down to the illogical
presumption that consumers would be better off if they had to pay
separately for a Web browser. But why stop (or start) with
browsers? If Reno is right, we would all be better off if Windows
didn't include word-processing software either. Or calculators and
calendars. Or modem drivers and disk compression utilities.
Microsoft released its first operating system in 1981, and has
continually enhanced its product with new features. What is it
about this feature _ Internet Explorer _ that the government finds
so objectionable?
</P>
<P>
   True, Microsoft has a near-monopoly in desktop computer
operating systems; 90 percent of all PCs run Windows. But that
doesn't make Microsoft a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, its share of the overall computer industry is
tiny. In 1996, Microsoft controlled less than 2 percent of global
computer market revenues. Even in the software-only universe, its
market share was only 4 percent. Among the Fortune 500, Microsoft
is ranked just 137th. It is outdistanced by IBM (which ranked 6th),
Hewlett-Packard (14th), Intel (38th), Compaq (42nd), Digital
Equipment (118th), and Dell (125th). ``It is difficult,'' the
Heritage Foundation's Adam Thierer writes, ``to understand the
claim that Microsoft's market power in the computer industry is
destroying competitive opportunities for these larger, more
profitable companies, or for any other company in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is even harder to understand the claim, implicit in the
Justice Department suit, that Microsoft is depriving consumers of
the benefits of competition. Computer prices are low and keep
falling. Product quality keeps rising. There is no shortage of
entrepreneurs or innovation. Microsoft plays hardball with
competitors, but it gives its customers exactly what they want: a
common operating system that comprises numerous products and
supports a myriad of applications. If it has a monopoly, it is a
monopoly honestly earned.
</P>
<P>
   The government has an ignoble history of firing its antitrust
guns at companies whose only real offense is being successful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, in one of the worst blunders of his brilliant career,
Judge Learned Hand agreed with the government that the Aluminum
Company of America had an unlawful monopoly and should be broken
up. Alcoa was wrong, he wrote, to ``always anticipate increases in
the demand for (aluminum) ingot and be prepared to supply them.
Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling its capacity
before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded
competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than
progessively to embrace each new opportunity as it opened, and to
face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa had to be punished, in short, for its efficiency and
adroitness, for steadily improving its operation, and for
safeguarding its market share. Fifty-three years later, it seems,
the Justice Department still regards those things as crimes.

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over archrival Mattel. In three days
he planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in
his 25 years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week, Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the big toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, astonishingly
late by industry norms.
 &HT;    Hasbro execs understood how to manufacture and market action
figures like G.I. Joe, but when it came to technology, they were
clueless. Early in the 1990s, Hasbro funneled a reported $45
million into a virtual-reality project before abandoning it. In the
1980s, the videogame business bankrupted Coleco, the maker of
Cabbage Patch Kids and ColecoVision, and nearly brought Mattel to
its knees.
 &HT;    But the recent success of toys containing microprocessors, from
Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has buttressed the belief
that technology will be the industry's savior. While earlier
generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive to a
child, the newer ones insinuate themselves into their owner's life
in sometimes alarming ways.
 &HT;    Some schools banned virtual pets because children were more
focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying attention to the
teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids began to mourn
digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like Furby, which
exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate themselves
even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a secret language,
playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    The technology is increasingly invisible. No instruction manual
is necessary and children can have what they most desire: the
perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    The industry is betting that this technological-psychological
alchemy will yield some hits. Without them, the industry slumps.
When Toys ``R'' Us announced earlier this year that its
first-quarter earnings had dropped 35 percent, it blamed the plunge
in part on the absence of a hit toy to bring in shoppers.
 &HT;    What makes this dependence on hits and fourth-quarter sales even
scarier is that hits can come from any corner of the industry.
 &HT;    Witness the Beanie Babies craze, which was perpetrated by Ty
Inc., a little-known, privately held Illinois company. The giants
of the industry _ Mattel and Hasbro _ have been scooping up the
adventurous, independent toy companies in the hope that
consolidation will increase their odds of bringing a few hits to
market every year.
 &HT;    Such was Hasbro's thinking when it acquired Tiger Electronics.
Based in a nondescript one-story office park north of Chicago,
Tiger, according to its new parent's first-quarter report, would
help provide Hasbro with ``a platform for future earnings growth.''
 &HT;    Founded in 1978 by Rissman and Roger Shiffman, the company
originally made low-tech items such as Mickey Mouse phonographs,
but it eventually began to branch out into handheld electronic
games and learning aids. The company's first breakout hit, tied to
the release of ``Home Alone,'' was the Talkboy, a voice digitizer
used onscreen by Macaulay Culkin.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him.
 &HT;    The company seemed concerned that if the inventor, whom I'll
call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may increase the fees he
demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    An earlier version of Furby was manually controlled with dials
and came to life like a puppet. This Furby uttered not a chirp from
its yellow beak. But, according to Eric, the finished Furby would
be able to play games, communicate with other Furbies via infrared
signals, learn English by means of positive reinforcement and teach
a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue). No two Furbies would
share the same personality or react to stimuli in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    Shiffman wanted to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in '99
or 2000, the way other companies traditionally would. Its category
_ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz lingo _ had already shown
its potential, having grown 223 percent in 1997 over the year
before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category looked like the hot one.
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy companies
to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can heavily
discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in
Toronto. It wasn't about technology. It was about love and
affection, spoken in the familiar language of Saturday-morning
acquisitiveness.
 &HT;    Two girls open up a cupboard, revealing a fuzzy little moving
ear, a surprised-looking set of eyes. Furby utters some Furbish.
 &HT;    First girl: ``What's that?''
 &HT;    Second girl: ``It's my Furby.''
 &HT;    In a later scene, a girl takes a Furby out of her backpack and
plays peek-a-boo with it. The ad ends with a child in bed with
Furby.
 &HT;    Toy to girl: ``Me love you.''
 &HT;    The tag line, spoken from Furby's point of view, is: ``Furby
keeps amazing you.''
 &HT;    Six weeks of production work culminated the night before the toy
fair opened, when a digital audiotape containing Furby's voice _
the last missing element _ was couriered to an editing studio in
New York.
 &HT;    With 1,704 exhibitors and 20,000 buyers, the annual show filled
New York's cavernous Javits Center and several blocks of showrooms
around the Toy Building. The only thing missing among the
white-faced mimes, Teletubbies and out-of-work actors dressed as
the Power Rangers, were children.
 &HT;    At the fair, the big retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Toys ``R''
Us, begin to formulate opinions about which toys will be hits, and
which ones will merely suck up shelf space.
 &HT;    Microsoft was introducing two new characters to its ActiMates
line _ Arthur the Aardvark and his sister D.W. were to join Barney.
Mattel was hopping on the ``special-features plush'' bandwagon with
the $100 Winnie the Pooh and another interactive, Big Bird.
 &HT;    Furby was a winner. The buyer from Wal-Mart committed, on the
spot, to buying a third of Tiger's entire production run. Everyone
wanted a piece of Furby's anticipated success. By now, so sure is
Tiger of Furby that at one point, it planned to require retailers
to order other, less-hot toys from its 227-page catalog.
 &HT;    Since the toy fair, Furby's ears have gotten smaller, to
diminish the similarities between it and the obnoxious Gremlins of
cinematic fame.
 &HT;    Eric, the inventor, is ironing out the Furby Communication
Protocol _ the method by which two Furbies will talk to each other
through bursts of infrared light.
 &HT;    Jones and Sims are also trying to fabricate Furby's history _
what they call, with a nod to Hollywood, the back story. Furby
needs a context to explain where the creature came from, likely to
be explained in TV ads and other promotional materials.
 &HT;    Tiger aims to mark the official launch date with massive Furby
displays at key retailers like F.A.O. Schwarz's flagship store in
New York. Closer to Thanksgiving, a contest on the Cartoon Network
will give children who learn Furbish the chance to win a toy.
 &HT;    Tiger has done everything it can to make sure that Furby is THE
hot toy this Christmas, that it will have parents lining up outside
the nearest Wal-Mart, awaiting shipments, begging for rain checks.
Based on orders, Tiger suspects that 1.5 million Furbies _ the
number they hope to produce by the end of 1998 _ won't be enough to
satisfy the demand.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    Furby, the 5-inch hairball with gremlin-like ears and saucer
eyes, was lying motionless on its display table.
 &HT;    And Alan Hassenfeld, the CEO of Hasbro, the world's
second-largest toy company, was in the showroom, accompanied by
Tiger Electronics' proud co-founders.
 &HT;    For Tiger, Furby was intended to be a sort of Giga Pets 2.0 _ a
follow-up to their top-grossing toy of last December. Hassenfeld
believed Tiger, a specialist in electronic gadgetry, was the
company to give Hasbro an edge over archrival Mattel. In three days
he planned to announce Hasbro's $335 million purchase of Tiger.
 &HT;    Hassenfeld stopped in front of Furby. ``This is your bonus for
buying Tiger,'' proclaimed Tiger chair and co-founder Randy
Rissman. Jeff Jones, Tiger's vice president of marketing, flipped
the switch.
 &HT;    Furby performed on cue, opening its eyes and chattering with
delight. Though this prototype contained just 5 percent of the
functionality that the final toy would have, Hassenfeld told
Tiger's cofounders that Furby was the coolest thing he'd seen in
his 25 years in the business.
 &HT;    It was Fri., Feb. 6, 1998, and the next week, Furby would debut
at the 95th American International Toy Fair. If all went according
to plan, it would be the big toy for Christmas. Yet Tiger had
rushed it into development only three months earlier, astonishingly
late by industry norms.
 &HT;    Hasbro execs understood how to manufacture and market action
figures like G.I. Joe, but when it came to technology, they were
clueless. Early in the 1990s, Hasbro funneled a reported $45
million into a virtual-reality project before abandoning it. In the
1980s, the videogame business bankrupted Coleco, the maker of
Cabbage Patch Kids and ColecoVision, and nearly brought Mattel to
its knees.
 &HT;    But the recent success of toys containing microprocessors, from
Tickle Me Elmo to Tamagotchi to Barney, has buttressed the belief
that technology will be the industry's savior. While earlier
generations of high-tech toys were clunky and unresponsive to a
child, the newer ones insinuate themselves into their owner's life
in sometimes alarming ways.
 &HT;    Some schools banned virtual pets because children were more
focused on ``feeding'' them than on paying attention to the
teacher. Many parents fretted when their kids began to mourn
digital creatures that had ``croaked.'' Toys like Furby, which
exhibit rudimentary artificial intelligence, integrate themselves
even more tightly with a child's life _ speaking a secret language,
playing games, seeking praise.
 &HT;    The technology is increasingly invisible. No instruction manual
is necessary and children can have what they most desire: the
perfect friend, loyal and unconditionally loving.
 &HT;    The industry is betting that this technological-psychological
alchemy will yield some hits. Without them, the industry slumps.
When Toys ``R'' Us announced earlier this year that its
first-quarter earnings had dropped 35 percent, it blamed the plunge
in part on the absence of a hit toy to bring in shoppers.
 &HT;    What makes this dependence on hits and fourth-quarter sales even
scarier is that hits can come from any corner of the industry.
 &HT;    Witness the Beanie Babies craze, which was perpetrated by Ty
Inc., a little-known, privately held Illinois company. The giants
of the industry _ Mattel and Hasbro _ have been scooping up the
adventurous, independent toy companies in the hope that
consolidation will increase their odds of bringing a few hits to
market every year.
 &HT;    Such was Hasbro's thinking when it acquired Tiger Electronics.
Based in a nondescript one-story office park north of Chicago,
Tiger, according to its new parent's first-quarter report, would
help provide Hasbro with ``a platform for future earnings growth.''
 &HT;    Founded in 1978 by Rissman and Roger Shiffman, the company
originally made low-tech items such as Mickey Mouse phonographs,
but it eventually began to branch out into handheld electronic
games and learning aids. The company's first breakout hit, tied to
the release of ``Home Alone,'' was the Talkboy, a voice digitizer
used onscreen by Macaulay Culkin.
 &HT;    Last year Tiger saw the virtual-pets craze coming and offered up
its line of Giga Pets to compete with Tamagotchi, marketed by
Japan's Bandai.
 &HT;    Tiger, like most toy companies, develops some toy ideas in-house
and buys others from outside inventors. Furby was developed by one
such free-lancer, a man to whom Tiger introduced me only after I
agreed not to name him.
 &HT;    The company seemed concerned that if the inventor, whom I'll
call Eric, gets too much publicity, he may increase the fees he
demands from Tiger on future projects.
 &HT;    An earlier version of Furby was manually controlled with dials
and came to life like a puppet. This Furby uttered not a chirp from
its yellow beak. But, according to Eric, the finished Furby would
be able to play games, communicate with other Furbies via infrared
signals, learn English by means of positive reinforcement and teach
a child Furbish (a Furby's native tongue). No two Furbies would
share the same personality or react to stimuli in the same way.
 &HT;    Furbies would be Cabbage Patch dolls with artificial
intelligence, Tickle-Me Elmos that could influence each other. One
Furby, for example, would be able to make another Furby sneeze, or
spark a giggle fit among its friends.
 &HT;    Shiffman wanted to bring Furby out by Christmas 1998, not in '99
or 2000, the way other companies traditionally would. Its category
_ ``special-feature plush'' in toy-biz lingo _ had already shown
its potential, having grown 223 percent in 1997 over the year
before.
 &HT;    With other special-feature plushes, such as Microsoft's Barney
and Mattel's interactive Winnie the Pooh, already coming to market
in a big way, the category looked like the hot one.
 &HT;    Actually, on the shelves of the local Toys ``R'' Us, about 40
percent of new toys will flop. It's not unusual for toy companies
to contribute ``markdown money'' so that retailers can heavily
discount toys that don't capture children's fancy.
 &HT;    For the toy fair, Tiger's ad agency, Posnick &AMP; Kolker of New
York (whose founders helped Coleco launch Cabbage Patch Kids in the
1980s), wrote a 30-second spot _ and filmed it over two days in

TYSON SHOULD BOX AGAIN, FOR HIS SAKE AND FOR THE SPORT'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before I tell you why boxer Mike Tyson deserves to be back in
the ring, I have a confession to make.
</P>
<P>
   Because I've long been a pacifist, and have a general reputation
of being against violence, people tend to be very surprised when
they learn two things about me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a fan of boxing, and I love bullfights.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say it, because I've heard it all. And animal lovers,
please don't send any literature because I've seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   Although I don't want to go into detail about either pastime, I
can tell you that I've followed prize fighting (as it used to be
called) ever since a young guy named Cassius Clay won an Olympic
gold medal in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   I would become an even bigger fan of the man and the sport nine
years later after meeting the then-banned Muhammad Ali during his
visit to North Texas State University. The next day, the Supreme
Court ruled in Ali's favor, saying he had the right to refuse
military service because he was a minister in the much-maligned
Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   It felt so good to be that close to history and to a real-life
hero.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I became a fan of bull fighting shortly after local
Channel 39 first signed on the air and its major sports programming
_ maybe its ``only'' sports programming _ was the Sunday night
replay of the bullfights from Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've made numerous trips to Mexico's capital city,
primarily for the culture and the history, although I've always
gone during bullfighting season. (Even trips to El Paso usually
coincide with a weekend when the fights are scheduled in Juarez's
bullring.)
</P>
<P>
   But, so much for true confessions. Well, maybe just one more.
</P>
<P>
   I like Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know it is fashionable to be on the anti-Tyson bandwagon,
to call the fighter some of the worse names you can think of and to
make jokes about ``getting an earful'' of something. But he's been
punished enough for that hair-raising, ear-biting bout with Evander
Holyfield last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know he's been convicted of rape, has been known to say
crude things, has been accused recently of physical assault and,
since the ``ear-rie'' Holyfield bout, has been deemed ``crazy'' by
many people in this country.
</P>
<P>
   While not dismissing Tyson's past, I also know of his troubled
childhood, his love for his adoptive parents, the positive changes
he made in his life (even in prison) and what he did for the
heavyweight division of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what most people say, including the Nevada State
Athletic Commission, they don't care about Tyson's troubles or
reputed character flaws or Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   They care about the money. And when Tyson is fighting, a bunch
of folks make a bunch of money.
</P>
<P>
   Surely no one expected the commissioners to do anything other
than restore the fighter's license this week. They had to _ for the
sake of boxing and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember in Tyson's early career when I was standing in
line to get into Dallas' Memorial Auditorium to watch a
closed-circuit bout featuring Tyson. Before I could get to my seat,
Tyson had knocked his opponent out.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one expects that kind of fight out of the boxer
today, they do expect him to put on a great show and bring some
pizzazz back to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   There are some people who want to see the fighter banned for
life, constantly humiliated and, in fact, destroyed, as if his
destruction would somehow bring honor to a sport that has little
honor left.
</P>
<P>
   I want to see Tyson back in the ring partly for his own
self-esteem. He will always have something to prove to someone, of
course, but the most important person he needs to please is
himself.
</P>

ORSON WELLES' VISION SHARPER IN RE-EDITED `TOUCH OF EVIL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON RENFROE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - He's a man who had it all. Admiration. Respect. Looks.
Professional success. And downfall.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened? What quirk of personality led him down from
such heights?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. This story is not about President Clinton. It's
about the director of what's long been considered the finest movie
ever made, years before the American Film Institute declared it so
on its Top 100 list.
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles was 25 when he directed ``Citizen Kane.'' He had
already conquered the stage with the Mercury Theatre repertory
company, formed with actor John Houseman and some of the best
actors from across New York.
</P>
<P>
   He had also become the most popular voice on the era's most
popular medium _ radio. He had become known to millions across the
country, starring in and directing plays, guest-starring on variety
shows and pitching soap.
</P>
<P>
   Every radio network wanted him because the shows he produced had
drama, impact and class, drawing on great works of literature such
as ``Arrowsmith'' and ``Beau Geste.'' A typical day in New York
would find him rushing from the Mutual network offices to CBS and
back again.
</P>
<P>
   His realistic ``War of the Worlds'' (1938) caused sensation and
panic among listeners who thought Martians were landing in their
back yards. In 1939, he directed a staggering 39 radio plays. There
was something about his steady, distinctive voice that kept
Americans listening.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was listening, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ever on the lookout for fresh talent for its films, RKO Radio
Pictures could see the potential box office of this very popular
star. Although not exactly the biggest fish in the Tinseltown pond,
RKO was well respected and had made milestone films such as ``King
Kong'' (1933) and ``The Informer'' (1935). It managed to tempt
Welles ahead of the bigger, more successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   He first thought about accepting the role of Quasimodo in ``The
</P>
<P>
   Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' but decided to wait until he was
offered a chance to direct a film. He considered many projects,
including Joseph Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness,'' but he eventually
had the chance to use what he called ``the biggest goddamn box of
toys any boy ever had'' in directing a story about a newspaper
tycoon, ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was going great guns. Welles couldn't have known that
in just a few years Hollywood would become disillusioned with him
as a director. After ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' (1942), it would
be 16 years before his movie career hit another directing peak with
``Touch ofEvil'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   Both ''Citizen Kane'' and the re-edited ``Touch of Evil,''
coming soon to theaters, show Welles as the master of the craft of
filmmaking. He reinvented the language of film through photographic
and sound techniques such as deep focus overlapping dialogue in
``Citizen Kane'' (1941) and brought them back again for ``Touch of
Evil.'' Even his worst critics admit he was a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Those films provide the two highest points in Welles' Hollywood
career. Although he had many memorable acting roles _ Harry Lime in
``The Third Man'' (1949) and Will Varner in ``The Long, Hot
Summer'' (1958) come to mind _ when it comes to directing, he never
did better than these two classics.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers many Welles biographers and lovers of cinema is
that the boy genius had so much potential, yet so seldom attained
the heights he was capable of. As Welles himself put it in an
interview late in life, ``I began at the top and have been making
my way down ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmophiles make note of what amounts to Welles' fear of
success. Others point out that he wouldn't finish what he started,
stretching himself too thin in far-flung places around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after shooting ended on ``The Magnificent
Ambersons,'' a drama about a well-to-do family unable to adjust to
changing times at the turn of the century, Welles tried to conduct
the editing long-distance while simultaneously shooting a
pan-American State Department-funded goodwill film in Brazil,
``It's All True.'' Talking through an edit, rather than using the
hands-on approach, would prove impossible even for Welles. Imagine
trying to teach someone to drive over the phone, without the
benefit of actually (begin ital) showing (end ital) him: Disaster
was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Frank Brady writes in his ``Citizen Welles'' that the
director felt ``the film art itself did not end when the actors
performed a scene and it was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was merely the preparation, the rough notes or unarranged
words of filmmaking,'' Brady wrote. ``The film was made when the
director, through his editor, combined the shots and elements
together in various combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed how Welles felt, why did he leave Hollywood to
party in Rio when such important work was left to be done?
``Ambersons,'' only his second film, was edited through phone
calls, cables and letters to Robert Wise, who would later direct
``West Side Story'' and ``Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the quality of communication networks in those days
confounded Wise's ability to do a good job editing, according to
Brady's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was going on half the time,'' Wise
recalled. ``We often tried for clarification (with Welles) by
telephone, and the problems were enormous, just getting through.
Then, when we reached him, we usually could not hear him because of
the connection. It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Welles stayed in Brazil, and when ``Magnificent
Ambersons'' was test-screened, the results were predictable.
Audiences laughed in the wrong places, had trouble following the
characters' relationships to each other and thought the movie was
self-consciously ``arty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ambersons'' nevertheless ranks high with today's
critics, it could have been as good and as well received as
``Citizen Kane'' if only Welles had taken the time to stay at the
task, in person, through the editing process. (begin ital) What
could have been (end ital) is a phrase that keeps popping up when
studying Welles' life.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably Welles' antics and setbacks during the shooting
of ``It's All True'' that finally turned the Hollywood
establishment against him. He behaved badly, drinking too much and
throwing tantrums, and he had a hard time making the
pseudodocumentary on the lives of Rio peasants.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, although he shot lots of film (375,000 feet of
Technicolor), not much of it made much sense. RKO had had enough.
The studio's hoped-for golden boy was dragging it down, financially
and creatively. He was undisciplined and out of control, and the
studio wanted no more to do with him, at least not as a director.
As a result, ``It's All True'' wasn't seen by the public until it
was released as a sort of curio in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ``It's All True'' and the lukewarm reception of
``The Magnificent Ambersons'' forced Welles to become a free agent,
acting in films mainly to fund his own pictures through the rest of
his career. Great director, sure, the studios seemed to say, but
dependable director, no.
</P>
<P>
   He made only a handful of studio-funded pictures during the late
1940s. Before ``Touch of Evil,'' his last studio film, under the
auspices of Western-maker Republic, was a 1948 treatment of
``Macbeth''which, although innovative in some ways, was savaged by
critics.
</P>
<P>
   How then did it come about that Welles was chosen to direct
``Touch of Evil'' at Universal? He had been chosen to play corrupt
police officer Hank Quinlan, but the studio had no director in mind
when it approached Charlton Heston to star as good cop Mike Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Heston claims it was he who suggested that Welles direct the
film. He told the ``Orange County Register'' earlier this year that
he wanted Welles because he admired ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he would turn a plain old cop story into something
special,'' Heston said.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, an up-and-coming star who portrayed Moses to great
success in 1956's ``The Ten Commandments,''won the day.
</P>
<P>
   Welles, Heston, Janet Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, Dennis Weaver and
others made a fascinating film. Then, the editing process began,
and once again, because of Welles' delays and broken promises, the
studio stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welles was his own worst enemy,'' Heston said in a recent
Phoenix interview. ``He would deliberately alienate the men in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stories surrounding the re-release of ``Touch of
Evil'' vilify Universal Pictures, which supposedly took the film
away from Welles. However, Welles shares responsibility for what
happened. He was given opportunities to make suggestions and
re-edits, but he chose to procrastinate and leave town at a
critical time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike what happened in the early '40s, however, this story has
a happy ending. Producer Rick Schmidlin and editor Walter Murch
have re-issued ``Touch of Evil,'' using a 58-page memo Welles sent
to the studio during the editing process. The result is a film that
should come closer to Welles' vision.
</P>
<P>
   For once, ``(begin ital) what could have been'' (end ital)
became reality. &QL;

   But the sordid tale has a happy ending. Elliott endured and so
did his mom and dad, who felt everything their son felt, and more.
This, after all, is what parents do. Thursday night, when Elliott
starts at quarterback for Arizona State for the first time, Evon
and Stan Elliott will be in Sun Devil Stadium watching, cheering
and perhaps reflecting on the journey they and their son had to
make to reach this moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had taken one wrong step,'' Stan Elliott said, ``he
wouldn't be there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems straightforward _ a struggling, 2-4 ASU team and a
typical quarterback switch before a game against Stanford. Elliott,
the brash, confident, redshirt freshman in; Ryan Kealy, the
third-year sophomore whose confidence seemingly has vanished, out.
What's going on with Kealy is anything but simple. And so is the
sequence of events that produced his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The price Elliott paid to position himself to get an ASU
scholarship was high.
</P>
<P>
   On Page 33 of the ASU football media guide, under the picture of
a very serious-looking Chad Elliott, is a description of his high
school career. It says he was a 1997 graduate of Grant High School
in Sacramento and lists his honors and statistics, including the
3,150 yards, the 69 percent completion rate, the 47 touchdowns and
the three interceptions that helped produce a 12-2 record and a
sectional championship.
</P>
<P>
   There is brief mention of what he did his junior year, but
nothing about it being spent at Nevada Union High School, which
serves the twin towns of Grass Valley and Nevada City.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Valley, not Sacramento, is Elliott's hometown, a
postcard-pretty community in the northern California pines about an
hour from Lake Tahoe. Prospectors used to come there for the gold
buried in its mountains. It is where Evon's parents own a grocery
store. Evon Elliott is fourth-generation Grass Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It is also where some considered Chad Elliott to be a turncoat
for switching high schools. His family was ridiculed and scorned.
Tires were slashed, and private investigators looked into the
Elliotts' finances, poked through their garbage, talked to their
neighbors and likely followed them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of cruel things that happened,'' Evon Elliott
said.
</P>
<P>
   All because her son wanted to throw the ball, to go deep, to use
his strong right arm and quick wits to the fullest. This, after
all, is what quarterbacks do. And he got to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my days where I was not very happy, crying,'' Evon
Elliott said. ``I was very upset that high school football could
get this far off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   The story begins during Elliott's junior year at Nevada Union.
The previous season, Elliott led the Miners to a championship, but
then he got hurt and was becoming increasingly frustrated with
Coach Dave Humphers' effective but conservative Wing-T attack.
Elliott knew the only way to attract college recruiters was to show
his stuff, and he couldn't do it there. Besides, Elliott was
somewhat of a rebel and wise guy. He and Humphers were starting to
get on each other's nerves. &QL; 
Change of scenery &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 60 miles away in the Del Paso Heights section of
Sacramento sits Grant High School. It is everything Nevada Union is
not. It is predominantly Black as opposed to all-White. It is
bordered by concrete, not trees and mountains. Its coach, Mike
Alberghini, likes to pass. And he hired as quarterbacks coach a
Grant alum named Aaron Garcia, who was good enough to play
quarterback at Washington State before Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents knew it would be best for me to go to another
school and hope to get a scholarship out of that,'' Chad Elliott
said. ``At least give me a chance where I can shine, because all I
was doing at the other school was handing off.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant High School's No. 1 rival is Nevada Union, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Alberghini, the coach at Grant, knew about Elliott. Knew him? He
defensed him the previous two years. He admired his athletic
ability, respected how he would take a hit and get right back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put relentless pressure on him,'' Alberghini said, ``and he
never broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard from Stan Elliott, ``I thought it was a
joke,'' Alberghini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look where he grew up,'' he said. ``It was practically
all-White, a mixture of pretty affluent people who had chosen to
move to the hills and get out of the city, and people who had lived
there all their lives. Our school is 83 percent minorities.
Predominantly Black. Samoans. Hispanics. Most of the White kids are
Russian immigrants. It was complete culture shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberghini wanted to test the Elliotts' sincerity, so he told
them Chad would have to enroll for the spring semester of his
junior year. He did that. Chad also would have to take a geometry
class in summer school and participate in a summer ``passing
league.'' He did that, too, making the hour-plus daily commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew what kind of character he had, what kind of
person we had,'' Alberghini said. &QL; 
Unrest in Grass Valley &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Grass Valley, the reaction was somewhat less than
enthusiastic. Some of the residents, in fact, were irate. It wasn't
enough that Elliott left, but that he went to Grant, of all places.
An undercurrent of racism already tinged the rivalry, and now this.
People wondered aloud why parents would send their son to a school
where he would need a bulletproof vest, why a family would move to
a bad place with gangs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many supported the move and understood the
motives. And Evon Elliott wants it made clear she does not want the
people of Grass Valley portrayed as racist. But, she said, ``There
is some backward thinking there.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before stories about Elliott surfaced, how he was
uncoachable, a problem. Sure, Elliott said, sometimes he'd irk the
coach by wearing a hat in class or by not wearing a tie when he was
supposed to. But it was all small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Humphers said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was benched several times for greater offenses than that,''
he told the ``Sacramento Bee'' in October 1996. ``But I'll not drag
a 17-year-old kid through the mud. I just want to leave it alone
and let him play.''
</P>
<P>
   A message left on Humphers' answering machine at Nevada Union on
Tuesday was not returned. &QL; 
Accepted and rejected &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Elliott to be eligible to play for Grant, he and his family
had to establish residency in the school district. So they rented
an 700-square foot apartment from which Stan, a building
contractor, and Evon, who works in her parents' store, commuted to
Grass Valley and back each day. Their other son, Alex, then 11,
stayed in Grass Valley and came down to Sacramento on weekends.
They kept their house.
</P>
<P>
   It was expensive and a little cramped, ``but it was kind of nice
to have a smaller place,'' Evon Elliott said. ``In a bigger house,
sometimes kids find their own sanctuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   At Grant, Elliott was ``fully accepted in a minute,'' Alberghini
said. Throwing to receivers such as Dante Stallworth, who wound up
with a scholarship to Tennessee, Elliott had a huge season. The
Pacers finished 12-2 and won a sectional title.
</P>
<P>
   One of the losses was to Nevada Union, 21-19, in its first
return to Grant's field since a shooting incident caused games to
be moved from Friday nights to Saturday afternoons. Elliott
completed just 8 of 20 passes for 155 yards and was knocked around
quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The real pain came after the game when he was ignored by friends
and former teammates, many of whom he played football with since
the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was hard for him,'' Evon Elliott said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated as a traitor,'' said Alberghini.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Elliott went back to watch a Nevada Union game,
somebody slashed his tires. &QL; 
A wonderful `melting pot' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott was growing as a football player, and in ways more
substantial than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how wonderful it was,'' Evon Elliott said of
the family's move to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be a good experience for my son. We lived in a
predominantly White area. Here he was, about to be 17, and he'd
rarely seen any other races in our area. It was beneficial in so
many ways. He made so many lifetime friends. It was good. Football
was good. Relations were made.''
</P>
<P>
   Evon Elliott said her son regularly brought teammates home for
dinner, and even now she sends care packages to Dante Stallworth in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me a lot,'' Chad Elliott said. ``College is a
melting pot, a bunch of different cultures and people, and it
helped me get ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Stan, Evon and Chad returned to Grass Valley,
but Chad finished out the school year, driving up and down the
mountains each day. ASU assistant coach Phil Snow had noticed
Elliott and began recruiting him hard. Quarterbacks coach John
Pettas joined the effort. They were virtually the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at his old school were disgruntled and were telling bad
stories about him,'' Pettas said. ``So we investigated his
character. We thought he was a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott committed to ASU before Christmas. One reason was,
``They stuck by me,'' he said. ``I was getting recruited a lot and
all of a sudden some would drop off. My quarterback coach called
the colleges and asked why. They said the coach of my previous high
school said I was a bad kid and don't recruit me. But ASU stuck by
me.'' &QL; 
Digging up garbage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another investigation was taking place. In February
1997, the ``Bee'' reported that the Nevada Joint Union High School
District was checking to see if the Elliotts failed to maintain a
full-time residence in Sacramento. That would strip Grant of its
title and Elliott of his records. The newspaper also reported that
private investigators were hired to follow Elliott and his family.
That was denied. But neighbors were interviewed, credit checks were
made and the Elliott's garbage rummaged through.
</P>
<P>
   It also was a fact that Nevada Union High School sent a letter
of inquiry to Grant. Both principals would not comment, but Nevada
County superintendent of schools Terry McAteer called the whole
thing a ``mess,'' and added, ``It's really sort of sad when a
school district sanctions private eyes going through people's
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation produced nothing but harder feelings and a
lawsuit against the school district filed by the Elliotts. No
improprieties were found. Chad Elliott's records stood. Life goes
on, and folks calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott enrolled at ASU and during his first year, Evon Elliott
moved again, this time to Chandler for six months to help her son's
transition. After Elliott's success at Grant, the same people in
Grass Valley who decried his leaving now looked at him ``like I had
done something special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all is forgiven, who knows? If Elliott can lead the Sun
Devils out of the doldrums and becomes the college quarterback he
thinks he can be, they might have a parade for him. &QL;

 iT ISN'T EASY BEING LINDBERGH'S DAUGHTER 
REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BARNET, Vt. When Reeve Lindbergh was a child, she dreamed that
her father was God. After all, she rationalized, she and her
brothers and sisters ``called him `father,' when all of our friends
called their fathers `daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, she could find him in the ``Encyclopedia
Britannica'' as Charles A. Lindbergh, the all-American hero, the
man who, over the course of a lonely 33 1/2 hours in May 1927,
became the first to fly solo across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 71 years after that still awe-inspiring &UR;  &LR; flight (which
took place 18 years before her birth), Lindbergh smiles and tosses
her head back at a question about that childhood dream, which she
relates in her just-published memoir, ``Under A Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he was like that,'' she said. ``He was big and he had an
amazing presence. Piercing blue eyes. And everything he said was
right.'' But then, ``He was also different from that. He could
relax and be quite silly, tumbling with us on the floor, carrying
me piggy-back around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, she thought, ``an inside view and an outside view.''
Outside, in public, ``I had the feeling that my father would put on
a uniform, the Lindbergh uniform,'' she said, ``but then at other
times, he would dissolve into a warm human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lindbergh, 53, it is an extraordinary legend to carry
through life. While she dealt with some aspects of it in her 1993
novel, ``The Names of Mountains,'' the memoir is her first effort
to deal with it directly.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents rarely spoke to their children about the public
events that made their lives so legendary. For the flight to Paris,
Lindbergh would refer the children to his book about it, telling
them, ``It's all in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the kidnapping and death of her parents' first-born
in March 1932 was a closed subject. And, Reeve Lindbergh says now,
``The things they didn't talk about are still painful. They hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling parallel to her parents' tragedy, Reeve Lindbergh
lost her son from her first marriage, Jonathan, to infantile
encephalitis in 1985 before his second birthday. He was the age
that her brother was when he was kidnapped. Her mother, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, now 92, was with her the night her son died, Lindbergh
said, and insisted they sit with Jonathan's body until the medical
examiner came. ``I never saw my son's body,'' she told her
daughter. ``I never sat with my son this way.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The intertwined triumph and tragedy of the Lindbergh legend is
well known, particularly among those of a certain age. She said
that people constantly want to tell her their connection to the
legend. At a children's book event _ Lindbergh has written 13 books
for children _ author and illustrator Maurice Sendak told her that
his nightmare memory of the kidnapping, which occurred when he was
4, is the psychological basis for his classic children's tale,
``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nightmare for people of that age,'' said Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   But for younger generations, the legend is dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs about the reaction of Eli and Sam, the teenage sons
of her second husband, Nathaniel Tripp, whom she married in 1987.
``They knew it was a big deal,'' she said. ``But not what kind of a
big deal. I think they were more excited about my teenage daughters
_ Elizabeth and Susannah _ moving in with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For herself, whatever burden the Lindbergh legend may be, it
appears one she has learned to live with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After 30 years in Vermont _ she moved there after graduating
from Radcliffe in 1968 with her first husband, Richard Brown, a
Harvard classmate _ she has the outdoorsy look that comes with
too-short summers and snow-laden winters.
</P>
<P>
   She has graying blonde, tousled hair that becomes more so as she
runs her fingers through it while pausing to recollect during
several hours of conversation. She is often described as slight of
build. It is a slightness that resembles her mother's in the
memorable photograph in which, dressed in aviator's flight gear,
she is standing next to her husband. The smile is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh lives now in far up-country Vermont with Tripp and
their son, 11-year-old Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, a mile and a half in from the state highway at the end
of a dirt road, is not in gentrified country. It is the kind of
back-country farm where once you might have found derelict cars
behind the barn and broken appliances on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there are chickens and a flock of 16 sheep. There is
also an old cow and an old horse that ``don't serve any purpose,''
Lindbergh said. ``Just hang out.'' Tripp figures ``the maximum this
farm could produce is $3,000 to $4,000 a year _ gross.'' Which is
why, he said, ``we produce books'': Lindbergh's children's books,
the 1993 novel, this memoir, and Tripp's ``Father, Soldier, Son; A
Memoir of a Platoon Leader in Vietnam,'' published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As for their 1840s farmhouse, it has the rumpled look of one
whose occupants care more about the living than the appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Although his sons and her children are grown and gone _ the only
one still at home is Benjamin, a visitor might think the house is
full of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen is a large, hand-drawn poster looking much like
an illustration from one of Lindbergh's children's books, setting
out various rules of the house: no more than three in the bathtub
at a time, including animals; no using the washing machine when
someone is taking a shower; and no racoons or peacocks allowed
inside the house. A World War II board game that Ben is playing
sprawls across the living room table.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh works in a small room off the kitchen, where the
clutter, extraordinary even by the usual standards of authors'
offices, swamps her computer. But there is a idyllic view up a
hillside meadow where several bluebird houses have been set out on
poles. Occasionally, deer appear out of the early morning fog at
the edge of the nearby woods. Their visits are rare enough,
Lindbergh said, ``that there is still a kind of magic in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly absent from the house is any noticeable Lindbergh
memorabilia. The only things she has, Lindbergh says, are personal
items _ like a little green eraser of her father's, a wooden ruler
on which her mother had written her initials, ``and the little
glasses case my father gave my mother to hold when she was in
labor'' and in which he had written the names of all the children
as they came along, from the kidnapped Charles through Jon, Land,
and Scott to Anne and then Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a family like ours,'' she said, ``it's the personal things
that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But with her memoir and with ``Lindbergh,'' a biography of her
father by A. Scott Berg also published this fall, it's the family
legend that's drawing new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who began working on the biography in 1990, spent
considerable time with all surviving family members, but
particularly with Reeve, whom he saw as the gatekeeper of the
family's extensive _ and never before opened _ archives. ``We had a
symbiotic relationship,'' he said. ``She'd send me chapters of her
memoir as she finished them. I don't think I used anything from
them, but I got a lot of attitudes from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Lindbergh worked on her memoir, originally begun as a
memorial to her sister Anne, who died in 1993, Berg became a
source. ``I'd call him for dates,'' she said. ```Scott,' I'd say,
`what was I doing in 1953?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when Berg came up to Vermont around
Christmas in 1992, a time chosen, Lindbergh said, because the
family, including Anne Morrow Lindbergh and all the children, would
be gathered for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   One night after dinner, she said, Berg sat down at the piano and
started playing Cole Porter tunes. After a bit, he came to
``Anything Goes'' and when he did, ``All of a sudden, my mother got
up from where she was sitting, all curled up, and walked over
toward the piano. And every time he got to the chorus, she would
sing in a tiny voice, `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Morrow Lindbergh was 86 that year and, as her daughter
said, ``she was pretty frail and lots had gone for her, but she
still remembered `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   From her childhood, Lindbergh remembers the lists of misdeeds
that her father would confront his children with on his return from
extended trips overseas or around the country: ``rake left out in
the rain,'' ``reading comics,'' or lapses in the ``freedom and
responsibility'' category.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back now, what she remembers is ``knowing him at a
good period in his life'' when he would come up to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Lindbergh the aviator _ including some 50 World War II
missions in the South Pacific as a civilian _ had become Lindbergh
the conservationist. And, she said, he was ``more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much the country meant to him,'' she
said. ``But he would come up and reminisce about varities of corn
and ways of raising sheep. These were things that were clearly in
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   (AT)5SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Aviator's biographer had access to family archive &QC; 
(AT)7 A major challenge for A. Scott Berg in writing his
just-published biography of hero-aviator Charles A. Lindbergh was
retelling the story of the incredible 33 1/2-hour solo flight
across the Atlantic in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston to promote ``Lindbergh,'' Berg said, ``I had a lot to
compete with, including Lindbergh himself, who did it so well'' in
his 1954 Pulitzer Prize-winning account, ``The Spirit of St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to recapture the atmosphere and excitement that
surrounded the event, Berg had the good fortune of hearing an
account from actor Jimmy Stewart, who played Lindbergh in the 1957
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the loveliest account I had,'' said Berg. The flight
occurred on Stewart's 17th birthday, Berg said, and he had stayed
up most of the night waiting for news. ``He talked about it to me
as if it was just the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, 49, lives in Los Angeles. He began work on the Lindbergh
biography in 1990. His biography of editor Maxwell Perkins won the
National Book Award in 1979. Following that, he wrote a biography
of film mogul Samuel Goldwyn.
</P>
<P>
   An equally great challenge, Berg said, was providing a
definitive account of the kidnapping of Lindbergh's infant son _
the ``crime of the century'' when it occurred in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Having secured permission from Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, Berg had access to previously unexamined family
archives, including letters that family members wrote to each other
during the three years between the kidnapping and the murder trial
and conviction of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

MRS. CASTANEDA: THE SORCERER'S WIFE  
 (NOTE TIME ELEMENT) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED- They were improbable lovers. For decades, he denied she
even existed.
</P>
<P>
   She was a tall Southern belle with Cleopatra bangs and a
seductive patter; he, short and serious, recently immigrated from
Peru in hopes of becoming a successful artist in America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, their paths crossed in Los Angeles during the mid-'50s, and
in 1960 Margaret Evelyn Runyan married the man who would become the
most famous literary sorcerer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda, author of ``The Teachings of Don Juan,'' ``A
Separate'' ``Reality'' and eight other bestselling books on the
enigmatic world of Mexican shamans, passed away last April in Los
Angeles of liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's works, which sold 8 million copies in 17 languages,
captured the spirit of the drug-bent, psychedelic '60s and helped
launch the New Age era with vivid accounts of spiritual and
pharmacological adventures with a white-haired Yaqui Indian
``nagual,'' or shaman, Don Juan Matus.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda wrote that, as a UCLA graduate anthropology student,
he met Don Juan at a Greyhound bus station in Nogales, Ariz., in
the summer of 1960 while researching medicinal plants used by
Indians of the Southwest. An unexpected apprenticeship with Don
Juan followed in which Castaneda, under the influence of peyote and
other psychotropic plants, saw giant insects, flew like a crow,
spoke with cactus and was chased by inorganic beings in the pursuit
of seeing pure energy and breaking away from ``ordinary reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Admirers then and now see his work as a compelling spiritual
quest. Critics view it all as a metaphor at best, more likely an
out-and-out hoax.
</P>
<P>
   And now the skeptics are clucking again as a multimillion-dollar
estate hearing over Castaneda's will begin Thursday (Oct. 22) in
Los Angeles. The adversaries? Castaneda's corporation vs. the
legally adopted son of his old love.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda always denied being married. Records prove
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Margaret Castaneda, 76, lives on in Charleston, W.Va.,
where she leads an active life among friends and family. And
despite her famous ex-husband's refusal to publicly acknowledge her
existence during the last two decades of his life, Margaret still
carries the torch for Carlos, whom she calls ``a genius'' and ``the
most wonderful human being'' she has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Margaret said the truth about
Castaneda and his books is like reality itself, an amalgam of
elements with varying degrees of resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Don Juan,'' Margaret said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   As an anthropology student, Margaret said Castaneda did spend
years in Arizona and Mexico doing fieldwork on aboriginal people.
But she believes the bulk of material for his books came from his
childhood in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret said Castaneda grew up in the small Peruvian village of
Cajamarca, not the more cosmopolitan country of Brazil as he
claimed. As a child, he walked the square where herbs were sold,
listening to magical stories told by local ``curanderos'' and
Quechua Indians.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she may have inspired the creation of Don Juan
through a conversation with Castaneda about Plato and his Socratic
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that Plato didn't have anyone to discuss the other
side of what he thought so he wrote his ideas as dialogues with
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret said Castaneda most likely came up with his teacher's
name, Don Juan Matus, from Mateus, the bubbly Portuguese wine the
couple favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He once held up a bottle of Mateus and said, `This is where
real knowledge comes from.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Margaret said it doesn't matter; what's important are the
teachings, which she believes are the most trenchant of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   As far as being an actual sorcerer, Margaret said Castaneda
(begin ital) did (end ital) have the knowledge and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   She believes she once spent a weekend in New York with
Castaneda's energy double, and that glass mysteriously shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day when I see a crow I say, `Carlos, is that you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret believes Castaneda's denial of their marriage was an
inevitable consequence of becoming a sorcerer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians called it becoming a man of knowledge, and it
entailed a complex process of erasing one's personal history,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was that, and there was what Margaret calls ``fear'' on
the part of Cleargreen, the corporation that handled all aspects of
Castaneda's career, that she might reveal a personal side to him
that could puncture his carefully woven mystique. For most of his
public life, Castaneda refused interviews, refused to have his
picture taken and refused to have his voice recorded.
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise when Cleargreen sued her over the
publication and distribution of her 1997 book ``A Magical Journey
With'' ``Carlos Castaneda,'' a 185-pager written with affection and
erudition about Castaneda before his fame and before the ``shedding
of his human form.''
</P>
<P>
   There are wonderful personal details in the book, such as how a
penniless Castaneda worked for the Mattel Toy Co., drove a cab and
did a shift at a liquor store in order to finance his education and
research for his doctoral dissertation, which eventually became his
first book, ``The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of
Knowledge''.``''
</P>
<P>
   But foremost, ``Magical Journey'' is a love story.
</P>
<P>
   As Margaret tells it, she met Castaneda in 1955 through her
dressmaker, a Costa Rican woman named Lydette Maduro. They began to
date despite Maduro's warning that Castaneda had ``powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda was a marginal artist. Margaret worked in management
for Pacific Telephone in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret said Castaneda loved foreign films, especially those of
Ingmar Bergman, and enjoyed getting together with friends over
Mateus to share intellectual banter.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's focus became retooled when Margaret introduced him
to ``The'' ``Doors of Perception,'' Aldous Huxley's account of his
controversial mescaline experiments and scholarly dissection of
altered states of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On first reading, Carlos was hooked,'' Margaret said.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned art and enrolled in social-science classes, first
at Los Angeles City College and later at UCLA. He was especially
taken with phenomenology curricula.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Margaret said, they were married in Mexico. Six months
later, they separated because he spent too much time in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their personal problems, Margaret said, they remained
good friends, and when she pressed him for a divorce, he drove her
back to the same little Mexican town to undo the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Castaneda told her they weren't really
divorced. It had all been a charade, something to appease Margaret
while he was doing fieldwork. This was especially upsetting news as
she had married another man after the fake divorce and bore his
child.
</P>
<P>
   The other man disappeared, but Castaneda remained and developed
a strong, spiritual attachment to Margaret's son, originally named
Adrian but renamed Carlton Jeremy Castaneda, or C.J., after
Castaneda legally adopted him.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. lives in Atlanta. He is married and owns a chain of
drive-through gourmet coffee shops. He said Castaneda treated him
as if he were his own.
</P>
<P>
   David Christie, owner of Millenia Press, publisher of Margaret's
book, said he has known Margaret for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret was a significant force in Castaneda's life,''
Christie said, ``including talking him into using Castaneda as his
last name, rather than Aranha. She was also a very beautiful
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis L'Amour thought so, too. Margaret said she met him in a
Los Angeles drugstore three years before Castaneda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to marry me, too,'' Margaret said. ``But I took him
to meet my aunt, and she said she didn't want her beautiful niece
marrying that lounge lizard who would never amount to a hill of
beans.''
</P>
<P>
   The same aunt didn't care for Castaneda, either.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret and C.J. lived several years in Tempe in the mid-'70s
after her real divorce from Castaneda. C.J. attended Marcos de Niza
High School; Margaret owned a phone answering service called the
Apache Sun, which she said Castaneda bought for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona was the most spiritual place I've ever lived,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret said that in 1978 Castaneda came to Tempe for C.J.'s
graduation from high school. Afterward, he took them to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't see him again until 1993 _ for the last time _ at a
bookstore in Santa Monica, Calif., for the signing of his book
``The Art'' ``of Dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried when I saw him,'' Margaret said. ``His hair had turned
gray. I couldn't imagine Carlos as an old man. It still upsets me
to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's estate was reportedly worth $20 million to $50
million when he died. A few days before his death, Margaret said,
his will was changed under ``very suspicious circumstances.'' She
said she and C.J. were left nothing even though their names were
mentioned at the top of the will. Castaneda's entire estate, she
said, was left to his corporation.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. has contested the will. If it turns out the way he hopes,
he and his mother, the sorcerer's wife, could benefit handsomely
from Castaneda's adventures in ordinary reality. &QL;

DEMOCRATS IN MAINE HAVE TROUBLE ON THEIR HANDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ It has come to this: The Democratic Party in
Maine is within a hair's-breadth of being decertified as an
official political party if struggling gubernatorial nominee Tom
Connolly doesn't get at least 5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Red alert! Connolly polled at only 6 percent four weeks before
the vote. Governor Angus King, the popular Independent incumbent,
siphoned off 61 percent in the poll by Strategic Marketing, versus
13 for former US Representative Jim Longley, the Republican. The
Green Party's Pat LaMarche (4 percent) and the Taxpayers Party's
Bill Clarke (2) left 15 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats organized a resuscitation team, King's
spokesman, Dennis Bailey, cracked: ``I think they could run a
canned ham and get 5 percent.'' Elsewhere around the nation there's
more pork than ham at work in the 36 governor's races. Huge leads
for incumbents, mostly Republicans, reflect the strong economy, the
lack of many or even any galvanizing state-level issues, and the
pragmatic approach of most governors, who tend not to be as
ideologically polarized as the GOP Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perusing a state-by-state polling survey by the National Journal
Hotline you find 22 Republican candidates for governor leading by
more than the margin of error, only four Democrats comfortably
ahead, and six races in the tossup category _ closer than 6 points
or less. Since the GOP has 24 of the 36 seats at stake and the
Democrats only 11, the Republicans seem to be holding much of their
tight grip on statehouses, which should help the GOP in the
congressional redistricting required in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One GOP wag jibed that the Republicans will control more land
than the National Park Service. But California _ where Lieutenant
Governor Gray Davis, a Democratic, leads Attorney General Dan
Lungren, a Republican _ is the big prize because the Golden State's
electoral votes give you the biggest chunk of what you need to win
the White House. If Davis loses and if Scott Harshbarger falls
short in Massachusetts, the Republicans will likely control the
governor's chair in the 11 largest states, a shift with awesome
import.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is up 6 and 8 points in two October polls, and
Harshbarger seems to have begun to move here, where the outcome is
likely to be a single-digit win one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The Brothers Bush have huge leads; Governor George W. was up by
70-24 in Texas, and Jeb is running in the mid-50s in Florida, to
Lieutenant Governor Buddy McKay's high 30s. This gives the Bushes
the inside track on the second- and third-largest blocs of
electoral votes for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New England incumbents _ save the Bay State's acting guv and
Rhode Island's Lincoln Almond, who is tied with Democrat Myrth York
in recent polling _ seem solidly ensconsed. Vermont's Howard Dean
polls at 64 percent, GOP Governor John Rowland of Connecticut is at
60 or 62, and Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire
had a 20-point comfort zone over Republican Jay Lucas, who has
outspent her by almost 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents in danger of being axed include Republican Fob James
in Alabama, a God squadder whose politicizing of matters Biblical
finds him trailing Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman,
and Maryland, where Democrat Parris Glendening is neck and neck
with Republican Ellen Sauerbrey. In heavyweight industrial states
like Pennsylvania and Michigan, Republican incumbents rule, but in
New Mexico and South Carolina, the GOP faces stronger-than-expected
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky imbroglio, with its impeachment
connotations, seems not to be much of an issue here, but in New
Hampshire, Republican Lucas has flayed Shaheen for not being
sufficiently anti-Clinton. No one is sure how turnout nationally
will be affected by Washington's perpetual scandal machine, but
most tea leaf readers see it helping Republicans in the South,
West, and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   I have developed my own Iodine Theory, to wit: In places that
border on saltwater, where the iodine content is higher, voters
tend to be more tolerant of Clinton's sins than in the interior,
where AM talk radio harangue-masters fill the role that hurricanes
and ocean-spawned storms play along the coasts.

   There are currently 32 GOP governors, the highest number the
party has held for 76 years. It was Lyndon Johnson who confided to
Bill Moyers that advancing the cause of black Americans might cost
the Democrats control of the White House for 30 years, so resentful
would become white voters. National politics has become transformed
in ways no one foresaw, though Richard Nixon's infamous Southern
Strategy has stood the test of time, more's the pity. Congress is
dominated by Sun Belt conservatives; the only Democrats elected
president in 38 years were Southerners; the North's political clout
is at its lowest ebb ever. And if Davis and Harshbarger lose,
Republicans will control the 11 largest states. Whew.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been arrested in London and faces extradition for
crimes against humanity is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can
be held to account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa earlier this month. Nor is it surprising that
Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar commented that ``the best
outcome would be if the government doesn't even have to decide,'' a
reference to the fact that the Spanish judiciary still has to rule
on whether to advance the extradition request.
 &HT;    The implications involve all the jumble of issues provoked by
the collision of demands for pure justice and the demands of
politics, the demands of peace, the demands of reconciliation.
Further, the new emphasis on the international right to judge
certain crimes complicates the question of who is to judge whether
circumstance or unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who
led it, will have some profound guidelines to offer from the moral
insights the experience has provided.
 &HT;    Many countries, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, ex-communist
countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile, have sought to
transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by trying to
tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is their
choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed were
crimes against humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who asked to question
Pinochet as a step toward extradition had been working on testimony
collected by victims for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption cases and the tracks of the ``dirty war'' by
police against Basque terrorists during the previous Socialist
government, to its great discomfiture.
 &HT;    His document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91 people
kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
prescribing genocide, war crimes, torture. There may be some
question about the jurisdiction of a Spanish court (or of a British
court since it has been suggested Britain could hold the trial
instead of granting extradition.)
 &HT;    But there is no question about the straightforward legal
sincerity of Garzon or that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day they will get their due.
 &HT;    The new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. This is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise, one
of the reasons I don't think it's a good treaty.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict, a
better chance of peaceful life. When, as was the case at Nuremberg
after World War II, it is possible to achieve all at once, so much
the better.
 &HT;    But the best in moral terms must not destroy the chances of
improving how people live.

ADS AIMED AT GETTING WOMEN TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two women's organizations are using advertising
campaigns to topple the conventional wisdom that President
Clinton's sexual infidelities will keep women away from the polls
on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media keeps reporting that women won't be voting and that
message is a very disempowering message for women to continue to
hear,'' said Margot Magowan, a co-founder of the group, Women
Count. ``It has the potential to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonpartisan organization's advertising campaign, which began
Tuesday in many major California daily newspapers, comes as
Democrats fear a low turnout by women voters will hurt their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats have had success at the polls in the 1990s
by relying on a ``gender gap'' in which women by large margins have
voted for the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Emily's List, a national organization that raises
money for women candidates who support abortion rights, is
spearheading its own ``Women Vote'' project.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List began the Women Vote project in 1994, when Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., was struggling in her campaign against
Republican Michael Huffington, who poured millions of dollars from
his personal fortune into the race. The group sought ``drop off''
women voters _ those who voted in presidential elections but not in
off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List spokeswoman Stephanie Cohen said the project
targeted 900,000 women voters with direct mail and follow-up calls
urging them to vote _ and 415,000 did. Cohen said the vote clearly
helped Feinstein. Her victory came in an election in which,
nationally, 16 million fewer women voted than in the presidential
election of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is making sure that people realize that this
election and going out to vote has an impact on their lives and
their families,'' Cohen said. ``It's not about scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Women Count was launched earlier this year by Esprit Corp.
co-founder Susie Tompkins Buell and several friends who were
frustrated by news media reports saying that the Clinton scandal
would alienate women and lead to voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so discouraged that women have let their right go,'' Buell
said Tuesday. ``If you think about what suffragettes did and how
they sacrificed and paved the way for all of us, we've just taken
it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The print ads by the group include an image of a woman flexing
her biceps along with the text: ``They used to say women couldn't
vote. Now they say we won't. Vote Tuesday, November 3rd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Madrid, political director for the California Republican
Party, praised the group's effort to increase women's participation
in politics, but questioned how nonpartisan its goals are. Buell,
who is spearheading the effort, was one of the top 10 California
donors to the Democratic Party in 1996, giving $138,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me this group sees the same thing we are seeing:
that Barbara Boxer is going to lose unless she can use scare
tactics to get women to vote,'' Madrid said. He said supporters of
Boxer, the incumbent senator who faces a tight re-election, ``are
wrong to use a nonpartisan group to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Buell said the vote campaign wasn't about re-electing Boxer,
although she personally supports the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about women taking responsibility for their concerns and
getting out and voting,'' Buell said. ``If you don't vote, don't
complain.''

cliches of being a mother,'' snapped Sandra Bernhard, in bare feet,

   FERGUSON-ARCHITECTURE (Bridgewater, Conn.) _ For every architect
there is an ideal client. When Peter May met his architect, Mark
Ferguson, his estate consisted of a gray saltbox house here on 11
acres overlooking a valley and mountain in western Connecticut.
Ferguson wasn't the King of Limestone then. He was a young man
fresh from Parish-Hadley, the chintz-strewn interior design firm,
setting up practice with two others who billed themselves as
Traditional Architects; men who belived firmly in the vocabulary of
classical times. May was only the first in a series of well-to-do
men and women to seek out Ferguson, though this first commission
would hardly compare to the grandeur of the architect's later
designs. By Tracie Rozhon.

<P>
   LASERS-TEENS (Undated) _ The path from technological miracle to
public nuisance is often a direct one. Witness the descent of the
laser, the pure, steady light that can cut diamonds or could, in
theory, carry all the world's electronic information simultaneously
on a single beam. The laser has found its lowest-common-denominator
use in the form of the pointer. More recently, these devices, some
of which can project little red dots 800 yards or more, have become
the newest playthings of mischievous teen-agers. By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-CATALOGS (New York) _ These days, as the holiday season
approaches, postal bags swell to Santa-size proportions with
mail-order catalogs. This week, there will be two new arrivals in
the mail _ both from small downtown design stores that are new to
the mail-order business. By Marianne Rohrlich.

   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-AGNELI (Undated) _ A new book, ``The Agnelli Gardens at
Villar Perosa'' (Harry N. Abrams, $75), is filled with fuzzy
pictures of very beautiful gardens in the Piedmont region of Italy,
virtually secret gardens that have never been opened to the public.
They cover 25 acres surrounding the Agnelli family seat in the
village of Villar Perosa 30 miles north of Turin. The beautiful but
impressionistic pictures hint at more than a taste for witty
abstraction. They underline a consistent attempt to gauze-wrap any
critical focus on a family that, in Italy, is seen as comparable to
the Kennedys. By Mac Griswold.

BATS ON THE WEB: NOT BLIND, NOT RODENTS, NOT EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When bats fly, evil lurks.
</P>
<P>
   No, not that kind of evil. Forget crosses, wooden stakes,
Hollywood Transylvanians and children of the night. Above all,
forget what Bob Benson, public relations director at Bat
Conservation International (www.batcon.org), calls ``Bram Stoker's
infamous novel.'' The real evil, bat enthusiasts say, is ignorance
and fear about one of nature's most remarkable and, from a human
perspective, most useful animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vastly more dangerous to have dogs in your neighborhood
than bats,'' said Dr. Merlin Tuttle, a wildlife biologist who
founded Bat Conservation International in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a very few years ago, nearly the entire world feared and
avoided bats at all costs,'' Tuttle said in a telephone interview.
``Today, we're beginning to make a pretty dramatic difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference shows. Tuttle, 57, moved the society from
Milwaukee, where he was a museum curator, to Austin, Texas., in
1986, partly because the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin had the
largest urban bat population in North America _ 1.5 million. He
also moved there because Austin was then what he called ``the
negative story capital of the world,'' with alarmist tales of rabid
swarms ready to sink their teeth into the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Congress Avenue Bridge (www.batcon.org/congress.html)
is a tourist attraction. And Bat Conservation International has a
$3.5 million budget, 24 full-time employees and 14,000 members in
76 countries. Its vast array of information and links shows the
power of the Internet as a teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   The organization provides teachers' guides and a multimedia kit,
``Discover Bats.'' Members receive a quarterly magazine and its
15-year archives are on line.
</P>
<P>
   You can pay to adopt a bat on line, which works something like a
foster parent plan _ including a ``letter'' from the bat and an
8-by-10 photo.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few facts from the site: Bats are not blind, are not
rodents and will not get tangled in your hair. Only one-half of 1
percent of bats are rabid, and most of them are too sick to fly.
Bat droppings and urine cannot transmit rabies.
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk about blood? A single little brown bat can
catch 600 mosquitoes an hour. Vampire bats even adopt orphans.
</P>
<P>
   And for some people, this may be the clincher: The seed
production of agave plants drops to 1 3,000 of normal without bat
pollinators. That's right: No bats, no tequila.
</P>
<P>
   One of the society's treasures is Tuttle's 80,000 slides of bats
taken over the last 30 years. Many were first-ever shots of rare
species at night. Bats have a false reputation for viciousness,
Tuttle said, partly because when frightened they bare their teeth
in self-defense. Such photos are often magnified, making the shy
animals look like saber-toothed tigers.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly serious or scientific, a Swedish company,
Pettersson Electronik (www.bahnhof.se/pettersson), sells ultrasonic
bat detectors that can identify species by their sound waves. If
that is a little dry for your taste, you can lighten up with jokes
from a bat humor page (www.nyx.net/jbuzbee/bathouse.html(NU)Bat
Humor)
</P>
<P>
   What prompts all this enthusiasm and Internet dedication for
bats? Jim Buzbee, a 39-year-old software engineer for Lockheed
Martin in Denver who maintains his own prodigious bat-link page
(www.nyx.net/jbuzbee/bathouse.html), took a guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be because bats are just more of an interesting topic
compared to, say, turtles,'' he wrote by e-mail. ``Bats tend to
stir emotions in people; witness all of the poetry people send
me.''

FROM A FRENCH PAST, A LOOK AT THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pinkee was born far away, in Paris, at a time when a fire
burned in every grate and smoke curled black and feathery like a
horse's tail from a thousand chimney pots.''
</P>
<P>
   So begins the tale of a little girl in the City of Lights on New
Year's Eve in 1899, ``the hinge upon which the century turned.''
Zero Zero, an interactive story on CD-ROM by Theresa Duncan,
describes Pinkee's journey through the streets of Paris in the
waning hours of the 19th century as she hops from rooftop to
rooftop, explores the catacombs and slides down cartoon chimneys to
ask whimsically drawn Parisians what the future has in store.
</P>
<P>
   Their replies, like Pinkee's Paris, are suffused with Gallic
insouciance. ``I love the future!'' exclaims Antoinette, the pastry
chef's assistant. ``It's very modern. Very chic!'' In Madame
Grenouille's greenhouse, the flowers exclaim, ``Salut!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the window of Quel Fromage, the French Revolution
is staged with wedges of Camembert and wheels of brie. In a
fashionable atelier, a couturier explains: ``Since all the great
styles have already been invented in this century, and by
Parisians, the only things for 20th-century designers to do will be
to mix them up. You'll see faux nouvelle and French neoclassicism
and machine-made utilitarian furniture all in the same room. There
will be lots of stripes, and lots of blown glass! It will be
fabulous!''
</P>
<P>
   The librarian, Benjamin Walter, scribbles in his book of ``20th
Century Dreams,'' an album with pictures of robots and space travel
with theremin music in the background. ``In the 20th century,'' he
says, ``aeroplanes will scoop up snow from mountaintops and drop it
over cities simmering with the heat of summer. In the future, we
will stroll along the rings of Saturn on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, since the future is French, the robots carry
baguettes and bottles of wine. Poodles wear astronaut helmets.
Sleek spacecraft sport bumper stickers from Paris, and a tricolor
flag flies on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   From pastries shaped like French philosophers to a hilarious
send-up of Baudelaire, Zero Zero is filled with winking cultural
references children may not catch. But they can surely relate to
its heroine, with her soot-smudged face and insatiable curiosity
about the future, her yen for faraway places and her enthusiasm for
new technology. She, too, is a child at the end of a century, at a
time when new visual technologies signify the future.
</P>
<P>
   Like modern-day Silicon Valley, turn-of-the-century Paris was
brimming with revolutionary visual devices. Zoetropes, panoramas
and motion pictures represented cutting-edge technology, as well as
the latest form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   A coin could conjure the films of Georges Melies in 1899. A
hundred years later, a mouse click conjures those same films in
Quick Time video, accompanied by the digital whir of an antique
sprocket-and-reel projector. On screen, the cursor brings every
object to life. Plus ca change.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only obvious difference between 19th- and
20th-century attempts to divine the future is our mood about it,
and the people we designate as soothsayers. Visions of the future
were once the province of novelists and philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are put forth by corporate consultants, advertising
agencies and tabloid astrologers (in order of ascending accuracy).
And whereas 19th-century oracles were generally optimistic, ours
predict a world filled with messy crises if not outright doom.
</P>
<P>
   According to nearly everyone in the professional futurology
racket, the 21st century is going to clobber us. First, all our
computers will shut down, precipitating a crash of planes, trains
and stock markets. The ozone layer will shortly disappear, leaving
us all fried to a crisp when we're not being ravaged by loose nukes
or terrorist germs.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the future will be very American. There will be a
McDonald's on every block, worldwide! Everyone will be drinking
Coca-Cola and downloading from the World Wide Web (in English) on
their Palm Pilots! They will have different skin tones and dress
codes, but everyone will be American (italics)inside.(end italics)
And all the world's consumers will join hands and sing in unison,
just like on the Small World ride at Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 21st century, this is going to seem just as
outlandish as robots with berets. Because this picture, like all
visions of the future, is hyperbole, based on our present hopes and
present fears. The only thing we can predict with absolute
certainty is that the clock will turn, and there will be fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zap! Zip! Wheee! Sparks spiraled up into the night, where they
joined their cousins, the stars,'' we hear toward the story's end.
``Pinkee put on her rabbit pajamas and stood in front of the round
window in the room she shared with her sisters. The seven sisters
had awakened from their sleep and joined Pinkee at the window,
where the last fireworks reflected pink and green on their sleepy
faces. `What time is it?' they asked as the last of the fireworks
faded. `It's the future,' said Pinkee. `We're there.'''

GARDEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Bringing Hibiscus Indoors &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two beautiful Hibiscus plants in pots outdoors. How do
I prepare them for the long Northeast winters, when I know they
must be brought indoors. I heard they should be placed in a
basement with little light and watered only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   A. Wintering over large, flowering tropical plants like Hibiscus
rosa-sinensis is always a challenge. They never thrive in the
living room the way they do outdoors. Leaves turn yellow and drop,
flowers seldom appear. Assorted pests DO appear, in droves. No
wonder gardeners dream of exiling these shrubs to the basement,
where they can be out of sight and out of mind until spring.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of Hibiscus never sleeps, however, and if you try to
store yours as though it were dormant, you may get a rude
awakening. If you want to try it all the same, keep the plants
cool, 45 to 50 degrees. Expect them to drop all their leaves. They
will likely get bugs. And they will still need to be brought into
light well before summer planting time.
</P>
<P>
   A better choice is a room that gets lots of light and is cool
enough to slow growth _ 60 to 65 degrees. If you must put hibiscus
plants in the living room, keep them in the sunniest place, away
from direct heat and far enough from the window so they don't
suffer big temperature swings from night to day. There is no point
in misting, but if you don't have a humidifier this would be a good
excuse to get one. Keep soil barely but consistently moist, and
don't feed unless flowers appear. Watch out for aphids, whiteflies
and red spider mites. If you see them, treat promptly with
insecticidal soap.
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus is tough. The plants will not be glorious inside, but
they will survive. Cut them back in late April, removing leggy
branches and working to create a pleasing shape. New growth should
start almost at once. It is tempting to set the plants out as soon
as the frost is past, but hibiscus is a heat lover that will be
happier inside until it is warm out day and night _ late May or
early June.
</P>
<P>
   Or treat hibiscus as an annual indulgence. While they are still
beautiful, give your plants to a deserving establishment with big
windows and no qualms about getting rid of ailing ornamentals.
Enjoy a carefree winter, and get new ones next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus are available from Fancy Hibiscus, 1142 S.W. First
Ave., Pompano Beach, Fla. 33060-8706; (800) 432-8332; catalog, $2,
refundable with order, and at Plumeria People, 910 Leander Dr.,
Leander, Texas 78641; (512) 259-0807; catalog, $3, refundable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Keeping Dahlias Cold &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the first time ever, I planted dahlias in my garden this
past summer. What a delight! What's the best way of storing them so
I can enjoy their profusion next year? I understand they do not
overwinter well and should be taken up.
</P>
<P>
   A. Dahlias will not winter over in places where the ground
freezes, but they are easy to store _ if you have a cold place to
keep them. Start by making labels now while you remember which
color is which. Cut off the dead foliage, leaving stubs two inches
long. Wait for a dry day, then use a digging fork to lift the
tubers. Turn the clumps upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Let them dry a few hours, then gently remove as much soil as
possible. Don't wash them off, as the last thin layer of clinging
soil will help protect them from shriveling. Line a large box with
a plastic bag; then add a four-inch layer of dry peat moss or
sawdust. Place tubers stem side up on the peat moss, keeping them
well separated. Nestle the labels into the clumps.
</P>
<P>
   Completely surround the tubers with additional peat moss, and
loosely close the bag. Store in a dark place, ideally at 35 to 45
degrees. When storage temperatures climb to the mid-50s, the tubers
start sprouting. Ignore short sprouts; they'll be buried when you
plant. Clumps that come from storage with long, pale stems,
however, should be hardened off for a week or so in the shade
before being set out in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Replanting Peonies &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When and how do I transplant my peonies. I planted them a
year ago, and they have far overgrown their location in my raised
bed garden in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no time to lose. Peonies should be planted at least
six weeks before the ground freezes. Start by choosing a new
location where they can grow undisturbed for the foreseeable
future. Peonies are long-haul plants, not at their best until they
have been in place a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off and discard the spent foliage. Carefully dig up the
roots. If they have been in place only a year, it is unlikely they
will need dividing. Be sure the new planting holes are wide _ the
understructure of peonies tends to be broad. Replant at once,
making sure the budlike eyes are no more than two inches below the
ground. After the ground is frozen at least three or four inches
down, probably after Christmas at this rate, add a layer of mulch.
Do not fertilize until spring, when a generous application of
compost will be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Peonies are available from Klehm Nursery, 4210 North Duncan Rd.,
Champaign, Ill. 61822; (800) 553-3715; catalog, $4, refundable with
order, and at New Peony Farm, P.O. Box 18235, St. Paul 55118; (612)

THEY LEFT HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT DIPLOMAS. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Agnes Chandler stopped going to high school
in 1940 because her mother couldn't afford to send her. Vickie
Hernandez quit in 1970 because she was pregnant. Boredom and a bad
attitude led Devin Williams to drop out just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to a high school dropout?
</P>
<P>
   Chandler might have been a professional dancer instead of a
cleaning lady.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez might be a psychologist or a teacher, not a grocery
store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Williams can be whatever he wants. He has gone back to school.
</P>
<P>
   Some dropouts succeed without an education, and some don't. Some
finish their degrees, some don't. But no matter what their age,
race or gender, most regret the single decision that shapes much of
their adult lives _ their jobs, their lifestyles, their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez recently passed the GED test, 28 years after she quit
school. ``Is it worth it? Yes, it's worth it,'' she said. ``The
result is an open door to better things.''
</P>
<P>
   How can school administrators teach that lesson to all the
headstrong teen-agers who drop out every year?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they can't.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it takes experience to see the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   AGNES CHANDLER
</P>
<P>
   The Diamond Hill Seniors Center is preparing for Tuesday lunch,
and there in the middle of the clamor is Agnes Chandler. At 69, she
is one of the center's most active volunteers. She is program
director and reporter and photographer for the ``Senior Sentinel''
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler retired years ago, after a lifetime of working odd
jobs: cleaning, cooking, waiting tables, baking sweet rolls,
picking cotton, working assembly lines, keeping a church nursery
and cleaning airplanes at Meacham Field in Fort Worth. The job she
wanted, she never had.
</P>
<P>
   She was a little girl growing up outside Temple in Central Texas
when she discovered her family's ancestral dance. Chandler is a
second-generation Czech who dreamed of turning her hobby into a
career.
</P>
<P>
   She was 16 and a good student _ straight-A's, she brags _ from
first through 10th grades. But in 1940, there was one high school
in her county, and it was in town.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents had divorced, and Chandler's mother raised her
alone. The bus did not run to their farm, and Chandler's mother
could not afford to put her daughter in an apartment in town. ``I
did not, did not drop out of school,'' Chandler says.
</P>
<P>
   She married at 17 and got a job. When she divorced in 1960, she
needed more money to raise the two children alone. She took her GED
test, passed it and landed a good job at General Dynamics,
assembling light fixtures for airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is retired, Chandler thinks about what might have
been. She still dances with a Czech group at festivals and fairs.
She wonders, though, if she had graduated, could she have gotten
into dance school? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler made certain her children finished school. She's
lecturing her grandchildren, too. ``I preach to my granddaughter,
`You drop out of school, I'm going to shoot you, girl. You better
keep your can in school.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't mean maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   DEVIN WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chandler, 20-year-old Devin Williams had the opportunity,
but he lacked the desire to finish school. Williams dropped out of
Southwest High School in Fort Worth in 1995, his senior year. ``It
was pretty much the kind of thing where you think you're big and
bad and you think you can take on the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   His situation is not uncommon, and it may be the hardest for
educators to fight. How do you change a bad attitude?
</P>
<P>
   Williams wanted to be in the jazz band, but his teacher demanded
he go through marching band first. Williams said no. Frustrated
with other teachers, he failed algebra, English and geometry.
</P>
<P>
   His parents balked when he brought up the subject of dropping
out. They agreed, eventually, after he agreed to finish his
education. Williams passed the GED test and went to work full time,
cashiering at a barbecue joint, making $5.25 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking out was a relief, and in other ways, you know you're
missing out on something every teen-ager takes part in: no prom, no
homecoming. While I was there, I tried to have as little to do with
it as possible, and in some ways, I don't regret it as much as some
people do. It did slow my educational process. I'm now a part of
real life. I can't have a summer job. I've got to pay my bills and
show up for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has settled down in the past two years. He married his
high school sweetheart (she stayed in school and graduated). He
works full time as a butcher. (''The money's not bad, but I'd
rather have the time off.'') He's taking courses at Tarrant County
Junior College and thinking about going into teaching. ``It's more
or less trying to make a difference _ kind of civil disobedience
strikes back,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   VICKIE HERNANDEZ
</P>
<P>
   The year Vickie Hernandez turned 16, she was pregnant. A doctor
wrote a pass that allowed her to finish the 10th grade at O.D.
Wyatt High School in Fort Worth. ``The thing you did back then was
you get married and take care of your children.'' So she did, as
soon as she finished the 10th grade. That was in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 years, Hernandez did without a diploma. She lied on job
applications, and no one checked. She sold jewelry at Dillard's
until January, when the department store phased out fine jewelry,
and Hernandez was laid off.
</P>
<P>
   This time while job-hunting, Hernandez told the truth. She
looked for other jobs, and, ``They were like, we don't hire
dropouts. We don't hire people unless they're in school or they
have a GED.''
</P>
<P>
   From March through July, Hernandez, 44, sat in a Tarrant County
Junior College classroom, studying for her GED test. After so many
years of telling her two daughters no _ there's no money for
basketball camp, there's no money for a computer, there's no money
for ballet lessons _ Hernandez decided no more living without an
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say I regret everything, because I'm grateful for my
family. But at school, there's nothing like sitting in that
classroom, and that's what I stress to my girls. I wanted my
children to be the opposite of what I was. Life is as rich as you
want it to be, and knowledge is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez passed the GED. She's living with her sister now,
saving her money from the grocery store where she works, and trying
to find a program to help pay for college tuition. A social worker
told her $21,000 annual salary is too much to get government help.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, she has her GED, and for someone who worked two jobs
on the weekend after two jobs during the week, that piece of paper
is as good as a high school diploma. For the first time in years,
she is dreaming again like a teen-ager: What will she be? A
psychologist? A teacher?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that, next to my children being born, that's one of
the greatest accomplishments of my life. Something you want so bad,
and you're almost convinced you can't have it _ just to hold that
paper, I felt as though I had walked across that stage in front of
millions of people. When I saw that, it was like something stirred
in me I didn't know was there. God, I just want to learn more.''

THANKSGIVING IS THE TIME TO BUILD A BETTER BIRD _ A TURDUCKEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the cool, fall breezes in the air, you just have to ask
yourself, ``How am I fixed for turduckens?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is just about a month away, give or take a week,
and if you plan on doing your own turducken, it's time to start.
Actually, if you are doing one for the first time, you might
already be late.
</P>
<P>
   A turducken, for those of you who are staring blankly at this
space, is a chicken stuffed inside a duck, stuffed inside a turkey.
It is the latest rage from ragin' Cajuns, and it is the
Thanksgiving dish that will make obsolete all those portable gas
burners used to fry whole turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turduckens have been real popular back in Louisiana for, I'd
say, the last four years,'' said Kent Vincent of Bayou Boys Cajun
Foods in Lewisville, Texas. ``Believe me, they'll take the place of
the world-famous fried turkeys. The turduckens are better.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent claims the problem with fried turkeys is that you need
to be there when the bird is lifted from the hot grease. It is
then, he says, when the turkey has cooled just enough to eat, that
it is at its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places fry them, then freeze them,'' he said. ``Then
they ship them out to customers. When you get one, you have to
rewarm it in your oven, and it ends up tasting just like baked
turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Turduckens are baked, but the mixture of meats and spicy
dressings lifts the taste beyond the normal
giblets-and-gravy-covered white meat.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know who came up with this idea, though it
was someone who had a lot of time on his or her hands. A turducken
is completely boned _ turkey, duck and chicken. When you slice
across it, it comes out looking like a jelly roll of meat and
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun food guru Paul Prudhomme didn't invent them, we know that,
but he has a recipe for one. It includes andouille dressing for the
turkey, corn-bread dressing for the duck, and oyster dressing for
the chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Add the time for making all this dressing to that of boning each
bird, and you can see why we might already be late for this year's
Thanksgiving. It's interesting just to look at the necessary tools.
Prudhomme's recipes call for ``1 small hammer, 1 (3-inch) needle (a
packing needle with a curved tip works well), and strong thread for
sewing up the fowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to swing by the hardware store on the way home from the
butcher.
</P>
<P>
   At Bayou Boys, the turduckens are available with rice dressing.
Last year, the company offered them with several different
stuffings, but the overwhelming favorite was the dirty-rice
dressing made with rice, ground beef, ground pork and spices.
</P>
<P>
   For those who fear dirty rice that traditionally has liver in
it, don't worry, the Bayou Boys omit it.
</P>
<P>
   There is another concession they make as well. They don't use
whole duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of domestic duck we have to use has a lot of fat
between the skin and meat,'' Vincent said. ``That was making the
turduckens a little too greasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the best part of the duck is the breasts, so Vincent
and his partners are now using just the breasts. They stuff the
boned turkey with rice dressing, lay two duck breasts on top of the
dressing, pack them with more dressing, place the chicken in, stuff
it, and sew the whole thing up.
</P>
<P>
   It takes these guys, who are turning out 50 to 60 a week, about
25 minutes to bone the birds and stuff them. That's generally about
90 days faster than average.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy one from Bayou Boys, it will run you $65. The
turducken will weigh in at around 13 to 14 pounds, and Vincent
figures a serving is about a pound a person.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cheaper version. You can buy a turken (no duck) for
$55. It weighs about 12 pounds and will serve 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Bayou Boys is cranking them out. Vincent says folks
are buying them right now, not for Thanksgiving, but for Sunday
afternoon football parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do them in advance and freeze them,'' he said. ``But we are
having trouble keeping up. If people want one, they need to give us
at least four or five days' notice, and they can't wait until we
get too close to the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The turduckens come frozen in a vacuum-sealed bag. Generally, it
takes about five hours to cook one after it has been defrosted _
four hours in a 350-degree oven covered, then one hour uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call Bayou Boys at (972) 434-0353. To do one yourself,
you can find several recipes on the World Wide Web. Just search for
``turducken.''

DISCONNECT THE DOTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The path from technological miracle to public nuisance is often
a direct one. Witness the descent of the laser, the pure, steady
light that can cut diamonds or could, in theory, carry all the
world's electronic information simultaneously on a single beam.
</P>
<P>
   The laser has found its lowest-common-denominator use in the
form of the pointer, the favorite tool of deadly dull meeting
presenters. More recently, these devices, some of which can project
little red dots 800 yards or more, have become the newest
playthings of mischievous teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   So routine have sightings of laser dots become on, for example,
movie-theater screens, that a friend in San Francisco has a term
for the phenomenon. She calls it ``high-tech graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of dotting incidents began to proliferate early this
year, after Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers of the devices
dropped their prices, and models that retailed for $10 or less
flooded the American market. Dotting is regarded by the police as a
threatening act because many guns use a laser-pointing device for
aiming. A red dot could conceivably be followed by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-August, the New York City police had reported nearly 100
incidents of officers being dotted. A sideshow juggler in Virginia
Beach, Va., and a roller-coaster operator at Hershey Park in
Hershey, Pa., have also been victims of laser harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The fad is not just for teen-agers. The Skymall catalog stuffed
in the seat pockets of 17 major airlines has, since January,
featured a two-page spread of laser pointers: ``Don't make a
presentation without the Ultimate Presentation Power Tool.'' Some,
like the $69.99 Infiniter 800, an ``ergonomically designed''
silvery-metal pod ``as beautiful as it is unusual,'' are clearly
intended for a sophisticated clientele.
</P>
<P>
   While laser pointers are a familiar sight at meetings and
conferences, none of the corporate consultants with whom I spoke,
all of whom constantly make or attend business presentations, say
they would ever think of using one. Indeed, there appears to be a
stigma attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never used a laser pointer in one of my
presentations,'' said Watts Wacker, a Westport, Conn., futurist
whose children gave him one for Father's Day. ``When someone does
use one, I tend to brace myself for an overwhelmingly boring and
hard-to-follow presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Keeley, the president of the Doblin Group, a Chicago-based
firm that dispenses advice on design strategy, concurs. ``An
interesting and odd little medium, isn't it,'' he observed. ``I
pretty much hate them. No one can hold them steadily, so they don't
quiver. They enhance the sense that the world is a frenetic
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeley, however, remembers attending a conference on
medical-communications technology in May where one of the speakers,
a representative from Boston Scientific, handed out laser pointers
to the audience. Attendees began projecting dots and symbols onto
the stage and the speakers, leading to an unsuccessful attempt by
the conference moderator to banish the devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone went juvenile,'' confirmed David Sume, one of the
conference organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Wacker has also gone juvenile with his pointer. He confesses to
dotting flight attendants as they demonstrate the oxygen mask.
``Perhaps the only time I have seen road warriors pay attention to
a safety demonstration on an airplane,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured in Asia, most laser pointers are designed there as
well. One of the rare laser-pointer designers working in America is
Juergen Coste, an engineer, and the president of Alpec, in
Livermore, Calif. Among the dozens of models Alpec sells is one
shaped like a 50-caliber bullet. It comes in a gift case and can be
inscribed with slogans like ``Make My Day'' or ``Hasta la Vista,
Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Coste denounces the practices of his competitors, whom he
accuses of shoddy workmanship, selling cheap pointers with
regulators that may not keep the power of the laser in check. The
more powerful the beam, the greater its capacity to blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not scary?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The scariest story Coste tells, however, is not about lasers
that can blind, but about a special order his company recently did
for Coca-Cola _ a pointer that projects no mere dot but a Coke
bottle and a Coke logo. In other words, advertising.
</P>
<P>
   While executives who use laser pointers are stigmatized as
nerds, and teen-agers who point them at police officers can be
arrested, the advertising industry is waking up to the potential of
these devices. If you think getting dotted is disturbing, just wait
until you've been logoed.

MORE PATIENT NET ACCESS ENCOURAGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Afraid and confused, the elderly woman
walked into the Fort Worth library seeking information about a
recently diagnosed disease.
</P>
<P>
   She had just left her doctor, who told her she had neuropathy
and sent her to a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Malone, senior librarian and Internet guru at the central
library, said she remembers the relief on the woman's face when her
research found treatments for the condition, which affects nerves
in the feet and other extremities.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge came courtesy of the information superhighway,
technology that is changing the way that the newly diagnosed,
chronically worried or sporadically curious learn about medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, public access must be expanded significantly to reach
Americans who cannot afford computers at home, according to a
special issue on computers and medicine published in this week's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many people out there just surfing for information, we
have to do a better job ensuring that the information that's
provided is accurate and up-to-date,'' said Dr. John Licciardone,
medical director of the International Travel Medicine Clinic at the
University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   For 14-year-old high school freshman Michelle Waters, the
Internet provides an escape into a world outside the hospital.
Between breathing treatments at Cook Children's Medical Center in
Fort Worth, Waters signs onto a computer and visits with other
children with cystic fibrosis from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about what medicines we take,'' said Waters, who was
being treated last week to clear mucus from her lungs. ``It's
interesting to know what they take and how often they come to the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA issue, which includes nearly a dozen studies, reviews
and editorials on Internet-related subjects, also discusses ways
that doctors can expand patient dialogue via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Whether physicians should use the Internet to communicate with
patients is a sticky issue, Licciardone said.
</P>
<P>
   Licciardone's travel medicine Web site fielded 26,129 hits last
year from at least 105 countries, according to statistics. But the
site, he said, no longer includes a section for general questions
and answers because the queries were getting too specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to provide more than the most
general information without sitting down and talking to the
person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, the
division of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition offered free
e-mail consultations for nearly three years. In all, 1,239 requests
were fielded.
</P>
<P>
   On average, physicians needed less than four minutes to answer
each patient e-mail, said Dr. Stephen Borowitz, a pediatrics
professor in Virginia and lead author of a related JAMA study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I'm doing in a lot of circumstances is answering
those questions that the physician did answer, but the patient
didn't hear,'' Borowitz said. ``Even though you may be in the room
with them for an hour, they don't process all that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Uninsured Americans are doubly penalized if they are locked out
of the information exchange, said Thomas Eng, a study director at
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``... They don't have the information that can be used to
prevent the need for the health care in the first place,'' said
Eng, who wrote a related public policy analysis in the medical
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, Eng said, public access to the Internet must be
expanded significantly to include shopping centers, post offices
and other community locations.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and her fellow librarians caution eager Internet users to
check the source as they dig for answers.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, they recall, wanted to know whether her husband's
prostate cancer medication would inhibit his ability to work.
Another was trying to learn more about a herbal alternative to
estrogen replacement therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the things that I've read on the Internet are much
more written in layman's language than some of the medical books we
get,'' Malone said.

 By SUSAN J. WELLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wondering why you didn't get a job offer after that last
interview?
</P>
<P>
   So did Bronti Kelly, a retail salesman and former military
reservist from Temecula, Calif., who couldn't figure out why he was
repeatedly turned down in the early 1990s for dozens of sales
positions at department stores _ or dismissed within a week if he
did manage to secure a job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after more than four years, Kelly, now 34, finally
discovered the problem: He had been denied employment because of an
erroneous shoplifting report circulated to retailers who did
background checks on him when he applied for work.
</P>
<P>
   The report had been forwarded by one of the stores to which he
had applied _ Robinsons-May _ through its parent company, the May
Department Stores, to the Stores Protective Association, a
nonprofit group in Simi Valley, Calif., that provides background
screening, work histories and loss-prevention programs to about 100
retail chains, manufacturers and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association, founded in 1929, share information
about employees. The group is a regional affiliate of the United
States Mutual Association, an 80-year-old private clearinghouse in
Chicago that pools theft case reports from its 10 member groups
nationwide _ it currently has about two million such reports _ and
operates much like a major credit bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says he was the victim of identity theft. After his wallet
was stolen, he said, a shoplifter who was arrested used Kelly's
name and identification; the Los Angeles County Police Department
corroborated his account. When he was unable to get work, he ended
up filing for bankruptcy and became homeless for a time.
</P>
<P>
   After he found out about the shoplifting report, Kelly sued May
and the Stores Protective Association in 1995, complaining that May
had failed to correct the report in the association's files even
after he had discovered it and provided proof of his innocence. The
association was found not liable, and May settled out of court in
January, paying Kelly $73,680.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me my life, really,'' said Kelly, who has since
legally changed his name and Social Security number. ``I never knew
why I wasn't being hired. That's the insidious nature of this _
there's often no way to know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda West, a spokeswoman for the May Department Stores in St.
Louis, said, ``We regret the difficulties this created for Kelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's story points to a growing conflict between the rights of
employers and employees in an age of quick, easy and inexpensive
computer access to public information: how to balance a company's
need to know about a person it might hire with the individual's
need for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of federal regulators and private
businesses, workers can be plagued by black marks mistakenly left
on public records if they do not pursue their right to discover and
correct errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, you had to hire a gumshoe to find out about a
person's background,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit advocacy organization in San
Diego. ``Now you don't have to go any farther than your desk _ what
you can find out today for typically under $100 is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   More public records have been placed on the Internet in recent
years as information brokers have linked with public agencies,
governments and businesses for computer access that enables them to
compile virtual dossiers on anyone, including data like Social
Security numbers, property ownership, driving records and nearest
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The services available range from large, blue-chip investigation
companies to upstart Web sites that offer data at bargain rates.
Checks can be done in days or minutes, usually for a cost of $5 to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Since many employers do not disclose what sort of background
checks they use, it is hard to know exactly how they conduct them.
But one thing is sure: The scrutiny of job applicants has
intensified in recent years, as incidents of workplace violence,
and the number of lawsuits charging employers with negligence in
hiring, have increased, employment experts say. And that has meant
a boom for the companies _ especially Web-based services _ that do
such searches.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, of course, has spawned an increase in the number of
databases containing background information and has made such
information available faster. Some of the services available are
www.knowx.com, which uses the Information America database;
www.informus.com, which primarily conducts direct public-records
searches for 1,000 businesses and employers; Advanced Research Inc.
(www.advsearch.com), which offers many checking services on a
contingency basis (no hits, no charge), and www.digdirt.com, which
says it has access to 325 billion records.
</P>
<P>
   Peoplewise, a 10-month-old privately held company
(www.people-wise.com) in Hollister, Calif., has developed what it
says is technology that allows the first real-time background
checks. Employers can get information within seconds, even during
an applicant's interview, said Gary Cornick, president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-employment screening must be fast, Cornick said. ``In this
labor market, you have to act quickly or you'll lose applicants to
competitors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But job applicants do have rights, especially under amendments
to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that took effect on Sept. 30,
1997, extending the protection of the rules governing credit
reports to job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The changes give consumers more protection by requiring an
employer to get applicants' permission before getting credit
reports or other background checks on them. And if job applicants
are turned down because of credit reports, the employer must tell
the applicants about that as well as their right to free copies of
the reports. The changes in the law also make it easier for job
applicants to correct any errors found.
</P>
<P>
   More employers are doing background checks on job applicants
because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the
actions of employees, but also of former employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal requirements have increased the use of background checks
by businesses,'' said Garry G. Mathiason, a senior partner with
Littler, Mendelson, Fastiff, Tichy &AMP; Mathiason, an employment and
labor law firm in San Francisco. ``There are enough horror stories
out there about criminal liability that employers feel it's become
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Florida Circuit Court in 1995 found the Allstate Insurance Co.
liable for failing to disclose the violent history of an employee
it had dismissed. The Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. subsequently
hired him, based on Allstate's recommendation, and he killed three
co-workers there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in Oakley vs. Flor-Shin Inc., the Kentucky
Court of Appeals ruled that an employer could be held liable for an
attack by an employee against a third party. In the case, a Kmart
employee was accused of rape by an employee of Flor-Shin, the
company the retailer had hired to clean floors. The victim sued
Flor-Shin, saying it had known that the worker had a criminal
history.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three states now require criminal background checks for
workers in positions like health care, child care, schools and
housekeeping. But few use Federal Bureau of Investigation records
to check potential employees, so workers with criminal convictions
can secure new jobs by simply crossing state lines, says a federal
report issued Sept. 14 by the federal Health and Human Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which focused chiefly on nursing-home practices,
calls for a national registry of workers with criminal backgrounds
that would be accessible to employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Background checks today are more critical than ever before,''
said Lynda Lucas, president and chief financial officer of the
Stores Protective Association. ``In a society where the term `going
postal' is routinely coined, I think if you asked most employees,
they would want to be assured that the person working next to them
wasn't a dangerous criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 300,000 screenings conducted by the association
each year, fewer than 2 percent return ``hits'' _ findings that
flag the applications as needing further checking _ and 1 percent
of the hits turn up applicants with reports on file of criminal
offenses, Ms. Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a day and age where it's hard to find qualified employees,
you really don't want to turn people away if there's not a real
good reason for doing so,'' said Barry Lawrence, a spokesman for
the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But checking applicants' records is quickly becoming routine for
many companies. In a 1995 Society for Human Resource Management
survey of 1,331 human-resource professionals, 92 percent said they
spoke to former employers before hiring new employees, 78 percent
called references provided by candidates, 61 percent verified
educational backgrounds, 42 percent checked driving records, and 25
percent conducted credit checks.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 survey of 589 members of the American Management
Association in New York found that 70 percent conducted background
checks on applicants and 48 percent searched criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Employers do background checks in various ways _ using the
telephone, fax or Internet, for example. But Alan F. Westin, a
professor emeritus of public law and government at Columbia
University and publisher of the Privacy and American Business
newsletter, said: ``I don't believe there's any documented place to
find out for sure who's relying on the Internet sources and who's
not. No one tracks it.''
</P>
<P>
   When employers check applicants' resumes, they find that quite a
few are lying. About one-third of all resumes have inaccuracies,
and 10 percent of those are serious enough to deny employment,
estimated Edward C. Andler, owner and president of the Certified
Reference Checking Co. in St. Louis, who has provided reference and
resume checking for employers since 1987.

   ``Over the years, the incidence of resume distortion has
continued to creep up,'' said Andler, who is the author of ``The
Complete Reference Checking Handbook'' (Amacom, 1998). ``People are
more willing to lie and stretch the truth.'' Andler estimated that
one of every 12 applicants _ even those who are seeking
executive-level positions _ will claim to have college degrees they
do not have.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers have adopted a policy of giving only basic
employment information when asked for references on former
employees because they fear lawsuits. Lawrence said, ``Employers
are frustrated because they can't always get the specific
information they need to make a hiring decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said background checks were most likely to hurt
applicants' chances unfairly when employers conducted hasty checks
using sources that were not reliable, many of them inexpensive
checking services offered on the Internet. ``No one is tracking
what the employer's checking on these Net services,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Small companies may turn to unreliable pre-employment checking
services because they may not know about reputable services or may
consider them too expensive, some experts say. ``This is not the
way the IBMs of the world check up on people,'' Westin said. ``But
it tends to be the impression many employees have. The most
potential for problems will be with smaller employers, not the big
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If a check turns up questionable online information, employment
lawyers say, it should be corroborated by other sources, like
public records. Mathiason cautioned, ``Electronic information can
be wrong and to rely upon it blindly is unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups concerned with privacy rights say mistakes in reporting
personal data happen routinely. But while Kelly had a hard time
countering erroneous information that came up in background checks
in the early 1990s, people applying for jobs can easily find out
now if inaccurate negative information is keeping them from
employment, and they can take steps to correct any errors.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Haines, 27, a resident of Mission Viejo, Calif., found
herself doing just that. She applied in May for a sales job with
Good Guys, an electronics retailer in Brisbane, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She did not get the job because of the results of a criminal
records check in California conducted by the Amherst Group on
behalf of Good Guys, she said. The check turned up arrest records
for criminal prostitution and drug possession, but those records
were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so ridiculous, it was laughable,'' she said. ``But it
was no joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The police record, Ms. Haines discovered, belonged to a person
with the same name. She was given a copy of the report, as required
by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so she disputed the errors, which
were corrected. She said she was now eligible to reapply to Good
Guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't know that they have the right to request the
details of their own report and the ability to dispute it,'' Ms.
Haines said, ``they'll never know why they didn't get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern over such mistakes in employment records has spawned
a cottage industry of do-your-own-search services that, for a fee,
will scout out the data available about you from public records and
references. Documented Reference Check, for example, at
www.badreferences.com, advertises that it will call an applicant's
previous employer, asking for a reference as if the applicant had
applied for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses one of several corporate names when making such
inquiries. It sends the former employee a confidential report,
generally for a fee of $87.95. If negative comments are discovered,
(justified or not, it says) the company offers to ask the former
employer in a letter to stop passing on bad references to
prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   When errors in records are found, said Deirdre Mulligan, a staff
counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington,
``the only way to correct records is to go back to the original
source of the information.'' At times, she said, that can be a
lengthy process.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the problem that background checks sometimes turn up
inaccurate information, employers have to try to balance their need
to screen job applicants with the rights of prospective employees.
The problems have increased with the growth of online
background-checking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy solution,'' said Norman G. Magnuson, vice
president of public affairs for Associated Credit Bureaus, a
642-member trade association in Washington whose members generate
650 million credit reports a year, speaking about the growing
reliance on electronic databases. ``We're trying to integrate a new
delivery method for information, but maybe we're just not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of the Society for Human Resource Management, said:
``Employers can have all that data and still not take away a sense
of how a person will perform in the job.''

   The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and other employee advocates
advise job seekers to do the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Order a copy of your credit report from the three major credit
bureaus: Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian (www.experian.com) and
the Trans Union Corp. (www.tuc.com). If you find information that
you think is incorrect, notify the creditor or credit bureau and
get the issue resolved.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check public records. Go to the county or city courthouse and
inspect files for accuracy, especially if you have an arrest record
or have been involved in legal cases. Request a copy of your
driving record from your state, especially if you are applying for
a job that requires driving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask to see a copy of your personnel file from your old job.
You generally have a right to see your file for at least a year
after leaving a job. Ask your former employer if it has a policy on
the release of personnel records; many companies limit such
disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read the fine print on a job application because you may also
be signing a statement that waives your right to a copy of your
credit report or authorizes the disclosure of other personal data.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell neighbors and colleagues, past and present, that they
might be asked to provide information about you, particularly if
you will be applying for sensitive or high-level positions. That
may help alert you to any problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider asking the interviewer about the company's privacy
policies. Find out if the potential employer plans a background
check and try to determine how the check will be conducted. See if
the employer routinely double-checks negative reports before making
decisions, especially if some or all of the information is found
through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Is it prudent for employees to ask these things? ``Absolutely,''
said Alan F. Westin, publisher of the Privacy and American Business
newsletter. But will such questions tempt an employer to drop a
person's resume in the round file? ``Could be,'' he said.

   Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, employers who screen job
applicants must do the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ An applicant must be told in writing that a credit or
investigative report will be done.
</P>
<P>
   _ An employer needs to get an applicant's signature on a
document granting permission to get background information for
legitimate business and employment purposes only.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before an employer can deny an applicant a job based on a
background check, the applicant must be given a copy of the report
and a two-page report called Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, written by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ Applicants must be told about their right to ask the
prospective employer to describe the scope of any background
investigation. If the employer bases its hiring decision at least
in part on information in a consumer report, the employer must give
the employee the name, address and telephone number of the agency
that furnished the report.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been arrested in London and faces extradition for
crimes against humanity is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can
be held to account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa earlier this month. Nor is it surprising that
Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar commented that ``the best
outcome would be if the government doesn't even have to decide,'' a
reference to the fact that the Spanish judiciary still has to rule
on whether to advance the extradition request.
 &HT;    The implications involve all the jumble of issues provoked by
the collision of demands for pure justice and the demands of
politics, the demands of peace, the demands of reconciliation.
Further, the new emphasis on the international right to judge
certain crimes complicates the question of who is to judge whether
circumstance or unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who
led it, will have some profound guidelines to offer from the moral
insights the experience has provided.
 &HT;    Many countries, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, ex-communist
countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile, have sought to
transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by trying to
tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is their
choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed were
crimes against humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who asked to question
Pinochet as a step toward extradition had been working on testimony
collected by victims for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption cases and the tracks of the ``dirty war'' by
police against Basque terrorists during the previous Socialist
government, to its great discomfiture.
 &HT;    His document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91 people
kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
prescribing genocide, war crimes, torture. There may be some
question about the jurisdiction of a Spanish court (or of a British
court since it has been suggested Britain could hold the trial
instead of granting extradition.)
 &HT;    But there is no question about the straightforward legal
sincerity of Garzon or that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day they will get their due.
 &HT;    The new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. This is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise, one
of the reasons I don't think it's a good treaty.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict, a
better chance of peaceful life. When, as was the case at Nuremberg
after World War II, it is possible to achieve all at once, so much
the better.
 &HT;    But the best in moral terms must not destroy the chances of
improving how people live.

 &HT;    VISA BILL TO FUND NEW JOB TRAINING, SCHOLARSHIPS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New visa legislation approved Wednesday by Congress
as part of the massive omnibus spending bill will generate about
$71 million for job-training programs and scholarships for U.S.
workers and students.
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B visa measure, sought by the high-tech community, boosts
the number of visas for highly skilled foreign workers from 65,000
to 115,000 next year. Employers argued that a tight labor market
has left them strapped for trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   One way Americans will benefit is from the higher $500 fee
employers must pay for each visa they apply for and renew.
</P>
<P>
   The bill dictates that the Labor Department receive 63 percent
of the fee revenue _ about $47.25 million _ to be filtered through
dozens of existing job-training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Workers or unemployed people can participate in the programs by
applying for an Individual Training Account grant, said Jake
Siewert, communications director for the National Economic Council
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Training account grants give workers money to apply to a program
of their choosing. Those interested can get information on
available programs through their employer or at one of the more
than 800 One-Stop Career Centers that have been established in
nearly every state to provide employment information.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation will receive 32 percent of the
fees _ about $24 million _ to establish a new scholarship fund for
low-income students studying mathematics, engineering or computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   Associate, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to
apply once the foundation sets up the program, which is not
expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
   David Stonner(cq), head of congressional affairs for the
foundation, said it faces numerous challenges in assuming a new
role as scholarship provider.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now awards 10,000 new grants and fellowships each
year, but has no scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   One problem will be with staffing, Stonner said. The bill did
not allocate any money for additional staff, although a deluge of
applications will have to be processed for the expected 10,000 new
scholarships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stonner said one solution may be to enter a cooperative
agreement with a university or scholarship fund that already
administers scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Other challenges will be in setting up criteria for who will
receive the scholarships and deciding how that money will be
divided among associate, undergraduate and graduate students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have within Congress a reputation of doing things well and
rising to challenges,'' Stonner said. ``This is going to be a real
challenge, because the parameters have yet to be written and the
fact that it is open to a variety of educational experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent of the fee revenue from the visas will
be used by the Labor Department to speed up processing of the new
visas and other program expenses.

<P>
   Associate, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to
apply once the foundation sets up the program, which is not
expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
   David Stonner(cq), head of congressional affairs for the
foundation, said it faces numerous challenges in assuming a new
role as scholarship provider.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now awards 10,000 new grants and fellowships each
year, but has no scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   One problem will be with staffing, Stonner said. The bill did
not allocate any money for additional staff, although a deluge of
applications will have to be processed for the expected 10,000 new
scholarships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stonner said one solution may be to enter a cooperative
agreement with a university or scholarship fund that already
administers scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Other challenges will be in setting up criteria for who will
receive the scholarships and deciding how that money will be
divided among associate, undergraduate and graduate students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have within Congress a reputation of doing things well and
rising to challenges,'' Stonner said. ``This is going to be a real
challenge, because the parameters have yet to be written and the
fact that it is open to a variety of educational experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent of the fee revenue from the visas will
be used by the Labor Department to speed up processing of the new
visas and other program expenses.

WITH BROADWAY POLISH, CONFIDENT LINDA EDER SPARKLES IN CONCERT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Linda Eder made a triumphant homecoming Monday night
with a vibrant and enthusiastically received concert at the Aerial
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   You could call Houston Eder's artistic home, since she made her
stage debut with the Alley Theater's world premiere of ``Jekyll &AMP;
Hyde'' in 1990. She returned for two engagements on that show's
long road to Broadway and performed three solo concerts at the
Alley, attracting a large and avid Houston following with her
stunning looks and sensational voice.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's been in the ensemble cast of the Alley's new
``The Civil War'' since September, Monday's concert marked Eder's
return as a diva with the sort of showcase supplied by her ``J&AMP;H''
role and past concerts. After a year and a half on Broadway, Eder
is a more confident, polished and nuanced entertainer. Since she is
now widely regarded as a major find, Houston and the Alley can take
justifiable pride in having found her first. (The evening was a
benefit for the Alley.)
</P>
<P>
   Attired in a trim black pantsuit for her concert's first half
and a sexy but classically simple black gown for the second, Eder
looked and sounded like a million bucks. Her vocal dynamism was as
impressive as ever, her big voice charged with feeling and
displaying the range to go from powerful belting to a pure soprano
for the gentler ballads.
</P>
<P>
   A key to this equation is that ``J&AMP;H'' and ``Civil War''
composer Frank Wildhorn, who is married to Eder and writes all her
original material, is supplying her with more varied and nuanced
material that plays to her strengths. In songwriting partner Jack
Murphy he has found his sharpest lyricist yet, giving Eder more to
work with, especially in a comic vein.
</P>
<P>
   The concert emphasized numbers from Eder's latest album, ``It's
Time.'' Besides the anthemic ballads that we know Wildhorn can
write and Eder can deliver with a knockout punch, the disc provides
an array of attractively bright big band-style numbers suggesting
1990s equivalents of standards by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart
or Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen, with a Nelson Riddle touch in
their brassy arrangements. Led from the piano by music director
Jeremy Roberts, Eder's eight-person band was tight and vivid,
though the Aerial Theater's amplification was unnecessarily
aggressive for most of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   When she eased confidently into the relaxed lilt of ``It's
Time,'' the title song confirmed not only its lyrics' ``time for
romance'' message but also Eder's arrival as a major stylist. She
gave vocal sparkle to the wry humor of ``Don't Ask Me Why,'' a
luckless girl's lament. Among the other new Wildhorn-Murphy tunes,
she made a feminist anthem of the punchy ``I Want More'' and
infused the show-bizzy ``Big Time'' with propulsive drive.
</P>
<P>
   When not singing Wildhorn originals, Eder chooses to perform
standards, even those indelibly associated with famed singers. This
is risky, but Eder has both the chutzpah and the pipes to pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
   She opened with an affectionate ``My Kind of Town,'' the
Cahn-Van Heusen tune forever linked with Frank Sinatra, and in
time-honored tradition changed the ``Chicago is'' line to ``Houston
is.'' She segued into a rousing ``Don't Rain on My Parade'' (from
Jule Styne and Bob Merrill's ``Funny Girl''), meeting the frequent
Streisand comparisons head-on by using the original arrangement and
even emulating Streisand's vocal inflections. The likeness was
almost alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In tribute to an entertainer she has credited as an enormous
influence on her, Eder sang two of Judy Garland's signature songs,
both by composer Harold Arlen. Eder's ``The Man That Got Away'' was
haunting, in an eerie arrangement that began softly and built to
despairing fury to match Ira Gershwin's torchy lyrics. She made
``Over the Rainbow'' her own with a loving, painstaking and
delicate rendition that caught the wistful yearning of E.Y.
Harburg's lyrics. Both songs raised goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to two of the finest contemporary theater composers,
Eder did an intently focused ``Losing My Mind'' (from Stephen
Sondheim's ``Follies''), then soared through the wise and
wide-ranging passion of ``Unusual Way'' (from Maury Yeston's
``Nine'').
</P>
<P>
   Eder's biggest gamble was her fiery rendition of the heroic
title song from Mitch Leigh and Joe Darion's ``Man of La Mancha.''
While she may not be as persuasive a Don Quixote as Richard Kiley,
he never looked so glamorous; hers was a disorienting but
theatrical rendition.
</P>
<P>
   Eder pleased the audience with two of her ``J&AMP;H'' favorites, the
mega-ballad ``Someone Like You,'' which still tugs the heartstrings
when she sings it, and her risqu tavern show-stopper ``Bring on the
Men'' (which, as she pointed out, was cut, perhaps unwisely, before
the show reached Broadway). Eder anticipated the next big Wildhorn
project with two promising excerpts from the upcoming ``Havana'':
the lovely ballad ``Why Do People Fall in Love?'' and the rousing
and ambitious title number.
</P>
<P>
   For encores, Eder turned inspirational with her touching
treatment of Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over Troubled Water''
and closed with the Wildhorn pop anthem ``Something to Believe
In,'' ably backed by a vocal group of her ``Civil War'' colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that her audience believes in Eder. Given the
talent on display, a nonbeliever would be hard to find. &QL;

TURNOUT COULD BE THE KEY IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S RACE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Henry Adams never walked a precinct nor took a
poll, but he understood voter turnout. The scion of presidents grew
up in pre-Civil War Massachusetts amid Federalist frenzy, Whig
anger, and the stirrings of the Know-Nothing Party. In ``The
Education of Henry Adams,'' he wrote: ``Politics, as a practice,
whatever its professions, has always been the systematic
organization of hatreds.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, hatred still motivates. Millions of Republicans,
prescandal or postscandal, despise President Clinton. Millions of
Democrats hate his court-appointed pursuer, Kenneth Starr. On Nov.
3, one group or the other will organize more systematically at the
polls. Seldom has the role of a president in off-year elections
seemed so murky, but that doesn't stop partisans in the nation's
largest state from guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton stuff seems like eons ago,'' says Paul Maslin,
pollster for Gray Davis, the Democratic lieutenant governor, who is
ahead of Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren in the contest for
governor. ``In a normal turnout in California in an off year
election, a 2 or 3 percentage point bias favors Republicans. The
electorate is always a little bit older, more conservative, and a
little whiter. We expect a Latino uptick in the first real surge of
that vote. A low turnout? I just don't see it. Of the registered
voters, I'd say it will be a 60 percent turnout, in that range.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Schroeder, chairman of the Republican State Committee,
looks at the turnout tea leaves differently: ``If it comes in at 51
percent, as I think it will right now, Dan Lungren's governor, and
we have a Democratic Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP conducts tracking polls, asking 230 Californians
daily for whom and whether they will vote. ``In the last 45 days,
Democratic turnout has dropped 16 points. Our base doesn't appear
to be more motivated, but theirs has declined, according to
absentee ballot requests,'' Schroeder says, pointing to the high
motivation factor (of hatred) in the US Senate race between
Democratic incumbent Barbara Boxer and Republican Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fong-Boxer race drives our base but doesn't drive
theirs,'' he says, pointing to a Clinton connection: ``The reason
it's down overall on one side is that Clinton's numbers'' in terms
of voter favorability ``went from 63-30 to 57-38 percent over that
same 45 days. That's in the Field poll, and it correlates to what
we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Merv Field began his career in polling, California had 2.7
million voters. This year, more than 15 million voters are
registered, but Field warns of ``deadwood'' in the rolls because
some 35 percent of Californians move every year. The Field poll
separates ``likely voters'' from no-shows by asking whether they've
voted in the past several elections and how certain they are to
vote this time.
</P>
<P>
   Field is not as confident as some national pollsters about
turnout patterns. John Zogby was quoted as saying ``Right now,
there is no evidence of a re-energized Democratic voter,'' echoing
the comments of Lydia Saad, the Gallup Poll's managing editor.
``Democratic interest in the election surged over the last two
weeks, where Republican interest stayed the same,'' she said,
adding that ``Republican voters are now showing more partisan
loyalty than Democrats, with party support rates very similar to
1994,'' when Republicans captured Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the level of turnout, but the character of
turnout,'' Field argues. ``Republicans, as well as Democrats, might
say, `A plague on both your houses,''' Mercutio's dying words in
``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical patterns suggest that plagues do not divide evenly.
If discouraged Democrats stay home and turnout dips even slightly,
it could be but a scratch to Clinton, who may eventually evoke
Mercutio's farewell: ``'Tis not so deep as a well, nor as wide as a
church door, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and
you shall find me a grave man.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was mom to mom: an actress with a 16-week-old baby, a
reporter with a toddler. Is the baby sleeping well? How's she
eating?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get caught up in the cliches of being a mother,''
snapped Sandra Bernhard, in bare feet, a B-movie A-line skirt and
not an ounce of baby fat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernhard is back in town, taking her improvisational
one-woman downtown show, ``I'm Still Here . . . Damn It!'' to
Broadway (previews start Oct. 22 at the Booth Theater). Known for
her scorching Sapphic wit and sailor's tongue, Ms. Bernhard, 43,
has added material about bringing up baby _ solo _ and finding
serenity in the cabala, the Jewish mystical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has lost her edge. When Ms. Bernhard gets up at 5
in the morning, she's as likely to be heading for the Howard Stern
show as bottle-feeding her baby, Cicely. ``I pumped for a while,
but I never produced enough milk,'' said Ms. Bernhard, who had a
Caesarean section on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent morning when Cicely was in the park with her
19-year-old nanny, Ms. Bernhard turned down the volume, dropped the
name-dropping (mostly) and dished about the same things new moms
everywhere cope with: child care, baby-proofing, toy overload. Of
course, her take on some of these quotidian matters might make a
soccer mom spin in her Land Rover tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having a TV in the room, but I don't want to see a
bunch of primary-colored kid's stuff'' was all she said about that
that was free of vulgarity. An invasion of red, blue and yellow
plastics is not imminent in the actress' elegantly appointed
Greenwich Village studio apartment; the baby has her own one-room
apartment upstairs that she shares with the nanny.
</P>
<P>
   As for the most frequently asked question _ Who's the father? _
it's a cliffhanger. Ms. Bernhard likes to answer according to mood.
Recently, she cited John Paulk, the drag queen turned heterosexual
who graced the cover of the Aug. 17 Newsweek, as the designated
dad. (Her intimates know but won't tell, except to say that because
of her interest in the cabala, he had to be Jewish.)
</P>
<P>
   Rearing a child alone is no joking matter, even for a comedian,
and Ms. Bernhard said she would rely on her friends, among them
Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer; Peggy Lipton, an actress;
Patricia Velasquez, a model, and Steven Aturo, a make-up artist.
``A lot of people in my life are never going to have babies,'' she
said. ``So I'm not too worried about who's going to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernhard's studio has the distinctive look of a seraglio for
one: lots of bedding; piles of embroidered velvet and lace-trimmed
pillows in dark, old master shades; a gigantic teak-framed mirror
tilted against the wall. A baby-proofing nightmare? ``I don't think
she's going to be the kind of baby who's going to be running around
tearing things up,'' the actress said, perhaps optimistically.
``She'll know better.'' Sure.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the high-voltage lighting: enough chandeliers,
high-tech ceiling fixtures, votive candles and twinkle lights for a
stage set. ``Sandra has such a variety of moods,'' said Robert
Verdi, her decorating muse and friend.
</P>
<P>
   Her primary home in Los Angeles, a 30s bungalow, is more
playful, Verdi said, with kitchen cabinets painted in a powder blue
and sea green plaid, and plates to match. Verdi decorated the baby
and nanny's apartment with more flounce than edge, combining a crib
carved with cherubs, Irish linen curtains and a collection of
Teletubby dolls from Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is luxurious but comfortable, a place where Sandra can
scream at her friends when they've been bad,'' Verdi said, sitting
on the couch beside Ms. Bernhard, somewhere between a companionable
snuggle and a one-man support group. Verdi whispered with
conspiratorial glee that people in the building who have seen him
pushing the stroller seem to think he's the baby's father. He says
he's not, but he sure knows his way around her bed, a queen-size,
rumpus-room upheaval of coverlets, sheets and pillows. ``I'm
thrilled when he comes over and remakes it for me,'' Ms. Bernhard
said, adding with a glint of mischief, ``I should take a picture
and study it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the intensely feminine mood turned a shade voyeuristic
at the sight of the Polaroids on her coffee table showing Ms.
Bernhard in an advanced state of pregnancy, nude in the shower. She
carried well. Often the conversation degenerated into
self-referential baby talk, with the pair mimicking Teletubbies and
reciting the refrain in sing-song from the Cole Porter-Moss Hart
tune about the ``Kling-Kling Bird on the Divi-Divi Tree.'' That is,
when they weren't batting around material for her show.
</P>
<P>
   A murky photograph of a French chateau on the wall _ a gift from
Karl Lagerfeld _ prompted Ms. Bernhard's ad-libbed,
obscenity-studded impersonation of the fashion designer and his
impenetrable French accent. ``I should put that in the show,'' she
said, her own best fan. ``I love Karl, and I love his clothes, and
as soon as he gives me some more, I'll wear them again.''
</P>
<P>
   But in describing how a Los Angeles bookstore owner accosted her
and offered to send her a monthly shipment of baby books, Ms.
Bernhard wavered between parent and performer: ``How many books
does a baby need? It's insane.'' But her indignity faded with the
glimpse of opportunity. ``I could do a whole routine about it,''
she said, brightening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernhard described a ballad in the show about child-rearing.
``It's a musical piece about raising your baby and, after all the
work and money and love, having her run off with white trash,'' she
said, upping the ante on a tale of disappointment any mother would
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did the actress snap at her designer, when he did his
own riff about her daughter. The subject was downtown parents
dressing their babies in black. ``We were at this restaurant with
Isaac, and he was holding Cicely up going, `I have no basics! I
have no basics!''' Mr Verdi said in the voice of a fashion-plate
baby. Ms. Bernhard interrupted Verdi mid-anecdote: ``I said that
line,'' she said curtly.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, during the two-hour informal interview, Ms.
Bernhard ``was golden,'' Verdi said, confiding later that she's not
always so tolerant. She was even enthusiastic about this reporter's
own wad of baby photographs. What an actress!
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friends have attributed her recent calm both to Cicely and to
her study of the cabala. The Hebrew alphabet could be seen posted
on the refrigerator and propped in the baby's crib.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always interested in Judaism, the beauty of the
tradition, the repetitions in reading the Torah, but nothing backed
it up until I discovered the cabala,'' said Ms. Bernhard, who grew
up in Scottsdale, Ariz., with three older brothers in a
Conservative Jewish family. After graduating from high school she
worked on a kibbutz for eight months, before moving, at 18, to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabala planted the seeds that made it possible for me to
change and have the composure to have a baby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not working, mother and daughter sleep together.
Eventually, Ms. Bernhard hopes to buy a larger place and is waiting
for the real-estate market to drop. Until then she will continue to
rent. ``I would like to stay in New York most of the time,'' she
said. ``It's great for a kid to be around a lot of ethnicities and
not to be freaked out by everything. If you're here in the city,
you have to learn how to live with all people. It's not even an
issue. It's more like `Hey, that's cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Ms. Bernhard stepped into her closet, slipped out
of her tight skirt and into gray sweatpants and headed off for the
playground, where she said all the other nannies treat her just

THE HISTORY OF CATHOLICISM IN BOSTON FASCINATES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when 35,000 faithful Roman Catholics would fill
Fenway Park for a rally sponsored by the Holy Name Society; when
hundreds of priests would parade through the streets of Boston in
honor of the Virgin Mary; and when the cardinal's daily radio
broadcast of the rosary commanded a huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   The early to middle part of this century was the heyday of the
Archdiocese of Boston, the period when the Catholic Church emerged
as a political and social force.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era when Catholics, who had long played second fiddle
to Protestants, transformed Boston into a decidedly Catholic city,
dotted with majestic brick churches, monuments to the power and
glory of the church.
</P>
<P>
   This is one slice of the story of Boston's Catholics that Thomas
H. O'Connor, the renowned Boston College historian, captures in his
new book, ``Boston Catholics: History of the Church and Its
People.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, widely regarded as the dean of Boston historians, does
not just tell the story of the princes of the church, but examines
the experiences of the people in the pews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make it a human story, about the people in the
parishes, and not an institutional story,'' said O'Connor, an
affable man who keeps a busy schedule at Boston College, where he
is a professor emeritus. ``It was the people who helped shape the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor hopes that his book appeals to Catholics and
non-Catholics. After all, he noted, anyone interested in the
history of the city must have some understanding of how an
immigrant, impoverished archdiocese became a power broker.
</P>
<P>
   The easy and most obvious explanation of the ascendancy of the
Catholic Church in Boston can be given in a single word: numbers.
The vast numbers of Catholics, the Irish who arrived in the
mid-19th century followed by waves of eastern and southern
Europeans in the late 19th century, guaranteed the church's rise.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor doesn't buy it. ``Just because you have the large
numbers doesn't guarantee anything, because it could just be an
amorphous, disjointed mass,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Besides numbers, the archdiocese also has enjoyed astute
leadership, archbishops who have been able to organize far-flung
parishes into a cohesive army of believers. Finally, O'Connor
credits the hard work of the immigrants who filled the churches and
are the backbone of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years it took to produce the book, O'Connor said he
was surprised by what he learned of some of the archdiocese's
little-known leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop John Williams, for example, who led the archdiocese
for two decades following the Civil War, built Holy Cross Cathedral
and St. John's seminary; established the parochial school system;
and inaugarated the St. Vincent De Paul Society. Williams also set
a welcoming tone for the flood of European immigrants arriving in
Boston, establishing national parishes for Italians, French, and
Lithuanians, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal William Henry O'Connell, during a tenure that lasted
from 1907 to 1944, turned a population of lay people still hesitant
about their place in Boston into a confident and empowered group.
</P>
<P>
   ``When O'Connell comes in, Catholics still suffer from a lack of
self-confidence, a sense that they are still kowtowing to the
Yankees,'' said O'Connor, who was born and raised in South Boston.
``But O'Connell comes in and tells them not to try and imitate the
Yankees. He tells them that they've got their own heritage and
roots. He created the CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) so
Catholics wouldn't have to go to the YMCA or YWCA, because those
were Yankee institutions. He made Catholics proud of their
Catholicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cardinal Bernard Law faces a new set of challenges.
Foremost, O'Connor noted, is the declining number of priests and
nuns. Increasingly, the church is relying on lay people, especially
women, to fill key posts.
</P>
<P>
   Law also has had to respond _ and here O'Connor gives the
cardinal high marks _ to a new wave of immigrants from Asia, Latin
America, and Africa. The archdiocese has established apostolates to
act as liaisons to the new arrivals, who have helped revive urban
parishes.
</P>
<P>
   Law also has forged strong alliances and good relationships with
Jewish and black religious leaders to address social and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Law's authority is much more
diminished than those of his predecessors, O'Connor said. Catholics
today are well-educated, sophisticated, and unafraid to challenge
church fathers and teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laity expect to have a say in determining and shaping''
the archdiocese's future, O'Connor said.

HOLDING HANDS OF YOUNG WEB WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had my usual nightmare the other night, the one in which I am
stumbling down the halls of my old high school, feeling cold, late
for a biology exam, noticing that other students are staring oddly
at my outfit. Catching sight of my reflection in a window, I see
why. I am naked, except for a pair of men's black nylon dress
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the refusal of my subconscious to graduate from high
school partly explained my state of anxiety the next morning, as I
sat on a hard wooden bench outside the principal's office at my
daughter's elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that I was nearly two decades removed from the days
when I had to bend to the implacable rules of public school. No
matter that I was a parent, accompanied by a sleeping baby in a
stroller, here to protest the fact that my 9-year-old daughter had
been put on a waiting list to join the school's newspaper club. I
still felt a chill.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sean O'Connell, principal of Southdown Intermediate
School in Huntington, N.Y., invited me into his office, I was a
mess. Plus, the baby dumped animal crackers on the floor, another
factor that possibly distracted him from my forceful eloquence, as
I argued that, to be able to accept my daughter, the newspaper club
should move to a larger room or accept help from parent volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   As O'Connell bounced the baby on his knee while I teased crumbs
from the carpet pile, he assured me that other students were sure
to drop out of the club to make room _ probably as soon as they got
their first assignment. ``So why are you getting so upset?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it seemed sad to exclude students from a fun activity
that would teach them about writing and, more important, about
having a voice in a community. Collaborating with friends to
express ideas that other people will read is still as powerful a
thrill today as back when, say, Thomas Jefferson took a crack at it
with the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the full truth was more complicated, tied up with a
recurring vision of me, helpless in those black nylon socks. ``I
don't want my daughter to grow up thinking it's OK to be thwarted
by bureaucracy,'' I said, finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' O'Connell said, ``why don't you have her start her own
newspaper and hand it out in class?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good idea, but as I drove home I thought of an even
better solution: let her start a newspaper on the Internet. After
all, the Internet is the antidote to the centralized authority of
the public-school classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Forget waiting lists. In the riotously egalitarian atmosphere
that prevails online, anyone is empowered to publish a newspaper,
simply by signing up for a free home page and typing some news on
it.
</P>
<P>
   When my daughter, Zoe, heard the idea, she said, ``Can I call my
friends right now and ask them to come over to help?''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a fledgling staff of three elementary school
girls assembled at our house, took an immediate break for a snack,
then reconvened in front of the computer, ready to create a home
page for the newspaper. This would have been a good opportunity to
transform our family's moldering free home page on the Geocities
site into something useful, but a failure to update the page for
the past five months had prompted Geocities to reassign our web
address.
</P>
<P>
   No matter; in less than five minutes, we had been assigned a new
member name, password and new Web address at http://www.
geocities.com/EnchantedForest/ Tower/1609/.
</P>
<P>
   Using a basic text editor provided by Geocities, the young
journalists could click back and forth between an editing window
and the actual template of their website. Enamored of such basic
html commands as  &QL; 
p(GT) and  &QL; 
c(GT), they quickly mastered the rudiments of online layout,
creating new paragraphs and centering blocks of text on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, they eschewed the  &QL; 
blink(GT) tag. Best of all, they saw their efforts published online
and updated each time they clicked the ``Save'' button at the
bottom of the text editor page.
</P>
<P>
   But almost as soon as the staff had christened the page
``Southdown Newspaper (NU)2: Interesting News About Southdown
School,'' I started to worry. Perhaps the fledgling news hounds
needed guidance from an experienced online publisher. After all,
with its capacity for disseminating information nearly instantly to
a worldwide audience, the Internet raises issues different from
photocopied sheets handed around a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Peter Owens, the professor of English at the University
of Massachusetts who started a children's interactive news service
at www.kidnews.com in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take extra care to protect kids,'' Professor Owens
said, ``because you've got an unlimited circulation now, which
makes it much easier for unsavory people to find the publication
than if it were just sent home from school on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   He also passed along a few tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not publish bylines that reveal children's last names or
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be sensitive about potentially embarrassing material, using an
`Anonymous' byline to protect the author.
</P>
<P>
   _ Build online archives for readers interested in back issues.
KidNews, for instance, did not accept new submissions for a few
weeks during the past month, while the site changed ownership. But
its archives remained rich with news written by more than 6,000
children worldwide. The site's new owner, Elaine Floyd, began
accepting submissions again this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing closely to Owens's advice, the staff of Southdown
Newspaper (NU)2 composed timely dispatches on the recent dispute
over the large number of students in each fourth-grade class _ ``by
Zoe, grade 4,'' the byline read _ results of recent student council
elections, by Natalie, grade 5, and the fourth-graders' weekly
schedule, by Kyle, grade 4.
</P>
<P>
   They came downstairs only once, to ask how to spell
``treasurer.'' I noticed later that they still needed a copy editor
to show them how to spell it. But they did learn a different lesson
that afternoon: how to overcome bureaucracy without breaking the
rules.

WOMEN WANT IT ALL, AND ITS ALL ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By NINA TEICHOLZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American women are fast closing the Web gender gap. Women 50 and
older are one of the fastest-growing populations online, and women
now make up almost half of all American Internet users. Given the
reams of magazine pages devoted to charting a woman's every body
curve and fashion fetish, Web sites for women were merely a matter
of course.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Pack, founder of the Women.com site, said women and men
functioned differently on the Net. Men are surfers, she said,
whereas women are seekers, going online to get specific information
_ advice on acne or how to do a proper sit-up _ and not spending
hours just looking around. They don't have time, Ms. Pack said, not
with children and careers and mealtime coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have applications and tools that help women get things off
their to-do lists,'' said Jason Stell, a spokesman for the iVillage
Web site. Accordingly, many women's Web sites are short on news
analysis and are instead crammed full of advice. Like women's print
magazines, these sites combine a number of topics (health,
child-rearing, work), while men's publications, online and off,
tend to pick one topic and stick with it (Muscle, Outdoors and
Men's Health magazines). ``Women integrate various aspects of their
lives,'' Stell said. ``Men, not so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the biggest sites aim to be for every woman, like
Working Woman magazine, Good Housekeeping and Vogue all rolled into
one. With strong corporate backing, these sites aim to capture the
entire 25-to-49 age group that advertisers so covet.
</P>
<P>
   Other, smaller sites are presenting an array of information on
topics long considered too delicate for the magazine racks; Web
zines for young women can be positively lurid.
</P>
<P>
   Still other women's sites define their niches more narrowly,
like the travel magazine Maiden Voyages (maiden-voyages.com), the
national sports clearinghouse Women'Sports Wire
(www.womensportswire.com) and a bookstore for women
(www.womenbooks.com).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the traditional women's magazines have online editions,
including Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Glamour and Redbook. But they
do not have much of a Web sensibility; they have lots of fashion
photos that take too long to download and, in most cases, very
little content. Mainly they are online to woo subscribers for the
print versions.
</P>
<P>
   Not that women on the Web are not interested in fashion and
beauty. Fashion Icon (www.fashion-icon. com), has reports on street
style, designers and fashion news. Fashion Net (www.fashion.net) is
packed with links to stores and products. And dedicated fashion
consumers will want to hit samplesale.com, a site that lists, day
by day, nearly every designer sample sale in the country. For
cosmetics and beauty, try Heather Kleinman's Cosmetic Connection
(www.kleinman.com).
</P>
<P>
   To help you navigate through all these sites, there is Femina
(femina. cybergrrl.com), a Web guide for sites ``for, by and about
women.'' Femina breaks sites into useful categories, like Yahoo's,
and its listings are extensive. And it is worth noting that the
categories include lesbians and bisexuals, and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   While Web sites for women fell behind the curve in the
Internet's infancy, they are quickly catching up. The Web has few
barriers to entry, making it a remarkably egalitarian place, and
thousands of women have responded, drawn by the chance to dictate
their own content. The result is a host of voices and concerns
rarely seen on the newsstand, and well worth a look.
</P>
<P>
   From Fluff To Finance
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WWW.WOMEN.COM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of a woman's age, profession or education, Women.com
aims to inform her. It has such disparate offerings as an
interactive tax planner, climate information for gardeners, a
how-to item on negotiating your salary and a workout personality
quiz.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com is actually a network of six separate Web sites:
Crayola Family Play, Stork Site (for pregnant women), Money Mode,
Beatrice's Web Guide, Prevention's Healthy Ideas and Women's Wire.
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable amount of information provided among these
sites, and much of it is presented in a lively, interactive way. At
the Healthy Ideas site, for example, you are not simply admonished
for eating badly; instead, you can reinvent your diet with a
``daily meal planner'' or punch your lunch into an interactive
calorie counter. In the Women's Wire style section, you can create
a virtual wardrobe by taking a style quiz or catch up on beauty
news.
</P>
<P>
   Although Women.com aims to attract the sophisticated, successful
woman, the tone is often chirpy and condescending, treating the
user more like a preteen than a woman. Instead of domestic or
international news, there is Good News, stories of caring and
sharing sponsored by Hallmark. Instead of politics, Women.com
offers For Princess Diana _ On her 37th Birthday. Often, too, the
choice of articles implies an obsession with how men and women
differ _ a male frame of reference that is disheartening to find.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, on the less girly side, there is a great deal of
financial advice in Money Mode, with stock prices and articles from
Bloomberg, and primers on every financial topic imaginable, along
with interactive planners (an education-cost calculator and a
mortgage calculator). Women's Wire has a section for the working
woman, with a job bank, a resume builder, a ``biz shrink'' who
answers questions and a section with profiles of successful women,
including what they think about men. You can also find out about
child care and care for the elderly, and get your work horoscope.

</P>
<P>
   For mothers, Crayola Family Play offers ``hundreds of activities
to do with your kids.'' Primary colors and building-block graphics
make this site look as though it was designed more for children
than for adults, but it does have enough ideas to keep your kids
busy for a thousand rainy days. (For Halloween, there are recipes
for jack-o'-lantern cookies and spooky slime.) A pregnant woman can
enter the Stork site and check the Babygram, which tracks the
development of her fetus (``this week your baby is beginning to
develop a little fat under the skin'').
</P>
<P>
   Finally, those users of Woman .com who want a male perspective
can write to the site's token guy, Emale.

<P>
   It takes a village to do just about anything at the iVillage
site. Offering support groups, bulletin boards and buddies,
iVillage.com has a community for every interest. Among them are a
community for women trying to conceive children, parents of
multiples, parents of teen-agers, potty-trainers, women with
home-based jobs, wedding-bound women and stay-at-home moms. To
reach a health or fitness goal, you can sign up for an online
``support buddy,'' and if it's group support you seek, you can join
one of the ``community challenges,'' like the Kick Butt challenge
to stop smoking and the Shape Up for Fall challenge. There's even
``cyber-support'' via e-mail, where you sign up with either a
digital coach or a mother _ one berates, the other encourages.
</P>
<P>
   Two experienced business women founded iVillage.com, and their
business acumen shows. The site has big corporate backers,
including General Electric and America Online, and links to buy
clothing, home appliances and other items are sprinkled throughout.
``We're very focused on the fact that the Web is one of the best
mass-marketing opportunities ever,'' said Jason Stell, an iVillage
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the formula is working: more women _ some two million,
according to Media Metrix, a Web-tracking business _ visit iVillage
than visit any other women's Web site. Women have flocked to
iVillage's online communities, where stories of anonymous
camaraderie abound: a single mother of two who has just received a
diagnosis of breast cancer goes online and writes of her fear, and
finds, two hours later, 12 messages in reply. These communities are
monitored by volunteers. ``It's a clean, well-lighted experience,''
Stell said.
</P>
<P>
   The same Women's Day tone found at Women.com pervades iVillage,
in articles like ``Celebrate Yourself!'' followed by ``Six New
Delicious Ways to Make Sweet Potatoes!'' Unlike Women.com, iVillage
offers no information on finances and little on world news. Still,
it does keep an impressive group of experts, available for
consultation on topics like child-rearing, health and fitness,
relationships and careers.
</P>
<P>
   The site sometimes verges on the cute, with items like ``The Joy
of Soy,'' ``Let's Talk Tofu'' and pink screens with daisies in the
``Keyboard Yoga'' section. But as a Web site for women in search of
kindred spirits, iVillage is one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Underwire, a weekly Web zine on women's issues, has the usual
online advice on fitness and health, money, sex and relationships,
but this exceptionally well-designed site is much easier to
navigate and has more harmonious graphics than its rivals.
Underwire's more serious and sedate tone is also a relief after the
cheerleading of some other women's sites.
</P>
<P>
   While its offerings are narrower, they're deftly chosen.
Lucille's Garage' delivers auto advice, and Miss Manners answers
questions of etiquette. There are regular contributions by the
political humorist Molly Ivans, articles of some depth and a
Related Readings section with mostly Oprah Book Club-type
suggestions. All books are related to Underwire's topic of the
week. A recent subject was race, with articles on the role of anger
in psychological health among minority women, and a
Taiwanese-American woman's experiences with discrimination in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   On the more whimsical side, Novel Idea is Underwire's adventure
in group storytelling. A prologue to a tale was posted and readers
took it from there, weaving a story, one reader picking up where
another left off. Three hundred and nine paragraphs into the
current Harlequin Romance-style story, the stunningly beautiful Kay
has just solicited from the beautiful and rich Natasha the tragic
story of her father, a spy in the Soviet Secret Service who almost
married a woman with strong connections to Czar Nicholas I. The
story is fairly chaste; clearly these authors have not been over to
Estronet.com lately.
</P>
<P>
   Making Women's Votes Count
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WOMENVOTE.ORG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ifyou want to delve behind the speeches of your senator or
representative, full voting records for all members of Congress are
available on Womenvote.org, the first Web site to publish an
interactive voting guide for women. Select the issues of most
interest to you from a substantial menu including general topics
(international trade and finance, crime) as well as so-called
women's issues (family planning and abortion, children and
families). ``Vote'' on various pieces of legislation from the past
four years and then compare your positions with those of your
representatives in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This nonpartisan Web site does not advocate; instead, it aims to
educate women and connect them with people influencing events.
Included here are many votes that newspapers neglect to cover,
particularly amendment votes and close votes. The site, which
opened in April, has surveyed many of the challengers in November's
elections on how they would have voted on particular issues and
will soon publish the results so you can compare their stands to
the incumbents'. The site plans to offer discussion groups,
candidate forums and news-maker forums after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Womenvote.org hopes to expand eventually to state politics.
Women with an agenda may also want to check out these comprehensive
sites: the Feminist Majority (www.feminist.org) and feminist. com
on the left and www.rightgrrl. com on the right (with links to the
Support Paula Jones and Support Linda Tripp Web sites).
</P>
<P>
   On the Edge (And Over It)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ESTRONET.COM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This hormone-pumped network is not the place to look for thinner
thighs in 30 days or a recipe for chocolate cupcakes. Estronet.com
is one of a half-dozen or so raunchy sites aimed at the
20-something woman interested in, well, sex. (Last week, the
network merged with the Chickclick network, which is oriented more
toward teen-agers, and is now the host for 22 sites.)
</P>
<P>
   An independently minded group of young women is behind an
eclectic group of sites, including Bust, Wench, Gurl, Swanky,
Hissyfit, Skirt and Minxmag. Some sites in the network are aimed
more at teen-agers, but even the presumably more mature sites, like
Bust and Wench, are fairly shallow and obsessed with sex. In the
Obsession issue of Maximag.com, for example, the leading articles
are ``Loving Latex: One Woman's Obsession'' and ``Sex Positive for
the New Millennium,'' which promotes personal liberation through
``great sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the content at Estronet, particularly at Bust.com and
Mousy. com, rival the Starr report for risque material. Scrolling
through Mousy, with features like Don't Call Me in the Morning, you
might wonder if these aren't actually pornography magazines for men
in disguise. But there are no pictures, only personal confessions
aplenty, and no topic is too intimate.
</P>
<P>
   One slight departure is Wench. com, which, contrary to its
perjorative name, aims to explore women's roles in society. The
site admits that it has only a ``vague idea of the direction we're
heading,'' but it's off to a decent start. There are a few articles
on national politics and two on sexism that it discovered in
computer software packaging and cartoons on Bazooka bubble gum
wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the feminist bent in Estronet is not so much
political as anti-high fashion. For example, several sites
criticized Vogue's requirement that Oprah Winfrey lose 20 pounds
before gracing its cover. ``Big whoop,'' Maximag said, to
``conventionally beautiful faces and unconventionally narrow
thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Irwin, Estronet's founder, said the network intended to
get beyond the vapidity of Vogue to address more serious topics
like date rape and menstruation. And although her site has drawn
plenty of contributors who want to share their stories, not too
many people are reading them _ at least not yet. For all the media
hype surrounding Estronet, it had fewer than 100,000 visitors a
month at the time of its merger, said Media Metrix, which tracks
Web usage.

CHEAPER THINKPADS STILL CLASSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the first installment of a new column by Peter H. Lewis.
Each week he will write about new products and developments in the
electronics industry of interest to consumers.  
 By PETER H. LEWIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending nearly two years interviewing consumers about
their computing desires and habits, IBM has created a very
impressive new line of notebooks designed for people who spend
their own money on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for selling hardware to the expense-account crowd,
International Business Machines has learned that individual
consumers have different desires than corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, IBM discovered, wanted a high-quality notebook not so
much as a traveling companion but as a substitute for a desktop
computer at home. And by the way, it had to cost less than $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's response is a trio of Thinkpad notebooks _ called the i
Series _ that will have base prices of $1,499, $1,999 and $2,499
when they arrive in stores next month.
</P>
<P>
   I've been testing the momma-bear version, the $1,999 Thinkpad
1450. It is about twice the size of the older Thinkpad 560X, the
slim four-pound model that I carry on business trips, but it is
also half the cost, and it outperforms the smaller machine. For a
desktop substitute, the added heft is actually an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   (But when I carry the external disk drive, CD-ROM drive, AC
power adapters, port replicator and other attachments, the 560X
actually weighs eight pounds, slightly more than the Thinkpad
1450.)
</P>
<P>
   The new Thinkpad has a big, bright display that outshines
anything offered by competitors in the price range, respectable
performance from its 266-megahertz Pentium MMX processor and lots
of features that make it more friendly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Thinkpads arrive in what has already been a delightful
season for portable PCs. Earlier this year, a resurgent Apple
Computer Corp. introduced the impressive line of powerful G3
Powerbooks. Dell Computer offered a high-end Inspiron notebook
featuring a Texas-sized 15-inch active-matrix display.
</P>
<P>
   Sony broke new ground with a powerful yet super-skinny
subnotebook computer, its magnesium-hulled Vaio 505. And we are
just beginning to see a new crop of ultraportable computers that
weigh a couple of pounds and cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Either because of price or features, however, none of these
computers seemed ideal for consumers who wanted an all-in-one
portable PC that could serve as a replacement for a desktop
computer at a reasonable price. (An all-in-one portable includes a
floppy drive and a CD-ROM drive in the main body along with the
hard disk, instead of forcing them onto the desktop as tethered
external devices, octopus style.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, prices for Pentium-class notebooks with
active-matrix thin-film transistor color displays _ the best in
terms of brightness and sharpness _ were above $5,000.
Expense-account customers quickly made Thinkpads the most desired
Windows notebooks in the airlines' first-class sections.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to buying a computer for personal use, even
corporate executives had to think twice about Thinkpads. With
prices for desktop computers dropping every week, in some cases
below $1,000, it did not take a chief financial officer to figure
out that one could buy two, three or more desktop computers for the
price of one high-end Thinkpad.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Series Thinkpads narrow the price gap between desktop and
portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   The one I've been using has the characteristic solid feel and
finish of a Thinkpad. In performance, it is still at least two
generations behind comparably priced Windows-based desktop
machines, but it holds its own with other laptop competitors in its
class. It wins hands down for cachet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get on a plane, it's still a status symbol to pull out
a big black IBM computer,'' said Andrew M. Seybold, editor-in-chief
of Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a newsletter about mobile and wireless
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   He forecasts success for the lower-cost i-Series Thinkpads.
``It's like when BMW or Mercedes came out with lower-priced
models,'' he said. ``People are waiting to buy them when you drop
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three new i-Series Thinkpads. The least expensive is
the model 1410, which comes with an Intel Pentium MMX processor
humming at 266 megahertz, 32 megabytes of system memory, a
3.2-gigabyte hard disk, a 20-speed CD-ROM drive, and a 12.1-inch
thin-film transistor screen. The cost is $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   The model 1450, which I tested, will have an estimated street
price of $1,999. It also had a 266-MHz Intel Pentium MMX processor,
but it came with 64 megabytes of RAM, a 4.3-gigabyte hard disk and
a 13.3-inch screen that was exceptionally good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The poppa bear is the 1710 model, which steps up to a more
powerful Intel Pentium II processor, a 24X CD-ROM drive and an
extra bay that allows the use of a second battery or some sort of
removable data storage. Based on specifications alone, the 1710
model appears to make the most sense as a desktop replacement,
worth the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   The new consumer notebooks share several new features, including
at least 2 megabytes of video memory and a 56K modem. Most
impressive is that they all sport thin-film transistor displays,
which yield brighter and sharper images than the lower-cost passive
displays found most often on low-cost portables.
</P>
<P>
   IBM said it had decided to use the costlier but superior
displays as a result of ``exit poll'' interviews with recent
notebook purchasers. The most common regret among people who had
already bought notebook computers, IBM found, was that they did not
get a bigger or better display, despite the higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of little things that make life better, IBM made
the new notebooks much better suited to playing audio compact
disks. Working with the audio company Altec Lansing, it created a
speaker system that fits in the left and right margins of the
computer's display, creating a wider than normal notebook with a
bit of an overbite on the lid.
</P>
<P>
   Other laptops, like the Compaq Presarios, sometimes place the
speakers where they can be muffled by the palms of the user.
</P>
<P>
   The i-Series Thinkpads have the CD controls _ including a
liquid-crystal display, a volume control dial, forward and reverse
track selection, and eject buttons _ on the outside of the
computer, so a person can play music disks without having to boot
up the computer.
</P>
<P>
   For those who resist headphones and think that their mission in
life is to share their musical taste with the folks in adjoining
seats, the speakers in the lid are cleverly positioned to pump out
decibels to either side when the case is closed.
</P>
<P>
   There are cheaper alternatives if a consumer simply wants a
portable audio CD player, of course.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also clearly listened to people who wanted to become
productive with their laptops without having to get a degree in
computer science.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research revealed a list of questions that new
users often have, including such common stumpers as these: How do I
send a fax from my computer? How do I send and receive electronic
mail? How do I download files from the Internet? What the heck is
power management, and how do I do it? How do I write a letter or
make a business presentation?
</P>
<P>
   So IBM has answered the questions by creating shortcut
instructions for each task (available on the 1410 and 1450 models).
IBM also added four color-coded function keys to the keyboard that
can be set up to perform common tasks, like connecting to the
Internet (the computer comes with an offer of 100 free hours of
Internet time through American Online), gathering e-mail and so on.
</P>
<P>
   What don't I like? It seems a shame not to show off such
beautiful screens with a DVD drive, which would let travelers watch
movies as well as play audio CDs. An external DVD add-on is the
only option. The new Thinkpads are too big to use on airline
seat-back trays.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium MMX processor poses a dilemma for students: It keeps
the cost down and is fine for e-mail, Web browsing and term papers,
but it is a lousy chip for serious game players.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that the i-Series Thinkpads are a good
value, and the only question is whether IBM can produce them fast
enough.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Stephen Crocker sent e-mail to his 20-year-old
daughter, Melissa, about the death last Friday of his fellow
Internet pioneer, Dr. Jonathan B. Postel, 55, he decided to explain
to her his friend's significance in the world of computer
networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're familiar with the Internet addresses, of course,''
Crocker, 54, wrote in his note, which was part primer, part
tribute. ``Jon set up an organized way to keep track of Internet
addresses and the many other sets of numbers needed to run the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Crocker continued to catalog Postel's technical achievements,
describing how his modest, behind-the-scenes work had evolved into
the crucial Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. He closed with
this: ``He was always balanced, fair and conscientious _ one of the
good people who kept things working.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker's missive to his daughter, a junior in college who uses
the Net every day but knows little about its technical
underpinnings, was intended to give her a glimpse into what his
generation did to lay the foundation for a network that she and her
contemporaries now consider one of life's necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Postel and Crocker were members of the Internet old guard, a
cadre of computer researchers who, when young, had strong opinions
and nothing to lose. They began thinking about computer networks in
the 1960s, when few in the corporate sphere seemed interested.
Paying no attention to the indifference, they built their network
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   More than scientists, they were inventors. For his part, Postel
came up with a method for organizing and tracking network addresses
while he was a graduate student at the University of California at
Los Angeles. In those days, the Net was so small that his project
was a little like documenting the house numbers on his own street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny because everything was in such a small volume and
everyone knew everyone,'' said Danny Cohen, a former colleague of
Postel at the Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey, a
branch of the University of Southern California where Postel worked
for 21 years. ``What was the point of documenting it if you could
talk to the guy who did it? Jon had the vision to see how important
it was. So when the network started growing, the infrastructure was
in place and it didn't collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of Postel's projects was to edit a series of technical
notes for the Network Working Group, which was developing
communications protocols, the rules by which computers converse.
Crocker, inordinately courteous, had written the first note in the
late 60s and called it ``Request for Comments'' because he wasn't
sure who was really in charge of this nascent network and didn't
want to offend anyone by sounding too official. The notes came to
be called RFCs and quickly became the Net's de facto bylaws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not longer after Crocker started the RFCs, Postel took on the
volunteer job of editing them. Nearly 2,500 RFCs have been
produced, and Postel kept some of the earliest ones in his home and
office.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with later waves of well-groomed Net millionaires,
Postel favored a long bushy beard and sandals. His office was a
mess, but his maintenance of the Internet's addresses, through the
federally financed Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which he
ran, was meticulous.
</P>
<P>
   He did not attend conferences devoted to such topics as online
business models. Instead, he attended meetings of the Internet
Engineering Task Force and the Internet Society. And his presence
at such gatherings was crucial. Over the years, he became a Net
deity, acting as a quiet arbiter when technical disputes were at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when the Net is synonymous in most people's minds with
a visual, commercial World Wide Web, full of sound, music, video
and stock prices, it still reflects the personalities and
proclivities of those who built it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that nobody actually owns the Net is no accident. It
belonged to those who built it and ran it. People like Postel
fought to keep its standards open and free, which enabled hundreds
of thousands of people to build on those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Postel believed that he was a public servant above all. He could
have become a millionaire many times over but always decided
against it. ``There are aspects of what I've done that are
positions of public trust,'' he once said in an interview. ``I
don't feel it would be right for me to start a company to profit
from those activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, a close friend of Postel's, said that even though Postel,
through his work, made it possible for the Net to grow
exponentially, he had mixed feelings about the Internet's success.
Occasionally, Cohen said, he and Postel and others mourned the
passing of the Net as they once knew it, a cozy place where you
knew pretty much everyone else who was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked many times about the disaster of success,'' Cohen
said. ``The worst disaster that can happen is success beyond your
expectations. Things aren't as nice as they used to be. Now there
are all kinds of people you don't know and all kinds of different
agendas.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Postel is not forgotten. He is enough of a legend that after his
death, eulogies and tributes, and even black ribbons, appeared all
over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shabbir J. Safdar, 31, a political strategist in Washington who
depends heavily on the Internet, said that although he had never
met Postel, he was well aware of his contributions. ``I met him
only in the sense that everyone else met him,'' he said. ``We we're
living on top of his work. Everything we do touches his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Safdar said few of his friends shared his appreciation of
Postel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Mockapetris, who worked with Postel to create the
Internet's Domain Name System in the early 1980s at Information
Sciences Institute, said the generational difference became
apparent to him recently when he received e-mail from someone
requesting the specifications for a particular protocol he and a
group of others had written.
</P>
<P>
   ``We jumped all over him for his breach of Net etiquette,'' said
Mockapetris, who is 49. ``He should have just gone to the RFC
instead of wasting 30 people's time.'' Mockapetris asked the
offender what his excuse for such a breach of etiquette might be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ten,'' was the response. &QL;

 IN FULTON, MO., LEGENDS OF CHURCHILL AND REAGAN INTERTWINE ,
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULTON, Mo. _ Through a strange convergence of events, this
college town in central Missouri has attained a symbolic status in
the saga of the Cold War that for more than 40 years divided East
and West.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Fulton on March 5, 1946, that one of the 20th
century's greatest statesmen, Winston Churchill, warned the world
that an aggressive communist empire had lowered an ``iron curtain''
across Europe's midsection, severing the communist east from the
democratic west.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron
curtain has descended across the continent,'' declared the eloquent
Englishman. ``Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient
states of Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest
and Sofia, all these famous cities and the populations around them
lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject in
one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very
high, and, in some cases, increasing measure of control from
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the beginning of World War II, Churchill and U.S.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt had been about all that stood
between Germany's Adolf Hitler and the freedom of the British
Isles. Without the two leaders, they probably would have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, stripped of his prime ministership by British voters
in 1945, journeyed to Fulton as a private citizen at President
Harry Truman's invitation. There, he delivered his historic speech,
entitled ``Sinews of Peace,'' at a copy of a magnificent
17th-century London church _ St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury. The
original church, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and gutted by a
German bomb in World War II, was dismantled and reconstructed
brick-by-brick on the campus of Fulton's Westminster College.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's warning, which signaled the start of the Cold War,
was followed by Truman's monumental decisions to provide arms and
economic aid to deter communist aggression in Greece and Turkey, to
rehabilitate war-devastated Western Europe with the Marshall Plan,
to launch an airlift of 2 million tons of supplies to end the
Soviet blockade of Berlin and to halt North Korea's brutal
incursion into South Korea. Those bold actions saved Western Europe
and South Korea from communism.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades later, Ronald Reagan, another superb communicator
with ties to Fulton, was to serve as president during the
disintegration of the Soviet empire and the last gasps of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Warner Brothers had released ``Kings Row,'' the movie
version of Henry Bellamann's novel about life, love, insanity and
sadism in small-town Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kings Row,'' which was closely fashioned after Fulton, where
Bellamann was reared, provided the handsome, 31-year-old Reagan
with his greatest role before he became president in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   It was the film in which Reagan, as Drake McHugh, cried out,
``Where's the rest of me?'' when he discovered that his legs had
been amputated by a cruel doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Before Reagan took office, every president since Truman had
sought to contain communist aggression while also seeking a
peaceful way out of the Cold War. But it wasn't until Reagan's
tenure, which coincided with the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev in
the Soviet Union, that the Soviet empire began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Capping the efforts of his predecessors, Reagan spent roughly $1
trillion to bolster America's defenses and ordered development of a
space-based missile defense system, known colloquially as ``star
wars.'' He also proposed that instead of limiting their number of
missiles, the United States and the Soviet Union actually reduce
their arsenals of such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After much negotiation, Gorbachev, realizing that the Soviet
economy was facing disaster and that change was imperative, wisely
agreed to a number of Reagan's proposals and promised to remove
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reagan's last two years in the White House were
tarnished by the Iran-contra scandal, they also witnessed the
beginning of the end for what he once had branded the ``evil
empire.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be an exaggeration to credit Reagan with ending the Cold
War as his supporters do, but he played a major role in bringing it
to a peaceful conclusion by adopting policies that hastened the
demise of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years after he retired to California, the Berlin Wall
was torn down, and democracy replaced dictatorship in such
communist satellites as Poland, Hungary and East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   There is no substitute for strong, enlightened leadership. That
is the story in Fulton where the legend of Winston Churchill is
entwined with that of Ronald Reagan.

WHY TRAVEL, WHEN THE INTERNET GETS YOU THERE QUICKER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Russell Baker once noted that all real reporting is
investigative reporting, I believe that all real writing is travel
writing. Every good author takes you on a real or fictional voyage
to a place you have never been.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also an important literature of staying at home.
Ivan Goncharov's slothful 19th-century hero, Ilya Oblomov, can
never figure out a reason to leave his bedchamber. In J.K.
Huysman's 1884 novel ``Against the Grain,'' his protagonist embarks
on a trip from Paris to London, but gets sidetracked at a Parisian
pub that serves roast beef and plum pudding. Savoring the British
ambience (``Was he not now even in London, whose aromas and
atmospheres surrounded him?''), our man never makes it to the train
station. ``What is the use of moving,'' he asks, ``when one can
travel on a chair so magnificently?''
</P>
<P>
   What use indeed? Why spend hours bouncing around in some
ill-riveted, flying cattle car only to be gunned down by local
soreheads at the foot of the Pyramids? Now, thanks to modern
technology, you will soon be able to go everywhere, without having
to travel anywhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   I first learned about the Virtual Heritage movement at a flashy
demonstration of Silicon Graphics' Infinite Reality computers.
Using software developed by Italy's Infobyte, I ``toured'' St.
Peter's basilica, and even flew to the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   A similar installation is now in place at the new Getty Museum
in Los Angeles, where visitors can take a virtual reality tour of
the Emperor Trajan's forum, digitally ``reconstructed'' by
archaeologists from UCLA and Northwestern University
(www.aud.ucla.edu/ &QC; 
bill/trajan.html). As it happens, this is the only chance you will
have to visit Trajan's famous meeting place, which was mostly
flattened by an earthquake in AD 850.
</P>
<P>
   One of the purposes of Virtual Heritage is to restore sites that
have been lost, like the forum. But another aim is to keep people
away from monuments deemed ``at risk'' from human visitation.
Infobyte (www. &QC; 
infobyte.it/catalogo/uk/vr/titoli.html) is now working to re-create
the pharaohs' tombs, which can no longer accommodate the hordes of
tourists who want to tramp through them. A company named Connected
PC (www.connec &QC; 
tedpc.com) &UR;  &LR;  can take you on a fly-around tour of Virtual
Stonehenge _ and simulate solstice sunrises _ saving you the cost
and the discomfort of the trans-Atlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, another joyless tourist ritual, the annual
``leaf-peeping'' pilgrimage, has gone digital. Yankee magazine,
headquartered in terminally quaint Dublin, N.H., operates a Web
site called Foliage Central (www.neweng &QC; 
land.com/foliage/leaves.html), quite handy for the Oblomovs among
us who rarely set foot beyond the bedroom door. The Yankee site
features an impossible-to-read map indicating that the very best
foliage to be seen today is in Providence, R.I., a city somewhere
south of Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   For complicated meteorological reasons best explained by the
Weather Channel's Web site (www.weather.com/fall), which also
tracks peak color trends, Vermont and New Hampshire are finito for
foliage. Of course, that's not the impression you'd get from those
states' tourism Web sites (www.visitnh.gov, www.tra &QC; 
vel-vermont.com/), &UR;  &LR; virtually aflame in leafy hype. Perhaps some of
those British barflies we quoted in the Sunday paper _
``Color-Starved British Flock to New England for Foliage Display''
_ can be duped into traveling up there.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there will be a Daily Leaf Cam that allows you to
``see'' the resplendent colors digitally. This one
(www.boston.sidewalk.com/ &QC; 
link/34310) purports to be a view of the village green in Dorset,
Vt., as viewed from the Dovetail Inn. Lately, it's been the village
gray, looking more like the view from a state-run hotel in
pre-glasnost Bratislava than a scene from the Green Mountain state.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like my reality to be a little more virtual, please.

   BRIDGEWATER, Conn. _ For every architect there is an ideal
client.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mark Ferguson met his patron of a lifetime,
the client's estate consisted of a simple gray saltbox house on 11
acres overlooking a valley and mountain here in western
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson wasn't the King of Limestone then. He was a young man
fresh from Parish-Hadley, the interior design firm, setting up
practice with two others as Traditional Architects; men who
believed firmly in the vocabulary of classical times, who reveled
in architraves and arches, fan windows and dentil molding and
crotch-mahogany veneer.
</P>
<P>
   The client, Peter May, asked only for a small library addition
alongside the 1960s saltbox. He was the first of a series of
well-to-do men and women to seek out Ferguson, though this first
commission would hardly compare to the grandeur of the architect's
later designs: the Spanish haciendas in Palm Beach, Fla.; the
English Tudor manor houses in Tulsa, Okla.; the McKim, Mead &AMP;
White-style beach bungalows on Martha's Vineyard. And it certainly
didn't compare to Ferguson's most monumental effort, the
Sagaponack, N.Y., home of the investor Ira Rennert, a
59,000-square-foot columned villa now under construction _ probably
the largest American house to be built during the second half of
this century.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferguson was content to start out small, at least in square
feet. The little library for May, paneled wall-to-wall in knotty
pine to match an 18th-century mantel with rosettes found at an
antiques show, was so magnificent that May soon grew dissatisfied
with the rest of the house. He bought another 60 acres and asked
his architect to design an exercise room behind the library.
Eventually, they cut french doors across the back wall, opening to
a new terrace.
</P>
<P>
   But it still didn't feel right. ``It was never going to be the
ultimate house,'' May recalled, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   So he ordered the saltbox house ripped down and commissioned
Ferguson to design an elegant Georgian country house, with Roxbury
fieldstone, a Doric portico and a hipped roof with a cupola and
widow's walk. Outside, Ferguson designed courtyards, terraces, a
sunken garden and a pool casino with a columned pergola. But just
when Ferguson thought the complex was perfect, his patron has
decided he wants something more: a kind of separate loggia off the
front, a shady place to sit and look at the view and garden;
something with more openness than the screened-in porch, but less
than the pool pergola.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ferguson is drafting that, May, whose company, Triarc,
last year snagged Snapple at a bargain price, decided it was time
to tear down the three-car garage with the fan panels and classical
details, and design one for four cars, with a luxurious sitting
room and, overhead, a few bedrooms for guests. Oh, yes, and a large
porch big enough for chaise lounges and tables, so the guests can
relax.
</P>
<P>
   Who said the '90s were washed up?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ferguson, 43, met with May. They pored over the
latest set of plans around the antique French kitchen table chosen
by Bunny Williams, Ferguson's friend, who decorated the house.
</P>
<P>
   Tomato-red metal scaffolding had been set up outside, with raw
wood planks at varying levels, one with a Chinese Chippendale-style
chair on it, ready for decisions about the best level to set the
patio floor for viewing the mountains and the 4,000-square-foot
greenhouse the architect had designed, next to the farm pond the
owner had dredged.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson pondered the kind of clients attracted to his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Would he consider doing, say, a $200,000 house?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to do something for a client with modest means,'' he
replied, his voice tinged with regret. ``The problem is to support
the kind of labor, the details we specialize in, our expertise in
custom design.''
</P>
<P>
   Take one door in the Connecticut house. It's over eight-feet
tall and looks like something out of Castle Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find this door in a lumberyard,'' Ferguson began.
``It's mahogany with figured veneer on the panels, and then it's
French polished. It's hung on unlacquered 5-by-5-inch ball-bearing
hinges with acorn finials. Then, you have the casing:
five-and-a-half-inches wide, made of one-and-three-quarter-inch
poplar painted to imitate the faux limestone that lines the
hallway's walls. This is not stock molding. It's milled with a
blade cut to a profile we designed, and it doesn't just go down to
the floor, it sits on plinth blocks. The threshold is made of oak
and, again, milled to a profile we designed. The latch is Baldwin;
the knobs are W.C. Vaughn Company.'' He took a breath.
</P>
<P>
   The price? About $6,000 for the door and door surround.
</P>
<P>
   There are 50 doors in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're journeymen,'' said Ferguson, a soft-spoken man with a
shock of blond hair, a perfect male-model type except for his ears,
which stick out just enough to make him look interesting. ``We're
architects with a small following. Not like the men who are doing
what we call `critical architecture,' people like Peter Eisenman.
They're interested in beauty and taste and the conventional things,
too. But at the same time, they're working really hard at being
inventive.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Ferguson continued wryly, is that, ``If you're
trying to re-invent architecture with every project, well, not
everyone's talent is up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or everyone's education. Classicists like Ferguson (whose
architecture degree is from Princeton University) and his two
partners, Oscar Shamamian and, notably, Donald Rattner, a founder
of the Institute for the Study of Classical Architecture in New
York, bemoan the fact that few architecture schools teach anything
pre-Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Prince of Wales' Institute of Architecture, a London
group, has more or less collapsed _ Rattner says it has now
``turned away from its roots to include something more synchronized
with current tastes: modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a cabal,'' Ferguson said, with good humor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the classicists admit they are in the minority, their
work often evokes strong feelings. But to Samuel White, a
great-grandson of Stanford and the author of a new book on the old
firm, there are both good and bad things about the new
mega-mansions designed to look as if they had been built 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping through Ferguson's portfolio, he shook his head
admiringly. ``This guy is good, very good; these buildings are
beautiful,'' said White, an architect who also draws on classical
forms, but so far has stuck to smaller homes, perhaps 6,000 square
feet _ not 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   But to spend the kind of money involved _ Ferguson's Rennert
house has been estimated at $100 million _ makes a lot of people
nervous, even a descendant of Stanford White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only bothers me because I think there are some original,
wonderful big houses in need of restoration,'' White said. Beyond
that, he worries what will happen to these pipe dreams of
billionaires. ``Imagine trying to resell a 60,000-square-foot
house!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these giant homes _ too big for anyone but the men who
built them _ have found new lives as schools or museums. But that
is exactly what Rennert's neighbors in the Hamptons fear; in fact,
some worry that there is a secret agenda to immediately turn the
new mansion into a school _ an agenda the Rennerts' representatives
have denied, pointing out that if the house is turned into
something other than a single-family residence the town can revoke
its occupancy permits.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders of what others denigrate as excess ask what is
wrong with a man who creates his own fantasy _ whether classical,
modern or postmodern. After all, White pointed out: ``Stanford
White did the same with the Grand Trianon; he copied it as
Rosecliff for Tessie Oelrichs.'' The key is in the landscaping, he
added. ``These things become a joke if they're out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   While this kind of slavish attention to classical details and
proportion has been sneeringly labeled ``replicative'' (by the
architect Charles Gwathmey) and worse (by others), White wondered
if the clients are happy with what they have created. ``I would
have to ask the owners if they're comfortable in the houses,'' he
concluded, ``and if they are, then God bless 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   May, the man who hired Ferguson to design and redesign his
estate in Connecticut, said he is comfortable not only in the
house, but with the architectural style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like classical architecture,'' he said. ``It's an issue of
details. I like details. I have friends who appreciate the more
clean-lined architects: total form over function.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in having a house by Charles Gwathmey or
the latest Frank Gehry,'' he concluded. ``It's just not what I want
to live with. I'd get bored with ultra-simplicity.'' He shrugged.
``Besides, I just love projects.''

WHY NOT WEAR SNEAKERS TO THE BALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if Cinderella wore sneakers to the ball?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a crazy thought. But fashion is supposed to make you
ask ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at Giorgio Armani. This fall, he has introduced a
revolutionary sneaker that he wants women to wear to formal
functions and on their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. His $195 numbers are meant to be worn with long
evening dresses and skirts and business pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty lace-up sneakers come in charcoal gray, olive, and
black. The fabrics include satin, wool flannel, neoprene, and
suede.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds too outrageous for Boston, think again. A
spokeswoman for Emporio Armani, where the shoes are sold
exclusively, reports the sneakers are hot with corporate types and
students.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure. The sneakers run circles around stiletto
heels ... and glass slippers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oilily established itself years ago as a fun clothing chain for
children. Its funky, brightly colored garments are memorable
because of extras like animal ear flaps, angel wings, and a fat
cartoonish character image named Blap.
</P>
<P>
   Some mothers started squeezing themselves into the kids'
clothing, so Oilily started a women's line eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those clothes are now so hot that this month Oilily opened its
first exclusively women's shop in the nation at 32 Newbury St.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ based in the Netherlands and with stores from
Switzerland to Indonesia _ is selling casual clothes and work wear
to women who want to branch out from wardrobes filled with solids.
</P>
<P>
   At Oilily, you'll find floral prints, plaids, stripes, and rich
designs in colors like bright orange, blue, yellow, and red. Prices
range from $75 for a blouse to to $350 for outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   So amid the sea of gray this season, now there's color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rose is probably the most famous model/actress you'd never
recognize. That's because she's a hand model who's appeared in more
than 5,000 television commercials and print ads since 1954. She's
soaked in Palmolive with Madge, held a coffee mug for Taster's
Choice, and iced a cake for Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old's hands are so soft and unwrinkled that Madison
Avenue has used them as stand-ins for Cybill Shepherd's, Candice
Bergen's, and Lauren Hutton's for various commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who lives in South Pasadena, Calif., used to apply heavy
creams and sleep in gloves to get her hands camera ready. But she
says, ``I kept wishing someone would make a simple hand product
that achieved the same results as my complex regimen.'' Finally,
Rose decided to invent one herself.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's introducing the Linda Rose Hand Care System, which
includes a hand cream and protective gel for $45. There's also a
$30 nail and cuticle serum. They're all designed to keep hands
looking young and they're available at Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Palmolive as hand softener.

TRAVEL BRIEFS CORRECTION FOR ITEM OF OCTOBER 18 
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors: The item below was sent in advance for Sunday, October
18. If used please correct. If you still have, please note that
Gandhi's name should not appear as one of the world leaders who
have been entertained on the vessel, which was launched in 1953.
Gandhi died in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Britannia's Gangplank Lowers for the People &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, world leaders including Nelson Mandela and Tony
Blair have been entertained aboard the Britannia, the luxurious
vessel used by Queen Elizabeth and her family around the world. On
Wednesday (Oct. 21), the 412-foot yacht, which has recently been
refurbished, opened to the public for tours at the port of Leith,
two miles from the center of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia, launched on April 16, 1953, was decommissioned
last Dec. 11. Technically a Royal Navy ship, the yacht has sailed
more than a million miles.
</P>
<P>
   Budgetary constraints have much to do with the Britannia's new
role as a tourist attraction. British taxpayers spent $160 million
maintaining the yacht over the last 10 years, and a major refit
would have prolonged her life for only a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors reach the ship through a visitor center designed by Sir
Terence Conran. Its centerpiece will be the yacht's 41-foot tender
floating in a pool. Britannia's original wheelhouse will also be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, visitors will be guided around Britannia's five
decks by an audio tour. The bridge, the state dining room, drawing
room and the Royal Apartments _ as they were when occupied by the
royal family, with white walls, bronze metalwork and dark mahogany
woodwork _ will be viewed through door-sized glass panels. The
engine room, the captain's cabin and the galleys are also on the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia will be open daily except Christmas. A shuttle bus
will run from Princes Street and from Waverley Station in
Edinburgh. Tickets will be about $10, and must be booked in
advance.

were two of the top high school quarterbacks in the country and
developed a friendship while traveling together on several
recruiting trips. Couch finally landed at Kentucky where he has
shattered several SEC records and will likely be a high pick in the
NFL draft in 1999 or 2000. Carter is beginning his first season as
Georgia's quarterback after a couple of years of minor-league
baseball. Their paths will finally cross on the football field
Saturday when the Bulldogs meet the Wildcats in Lexington.

<P>
   Q. I've heard about off-site data storage. How does it work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Think of off-site data storage as a safe deposit box for
backup copies of your computer's files. While safeguarding against
typical crises like hard drive failures, destructive viruses,
accidental file deletion or a power surge from a storm or faulty
electrical system, off-site storage also insures the safety of
files from environmental disasters like floods and fires, as well
as from computer theft and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Off-site storage companies have various services and methods of
handling files. Backing up files over the Internet is fast becoming
the most popular method of off-site storage. Most online backup
companies store your data by copying files from your computer to
one of theirs via modem and the company's special software of
choice. The software can automate the entire process, scheduling
the sessions and dialing the phone for you. Files copied over the
phone lines can also be retrieved in the same way for quick
restoration in the event of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   There are several companies that will also offer to make a
CD-ROM of your data and mail it to you on a regular basis so you
have fairly recent copies of your files on hand. If you are
concerned about confidentiality, make sure the off-site service you
choose offers password protection and encryption of your files.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have Internet access and still want off-site
storage, there are places that will provide you with postage-paid
mailers to send in your own backup tapes and disks. The company
will store them safely for you and nag you when it is time to back
up again, and in the event of a crisis, will send back the files
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Off-site storage prices start at about $20 a month. A Web search
will turn up a selection of companies that offer the service,
including Offsite Data Management Services (www.odms.com),
Connected Online Backup (www.connected.com) and Mailsafe
(www.cyberhost9.net/msoffsit).

MAIL ORDER: THE MORE, THE MERRIER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the holiday season approaches, postal bags are
swelling to Santa-size proportions with mail-order catalogs. This
week, there will be two new arrivals in the mail _ both from small
downtown design stores that are new to the mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, David Shearer and his wife, Gail Schultz, opened
Totem, a TriBeCa store that sells contemporary furniture and
accessories by young European and American designers. When they
kept hearing from out-of-town customers that there was that nothing
like Totem where they lived, the couple decided to do a catalog.
They will mail 10,000 copies of DSGN, their magalog, as they call
it, all over the country. In addition to products _ from Umbra
plastic wastebaskets to Scandinavian upholstered furniture _ DSGN
includes brief articles about interior design and designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' Shearer said, ``and we're already
planning the next issue for spring.''
</P>
<P>
   To order a catalog, call (888) 519-5587. For shoppers who prefer
browsing on the Web to perusing a catalog, www.totemdesign.com is
up and running.
</P>
<P>
   This week's other catalog debut is from Troy, a shop on Greene
Street in SoHo that sells '60s, '70s and contemporary home design.
Troy Halterman, the owner, isn't mailing his holiday gift brochure
outside New York City, though. The first 5,000 copies are for
``sophisticated New Yorkers,'' Halterman said. ``This one is a
test. If the response is good, there will be others.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog can be folded into a little box, with graphics that
recall the gift box the store had made specially for mailing
fragile objects. ``We think our new gift box is itself worth
keeping,'' Halterman said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Mxyplyzyk, the Greenwich Village shop known for
well-designed furniture and gifts will mail out its first catalog.
Kevin Brynan and Kevin Terpstra, the co-owners, are hard at work on
the venture. They, too, have had frequent inquiries from
out-of-towners who assume the store already has a catalog. Hang in,
shoppers: something to look forward to after the holidays.

FAMED EDITOR HAROLD EVANS NOW HAS BOOK TO HIS CREDIT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tan, trim, impossibly dapper, Harold Evans does not
defeat expectations. Opening the door to the Sutton Place duplex he
and Tina Brown, his wife and fellow famous editor, share with their
two children, Evans is the very model of a modern media general,
right down to his suspenders (red), cuffs (French), and accent
(British).
</P>
<P>
   He's just back from London and slightly jet-lagged, but the
whirlwind vigor that helped gain him one of the most glittering
resumes in journalism and publishing is soon evident. Evans may be
70, but he looks closer to 50. And talking about his new book,
``The American Century,'' he sounds more like 20, such is his
enthusiasm for this phone-book-size ``history for browsers,'' as
Evans calls it, that chronicles the United States in the years
between 1889 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that Evans should be eager to talk about
the new book. Clearly, ``The American Century'' is a labor of love,
a work 12 years in the writing, and 40-plus in the contemplating.
``As early as 1956,'' Evans says, recalling his first visit to the
United States, ``I wanted to write a book about America and freedom
and the romance and the nearness of the history ... to put my arms
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   His eagerness to discuss the book makes sense for another
reason: It means Evans is talking about something other than what
he dismisses as ``the small change of Grub Street,'' which has
dogged him for much of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he surrendered one high-powered post, president of
Random House, for another, editorial director for Mortimer
Zuckerman, the real estate tycoon who owns US News &AMP; World Report,
the (N.Y.) Daily News, The Atlantic Monthly, and the Boston-based
business journal Fast Company. (The publisher of Evans's book,
Alfred A. Knopf, makes it a condition of this interview that he not
be asked about his departure from Random House.)
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Evans has focused on US News, which is currently
running a 10-part series drawn from the book, and the Daily News.
By design, Evans's duties have remained vaguely defined. ``The job
of the editors is to edit the papers,'' Evans has said. Is his job,
then, to edit the editors? ``You know,'' he replies, ``(Walter)
Bagehot said of the monarchy: The job is to advise, warn, and
encourage.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's pointed out this analogy carries an implicit
assumption _ for that matter, Evans would seem to have the makings
of quite a good sovereign _ he barks out a laugh and shakes his
head. ``The commoner who would be king,'' he mutters, then changes
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it in terms of prime ministers or presidents
or what-have-you,'' says Zuckerman of his longtime friend's role
(Zuckerman is godfather to Evans's daughter Isabel and was among
the dozen or so guests when he married Brown). ``We're just all
working together to improve the editorial product.''

</P>
<P>
   At Random House, Evans enjoyed perhaps the highest profile in
book publishing. Now he's a self-described ``invisible man''
working behind the editorial scenes. ``If people say, `Harry's
doing nothing,' that's fine with me,'' he told The New York Times
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later he got back some of his old visibility, courtesy
of the highly messy firing of US News editor James Fallows. Fallows
told the staff he'd been dispatched by Zuckerman. Evans quickly
released a statement saying the decision had been his, telling The
Washington Post, ``I have not been known simply to be a lap dog.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it was his aggressive independence that had
established Evans's reputation. He grew up in the north of England,
the son of working-class parents. One can still hear a hint of
Yorkshire and Durham in his u's. ``When I was young,'' he says, ``I
was very conscious of the fact I spoke with a northern accent and
my father drove a train and I hadn't been to the right school.''
After 15 years working as a reporter and editor at several
provincial papers, he was hired in 1966 as chief assistant to the
editor of The Sunday Times of London. Within a year, he was editor,
a post he held until 1981. Evans put such a premium on
investigative reporting and crusading journalism that the paper was
sued 250 times (the Times won all but one of the suits). When
Rupert Murdoch purchased both the daily and Sunday Times, he put
Evans in charge of the former. Evans's struggle with Murdoch for
editorial control got Evans fired after 13 months _ and made him a
journalistic hero on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the United States in 1984, serving concurrently as
editorial director of US News and editor-in-chief of Atlantic
Monthly Press (at the time, owned by Zuckerman). In 1986, he became
founding editor of the magazine Conde Nast Traveler, before taking
over Random House four years later.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that Evans was a high-wire act there. Publishing
insiders marveled at both his mastery of showmanship and relaxed
attitude toward the bottom line. A $6.5 million advance to Colin
Powell for ``My American Journey'' paid off handsomely. A $5
million investment in Marlon Brando's memoirs barely broke even.
Spending $2.5 million on a book by disgraced Clinton political
adviser Dick Morris proved a costly error.
</P>
<P>
   What is in dispute is why the act ended when it did. Was it that
an opportunity to return to journalism was irresistible to a
bred-in-the-bone newsman (Evans's line)? Or did a shaky balance
sheet mean he had to jump before being pushed (the consensus view
on Publishers Row)?
</P>
<P>
   Evans has been assiduous in promoting the former view, going so
far as to threaten suit against an English magazine, The Spectator,
that had portrayed him as having been forced out. And according to
The New York Observer, when Vanity Fair assigned a profile of Evans
that promised to be unflattering he refused to talk to reporter
David Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   Even his wife's much-publicized departure from The New Yorker in
July might be seen as having its uncomfortable aspects for Evans.
Being married to Brown, 44, has unquestionably added to his cachet.
With them as Zeus and Hera atop media Olympus, no other couple need
apply. Harry and Tina stand where once stood Henry and Clare Booth
Luce, then Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn (Evans and Brown were wed at
the latter's Hamptons summer home in 1981).

</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the couple's balance in editorial throw weight
has shifted. In ``Good Times, Bad Times,'' Evans's 1983 memoir of
Murdochian double-dealing, the index entry for Brown reads, ``see
Evans, Tina.'' Things have changed a good deal since then. Both his
leaving Random House and her leaving The New Yorker were Page 1
stories in The New York Times. Only she made it above the fold,
though. (The one other interview condition is no questions about
Brown's new magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked about events of the past year generally, Evans is
characteristically upbeat. ``I'm very happy professionally,'' he
says. He professes amusement when it's pointed out he's now entered
his eighth decade. ``I can't conceive of leading `a life of
leisure,' heading out to the golf course each morning, that kind of
thing,'' he laughs. ``I just have to stay intellectually engaged or
I wouldn't be able to function. Perhaps this is a character defect,
that one has to keep going. I suppose I can't relax really, except
in my work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Century'' is a case in point. ``I am
persistent,'' Evans says, describing a regimen of rising each
morning at 5 to work on the book till 9 a.m. (with time out for a
daily swim), and devoting weekends, holidays, and vacations to it.
</P>
<P>
   Even when socializing he did research _ though what he learned
was dismaying to a self-confessed ``immigrant in love with the
romance of America.'' What had started out as an exercise in
self-improvement _ among Evans's hobbies, Who's Who lists ``boning
up on US history'' _ became what he hopes will be a contribution to
general civic education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go out to a dinner party and try to pump somebody about
their views on, say, FDR's court-packing plan or the Great
Depression, and finally it would come out that they didn't really
know what it was all about. It might sound simplistic to say this,
but coming here in '56 and then as a newspaper editor from England
where I'd faced many, many (legal) restrictions, I came to a more
vivid realization of the nature of American freedom than many
Americans who take it for granted do.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans regards ``the power of freedom'' as his book's ``essential
thesis.'' It's a power he has come to appreciate all the more,
presumably, since November. Or at least, when asked about the bad
press he's gotten over the past year (a fairly novel experience for
Evans), it's freedom he adverts to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the free exchange of ideas. I think back on
what I wrote (in his new book) about Near v. Minnesota. It was a
case where a racist newspaper, a vile sheet, really, was being
prosecuted. The Supreme Court, ruling in its favor, said that
freedom is not confined to the virtuous, and you have to believe
that. Free speech doesn't mean just things you like. I take a
completely philosophical view of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He delivers these words impressively, as an oration almost.
(Hearing Evans discuss his book, one suspects he could do for a PBS
version of ``The American Century'' what Shelby Foote did for Ken
Burns's ``The Civil War.'') Such eloquence makes a guest feel
somewhat awkward when he expresses puzzlement at these remarks. It
was Evans, wasn't it, who threatened to sue The Spectator?
</P>
<P>
   Evans's voice tightens, his warm manner disappears. ``I don't
want to go into that. It's small beer, simply a question of fact.
If you're dealing in fact, try to get the facts right, that's
all.''

   GLENN _ After a 36-year hiatus, space pioneer John Glenn is set
to return to orbit today. The Space Shuttle Discovery is scheduled
to blast off at 2 p.m. EDT, launching Glenn and his six crewmates
on a nearly nine-day science mission that includes experiments to
study the aging process. Glenn became the first American to orbit
the Earth on Feb. 20, 1962, when he flew his Mercury capsule
Friendship Seven on a four-hour, 55-minute mission that circled the
earth three times. This mission will mark the first space shuttle
flight by one of America's original seven Mercury astronauts and
will make Glenn, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space by 16
years. Glenn has emphasized the importance of his aging experiments
since NASA announced his selection for the flight in January. But
science is likely to take a back seat today to the sheer wonderment
of outer space. Despite Glenn's previous flight, retired space
shuttle pilot Joe Engle says Glenn is in for the experience of his
life. Glenn was strapped tightly into a tiny capsule on his first
flight, and his views of earth and space were limited to a small
window and a periscope. This time, Engle says, he will be able to
float out of his seat and drift up to the orbiter's large overhead
windows. When aimed at the earth, the two big windows ``are like a
glass bottom boat,'' Engle said. Engle said that moment, which he
experienced as pilot of the second space shuttle flight, stands out
above everything else he has done. ``It made the hairs stand up on
the back of my neck.'' So it's likely to be for Glenn, but don't
count on hearing him talk about it, etc. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily
News). 30-40.

HAVE A LAUGH OVER CELL-PHONE NATURALISTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At long last, for the modern outdoorsperson who has everything,
there is a camouflage cell phone shaped like an ancient
moss-encrusted tree root and capable of linking one to imperiled
rain forests and wetlands round the planet.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not really. But it's the kind of thing that comes to mind
when reading David Brooks's very funny piece, ``Cell Phone
Naturalists,'' in the Oct. 26 issue of  &UR; The Weekly Standard &LR; . The
article examines how the perennial war between nature lovers and
technology lovers may be gradually eclipsed by the _ dare we utter
it! _ compromise politics of a new generation of Cell Phone
Naturalists. These are the folks who believe in technology as much
as the nature they profess to love, the engineers and programmers
who may rarely venture into the wilderness, but head to work
dressed as though they just wandered off K1. The CPN doesn't so
much want to preserve nature. He wants to conquer it with Gore-Tex
and Polartec and water purifiers and, of course, his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks makes his observations from the throbbing heart of Kevlar
Kulture itself: the REI outdoors store in Seattle. Like any normal
person who wanders into such a place, Brooks is as daunted by the
myriad chemically engineered clothing options as by the humongous
calves of the salespeople. In the end, he cites a few cases in
which environmentalists and capitalists have found common cause of
late, without quite saying whether this is good or bad. But it's an
interesting piece, worth a read if only for its riotous beginning.
</P>

   With President Clinton's unique method of curing cigars seared
in our memory, we rushed to this month's cigar press to see if the
presidential peccadillo had triggered a surge in cigar sales or
caused the Cuban economy to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, there was not a single mention of Monica,
although there were many sultry-eyed brunettes suggestively
fingering stogies. We did, however, stumble upon a gripping story
in the October  &UR; Cigar Aficionado  &LR; about a man called Aram Setian, a
testosterone-fueled individual who road-tests Mercedes-Benzes by
hurtling across the American terrain ever in search of craggier
peaks and more brutal temperatures. They call him the Benz Breaker.
</P>
<P>
   His is an astounding job, a road warrior fantasy come true _ if
you don't mind sitting on your fanny for 14 hours at a stretch.
Setian, a defector from the Bulgarian Red Army who looks
disappointingly like a vacuum cleaner repairman with a bad haircut,
spends his days ricocheting across the Southwest pushing his luxury
V-12 to speeds above 100 mph. Sometimes he is part of a convoy of
as many as 25 prototypes. Why don't we ever see these automotive
avalanches hurtling by on the highway? Because they're concealed
from consumers by screwed-on sheet metal camouflages, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the driving day, the road warriors unwind big time
over amber liquid and, of course, cigars. Aficionado that he is,
Setian keeps a couple of Upmanns in his computer case and
occasionally sneaks across the Mexican border for replenishments.
And what do the boys do after coffee? Our story does not let on.
Suffice it to say that there is presumably not a lot of road dust
left on them by the time they are done.

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Among the flock of new magazines that has appeared on the
newsstands in recent years,  &UR; DoubleTake  &LR; has always seemed
something of a conundrum. A glossy quarterly featuring photography,
features, fiction, and poetry, the three-year-old magazine often
seemed to be groping for an identity. Sometimes it worked,
beautifully. Sometimes it was self-important and annoying. Either
way, one always wondered just who was reading all those terribly
literate pieces, not to mention paying the $10-per-issue newsstand
price.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever they are, they'd do well to buy the fall issue, which is
rumored to be its second to last. Of several very good articles,
the best is a short, low-billed gem about a botanist in Ecuador who
hits the homicide beat with a tabloid newspaper reporter to see if
he can't learn a ``trick or two about reporting extinctions.'' He
does. Sort of. He witnesses his first corpse, a man who choked on
his potato soup at a bar, lying in a field. The botanist watches
some women in baseball hats watching the dead man. He makes note of
the plants growing about the cadaver. (He is a good writer and not
just for a botanist.) He goes with the reporter to a couple of
funerals. He goes to a press conference. And then he gets on the
bus back to the forest where he works and reflects upon how when a
tree dies, how very quiet it is.
</P>
<P>
   It is a colorful bit of writing and just the kind of piece that
may go homeless in a world without DoubleTake. Also in the issue is
an interesting interview with Cambridge filmmaker Frederick
Wiseman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Halloween is right around the corner and if you happen to be
wondering what are the deadliest things in the world, the October
issue of the men's magazine  &UR; Maxim  &LR; is here to tell you. The list
includes: The curse on the Hope Diamond. Washington D.C. Fugu, a
Japanese dish prepared from puffer fish and from which the natural
poison is not always entirely removed. Working as a keyboardist for
the Grateful Dead (three have already died.) Candy apples don't
even make the list.

 &HT;    VISA BILL TO FUND NEW JOB TRAINING, SCHOLARSHIPS
 &HT;    Revises grafs 4-5 to correct how Labor Department will use fee
revenue.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New visa legislation approved Wednesday by Congress
as part of the massive omnibus spending bill will generate about
$71 million to improve job-training programs and provide
scholarships for U.S. workers and students.
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B visa measure, sought by the high-tech community, boosts
the number of visas for highly skilled foreign workers from 65,000
to 115,000 next year. Employers argued that a tight labor market
has left them strapped for trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   One way Americans will benefit is from the higher $500 fee
employers must pay for each visa they apply for and renew.
</P>
<P>
   The bill dictates that the Labor Department receive 63 percent
of the fee revenue _ about $47.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to a consortium of businesses, training
providers and other entities to help high-tech and other industries
identify what skills they need in workers and develop strategies to
improve current job training programs, said Cecilia Rouse, a
special assistant to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation will receive 32 percent of the
fees _ about $24 million _ to establish a new scholarship fund for
low-income students studying mathematics, engineering or computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   Associate, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to
apply once the foundation sets up the program, which is not
expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
   David Stonner(cq), head of congressional affairs for the
foundation, said it faces numerous challenges in assuming a new
role as scholarship provider.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now awards 10,000 new grants and fellowships each
year, but has no scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   One problem will be with staffing, Stonner said. The bill did
not allocate any money for additional staff, although a deluge of
applications will have to be processed for the expected 10,000 new
scholarships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stonner said one solution may be to enter a cooperative
agreement with a university or scholarship fund that already
administers scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Other challenges will be in setting up criteria for who will
receive the scholarships and deciding how that money will be
divided among associate, undergraduate and graduate students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have within Congress a reputation of doing things well and
rising to challenges,'' Stonner said. ``This is going to be a real
challenge, because the parameters have yet to be written and the
fact that it is open to a variety of educational experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent of the fee revenue from the visas will
be used by the Labor Department to speed up processing of the new
visas and other program expenses.

employers must pay for each visa they apply for and renew.
</P>
<P>
   The bill dictates that the Labor Department receive 63 percent
of the fee revenue _ about $47.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to a consortium of businesses, training
providers and other entities to help high-tech and other industries
identify what skills they need in workers and develop strategies to
improve current job training programs, said Cecilia Rouse, a
special assistant to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation will receive 32 percent of the
fees _ about $24 million _ to establish a new scholarship fund for
low-income students studying mathematics, engineering or computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   Associate, undergraduate and graduate students will be able to
apply once the foundation sets up the program, which is not
expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
   David Stonner(cq), head of congressional affairs for the
foundation, said it faces numerous challenges in assuming a new
role as scholarship provider.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation now awards 10,000 new grants and fellowships each
year, but has no scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   One problem will be with staffing, Stonner said. The bill did
not allocate any money for additional staff, although a deluge of
applications will have to be processed for the expected 10,000 new
scholarships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stonner said one solution may be to enter a cooperative
agreement with a university or scholarship fund that already
administers scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Other challenges will be in setting up criteria for who will
receive the scholarships and deciding how that money will be
divided among associate, undergraduate and graduate students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have within Congress a reputation of doing things well and
rising to challenges,'' Stonner said. ``This is going to be a real
challenge, because the parameters have yet to be written and the
fact that it is open to a variety of educational experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 5 percent of the fee revenue from the visas will
be used by the Labor Department to speed up processing of the new
visas and other program expenses.

   TAKE-BOS  
 (Undated): ... ``smaller loaves'' HONEY-CURRY BREAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   This bright yellow, fragrant, and wonderfully chewy bread comes
from ``The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook'' (Workman, 1984), by
Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins. With its intense flavor, it works
equally well as toast (Rosso and Lukins suggest spreading it with
lime marmalade), sandwiches (great in combination with any
chutney), and pull-apart rolls. It's always a big hit with my
nephew at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   3 packages active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup honey
</P>
<P>
   2 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   6 to 7 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter (for pull-apart loaves)
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/2 cup of water into a large bowl, stir in the yeast, and
let stand 5 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan and stir in the
curry powder. Cook over low heat for 1 minute. Stir in the honey
and remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add the honey mixture, buttermilk, salt, and 3 cups of the flour
to the yeast mixture. Stir it with a wooden spoon to mix well.
Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft
dough.
</P>
<P>
   Knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dough in a well-buttered bowl and turn to coat the
dough with butter. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm
place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Punch the dough down and divide it in half. Shape into standard
loaves or pull-apart loaves. Cover and let rise for about 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the pull-apart loaves, roll out half the dough lightly into
a rectangle about 12 inches by 18. Paint with melted butter. Cut
the rectangle lengthwise into 3 equal strips and then stack them
one on top of the other. Then make 4 equally spaced crosswise cuts
in the stacked strips. Place the 5 stacks on edge in a buttered or
oiled loaf pan so that the layers form a long row down the length
of the pan. Paint liberally with melted butter in between the
stacks and over the top after fitting all of them in the pan. Cover
and let rise as above.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg and 2 teaspoons of water in a small bowl. Brush the
tops of the loaves with the egg wash. Sprinkle each loaf with the
almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the loaves are brown and sound hollow when the
bottoms are lightly thumped, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on wire racks
to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 standard or pull-apart loaves.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
SOUR CREAM BREAD
</P>
<P>
   This exquisitely rich bread is from ``Beard on Bread,'' by James
Beard (Knopf, 1973). It's wonderful for toast and sandwiches, and
the delicate texture of the dough makes it a pleasure to knead. It
also is a good candidate for the pull-apart loaves described above.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup warm water (100 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sour cream, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Combine the yeast, sugar, and water, and allow to proof for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Put the sour cream, salt, and soda in a mixing bowl. Add the
yeast mixture. Then add 4 cups of the flour, cup by cup, to make a
very wet, sticky dough, beating hard with a wooden spoon after each
addition.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape out onto a lightly floured board. Using a baker's
scraper, lift the flour and the dough, and fold the dough over.
Turn it clockwise slightly and repeat the lifting and folding
process until the dough is less sticky and can be worked with your
hands. Add only enough flour to prevent sticking. (This entire
kneading should take about 10 minutes, possibly longer if you are
inexperienced.) Shape the dough into a ball, place in a buttered
bowl, and turn to coat it with the butter. Cover with plastic and
let sit in a warm spot to double in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Punch the dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured board and
knead for a minute, then divide into 2 equal pieces. Butter two
9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf tins. Shape the dough into loaves and fit
into the tins. Cover loosely and let rise again until doubled. Bake
in a preheated 375-degree oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the
loaves sound hollow when tapped on the top and bottom. Cool
thoroughly before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 loaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SEMOLINA BREAD
</P>
<P>
   This gorgeous golden loaf can be a delicious accompaniment for
Italian food or an unusual sandwich bread. Semolina flour used to
be available only in health food stores and Italian groceries, but
it's making its way into supermarket chains, usually in the pasta
section. Adapted from ``The Silver Palate Cookbook,'' by Julee
Rosso and Sheila Lukins (Workman, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 cups lukewarm water (105 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   1 package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups semolina flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 cups bread flour or unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   Sesame seeds (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Pour the water into a mixing bowl, stir in the yeast, and let
stand for 10 minutes. Stir again to be certain the yeast is
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Add the semolina flour and salt, and stir well.
</P>
<P>
   Add 2 cups of the bread flour and stir to make a sticky dough.
Turn the dough out onto a work surface and let it rest while you
wash and dry the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Begin kneading the dough, sprinkling the remaining cup of bread
flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to your hands. After
about 10 minutes, the dough will be smooth and elastic and will
have absorbed more or less the last cup of flour.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the dough into a ball and place it in the bowl. Pour the
olive oil over the dough and turn it several times to coat with the
oil. Cover the bowl with a towel and set aside until the dough has
tripled in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Punch down the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured
surface, knead briefly (5 minutes or less), and return it to the
bowl. Cover again and let rise until doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Punch down the dough, cut it into thirds, and shape each third
into a thin loaf about 24 inches long. Sprinkle a baking sheet with
3 to 4 tablespoons of cornmeal and arrange the loaves on the sheet,
leaving as much room as possible between them. Cover and let rise
until not quite doubled, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Beat together the egg and 1 tablespoon of water. When the loaves
have risen, brush them well with this egg wash. Sprinkle the sesame
seeds (if using) and make decorative diagonal cuts on top of the
loaves with a sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Slide the baking sheet onto the middle rack of the oven and
reduce the heat to 375. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the
loaves are brown and sound hollow when the bottoms are thumped.
(For a crisper bottom crust, remove the loaves from the baking
sheet and place them directly on the oven rack for the last 5 to 10
minutes of baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the loaves from the oven and cool on a rack. Wrap when
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 loaves, about 18 inches long.

HANDS-ON BREADMAKING STILL PRODUCES SPECIAL RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DEBORAH P. JACOBS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bread machine offers an idyllic vision: waking in the
morning to the aroma of a freshly baked loaf; watching from a safe
distance, dry and clean, as it manhandles that sticky brioche
dough; turning out batches of holiday breads without breaking a
sweat. Before entering this yeasty utopia, however, a few hard
questions must be confronted: Where will I find space for it next
to the coffee maker, microwave, and toaster? Isn't $150 or $200 a
lot, especially for something I may end up not using? And _ most
difficult of all _ isn't making bread something that's meant to be
done by hand?
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, many people have been deterred by such questions.
According to an appliance buyer for Crate &AMP; Barrel, the market for
bread machines has flattened out. Everyone who's going to buy one
already has, the theory goes, and the remainder of the population
remains uncertain or unwilling.
</P>
<P>
   If, like me, you've so far found yourself in the second camp,
you probably love the tactile joy of the dough taking shape under
your hands, and the aromas and tastes that reward your efforts.
Even giving up a large part of a day to the process doesn't seem
like too much of a sacrifice to us die-hard hands-on bread makers.
</P>
<P>
   However, technologically naive bakers find their time limited,
too. When I set aside several hours to produce that perfect loaf, I
want it to be a standout. That doesn't mean impractical _ something
that will go with one meal or appetizer and then get lost in the
freezer _ just special. The recipes that follow, all longtime
favorites, can make a splash at a holiday table or with your
morning coffee. Some can double as top-notch dinner rolls and
stellar sandwich bread.
</P>
<P>
   They're so good, in fact, that even those who love their bread
machines may want to try them _ with or without the machine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHOCOLATE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   From Carol Field's ``The Italian Baker'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1985),
this not-too-sweet bread, studded with chocolate chips, is divine
with coffee, spread with a little butter or cream cheese. Field
also suggests red wine as an accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 teaspoons (1 package) active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch process
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups warm water
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup semisweet chips
</P>
<P>
   Stir the yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar into the 1/3 cup plus 1
tablespoon water in a large mixing bowl. Let stand until foamy,
about 10 minutes. Mix the flour, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of
sugar, cocoa, and salt. Stir the 1 1/4 cups of water, egg yolk, and
butter into the dissolved yeast, then stir in the flour mixture, 1
cup at a time. Stir in the chocolate chips last. Knead on a lightly
floured surface until velvety, elastic, and moist, 8 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic
wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Punch the dough down and cut in half on a lightly floured
surface. Shape each piece into a round or oval loaf and place on
oiled baking sheets. Or place in a loaf pan if you prefer this
shape. Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the
heat to 375 and bake 30 minutes longer. Cool completely on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 round, oval, or square loaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
RAISIN BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Another wonderful bread from Carol Field's ``The Italian
Baker.'' The amount given for the raisins may look like a mistake,
but it's not _ the end product is about half dough and half
raisins.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufrecipe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   About 3 cups golden or dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   3 3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon malted grain syrup or liquid malt extract (or
substitute 1 teaspoon brown sugar)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus 2 to 3 tablespoons
for the raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   Soak the raisins in water to cover (cool water for the golden
raisins, warm water for the dark) at room temperature for 1 1/2
hours. Drain the raisins; warm 1 1/3 cups of the raisin water for
the yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the yeast, malt, and sugar into the raisin water in a large
mixing bowl; let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the
butter. Mix together the 3 3/4 cups flour and the salt. Stir the
flour mixture, 2 cups at a time, into the yeast mixture. Knead on a
lightly floured surface until firm, elastic, and silky, 4 to 5
minutes. You will find that the dough comes together quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Without
punching the dough down or kneading it, pat it gently with your
palms or roll with a rolling pin into a circle about 14 inches in
diameter. The dough will be slightly sticky and tacky. Pat the
raisins dry and toss with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the flour. Work the
raisins into the dough in 3 phases: Sprinkle a third of the raisins
over the dough, turn in the sides, and roll it up. Flatten the
dough with your palms and sprinkle with half the remaining raisins.
Roll up and let the dough rest under a towel until relaxed and easy
to work again, about 15 minutes. Pat the dough as flat as you can
and sprinkle with the remaining raisins. Try to get in as many as
you can, but don't worry if you can't incorporate them all _ this
is an extraordinary amount of raisins.
</P>
<P>
   Roll up the dough into a long, slightly tapered loaf. You may
either bake it as 1 long loaf or cut it in half for 2 shorter
loaves. Tuck the ends of the loaf under and try to keep the raisins
under the taut surface of the skin. Place the loaf on a lightly
floured peel, a lightly oiled baking sheet, or a baking sheet lined
with parchment paper. Cover with a towel and let rise until well
puffed and almost, but not quite, doubled, about 1 hour. Roll the
loaf gently back and forth to set the shape before baking and check
that the ends are tucked under.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Bake 5 for minutes. Reduce the
heat to 400 and bake 40 minutes longer. Cool completely on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 large or 2 smaller loaves.

CAN COMPANIES WHOSE VALUE TUMBLE STILL COMPETE?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND STEVE BAILEY 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a stock, Shiva Corp. was damaged goods for two years before
Intel Corp. came along and agreed to buy the Bedford-based computer
networking company this week.
</P>
<P>
   Its competitive future in doubt, Shiva had seen its stock sink
steadily from more than $80 per share to astonishing single-digit
lows. Intel's final offer: $6 per share.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But there many other technology companies that have plunged
into stocks slumps nearly as dire this year, and only in a matter
of months.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies that have lost 50 percent to 75 percent of their
stock value over the last year number in the dozens. They have all
suffered some kind of setback, but many remain viable businesses
with solid balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   If Shiva finally attracted a buyer with cash, are other wounded
tech stocks likely to be swallowed in a wave of post-correction
mergers?
</P>
<P>
   Some, but fewer of any meaningful size than you might think,
according to analysts, institutional investors and investment
bankers who follow technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many local companies are so cheap they could be bought and
mostly paid for with their own cash today. But they have become so
small that big buyers probably couldn't be bothered.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 local high-tech companies holding net cash (cash
and short-term securities minus debt) equal to between 50 percent
and 177 percent of their stock market value, according to data
prepared for Boston Capital by Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the high-tech
investment banking firm. But only two of those companies had a
market value of more than $50 million and all were small enough to
be considered micro-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even among larger battered tech stocks, just being cheap isn't
enough. Those companies may become attractive if they have
particularly good products that would expand a buyer's line; can
boast a large ``embedded'' base of customers that are likely to
stay &UR;  &LR;  because they have invested in the company's technology; or
could help an acquirer reach new customers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see a lot of financial
engineering in the tech world,'' said Katherine Kirk, managing
director of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in Boston. ``You've got to look at
strategic comparisons in each case. If it's not there, it isn't
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like Damian Rinaldi of First Albany Corp. think most of
the fallen tech stocks are cheap for reasons that have to do with
poor fundamentals. But some local stocks have been discounted so
deeply they raise eyebrows. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. of Bedford, a leader in
computer security and encryption, has fallen from an April high of
42 1/2 to 12 yesterday. It traded as low as 6 two weeks ago.

   Security Dynamics made money for years selling authentication
systems for corporate computer users and later acquired RSA Data
Security, an Internet encryption leader. Now its original
authentication products are being challenged by new technology
using so-called ``digital certificates'' to make computer
communication and commerce secure _ a serious problem that has hurt
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But Security Dynamics, with a current market value of about $490
million, could still offer a bigger company a leading position in
the important computer security field and a huge embedded customer
base.
</P>
<P>
   Security Dynamics also owns a stake in Verisign Inc., a
competitor in the digital certificate field. The company's cash and
its investment in Verisign amounts to about $6.50 per share,
slightly more than half the stock's current price.

<P>
   _Aspen Technology Inc. of Cambrige, which makes software to run
factories and other facilities, has a big problem beyond its
control. Its customers are mostly in the oil business, which is
struggling through tough times today.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen shares plunged from 55 1/4 in July to 10 11/16 yesterday,
slicing the company's value by more than $1 billion to about $261
million.

<P>
   ``Their end-user markets are falling apart,'' said John Golden,
a technology analyst at John Hancock Mutual Funds. ``But I wouldn't
consider them down and out.''
</P>
<P>
   _Cabletron Systems Inc. of Rochester, N.H., was clobbered last
fall and stayed down. Shares of the once high-flying networking
company plunged from nearly 32 to 9 7/16 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cabletron doesn't have a premier product line or a big advantage
on next-generation technology. But it is of an interesting,
in-between size. Cabletron is large enough, with annual sales
approaching $1.5 billion, to draw the attention of huge and
acquisitive network companies like Cisco Systems Inc., but perhaps
not large enough to recover and thrive again on its own.

GARDEN NOTEBOOK: THE BLURRY IMAGES OF A FAMILY HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)  (lb) 
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Agnelli Gardens at Villar Perosa'' (Harry N.
Abrams, $75), is filled with fuzzy pictures of very beautiful
gardens in the Piedmont region of Italy, virtually secret gardens
that have never been opened to the public. They cover 25 acres
surrounding the Agnelli family seat in the village of Villar Perosa
30 miles north of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the pictures so fuzzy? Because the photographer, Marella
Caracciolo de Castagneto Agnelli, 71, the wife of Gianni Agnelli,
head of Fiat SpA since 1966, wants them that way, said her niece,
Marella Caracciolo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo, 33, and Mrs. Agnelli wrote the text for the
book, a history of the family as seen through its gardens. The
beautiful but impressionistic pictures hint at more than a taste
for witty abstraction. They underline a consistent attempt to
gauze-wrap any critical focus on a family that, in Italy, is seen
as comparable to the Kennedys _ that is, if the Kennedys controlled
the press, held the reins of society and ran the largest business
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Italian the film ``The Silence of the Lambs'' had to be
retitled (``Agnelli'' means ``lambs'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian collective unconscious wants them to be royalty,''
Ms. Caracciolo said. ``In the completely disruptive Italian
republic, they represent some kind of unifying force.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Agnelli, a photographer for Vogue in the 1950s, is perhaps
best remembered from a legendary 1950s Town &AMP; Country photograph by
Richard Avedon of her swanlike neck and fine Neapolitan nose.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades ago, she began shaping the villa's gardens. What
she had to start with were straggly terraces laid out in the late
18th century (before her husband's great-great-great-grandfather
bought the villa), a 19th-century limonaia, or orangery, a
neo-Gothic memorial chapel, a great lawn with Victorian specimen
trees _ and unlimited funds.
</P>
<P>
   She removed flower beds shouting with red salvias in favor of
features like an English woodland walk and a kitchen and cutting
garden.
</P>
<P>
   The late great English garden designer Russell Page _ creator of
the smaller garden in the courtyard of the Frick Collection in New
York and of hundreds of luxurious private gardens in Europe _ made
a series of lakes where there had once been a mountain ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Gae Aulenti, the Italian architect, designed a pool and pavilion
in the 1980s. A sculpture garden focuses on works by Henry Moore,
Max Ernst and Rene Magritte.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the almost-too-perfect gardens relate to the polished
public image created by Gianni and Marella Agnelli, Ms. Caracciolo
said, ``They have managed to make themselves into what they wish to
be, what they appear to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She insists the gardens are not Byronic. ``This is the
antithesis of the romantic garden,'' she said. ``It's not about
melancholy at all, or about nature. It's about man as the master of
the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   As a favored niece, Ms. Caracciolo had access to write the book,
but was under an obligation not to betray the family. All the
family mistakes have been kept within the family fortress, its
exterior smoothed by money and tight-lipped stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, it says, ``Villar Perosa had to remain an oasis
apparently untouched by the events of reality.'' The book alludes
only in passing to the Allies' bombing the villa during World War
II, and the Agnelli hankerings for ``fast cars, gambling, beautiful
women.''
</P>
<P>
   A garden history of Villar Perosa might not be the place to air
the Agnellis' documented collaboration with the fascists. But it
seems too much of a gloss to say, as the book does, that ``after
1940 and Italy's entry into the war, the family lived through a
period of separation'' and that the period was marked ``by
political and social tensions.'' Ms. Caracciolo said her aunt toned
down her first draft to fit a more discreet and stately vision.
</P>
<P>
   The sprightly Ms. Caracciolo is good-natured about this
intervention. When she interviewed various Agnellis for the book,
she found that their stories were as different from one another as
petunias from peas. Just as gardens are constantly replanted and
revised, so is family history. What doesn't work gets edited out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo was a journalist for Epocha, a newspaper that is
one of the few in Italy not owned by the Agnellis. She is the
author of three books, including a history of another fabled
Italian garden, Ninfa. She lives in New York with her husband, the
painter Sandro Chia (who did the murals at the New York restaurant
Palio), and their two children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo is half Canadian, but her Italian side is
Caracciolo, a princely Neapolitan family. Still, she said, she is
not an Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am of them but not of them,'' Ms. Caracciolo said carefully.
Within the pages of the book at least, Villar Perosa is perfection,
what Page called ``my Shangri-La.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the others of her generation in this family, Ms.
Caracciolo does not want the regimentation of perfection, the
striving for Shangri-La that was the old Agnelli way. ``I avoid
it,'' she said, sitting on an undistinguished yellow plush sofa.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from her loft apartment, however, her life is casual,
expensive and spare. But a little taste for Shangri-La lingers. On
the wall above her hangs a beautiful, tattered 17th-century Italian
tapestry that shows a Renaissance garden with figures.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, Ms. Caracciolo and her two children visit Villar
Perosa to see the generations of cousins, the aunts and uncles.
What better place to learn about the changing nature of gardens and
families and the often necessary fictions they so beautifully
maintain about stability and order and beauty?
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28 at 6 p.m., Ms. Caracciolo will deliver a slide
lecture about Villar Perosa in New York to benefit the New York
Horticultural Society. Tickets are $350. Information, (212)
757-0915.

MEASURE DESIGNED TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY ON INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Soon &UR;  &LR; your kids may need a permission slip to surf some parts
of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked inside the giant federal spending bill nearing approval
in Congress is a provision that would be one of &UR;  &LR; the strongest
steps yet taken by the government to protect privacy on the
Internet: a law that would require commercial Web &UR;  &LR; site operators
to obtain approval from parents before they seek to collect
information from children on &UR;  &LR; line.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, praised by businesses including IBM Corp., AT&AMP;T Corp.,
Netscape Communications Corp., and Microsoft Corp., marks a
significant compromise in the often-contentious debate over just
what privacy rights consumers should expect on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To many marketers, on-line networks represent a revolutionary
chance to tailor product pitches to individuals. But federal
regulators say some Web &UR;  &LR; site operators have been too nosy _
particularly in their attempts to collect names and addresses from
children, information that could be resold.
</P>
<P>
   Though privacy advocates argue the bill doesn't go far enough,
they praise the measure included in the spending act for
establishing at least basic protections for the powerful medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the best selling tool that's ever been
invented, and it's like putting that powerful salesman right in
your house,'' says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center
for Media Education &UR;  &LR; in Washington, an advocacy group favoring the
new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've put a parent in between the commercial marketers and
the child,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules sponsored by Massachusetts Representative Edward
J. Markey (D-Mass.) in the House, and by Senators Richard Bryan
(D-Nev.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), would require companies to
obtain parental consent before asking children younger than 13 to
reveal anything about themselves. In addition, the rules call for
parents to have access to the data and the power to correct or
withdraw it from company databases.
</P>
<P>
   A combined version of the privacy rules is included in the
federal spending legislation nearing final passage in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy measures stem from recommendations by the Federal
Trade Commission, which has criticized the on-line industry for
failing to disclose enough about how consumer information could be
recycled.
</P>
<P>
   Unclear is just how parental consent might be granted. Aides to
Markey say the FTC will study ways in which consent could be given
via e-mail. But no standard is expected for at least another six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legislation represents an important agreement between
privacy advocates and companies like America Online, which worry
that consumer suspicion about leaky data on the Internet might
stall its growth.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the new privacy rules, ``I think the industry has
stepped up and said, `We know we can't build Internet commerce
without the trust of our members,''' says Jill Lesser, AOL's
director of law and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether children experience too many interactive sales pitches
has been a hot topic since the summer, when the FTC reported that
out of 212 Web sites aimed at children it surveyed, 189 sought to
collect data. Often these sites require users to submit data before
they may explore pages fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more troubling,'' the agency reported, is that fewer than
10 percent of those sites told children to ask their parents before
they shipped in their names, addresses, and other facts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FTC in August settled charges against GeoCities
Inc., a popular Web site provider, which admitted that it had
turned over to advertisers information it had promised to keep
confidential, such as users' marital status and education. The
agency also alleged GeoCities collected children's names and other
information without properly notifying users.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities denied wrongdoing but agreed to delete its children's
database. It also agreed to post a statement telling users how it
will use the information it collects. &UR;  &LR; The practice is becoming
more common amid growing privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company also supports the parental &UR;  &LR; consent measure,
according to James Halpert, an attorney who represents Geo-Cities
at the Washington firm of Piper &AMP; Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, Halpert says, GeoCities agrees that chat rooms and
on-line forums are able to capture children's attention far more
effectively than traditional marketing gimmicks such as clubs
inviting kids to mail in cereal box-tops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize that the bill will curb some of the
conversations with children, but children are different'' than
adult users, he says. ``The way children experience the on-line
medium, they require a different privacy model.''
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy activists wanted an even stronger bill that would
allow adult users of the Internet to restrict the re-use of any
personal data they might submit as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that affects everybody, regardless of age,''
says David Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington. ``Everybody couches themselves in
child protection, and all the other privacy concerns go out the
window.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey says some agreement with the industry was better than
none, and that &UR;  &LR;  he will try to expand the privacy protections for
adults in the next congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the children's privacy rules, several other new
electronic &UR;  &LR; commerce bills are expected to be part &UR;  &LR; of the spending
act. One would establish a three-year moratorium on new taxes aimed
specifically at buyers and merchants on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another &UR;  &LR; more contentious bill would require operators of
sexually &UR;  &LR; explicit commercial Web sites to verify that viewers are
over 18. The bill defines these sites as those whose content is
``harmful to minors.'' The bill's Republican backers say the
definition makes the law more limited than a similar law passed in
1996 against ``indecent'' material. That law, the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, was struck down by the Supreme Court on
constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech advocates say the latest anti-smut bill still uses
too broad a definition, and they vow to sue if the law is passed.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of these groups say that together the latest
privacy and decency measures represent a more limited and realistic
set of rules to govern electronic commerce when compared with
proposals of years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has walked another step on the road to understanding
the Internet as just another policy area,'' says Jonathan Zittrain,
executive director at Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society. ``That's a good thing, to the extent that
there's no longer panic over what the Internet represents.''

BOSTON'S MUTUAL FUNDS INDUSTRY WAITS FOR OTHER SHOE TO FALL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chill has descended over Boston's financial district, where
the heart of America's mutual fund industry is warily watching Wall
Street's downsizing and quickly readying itself to cope with life
in a volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of almost uninterrupted expansion, Boston asset
management firms are bracing for aftershocks from the global
financial crisis. &UR;  &LR; Despite a mini-rally in recent days, the
domestic stock market is off about 10 percent from its July peak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Putnam Investments, a mutual fund giant that nearly tripled in
size over the past five years, is about to implement a hiring
freeze, industry sources say. Massachusetts Financial Services, a
smaller firm that also grew explosively, has already done so.
Scudder Kemper Investments Inc., the New York investment firm with
Boston-based operations, has called off all hiring until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Wall Street-size cutbacks here.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's multitrillion-dollar asset-management industry has a
different structure than New York's money culture. Whereas
investment whizzes here make their living overseeing mutual fund
assets that generally tend to stay put over the long term, New
York's wheeler-dealer stockbrokers, traders and investment bankers
live in a transaction-oriented culture that lives and dies by the
market each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With mergers and stock offerings down, Wall Street companies are
taking hits to their bottom lines. By contrast, most
money-management firms have generally maintained strong revenues
despite the market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That difference affords Boston some protection from layoffs of
the kind announced last week by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. The nation's
largest stock brokerage will ax 5 percent of its work &UR;  &LR; force, or
3,400 jobs, due to global economic uncertainty. Other investment
banks and brokerages are following suit, though not as drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when depressed stock markets slash the value of assets
managed by a mutual fund firm, thereby reducing money-management
fees, revenues suffer _ and cost cutting comes to the fore. The
picture becomes worse if investors hand fund firms less new cash by
pulling back on purchases.
</P>
<P>
   So far that has not happened; investors are by and large simply
buying different kinds of mutual funds. But firms nestled in
downtown Boston are battening down the hatches just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments, the country's biggest mutual fund firm,
with 13,000 employees in Massachusetts, says it is still hiring.
</P>
<P>
   But in a twitchy market that since summer has flirted between a
10 percent correction and a 20 percent bear turn, industry
specialists speculate that layoffs are imminent.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent skittish staffers from preemptively jumping ship,
Fidelity recently blocked employee access to a popular Internet job
site geared to financial services, one fund industry source said.
Company insiders say staffers are increasingly spending their lunch
hours surfing the Web for job postings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pioneer Group Inc., the mood is grim. ``All additional
hiring I would characterize as under very critical review and
intense justification,'' said spokesman Timothy T. Frost. ``We are
going to look very, very closely at expenses.'' Pilgrim Baxter &AMP;
Associates, the Wayne, Pa.-based mutual fund firm that is owned by
United Asset Management Corp. of Boston, plans to lay off 50 people
in its marketing division.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street Corp., the giant back-office processing and
asset management company, executives are preparing for a slowdown.
``Clearly, we are hiring less,'' said chief financial officer
Ronald L. O'Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's financial services firms grew furiously this decade,
becoming a bulwark of the state economy with around 60,000
employees. Investment firms have swallowed up a third of the
downtown commercial real estate leased or sold so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The global economic downturn looming on the horizon could change
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a de facto hiring freeze across
the board in the industry,'' said Joseph C. Haberman, an executive
search consultant at A.T. Kearney in New York. He also predicted
layoffs of 5 &UR;  &LR; to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That causes fear among investment professionals, especially
after a wretched third quarter for stock funds that for many
signaled the bull market's end. ``The general mantra out there is,
`This is a chance to get rid of some of our laggard performers,'''
Haberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many asset management firms, including Fidelity, are privately
held, so they don't have to tighten the belt after one bad quarter
to appease shareholders. Contrast that with other financial
services players that are publicly traded. BankBoston Corp., for
example, is laying off 111 staffers worldwide after a miserable
three months for emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In theory, Fielity cannot let off people in droves for the
long term because of a $40 million state tax break the local fund
industry received in 1996 in exchange for hiring pledges. Under the
deal, Fidelity must boost state employment by 5 percent a year, or
about 500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most cuts in the asset-management industry will likely come in
areas that are contracted out to third parties, such as back-office
processing and consulting. Advertising and marketing expenditures
will also be reined in if there are fewer investors to woo in a
soft market. MFS has already cut its advertising budget for the
fourth quarter by 13 percent, spokesman John F. Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, people are scaling back pay expectations. Money
managers to whom hefty six figure bonuses are the cake, not the
icing, could be left with crumbs for the first time this decade.
``The bonus could be thin or nonexistent this year,'' said Jim
Lowell, publisher of the independent Fidelity Investor newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   With many companies now planning budgets for 1999, expenditures
are getting a once-over. At MFS, Poland Spring bottled water has
been replaced with the cheaper Atlas filtered system _ a move that
saves the company $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at many Boston firms, there's not much fat to trim in the
creature comforts area. Chalk it up to Boston's legacy of
austerity: Compared to flashy New York investment bankers, with
their minibars, shoeshine men, and no-holds-barred entertainment
budgets, Boston money men are a no-frills lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned Johnson comes from a good strain of Puritanism and is lean
and efficient,'' said one fund industry source, referring to
Fidelity's chief executive. ``You see a lot more mahogany and
marble at Merrill than you do at Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson preferred wall-to-wall carpeting, plug-in shoe shiners
in the men's rooms, and plain Arabica coffee, not flavored
varieties, for the staff, the source said. Unusual for the
industry, Fidelity has a purchase-order system in which staffers
must justify an expense before they incur it. Most Fidelity
employees fly coach class.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there isn't room to trim. Fidelity spends
hundreds of millions on pet projects; it recently alloted $20
million to test an experimental technology base. Such efforts are
likely to be sliced in any downturn, said Louis Harvey, president
of Dalbar Inc., a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, fund companies are looking less at the stock
market's rally of recent days and more at the longer-term trend.
``A lot of people are going to be surprised,'' Haberman said.
``People don't realize the industry can react as fast as it does.''

 &HT;    GRAMM FACES DOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM LAW
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress appeared poised this year to dismantle a
Depression-era law that has prohibited consumers from one-stop
shopping for banking, insurance, stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with his objection to a tiny piece
of the overhaul, stalled a reform that had been 20 years in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   His beef: expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977
federal law that requires banks and savings and loan associations
to record the gender, race and income of loan applicants and report
each year whether those applicants received loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the CRA has been turned into an Mafia-like extortion
device by groups representing consumers and minorities. These
``professional protest groups,'' Gramm charged, use the publicly
available data about lending practices to pressure banks and S&AMP;Ls
to set quotas for lending and hiring and to financially support the
protesting groups.
</P>
<P>
   The CRA, originally designed to ensure that banks were making
loans in communities where they receive deposits, ``has become a
rich source for extortion and kickbacks,'' Gramm said in an
interview last week. Asked why banks don't complain, he explained
that ``the merchants being shaken down by the Mafia don't complain
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's objection, shared by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. and a
handful of other senators, stopped the legislation from coming to a
vote in the Senate. Even if the bill had passed, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and other presidential advisers had enough doubts
about the bill that a veto from President Clinton was considered a
good possibility. Still, Gramm played a big enough role in stopping
the financial-services overhaul that he was blamed by some for
killing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came closer to passing comprehensive financial services
reform in the 105th Congress than we have in a generation,'' said
Dean Sackett, a vice president of the National Association of
Professional Insurance Agents. ``Unfortunately, turf battles within
the Clinton administration, the looming threat of a presidential
veto, opposition by key senators to Community Reinvestment Act
requirements and the narrow interests of a small minority prevailed
over the interests of the country at large and those affected by
the legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's willingness to scuttle the overhaul of financial
services because it could expand the CRA beyond banks was the most
recent example of his lack of compunction about delaying or even
killing widely supported bills that contain items he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, he delayed for weeks a popular
agriculture-research bill because he objected to a provision that
restored food stamps to legal immigrants, including children, whose
aid had been cut off under the 1996 welfare reforms. The
agriculture bill eventually passed, unlike the financial-services
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's willingness to do in the bill also gives a hint of what
might be in store if Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., loses his
re-election bid Nov. 3 and Gramm succeeds him as chairman of the
powerful Senate Banking Committee, which oversees banks as well as
securities and federal housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill _ primarily the trade associations for
banks, insurance companies and securities firms _ had hoped until
last week that their lobbying efforts and campaign contributions to
key members of Congress might keep the bill alive as part of the
giant federal spending plan that wrapped up other unfinished
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the trade groups conceded defeat in a joint
statement, pledging to work together for passage next year and
thanking ``those members of the House and Senate leadership who
worked so hard to achieve legislation that could enjoy such broad
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was released the same day that the Center for
Responsive Politics reported that the industry groups together had
contributed $30 million to congressional campaigns since January
1997. Gramm, who is not up for re-election this year, was not among
the top beneficiaries of the group's money.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which Gramm blocked the bill, known as H.R. 10,
also illustrates continued uncertainty in Congress about undoing
the Glass-Steagall Act, written in the Depression to prevent the
concentration of banking, insurance and securities in mammoth firms
whose failures could wreak untold havoc.
</P>
<P>
   After many failed attempts at rewrites, Congress thought it got
it right this year, but H.R. 10 squeaked out of the House in May by
only one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needed some more fixes to be a really good bill,'' said
Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, a former investment banker and a
member of the House Banking Committee. Bentsen voted against H.R.
10, saying he was concerned about the assignment of regulators for
the new multi-purpose entities that the bill would create. He also
said he thought the bill short-changed small banks.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns kept the bill on hold in the Senate until
September, when D'Amato finally brought it before the Banking
Committee. It emerged from committee in mid-September and was
headed for a full Senate vote with the blessing of the banking,
insurance and securities industries, all of whom overcame historic
rivalries to back the Senate's version of H.R. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gramm took to the Senate floor Sept. 30 and declared: ``I
intend to do everything in my power to impede this bill ...to use
all of the rules of the Senate, no matter how long it takes, no
matter how difficult it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   He laid out his concerns that the bill expanded the Community
Reinvestment Act and ``literally set up the vehicle for billions of
dollars to be extorted from financial institutions in America by
people who are professional protesters.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gramm said he was thinking of groups such as
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN),
a consumer group that often stages protests of businesses it
considers unfriendly to the elderly and poor.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing Gramm's charges, ACORN policy analyst Patrick Woodall
in Washington said, ``We must be the worst extortionists and
kidnappers in America.'' The group filed objections with the
Federal Reserve to three of the five big bank mergers this year;
not one was disallowed, Woodall noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that community groups have an incredibly
difficult time with lenders who are in theory the lifeblood of the
community,'' Woodall said. ``We do end up exerting pressure because
that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   ACORN and other groups also seek and receive financial support
from banks _ a practice Gramm said he would have moved to outlaw if
the bill had come to a vote. Woodall said the financial support
helps ACORN screen loan applicants for the banks; Gramm called the
practice extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The banks themselves said they have noticed ``some heavy-handed
tactics'' by groups wielding lending records under CRA, but the
banks have learned to deal with both the pressure and the paperwork
that the law creates, according to Pattie Cinelli, spokeswoman for
the American Bankers Association. The association supported H.R.
10.
</P>
<P>
   Was the bill worth killing over CRA? ``Not for the American
Bankers Association members,'' she said.

 &HT;    GRAMM FACES DOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM LAW
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress appeared poised this year to dismantle a
Depression-era law that has prohibited consumers from one-stop
shopping for banking, insurance, stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, with his objection to a tiny piece
of the overhaul, stalled a reform that had been 20 years in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   His beef: expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977
federal law that requires banks and savings and loan associations
to record the gender, race and income of loan applicants and report
each year whether those applicants received loans.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the CRA has been turned into an Mafia-like extortion
device by groups representing consumers and minorities. These
``professional protest groups,'' Gramm charged, use the publicly
available data about lending practices to pressure banks and S&AMP;Ls
to set quotas for lending and hiring and to financially support the
protesting groups.
</P>
<P>
   The CRA, originally designed to ensure that banks were making
loans in communities where they receive deposits, ``has become a
rich source for extortion and kickbacks,'' Gramm said in an
interview last week. Asked why banks don't complain, he explained
that ``the merchants being shaken down by the Mafia don't complain
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's objection, shared by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. and a
handful of other senators, stopped the legislation from coming to a
vote in the Senate. Even if the bill had passed, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and other presidential advisers had enough doubts
about the bill that a veto from President Clinton was considered a
good possibility. Still, Gramm played a big enough role in stopping
the financial-services overhaul that he was blamed by some for
killing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came closer to passing comprehensive financial services
reform in the 105th Congress than we have in a generation,'' said
Dean Sackett, a vice president of the National Association of
Professional Insurance Agents. ``Unfortunately, turf battles within
the Clinton administration, the looming threat of a presidential
veto, opposition by key senators to Community Reinvestment Act
requirements and the narrow interests of a small minority prevailed
over the interests of the country at large and those affected by
the legislation.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Agnelli Gardens at Villar Perosa'' (Harry N.
Abrams, $75), is filled with fuzzy pictures of very beautiful
gardens in the Piedmont region of Italy, virtually secret gardens
that have never been opened to the public. They cover 25 acres
surrounding the Agnelli family seat in the village of Villar Perosa
30 miles north of Turin.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the pictures so fuzzy? Because the photographer, Marella
Caracciolo de Castagneto Agnelli, 71, the wife of Gianni Agnelli,
head of Fiat SpA since 1966, wants them that way, said her niece,
Marella Caracciolo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo, 33, and Mrs. Agnelli wrote the text for the
book, a history of the family as seen through its gardens. The
beautiful but impressionistic pictures hint at more than a taste
for witty abstraction. They underline a consistent attempt to
gauze-wrap any critical focus on a family that, in Italy, is seen
as comparable to the Kennedys _ that is, if the Kennedys controlled
the press, held the reins of society and ran the largest business
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Italian the film ``The Silence of the Lambs'' had to be
retitled (``Agnelli'' means ``lambs'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian collective unconscious wants them to be royalty,''
Ms. Caracciolo said. ``In the completely disruptive Italian
republic, they represent some kind of unifying force.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Agnelli, a photographer for Vogue in the 1950s, is perhaps
best remembered from a legendary 1950s Town &AMP; Country photograph by
Richard Avedon of her swanlike neck and fine Neapolitan nose.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades ago, she began shaping the villa's gardens. What
she had to start with were straggly terraces laid out in the late
18th century (before her husband's great-great-great-grandfather
bought the villa), a 19th-century limonaia, or orangery, a
neo-Gothic memorial chapel, a great lawn with Victorian specimen
trees _ and unlimited funds.
</P>
<P>
   She removed flower beds shouting with red salvias in favor of
features like an English woodland walk and a kitchen and cutting
garden.
</P>
<P>
   The late great English garden designer Russell Page _ creator of
the smaller garden in the courtyard of the Frick Collection in New
York and of hundreds of luxurious private gardens in Europe _ made
a series of lakes where there had once been a mountain ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Gae Aulenti, the Italian architect, designed a pool and pavilion
in the 1980s. A sculpture garden focuses on works by Henry Moore,
Max Ernst and Rene Magritte.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the almost-too-perfect gardens relate to the polished
public image created by Gianni and Marella Agnelli, Ms. Caracciolo
said, ``They have managed to make themselves into what they wish to
be, what they appear to be.''
</P>
<P>
   She insists the gardens are not Byronic. ``This is the
antithesis of the romantic garden,'' she said. ``It's not about
melancholy at all, or about nature. It's about man as the master of
the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   As a favored niece, Ms. Caracciolo had access to write the book,
but was under an obligation not to betray the family. All the
family mistakes have been kept within the family fortress, its
exterior smoothed by money and tight-lipped stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, it says, ``Villar Perosa had to remain an oasis
apparently untouched by the events of reality.'' The book alludes
only in passing to the Allies' bombing the villa during World War
II, and the Agnelli hankerings for ``fast cars, gambling, beautiful
women.''
</P>
<P>
   A garden history of Villar Perosa might not be the place to air
the Agnellis' documented collaboration with the fascists. But it
seems too much of a gloss to say, as the book does, that ``after
1940 and Italy's entry into the war, the family lived through a
period of separation'' and that the period was marked ``by
political and social tensions.'' Ms. Caracciolo said her aunt toned
down her first draft to fit a more discreet and stately vision.
</P>
<P>
   The sprightly Ms. Caracciolo is good-natured about this
intervention. When she interviewed various Agnellis for the book,
she found that their stories were as different from one another as
petunias from peas. Just as gardens are constantly replanted and
revised, so is family history. What doesn't work gets edited out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo was a journalist for Epocha, a newspaper that is
one of the few in Italy not owned by the Agnellis. She is the
author of three books, including a history of another fabled
Italian garden, Ninfa. She lives in New York with her husband, the
painter Sandro Chia (who did the murals at the New York restaurant
Palio), and their two children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caracciolo is half Canadian, but her Italian side is
Caracciolo, a princely Neapolitan family. Still, she said, she is
not an Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am of them but not of them,'' Ms. Caracciolo said carefully.
Within the pages of the book at least, Villar Perosa is perfection,
what Page called ``my Shangri-La.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the others of her generation in this family, Ms.
Caracciolo does not want the regimentation of perfection, the
striving for Shangri-La that was the old Agnelli way. ``I avoid
it,'' she said, sitting on an undistinguished yellow plush sofa.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from her loft apartment, however, her life is casual,
expensive and spare. But a little taste for Shangri-La lingers. On
the wall above her hangs a beautiful, tattered 17th-century Italian
tapestry that shows a Renaissance garden with figures.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, Ms. Caracciolo and her two children visit Villar
Perosa to see the generations of cousins, the aunts and uncles.
What better place to learn about the changing nature of gardens and
families and the often necessary fictions they so beautifully
maintain about stability and order and beauty?
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28 at 6 p.m., Ms. Caracciolo will deliver a slide
lecture about Villar Perosa in New York to benefit the New York
Horticultural Society. Tickets are $350. Information, (212)
757-0915.

BASTION OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS RETHINKS RIGID SPEECH CODE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Should a farm science professor be punished for
using a Playboy centerfold to illustrate different cuts of meat?
What if a history professor uses a racial epithet when describing
the slave trade?
</P>
<P>
   For the past 17 years, the answer at the University of Wisconsin
was almost certainly yes. But for the past year, this bastion of
political correctness has been rethinking that rigidity in a
closely watched attempt to soften its faculty speech code, one of
the nation's oldest and most restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to avoid using a speech code to deal with all
irritating speech,'' said Roger Howard, associate dean of students.
``We really want to go after this very atrocious speech where the
pattern will show at least some evidence of intent by a faculty
member to make the environment hostile because of a student's race,
color, gender, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The work is being viewed by academics nationwide as a turning
point, or at least some of the first pebbles of a potential
landslide among anti-harassment speech codes that most US campuses
have adopted in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To some, it is a long-overdue repudiation of censorship on
campus. To others, it portends a swing of the pendulum back to
second-class status for anyone not among the traditional elites.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is: What limits, if any, should control
communication between faculty and students, balancing First
Amendment rights and a desire to protect students from harm?
</P>
<P>
   Already, courts have struck down student speech codes as
unconstitutional in New Hampshire, Michigan, California, and
elsewhere. Wisconsin's student speech code was struck down by a
federal judge in 1991, although the faculty code remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities have been paralyzed by the controversies. At
the University of Massachusetts, a verbal harassment policy that
had been expected to take effect three years ago has languished in
draft form, in light of concerns about vague language.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's reexamination is happening on a campus known at once
for PC orthodoxy and freewheeling speech. The sidewalks throughout
campus are alive with chalk graffiti hawking causes of all stripes,
and a bronze plaque bolted to the main administration building
sings the praises of ``that continual and fearless sifting and
winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the rewritten faculty speech code almost certainly
will satisfy neither extreme, and the tensions are already showing.
As the school's Faculty Senate prepares to receive a final proposal
from a committee of faculty, students, and academic staff, deep
philosophical and pragmatic differences have emerged, splitting the
rewrite committee into competing camps.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed the existing faculty code needed fixing, but
most participants in the process agree the code is flawed at the
very least because it makes no explicit endorsement of academic
freedoms. Another criticism is that the procedure for dealing with
allegations is inadequate. The code also has been faulted as too
restrictive, outlawing any comments by professors that students
find even vaguely demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its longevity and the importance its backers attach to
it, no professors have been disciplined under the code, although
several have come close. The more immediate concern is whether the
existing code has created a ``chilling effect'' on speech and is a
tool to enforce leftist political orthodoxy intent on avoiding
offense to such groups as women, gays, and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   An early proponent of reworking the code was a professor who
became enmeshed in it. Lester Hunt, a professor of philosophy, was
accused of discrimination for using the word ``injuns'' while
speaking privately with an American Indian student. He said he did
not consider the word insulting, but settled the matter by writing
an apology to the student at the university's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people, like me, teach subjects that concern all the
hot-button areas _ race, gender, you name it _ and what the code
does is threaten you with punishment if you say the wrong thing.
That makes it difficult or impossible to teach these subjects
effectively,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee proposal opens with a preamble that forcefully
embraces the First Amendment and the academic freedom of
professors. It also notes that intellectual exchanges in classrooms
may be ``unavoidably hurtful.'' As such, any comments germane to
the subject being taught are protected.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal then spells out essentially three types of
offensive speech: comments that debase or derogate an individual
student; comments or epithets that are gratuitously debasing even
if not directed at an individual; and offensive teaching methods
for which there is no reasonable educational justification.
Disciplinary action could be taken only if a faculty member
repeated the speech or teaching method after being told it was
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the proposal cites the use of the word ``nigger''
by a history professor teaching about slaves. If directed
repeatedly at an individual, or even made in passing remarks to the
class, a majority on the committee said there could be no good
educational reason for such an epithet in that context, and
therefore discipline was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if a literature professor assigned readings on race
that employed the same epithet, and the professor used the word in
class discussions of the book, that would be protected speech.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of offensive teaching techniques, committee
members cited what they said was a true story of an agriculture
professor using a Playboy pinup as a ``teaching tool'' to
distinguish cuts of meat. That incident occurred before the speech
code was enacted, and the professor was not punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rules, like any law, express a community's moral
sentiment, its sense of right and wrong,'' said Ted Finman, a law
professor who wrote much of the original code in 1981 and was among
the majority in the rewrite. ``Bad stuff still goes on and has to
be addressed. Much of it is inadvertent, because there are a lot of
instances in which white males simply are unaware that certain
remarks are extremely demeaning to women, blacks, other
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But seven of the committee's 17 members want to make it
significantly harder to trigger discipline, and only for the most
egregious speech. The minority wants proof of ``intent'' by a
faculty member to harm a student, and also wants students to prove
they were somehow damaged by the offensive speech.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the panel's student representatives _ a gay man, an
Asian-American woman, and a white woman _ joined the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism, sexism, homophobia are all parts of our society,
whether we want to admit it or not. We can't erect a wall around
our university and pretend those things don't exist,'' said Jason
Shepard, the openly gay president of the school's senior class, and
a leader on the minority. ``Prepare us for the real world, and
we'll deal with it at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Wisconsin, academics are divided on the usefulness of
speech codes and whether they can ever pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can throw somebody out of Yankee Stadium for being
verbally indecorous, then certainly you should be able to criticize
somebody in a university setting for being verbally indecorous,''
said Stanley Fish, professor of English and law at Duke and author
of ``There's No Such Thing As Free Speech. And It's A Good Thing,
Too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Charles Kors, a professor of history at the University
of Pennsylvania, called speech codes an assault on the Bill of
Rights and said they are almost always applied unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If left-wing professors had to worry about creating a hostile
environment for straight-laced white Republicans, if radical
feminists had to worry about creating a hostile environment for
men, these codes wouldn't last a day,'' said Kors. He and Boston
lawyer Harvey Silverglate wrote the book ``The Shadow University;
The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard, Wisconsin's associate dean of students, said that while
the codes are magnets for controversy, the attention they receive
is disproportionate to their role in making campuses less hostile
to women, minorities, gays, and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech code is 2 percent of a solution,'' Howard said.
``The danger is that we will focus so much time and energy on it
that we lose sight of the broader cultural changes that need to be
made.''

ANIMAL ORGANS SAFE FOR HUMAN TRANSPLANTS FORESEEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new technique for precisely rewriting the intricate coding in
genes, combined with the methods that produced Dolly the cloned
sheep, may make it possible to create animals whose organs could be
safely transplanted into humans, Scottish scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two techniques should enable scientists for the
first time to easily remove, or ``knock out,'' unwanted traits in
livestock by disabling the appropriate genes, they said. That could
include the gene for a marker on cells of animal organs that
triggers a violent response from the human immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Roslin Bio-Med Ltd. in Scotland, where the lamb
clone Dolly was produced, made the announcement along with
officials of Kimeragen Inc., a Newtown, Pa., firm that developed
the method for rewriting DNA sequences in genes.
</P>
<P>
   The method is called ``chimeraplasty'' or ``precise genetic
surgery'' and relies on high-quality molecules called
``chimeraplasts'' that are made by Boston Biosystems of Bedford.
Some specialists call it the genetic equivalent of the white
correcting fluid used with typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   Chimeraplasty has been a hot but controversial topic in
scientific circles in recent months. Researchers say it could have
a nearly revolutionary impact on plant and animal breeding and
human gene therapy. But some experimenters have said it does not
always seem to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly convinced this is worth exploring, despite the
mixed experiences,'' said Simon G. Best, chief executive officer of
Roslin Bio-Med in a telephone interview. If it works, ``it would be
significantly faster _ months faster _ than any of the other
options around, and that's what matters to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Roslin scientists have already produced cloned animals that have
an added gene, but deleting a gene or making precise alterations in
its blueprint is a much more difficult task, one that can currently
be done only with long and cumbersome methods. Chimeraplasty, said
Best, could solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies have agreed to pursue two goals. One is to
produce sheep that are not susceptible to the devastating brain
disease scrapie, the sheep equivalent of mad-cow disease in cattle.
They would do this by using chimeraplasty to knock out the gene
that makes proteins called prions in the sheep. Prions can mutate
to cause and transmit mad-cow disease and its variants in other
animals. If the strategy works in sheep, it would then be applied
to cows.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will also use the Kimeragen process to create sheep
that lack a sugar molecule on the surface of cells that sparks a
violent immune reaction when animal organs are transplanted into
humans. The modified organs could then be implanted into humans
without triggering acute rejection that destroys transplants almost
immediately. This would not eliminate the problem of chronic
rejection, but the slower response is less serious and can be
controlled by drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Roslin Bio-Med is a spinoff of the Roslin Institute near
Edinburgh, where scientists led by Ian Wilmut created Dolly, the
first mammal created by cloning, or copying, a cell from a fully
developed adult.
</P>
<P>
   In the new two-pronged technique, scientists would take a
connective tissue cell called a fibroblast from an adult animal and
let it multiply in a laboratory culture. Next, they would use a
chimeraplast _ a tailormade molecule composed of DNA and RNA
(another molecule that encodes genetic information) to change a
single letter of the code in the gene they want to disable.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the scientists could transplant the nucleus of the
modified cell into a donor egg whose nucleus had been removed. The
egg, fitted with the altered nucleus, would then be triggered to
develop into a new individual with the desired traits and be
implanted in the womb of a surrogate female.

 By LOUISE G. YARNALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going through a divorce five years ago, Maralyn Facey watched
her lawyer set up child custody and visitation schedules with
calendar sheets, a beleaguered paralegal clutching a calculator,
and colored pencils spilling across the office floor.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Ms. Facey, 45, the editor of a newsletter
for divorced parents, interviewed Cosmas Demetriou, a single father
and Hollywood set designer who had spent $65,000 on a prolonged
battle for joint custody of his son and daughter. His experience
revealed how the innocent-looking colored pencils and calendar
sheets could become weapons of torture as parents fought in court,
each side trying to pump up ``quality time percentages'' with the
kids in order to get more _ or pay less _ child support.
</P>
<P>
   From that initial meeting sprang a new love _ Demetriou _ and a
new software program _ Kidmate _ that Ms. Facey developed with
Demetriou. Kidmate has a site on the Web (www.kidmate.com) and
might be described as the TurboTax of child custody and visitation
battles.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $450, it simplifies an unpleasant chore. And it is a
tool for the times: More than half of married couples part, many of
them two-income families with both parents seeking to share child
care. It is no longer the case that divorce automatically relegates
the father to a weekend role and the mother to an
alimony-collecting caregiver. Today, custody and visitation come in
as many flavors as Coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey said development costs for Kidmate included $200,000
for programming charges. The software, which went on the market in
October 1997 chalked up more than $100,000 in sales its first year.
By contrast, Quicken, the popular financial software that has been
around since the early 1980s, had more than $12 million in sales
the same period. But KidMate does not have the same mass market
appeal as Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers of Kidmate are mostly matrimonial judges and lawyers
in California, New York, Florida, Ohio and Canada. It is also
expensive _ ``almost as pricey as a lawyer _ not quite though,''
said David L. Levy, a lawyer and the president of the Children's
Rights Council, a national lobbying organization in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey is hoping that Kidmate will spread beyond
professionals and help families involved in divorce. She plans to
make available on a Web page (www.kidshare.com) Kidshare, a version
of the Kidmate software for $10.
</P>
<P>
   KidShare will not have as many features as KidMate, but Ms.
Facey believes it will appeal to those who want the convenience of
scheduling software that they can e-mail to their lawyers and
ex-spouses.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Facey, the software has become a mission. ``I feel like
every single piece came out of my body,'' Ms. Facey said. Ms.
Facey, who juggles children's soccer matches with cooking dinner,
runs her fledgling software business out of a converted family room
in her Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so tired,'' she said, ``but I've never had
this sense of reward. I've had leading judges call me up and say,
`Awesome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every judge I know has this program,'' said Alexandra
Leichter, who has practiced family law in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
for 26 years and who assisted in reviewing earlier versions of the
program. ``It has the potential to make our lives a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Matrimonial judges in New York State recently began using the
software package, which Ms. Facey donated to the court system. It
has already had an impact on how judges do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can put into visual terms and language terms the often
complex kinds of schedules for shared parental time and access to
the child,'' said Jacqueline Silbermann, New York's administrative
judge for matrimonial matters.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bryson, co-chairwoman of the New York Women's Bar
Association's committee on Technology and the Internet for Lawyers,
says the Kidmate software smooths over snags that regularly pop up
when one parent suggests a schedule change. A simple request like
wanting to attend a child's ballet lesson quickly raises hackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``These situations happen routinely,'' Ms. Bryson said, ``and
someone's assistant in the law office has to sit there with colored
pencils and try to identify who's getting the child for what
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey was divorced in 1993. Overnight, she said, her life
went from expensive grocery stores to coupons at discount stores.
She said she felt like an alien among her married friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting in the car pool lane with people saying, `Oh Jim
and I are going out to dinner tonight,' and so I started talking to
my single friends. I said, `There oughtta be a newsletter.''' So
she began Solo (pages.prodigy.com/Solo/guide.htm), which started
with 200 copies in 1994 and today circulates to 6,000 single
divorced people.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the interview with Demetriou. It was Ms. Facey's first
attempt at getting the ``men's side of the divorce story,'' and,
she recalled, she was particularly tough on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took every question and refuted it,'' she said. ``Here was
a man who put his career second for his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey was impressed by his priorities. She could not help
but notice that he was ``cute,'' she said, but quickly told
herself, ``There's no way.'' But she let him start writing articles
for Solo, and in time, they decided to combine their talents not
only for the software project, but for another chance at romance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They named their software company Lapin Agile, after the Steve
Martin play that was Ms. Facey's and Demetriou's first date. Both
the business and the relationship blossomed, although Ms. Facey
still puts off marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too busy giving birth to myself,'' Ms. Facey says.
</P>
<P>
   KidMate has many features. It immediately calculates custody
percentages and graphically represents each child's schedule. It
also solves more mundane problems like projecting the day of the
week for Yom Kippur in 2001, and dividing up both Christian and
Jewish holidays. It can be adapted to include other holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Programs have been created to nail down the financial details of
divorce, probate, and other species of legal entanglement, but
KidMate is the only one that focuses on custody and visitation
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like Dissomaster, frequently used by family courts in
California; FinPlan, frequently used in New York, and BackCalc,
popular in the Washington state courts ``all do money, Ms. Facey
said. ``They don't do children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe that?'' she said. ``You split the furniture
and Aunt Martha's silver, but not the kids. Karmically, you have to
come back in the next life as a bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey's 8-year-old daughter, Claire Elowitt, carries a
printout of her KidMate schedule in her school notebook. It helps
Claire to remember if she is spending the weekend at her mother's
or her father's, an important detail when deciding whether she can
invite a girlfriend for a sleepover: Mom allows them. Dad does not.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey believes the software ``empowers kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce is death,'' she said. ``It's the death of a dream. You
think that you never have to deal with that person again, but now
you're going to have to deal with them twice as much. Now
everything's an issue ... and people need to know how to translate
this to the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Although members of the legal profession are more computer
literate today than a decade ago, Ms. Facey still reels when she
finds herself introducing a top-notch legal mind to a computer
mouse. But despite their appeal to the computer literate of the
legal world, programs like KidMate still meet with skepticism from
jurists who prefer law libraries and yellow notepads.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent training session for members of the New York Women's
Bar Association, only about 15 people showed up, and several were
concerned that the software would promote certain types of custody
arrangements over others. KidMate, for the record, offers a menu of
suggested custody arrangements, but can also be customized.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I noticed was that several matrimonial
attorneys who came were extremely skeptical because custody
arrangements are so difficult,'' said Ms. Bryson of the
association's computer committee. ``When they saw it was a
calendaring tool, I think it was very interesting to watch the
transformation that occurred in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bryson, who has supported various efforts to use computers
to reduce paperwork and time pressures in the legal field, said
that the resistance to KidMate seems similar to the resistance to
technology in general. In a pilot program to enable electronic case
filings in the federal courts, Ms. Bryson fielded complaints from
law firms who feared increased overhead costs and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Bryson says that programs such as KidMate have the
potential to make lawyers' jobs easier and clients' costs lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite different today than it was 15 years ago. When
lawyers were introduced to technology, you had partners with
computers on their desks as basically overblown paperweights,'' Ms.
Bryson said. ``But as the utility has increased, it has radically
changed the way lawyers look at computers and computer programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Facey's concerns are more basic and low-tech. She wants the
tool out there to help as many divorced families a possible. She
plans to put up Web page that enables modest-income families to use
the software for just $10 (www.kidshare.com).
</P>
<P>
   As for her not being a ``mission person,'' Demetriou begs to
differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is driven. She is dedicated. But I think she had to find
her mission later in life. The computer program is part of that
mission,'' he said. &QL;

TILING LESSONS ARE IN THE MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TILE-DESIGN) 
(js) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No matter what kind of tiles you buy, the excitement
dies hard if they go up on the wall looking like your first set of
teeth, with toothpaste smeared fatly across the front.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts tiling can be poorly done, especially veterans of
their own attempts. ``When I started out 18 years ago, my first 40
calls were repairs,'' said Stephen Spretnjak, a New York artist and
tile worker. ``I learned how to tile by going over somebody's
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Spretnjak did the tiling at Balthazar, the SoHo bistro, and
Pravda, the downtown vodka bar, which included a hammer and sickle
mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   You may not be doing the installation yourself, but you can be
aware of how a conscientious tile worker approaches the job,
whether using ceramic, stone or glass tiles, in a bathroom or
kitchen. Like any adept, Spretnjak has his priorities and his
preferences, as he demonstrated on a recent assignment: a
300-square-foot steam room being constructed in a commercial loft
on Canal Street, which he is tiling with white,
three-inch-by-six-inch subway tile.
</P>
<P>
   The first concern is the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If an existing wall is being tiled, make necessary repairs, most
experts advise. Don't expect tiles to conceal damage; they will
fall off. If a new wall is being built, as with Spretnjak's steam
room, make sure the contractor uses cement board, which is a
fiberglass mesh board imbedded with cement that is waterproof _
much more so than standard plaster wallboard. Spretnjak also
specifies galvanized screws for attaching it to the wall studs;
Sheetrock screws rust and fail if moisture finds its way inside the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Old or new, the prepared wall must be absolutely level and flat
before the first tile goes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No dips, no indentures,'' Spretnjak said. ``I take the tile
adhesive, or mud, as it's called, and smooth out the surface with a
big board like it's a plaster wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you have tile installed, inspect it, to make sure colors,
shading or veining are what you want. Charles Pearl, a tileworker
who was completing a 100-square-foot shower enclosure last week in
an apartment on Fifth Avenue, recommended that the installer also
make a close inspection, ``to make sure that you can actually work
with it.'' Pearl was using 18-inch-square marble tiles.
</P>
<P>
   How many tiles to buy? Calculate the square footage of the
space, dividing by the size of the tile. Then add 10 percent to 20
percent. You will lose tiles because of breakage caused by cutting
and because of unusable short ends. If you're including a diagonal
pattern in your design, add 25 percent because of the greater
number of cuts. It is impossible to find exact replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the thing about tiles, even white,'' said Roger
Nelson, the general contractor on Spretnjak's steam room. ``When
you get a patch job, you can never match them. It's a horror
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, tile was adhered with a mud-set, a thick patty of
cement. A generation of thin-sets, which are lighter, epoxy
adhesives developed in the 1950s, has largely replaced mud-sets,
with equal effectiveness, Spretnjak said. He combs it onto a wall
with a notched trowel, and then begins applying the tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start from the bottom up,'' he said. ``Gravity forces down.''
When he is two-thirds of the way up a wall, Spretnjak stops to take
account of how it will finish. ``I'm going to be very concerned
about what kind of cut I'll have to make at the top, because it's
the most visible,'' he said. ``If I know I'm going to be an inch or
two short of a full tile at the top, then I consider a band of
decorative trim about a third of the way down, or a molding trim.''
</P>
<P>
   Spretnjak also installs glass mosaic tile, though the process
requires its own precautions and patience. ``It's little bits that
reflect light,'' he said. ``When 13th-century tile workers were
doing a basilica and they had a saint to be lit by torchlight, they
would angle the mosaic glass of the eyes and the hands so that when
the light hit, it would reflect and look more real.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an effect you want when you're showering.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid an uneven set to the surface, Spretnjak lays the tile
into the thin-set, tamping and smoothing it flatly with a broad
wooden float, ``not your fingers,'' he said, which push individual
tiles into the thin-set unevenly.
</P>
<P>
   Larger four-inch-square glass tiles also run their own risks,
and a higher installation cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to butter the back of each tile carefully with
thin-set,'' said Daniel Bonpietro, a tileworker installing tile
with Pearl on Fifth Avenue, ``so you don't see the tooth marks the
trowel makes in the thin-set on the wall. You'd see those parallel
lines right through the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Laying the tile is half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grouting's the big frustration,'' Spretnjak said of the epoxy
that fills the thin gaps between the tiles. After the tile has set
for a recommended 16 to 24 hours, the grout is applied in strokes
across the wall, with a rubber float that works like a squeegee to
push it into the gaps while skimming it cleanly from the surface of
the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory. Grout allowed to dry where it shouldn't _ on,
say, the shiny face of a tile _ is there to stay without hard work
to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Colored grouts, available in dozens of shades, can approximate a
tile color, subtly disappearing, or create a vivid counterpoint.
The drawback: like tiles, they can be hard to match in a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Regularity is the goal. But not always uniformity. Monotony is
tile's biggest occupational hazard.
</P>
<P>
   David Ling, a New York architect, employed glass mosaic tile in
a recent apartment project to sheathe the undulating form of a wall
in a deep, midnight blue. Ling chose hand-poured, hand-cut
Brazilian Vidrotil-brand glass tiles _ available at Hastings Tile,
230 Park Avenue South (19th Street) _ for their artistic
irregularity and fluid top relief. He also instructed the installer
to interrupt and widen the gridded spacing of the tiles with the
knife of his trowel, at random intervals, as the thin-set dried, to
create a gentle, schooled swim in the pattern of the wall's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   At what price perfection _ whether studiously casual or
conventionally square?
</P>
<P>
   Based on square footage, time involved and the labor required
for the number and difficulty of cuts in the tiles, Pearl offered
an estimate on his 100-square-foot marble shower, with several
built-in shelves and a small tiled seat: $1,500. This excluded the
cost of the tiles and any construction or preparation of the
underlying wall. For standard ceramic tile, the price would drop.
For stone tile like limestone, which requires sealing, the price
would rise. Setting irregular tiles also adds to the cost. Glass _
the most expensive scenario _ could drive the price up an
additional $1,000, Pearl said.
</P>
<P>
   For a simple 300-square-foot space like the steam room,
Spretnjak offered an estimate of $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   As in any renovation, invite bids from at least three tiling
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody is high, ask him to explain why,'' Pearl said.
``But avoid really cheap jobs. You'll get one. Choose someone who's
going to refuse stupid economies, like using Sheetrock in a shower
instead of cement board. There's a lot of money involved, and it
should come out looking like that.''  &QL;

LINCOLN ARTIFACTS ARE POPULAR ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.C.)  (js) 
 By TERRY McMANUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine for a moment that the reputations of U.S. presidents
were like publicly traded companies. You and your broker would be
dizzy following the peaks and valleys of your Clinton stock or you
might still be kicking yourself for not shorting George Bush before
the 1992 election. Maybe a revisionist biography or two could juice
those shares of Warren Harding that have long been dormant in your
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't go wrong buying Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln is a
blue-chip performer, rising in value every year.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a sense, Lincoln's reputation does get traded regularly.
Artifacts of Lincoln and his times are popular items on a variety
of online auction sites. Earlier this month, Christie's
(www.christies.com) auctioned an 1843 daguerrotype of a man who may
or may not be The Railsplitter himself. Bidding peaked at $150,000,
falling short of what the owners wanted for the purported earliest
known Lincoln photo. (One expert estimated that if the owners
eventually prove their claim, the item could fetch $2 million to $5
million.)
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bauer, a historical research specialist with the Illinois
State Historical Society in Springfield, said interest in Lincoln
has always been strong, and periodically becomes intense. ``It's
generally thought that Lincoln is the third most-chronicled person
in history, behind Jesus Christ and Napoleon,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer oversees Illinois' huge Lincoln archives, which include
some 1,500 manuscripts and 11,000 books written by or about the
16th president, plus a huge assortment of movies, plays and various
historical artifacts. The collection, whose centerpiece is the
original Gettysburg Address, represents ground zero in the Land of
Lincoln (though other archives reside at the Library of Congress
and elsewhere).
</P>
<P>
   From a cluttered office and warren of storage rooms in the Old
State Capitol Building in downtown Springfield, Bauer continues to
buy Lincoln-related artifacts for the state. But he must be
selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection is getting too big for the space we have,'' he
explained. Still, in his quest for more Lincoln memorabilia, Bauer
expanded his searching to the Internet in 1996, bidding for many
items on the EBay site (www.ebay.com).
</P>
<P>
   He ventured online in part to save the state money. EBay is an
auction site, but buyers deal directly with sellers, eliminating
the auction house's cut. The convenience factor was what really
appealed to Bauer, who did not want to spend a lot of time
traveling to auctions. ``The Net has allowed that flexibility,
where I can sit here at the desk and still bid on what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, Bauer has purchased about 50 pieces through EBay. Many
can only be described as early 1900s curios: cigar wrappers and
shoe-polish tins bearing Lincoln's likeness; a child's prayer card
depicting Lincoln; a tobacco trading card noting his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one gem, though. Bauer's first purchase on
EBay netted, for $65, a ``stereo card'' depicting preparations for
Lincoln's funeral in Washington. When looked at with a 19th-century
stereo viewer, the image appears to be in 3-D. Bauer said that any
stereo cards from that era were scarce, and those from the funeral
rarer still.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best piece I found on EBay,'' he says, estimating
that he could sell the same card today for about $250 _ though he
never would. The state's collection is permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Treasures like the stereo card remain the exception, rather than
the rule for online auctions. But the perception of electronic
auctions as the world's largest garage sale is evolving. ``The
Internet is going to allow much broader collecting,'' says David
Redden, an executive vice president of Sotheby's. The Net, he
believes, ``will create larger, better, bigger and more plentiful
collections.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the interest in online trading grows, the likelihood of
finding underpriced Lincoln treasures will diminish, some experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say that I have ever found a true bargain in the
field of Lincolniana,'' says Doug Sanders, owner of McGowan Books
(www.mcgowanbooks.com) in Chapel Hill, N.C., which specializes in
Civil War-era pieces. Sanders has been selling collectibles through
the store's own site for five years, and he also does business on
EBay. ``The competition is fierce, preventing the acquisitions of
bargains at auction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer also said that he had been the victim of ``sniping,'' in
which a nominal high bidder is picked off by an opportunistic rival
as an auction's time limit is about to expire. It happened to him
when he had been the high bidder on an 1860 election pamphlet
throughout most of the proceedings. With a few minutes left for
bidding, he had to leave his desk; when he returned, someone had
outbid him by just $2.50, securing the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Some disreputable dealers are simply looking to cheat people.
Bauer says buyers should be especially wary of phony editions of
The New York Herald newspaper from the day after Lincoln's
assassination. ``People are paying $100 to $200 for a facsimile
that you could get for $1,'' Bauer says. ``You try and help these
people by e-mailing them, but you just can't do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fake Lincoln signatures also clutter the market. To protect the
state from fraud, Bauer will not buy any purported Lincoln
autograph _ online or otherwise _ without a money-back guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, Bauer has been delighted with his
EBay adventures. Once he was outbid on a Lincoln photo that sold
for $260. Within 12 hours, two people e-mailed him, offering better
images for less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound corny,'' he said, ``but dealing with
some of these folks has really restored some of my faith in human
nature.''

<P>
   Overhead garage doors have more components than any other door
in the house, and periodic maintenance is necessary to keep them
functioning smoothly and to eliminate potential problems before
they become major headaches.
</P>
<P>
   When an overhead garage door fails to operate properly, the
problem can usually be traced to one of these causes: the mounting
screws that hold the brackets or tracks have worked loose so the
door sticks or binds as it moves; the rollers that guide the door
have jumped the holding track; the hinges or rollers bind because
they are dirty, corroded, or damaged; the springs have lost some of
their tension.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of overhead garage doors: one-piece doors
that have a rigid, lightweight panel that swings up as a single
unit and sectional garage doors that have several horizontal panels
joined together by hinges _ these doors fold as they move.
Sectional garage doors have more complex mechanisms than one-piece
units, but both models require periodic servicing.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting the door, first look at all the hardware _ the
hinges, rollers, and brackets. Make sure that all holding screws
and bolts are tight. If you attempt to tighten a loose screw and
find that it has stripped its threads, pull it out and replace it
with a carriage bolt. Drill a hole through the door and insert the
carriage bolt from the outside; secure it with a nut and washer
from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect the door rollers to make sure they are in good
condition, then check to see that the roller spindles are parallel
to the door seams and are not bent. Bent or broken rollers should
be replaced (most home centers stock these parts). Lubricate the
spindles and roller bearings twice a year with lightweight oil;
also squirt a few drops of oil on the door hinge pins.
</P>
<P>
   All overhead doors travel in their upward path along metal
tracks. One-piece doors have two tracks hanging from the ceiling
joists. Section doors also have two overhead tracks, but these
curve down into vertical tracks on either side of the door opening.
Rollers, mounted in door brackets, travel in the tracks to keep the
door on course. Tracks should be level (or slightly pitched toward
the back of the garage), plumb, straight, and free of dirt and
debris. Bent tracks will allow the rollers to pop out and make it
difficult to raise or lower the door. Dirt and debris can cause the
rollers to bind.
</P>
<P>
   Use a level to inspect the tracks at least once a year. Make
sure that horizon members are level and vertical sections are
plumb. Hold a long metal ruler against the tracks to check for
straightness and make sure all sections are in line. Measure the
distance between the tracks to be sure that they are parallel and
equidistant apart. If they are not correctly aligned, use a wrench
to loosen the holding brackets, then gently tap the tracks into
place. Tighten the brackets after making this adjustment. Wipe the
inside of the tracks clean, then spray them with silicone
lubricant.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-duty springs are coupled to the door with braided cable.
They assist the operator in lifting and closing the door. All
overhead garage doors have either tension springs (sometimes called
an extension spring) or torsion springs. Tension springs are
mounted in pairs, one on either side of the door; they extend and
are under tension when the door is down. Torsion springs are
mounted crosswise above the door opening and are always under
tension.
</P>
<P>
   If the springs are adjusted correctly, the spring tension will
keep the door in place when the bottom of the door is within three
feet of the ground. If raised above that level, the door should
slowly raise by itself. Before attempting to readjust the springs,
make sure that all the other components are lubricated and
functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   Tension springs are adjusted by repositioning the S-hook at the
end of the braided-lift cable (one-piece doors have the S-hook and
bracket but not the cable). This hook, above the opening on either
side the door, fits into one of a series of holes in an overhead
bracket. Raise the door and use blocks or clamps to hold it in
place. Move the hooks forward (away from the springs) to increase
the tension. Remember to make the same adjustment on both door
cables.
</P>
<P>
   Torsion springs are adjusted by inserting an iron bar into a
slot at the end of the spring, then twisting it to tighten an
internal ratchet mechanism. While this sounds simple, it can be
dangerous because the spring is under heavy tension. It is best to
leave tension-spring adjustment to a professional.

   When William Yokoyama started seventh grade, he had already been
using a home computer for more than six years. He could easily use
it to do word-processing, surf the Internet, draw pictures, make
charts and graphics, and write simple game programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of computer classes in his middle school
``they were teaching how to power up,'' recalled William, 14, of
Chula Vista, Calif., who is now in the ninth grade. The class goal
was to learn how to type a business letter. William wanted more of
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his equally computer-literate friends stayed in the
class because ``they thought it was an easy A,'' he said. ``I'd
rather have fun while I'm trying to get an A.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers at his school, Bonita Vista Middle School, agreed with
William and his father, Irv Yokoyama, and moved William into a
course where he could use the computer as a research tool to study
subjects like the environment and atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the new national classroom challenge faced daily by
teachers and parents, now that computers are common in schools and
in most homes where there are children: how to teach and stimulate
both the computer ``haves'' and the ``have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those students who have access to home computers come to the
classroom with skills far beyond those who don't, most of whom need
several lessons just on booting up and moving the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States continues its romance with technology, the
issue is arising more often among educators. The percentage of
households with home computers has jumped from 33 percent in 1995
to 45 percent this year, according to ZD Market Intelligence, a
market research company.
</P>
<P>
   More telling, 58 percent of households with children have
computers, up from 52 percent a year ago. While not all educators
agree that there is a problem, or even that computers should be
used extensively by grade-school pupils, many say that the playing
field is clearly not level for the child who does not have
technology as close as the bedroom or the family room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any student who has a computer in the home has a decided
advantage over kids who don't,'' said Ken Tobin, a
science-education professor at the University of Pennsylvania and
the director of teacher education at the university.
</P>
<P>
   The computer has become such a key communication and research
tool in education that many students will use the Internet before
going to the library, said Paul Myers, associate professor of
computer science at Trinity University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years of teaching his class on ``Computers and Society,''
he has found that he no longer needs to spend the first two weeks
giving instructions on keyboarding, because usually every student
knows how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The balance has now tipped to the point where Myers says
educators are encouraging students to visit the library so that
they don't forget how valuable a resource books are for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an issue here; the issue of the haves and
have-nots,'' said David Tremblay, senior industry analyst for ZD
Market Intelligence, based in La Jolla, Calif. ``Lower-income
households are much less likely to have personal computers. You
can't assume everyone has a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Sherman, schools superintendent for Cherry Hill, N.J., a
Philadelphia suburb, which has 10,600 students, doesn't see
children who don't have home PCs as the top issue in education. But
``it's a growing issue,'' he said, adding: ``And it's not just a
matter of having or not having, but whether they are being used. We
have a responsibility to support these kids. There are also
teachers who are haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were kids in the '70s and '80s who didn't have
calculators,'' he said. ``Technology is an essential tool; it's not
a luxury. For those who do not have it, the gap is getting wider.''
</P>
<P>
   Income is certainly a factor. Among households with annual
incomes of $75,000 or more, 68 percent have computers. Among
households with annual incomes of $20,000 or less, only 19 percent
do.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, there are also more computers available in
school buildings, according to Quality Education Data, a private
education research company in Denver. There are now 85,900 public
schools with computers, out of a total of 87,200 in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   While some technologically savvy people are starting to question
the need for computers in the schools at all, educators like Tobin
and many school administrators and teachers advocate granting
access to computers after school hours through libraries, other
community centers and the schools themselves if teachers are
willing to open the doors at night.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of the students in the affluent Cherry Hill
district have home computers, said John Scarinci, the district
technology director. He compares not having a home computer to not
having an Encyclopaedia Britannica in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less convenient,'' he said, for students without home
computers. But he said students could get access at the library or
at a friend's house, much as he did growing up without an
encyclopedia at home.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also seem to be feeling more pressure to buy computers
for their children, and as prices drop, more families can afford
them.
</P>
<P>
   A new basic computer system that might have cost $4,000 five
years ago now sells for less than $1,000. A browser that hooks up
to a television, WebTV, can be bought for $200 or less with
discounts, and used computer equipment is only $300 to $500,
Scarinci said. ``It's the price of a television set.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip and Daisy Gilliland, of Port Richey, Fla., whose three
children range from a baby to a second-grader, are shopping for
their first personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other kids do have computers,'' said Mrs. Gilliland.
``They feel bigger and smarter using the computer. With all the
technology we want to get the kids used to using the computer. We
wouldn't have thought of it just for ourselves.''

   A college freshman, Matthew Fusfield, who graduated from Cherry
Hill High School East in June, agrees that students do better with
computers at home. He got his first computer in fourth grade and
helped the district set up its computerized bulletin-board system
when he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer is an advantage in education,'' he said. ``It's a
tool. It's not an absolute necessity, but research is much
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusfield said he had often helped others learn about computers
during class. Educators see this trend of students with experience
helping other students as changing the dynamics of the classroom
and sometimes the philosophy of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Students not only teach other students but sometimes even teach
the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes a lot of the power pieces in the classroom,'' said
Judith McGonigal, a teacher in the Haddonfield School District in
southern New Jersey. ``The kids that have more experience become
the co-teacher in the classroom. You are the co-learners with the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the cost of computer equipment and the
constant changes and upgrades required, many rural and urban
districts can't afford to keep up with more affluent suburban
districts.

   And even in districts like Cherry Hill, the gap between haves
and have-nots could grow in the next year as the school opens up an
interactive message system for teachers, administrators and
students called Cherry Hill Live. The district tries to accommodate
all students now by giving them computer time in the classroom and
in labs.
</P>
<P>
   This year Cherry Hill stopped using computer teachers to teach
technology skills in elementary school and instead has the regular
classroom teacher take children to the computer lab once a week.
There are at least one or two computers in most of the classrooms
in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving away from technology as a subject and using it
as a tool,'' Scarinci said.
</P>
<P>
   In kindergarten at Cherry Hill, the classroom teacher, Ellen
Specter, says that the students who gravitate to the two computers
during free time are often those who have computers at home. In her
morning class, 15 of the 23 students have computers. In the
afternoon class, 17 out of 20 do.
</P>
<P>
   Every class starts with Mrs. Specter giving instructions like
``Point to the monitor, point to the keyboard, point to the
mouse.'' Some children point to a rabbit icon on the screen
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Students have to find the yellow notepad icon on the Student
Writing Center software made by The Learning Co. of Fremont, Calif.
They get a list of words to click on and can change the border on
their screen.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the children can be heard saying things like ``Mrs.
Specter, mine's stuck!'' and ``Something happened, Mrs. Specter.''
But there are also voices saying ``Cool!'' and ``Look!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some students are not used to moving the mouse,'' she said.
``Two of them still don't know how to put their hand on the mouse.
I see a wide range of skills depending whether they have a computer
at home and whether they are allowed to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer teacher, Rita Mitchell, at Lindenwold Elementary in
southern New Jersey, has classes where usually about half the
children come from homes without computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I find the biggest difference is in third grade,'' she
said. ``The kids who have it at home know a whole lot more about
computers than those who don't. Their drawings are more
sophisticated. I have to make sure that I keep all the children on
task and that I'm not losing them. I have to have a bag of tricks
to give them something else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she will let more advanced students try out new
software so that they have something to do while others get used to
handling the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 Macintosh computers in her lab, she divides the classes
of about 30 students roughly in two. In one group she places those
who have computers at home along with those who may not have
computers but who follow directions well. In the other group, she
will put students who don't have computers and who may have more
trouble learning. She also puts children who need more help next to
children who have a computer and can help them.
</P>
<P>
   Finding and creating a curriculum that allows students to go at
their own pace is the solution for many teachers. It is the same
approach many have used for years to encourage slow readers while
also challenging students who read above their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term is `differentiation,''' said Mrs. McGonigal, who has
taught for 30 years. ``Each learner goes into it where they are.
You're not teaching everyone the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When students get to fourth and fifth grade and do more research
on the Internet and can bring in projects with complex graphics and
color charts, teachers see even more advantages for those who have
home computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets to the Internet, I see more expertise,'' said
Ginger Hovenic, executive director of the Harborside School in San
Diego and a consultant to the Classroom in the Future Foundation,
which trains teachers to use technology. ``You can see the kids who
have spent a lot of time exploring things That's when I see the big
gap begin to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools, like Robert Smalls Middle School in Beaufort,
S.C., have a program under which students can lease a laptop, in
this case for $15 a month, if their parents cannot afford to buy
one. One teacher, Melissa McFeely, is a believer in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, out of 21 students in her homeroom, 19 were from
low-income families. All but three of those 19 students leased a
laptop. ``More and more families are going to give up other things
to have computers in the home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure may also force the issue of getting a computer at
home. It's now cool to be good at the computer, but that status may
make the kids who do not have the technological tools at home even
more uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Marshall, a New Jersey mother of four who used to work as
a computer-classroom aide, said she felt that students were
sometimes embarrassed to say they did not have a computer or they
did not have the skills other children had on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some kids who had never touched a computer, but didn't
want to admit it,'' she said. ``There's a lot of pressure to be
computer literate, and the majority of kids don't want to admit it
if they can't do it. If these issues aren't addressed in education,
the gap could widen between the kids who have the knowledge and the
kids who don't.''

`TRUTH COMES IN BLOWS': RECONCILING WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening section of this deeply felt, deeply conflicted
memoir of growing up in an unhappy family, ``Truth Comes in
Blows,'' Ted Solotaroff recounts the final two years in the life of
his impossible father.
</P>
<P>
   In that time of enraged dying, Solotaroff came back into his
father's life after many years of estrangement. He had become a
successful editor and author in New York City, while his father had
sold his plate-glass business and was living alone in Livingston,
N.J., having recently driven away his fourth wife.
</P>
<P>
   Solotaroff writes of trying without success to arrange for his
father's care. He writes of getting the old man to tell him
something of his background and youth. The wall between them seemed
to be cracking. And then one day his father ``called to say that he
wasn't feeling well, couldn't get moving, would I come a little
early and give him a massage.'' A massage? Solotaroff reports that
he felt queasy about the prospect of putting his hands on his
father's body. He thought of Noah and Ham in the Old Testament and
the story's implication that he should honor the dignity of his
father's nakedness. But he relented and gave the old man deep
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   And the reader is prompted to wonder how he was able to do so,
how he was able to get past his rage at the many blows his father
had struck him and to tap the deep well of tenderness that
overflowed not too long afterward when his father stopped answering
the phone and the author and his wife discovered him dead on the
floor of his bedroom and, picking up his father's fallen
eyeglasses, he found himself weeping.
</P>
<P>
   In what follows, Solotaroff tells of growing up in the 1930s and
'40s, a Jewish boy of shaky identity with his religion, in a
lower-middle-class family in Elizabeth, N.J. Much will seem
familiar, particularly to people of the author's age: the shadows
of the Depression and the clarity of World War II; the struggle to
fit into an ethnically diverse community; the discovery of, first,
sports and then of achievement in the classroom; the anxieties of
sex and the seductions of radical politics.
</P>
<P>
   Solotaroff writes of these matters eloquently. If he now and
then deviates into abstractness on the role of the common man in
World War II and the significance of the birth of Israel, his more
personal set pieces are irresistible: for instance, his making up
his own ``idiotic'' lyrics to the Michigan Wolverines football
fight song to express his idealization of ``the American
heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   Hail to ye fields and forests
</P>
<P>
   Loudly proclaiming weather,
</P>
<P>
   Hail, hail, oh hail, oh hail,
</P>
<P>
   The man from Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Or his account of an interview with a high-school English
teacher who sensed that a classroom cutup might be harboring some
writing talent: ``She sat back in her chair, gave me a long
scrutinizing, slightly amused look, and said, `Do you have even the
slightest idea what a paragraph is?'''
</P>
<P>
   But dominant in his childhood were two experiences: first, a
leap from a playground swing when he was 5 that because of his
father's neglect left his nose broken and twisted to one side and
convinced him that he was ugly despite all those around him who
loved his smile. And even more overwhelming, his sense that living
within him were two warring people: on one side the artistic child
who reflected his mother's gentle temperament, and on the other the
imperious bully who was his father.
</P>
<P>
   How did the author heal these wounds and conflicts? Within the
20-year span of what he recalls, that he did so successfully is not
at all clear. In his late teen-age years he had his nose surgically
straightened (only to break it again during a boxing match in the
Navy), but little evidence exists that his self-image improved, at
least by the time he goes off to attend the University of Michigan
in the book's closing pages.
</P>
<P>
   As for the turmoil engendered by his parents' endlessly
disintegrating marriage, his story is one of confusion and
continual wrong turns. Even when his parents finally divorce and he
breaks away from his father, he doesn't seem to have dug to the
roots of his parents' conflicts or untangled the emotional
undergrowth inevitably vegetating within him.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear at the end that he is going to have trouble with
women. All of which confusion has the paradoxical effect of making
Solotaroff's story more forceful and plausible. For how many
20-year-olds have even begun to understand themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Yet clearly Solotaroff understands himself in retrospect. In the
memoir's final scene, having come home from college to visit his
mother, he talks with her about a poem by Delmore Schwartz and
acknowledges her artistic influence on him. If the scene seems a
little forced, it conveys as you read it that in maturity the
author resolved his conflict by embracing what his mother _ so long
belittled by his father as weak and foolish _ had managed to imbue
in him.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as you close ``Truth Comes in Blows'' _ the title of
which comes from a question posed by the narrator of Saul Bellow's
novel, ``Henderson the Rain King,'' ``Does truth come in blows?'' _
you recall the tenderness of that reluctant massage Solotaroff gave
his father and his father's groaning pleasure in receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have happened so long ago that you wonder why
Solotaroff told the story of his father's death at the beginning
instead of at the end, when we would have appreciated more fully
the extent of the man's selfishness and thus the wonder of his
son's capacity to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   But by placing his father's death at the end he would have
shifted the emphasis of his book from survival to forgiveness. And
the survival of the succeeding generations is what this memoir is
really about, survival despite all the terrible blows that the
truths of history deliver.

   CALIFORNIA -- BUDGE. Bay Area's congressional delegation was
divided over the huge $500 billion spending bill Congress passed
Wednesday, even though the project contains tens of millions of
dollars for transportation and education projects in the region.
Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- BUDGET. It's 4,000 pages long, weighs nearly 40
pounds and is filled with more pork than a barbecue festival. But
the $500 billion federal budget bill passed by Congress Wednesday
contained a myriad of Colorado projects, including funding for both
the Southeast and Southwest light rail corridors, expansion of the
Federal Courthouse in Denver, the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center at Fitzsimons, and funding for the cleanup at Rocky
Flats. But the thing is so big, Colorado's delegation doesn't know
exactly what's in it. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   -- HEFLEY. (Probable.) Saying it was too bloated, had too much
pork, and was given to Congress too late, Rep. Joel Hefley,
R-Colo., voted against the $500 billion budget plan. Still, the
bill contained many projects for Colorado Springs and the state.
Zaret
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- CANAL. The Augusta Canal National Heritage Area is
$500,000 richer as a result of the massive spending bill approved
by the Senate Wednesday. Williams
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS -- BRIEFS. Column for Sunday. (Working.) Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA -- BUDGET. Northwest Indiana is slated to get nearly $34
million for five projects from the $500 billion federal budget
passed by Congress this week. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA -- BUDGE. Western Louisiana will receive millions of
dollars in education, transportation and health funding, as
Congress approved a huge $500 billion catchall spending bill
Wednesday. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA -- WRAP-UP. Nevada's two congressmen and two senators
reflect on the 105th Congress, and look forward to the 106th.
Preston
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- DEWINE-CLOSING. Ohio Republican Mike DeWine gave the
closing remarks as the U.S. Senate concluded the 105th Congress
Wednesday. DeWine spoke about the impeachment process, foreign
crises and the attack of a gay college student in Wyoming. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   -- OXLEY-COPA. Facing opposition from the Department of Justice
and the American Civil Liberties Union, Rep. Mike Oxley's Child
Online Protection Act, which was tacked onto the Omnibus Spending
Bill, passed through the House and Senate Wednesday. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- STEEL. Members of the steel industry on Wednesday urged
federal officials to take action to stop the illegal dumping of
cheap foreign steel. (Possible.) Gorman
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- SCHOOLS. Every child has been told breakfast is the
most important meal of the day, and Brownsville high schools are
making sure their students get the day started right. ``Breakfast
in a Bag,'' a program started in Pace High School by Principal Tim
Coyle, was such a success that several other schools in the
Brownsville district adopted it. On Tuesday, the Food Research
Action Center (FRAC) held the Brownsville program up as a model for
the nation's schools. Brown
</P>
<P>
   -- FEC. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, continued his trend of

perennial candidate Tom Haughey. Brown
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- OMNIBUS-REACT. With the exception of Rep. David
Obey, the entire Wisconsin delegation was among the 95 members

 &HT;    Divas deliver in electric event
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An estimated 20 million people watched this concert when it
first aired live on April 14, making it the highest-rated program
in VH1's 13-year history. And certainly this teaming of five
disparate pop singers was, if nothing else, a nearly impossible
visual treat. Surprisingly, in spite of the potential clashing of
egos and styles, this recording of the landmark event is almost as
much fun.
</P>
<P>
   But be forewarned, there are drawbacks: dumb stage patter
(Celine Dion, the whitest chick on the face of the planet, actually
says hi to ``everybody in the how-us''), Gloria Estefan's Las Vegas
lounge arrangements and Carey's out-of-control vocal cords hitting
notes like an unleashed pinball. The solid moments, however, are as
rich as a ``hallelujah'' from the First Lady of Soul. Certainly
Aretha Franklin's presence sets the bar up a notch, and the divas
deliver. Relative newcomer Shania Twain actually sounds better than
the wobbly Estefan (``Turn the Beat Around'') and unbridled Mariah
Carey (``Make It Happen''). Dion picks the perfect tunes for her
over-the-top delivery: Ike and Tina Turner's ultradramatic ``River
Deep, Mountain High'' and (yes) yet another version of ``My Heart
Will Go On.'' But the star of this show isn't even listed as a
headliner. Legendary singer-songwriter Carole King joins the entire
group for a soulful version of ``A Natural Woman (You Make Me Feel
Like)'' that's as electric as the final frenzy of explosions in a
fireworks show.

 &HT;    Array of Italian appetizers a colorful, creative way to start
meal
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My, my how we've grown.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Italian food, we're no longer a nation stuck on
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   We rarely say noodles anymore. We say pasta. We buy olive oil _
cold-pressed, extra-virgin. And balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   We've begun to learn the pleasures of risotto, biscotti and
focaccia (anybody catch Cindy Crawford demonstrating her herbed
focaccia on a recent ``Rosie O'Donnell Show''?). And we've
certainly adopted sliced tomatoes with fresh basil, mozzarella and
drizzles of olive oil as a choice summer appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   So why not take another step up to the plate?
</P>
<P>
   Autumn is a perfect time to dive into the deep riches of
antipasti, Italy's array of satisfying appetizers made with simple,
fresh ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   A well-planned antipasto assortment can jump-start an otherwise
all-too-predictable holiday party (by Christmas will you really be
able to stomach yet another slice of ham stuffed into a tiny
croissant?) or perk up the palate at Thanksgiving for that big,
beautiful bird waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may argue that a dessert cart is more enticing,'' Michele
Scicolone writes in her cookbook ``The Antipasto Table,'' ``but I
find an antipasto table harder to resist. Tender seafood, stuffed
vegetables, moist mozzarella and colorful salads spangled with
herbs and glistening with golden-green olive oil are far more
tempting to me than any sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of a great antipasto is ``to stimulate the appetite but
not fill the stomach completely,'' says Elviana DeZan, who for six
years with her husband, Armando, has owned and operated Atlanta's
AREL Group, which supplies olive oil, pesto and other Italian food
products to grocers. ``Think of it as a start to something _ not
the end to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional antipasto is frequently finger food divided into
five basic groups: toasted bread (bruschetta and crostini topped
with various cooked meats or vegetables); sliced cold meats (like
prosciutto, mortadella and salami); cooked or raw vegetables (like
marinated eggplant, stuffed sweet peppers, winter squashes and
mushrooms); cheese and eggs (especially buffalo mozzarella in
little morsels and slow-cooked, round and flat frittatas); and
seafood (like anchovies, oysters, clams, scallops, shrimp and
lobster).
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, sometimes 20 different dishes are prepared for the
antipasto buffet. But DeZan says you can also pull off a successful
start to a dinner party with two or three kinds of antipasto.
Portions are colorful, often bite-size, made with the freshest
ingredients available and encompass a broad spectrum of textures,
flavors and temperature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is to be creative,'' DeZan says. ``Work
with ingredients that look good together and stimulate the
appetite. You want your guests to enjoy themselves without feeling
very full.''
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author Lorenza De'Medici says there is no better way to
welcome guests than to start things off with a really tasty dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anything be more unappetizing than being offered some of
those miserable little packaged things that are often served?'' she
writes in her new book ``Lorenza's Antipasti.'' ``The meal that
follows could be quite wonderful but, unfortunately, first
impressions last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we entertain,'' she adds, ``we should commence with
our best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   How else to show how much we've grown?

 &HT;    These horror flicks a real scream on disc
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whet your appetite for Halloween with a couple of offbeat horror
flicks. Full of mutations and mutilations, David Cronenberg's
amazing ``Videodrome'' is like ``Network'' on a bad acid trip.
James Woods is the owner of a small cable TV station trying to
track down a mysterious program that's nothing but sex and violence
(remember, this is way before Jerry Springer). Talk about ratings
potential ... Deborah Harry plays one of the show's on-air talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thing,'' John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks' sci-fi
classic from the 1950s, offers Kurt Russell and a band of
supporting players enduring several cold days in hell when a
bloodthirsty, shape-shifting alien attacks their Antarctic outpost.
The DVD bonuses include running commentary by Russell and Carpenter
and a behind-the-scenes look at what was then (early '80s) some
pretty fancy special effects work.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Some true heavies: Nazis as aging villains
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once World War II was safely won, the Nazi Next Door became a
fairly familiar figure in movies. After all, not all of them made
it to Argentina. ``Apt Pupil,'' opening Friday, casts Ian McKellan
as a death camp commander who has eluded capture for decades. Here
are some other films about old Nazis who, somewhat like MacArthur's
old soldiers, preferred to fade away ... into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Marathon Man'' (1976) _ This is the movie that made people
more worried about dentists than about Nazis. Dustin Hoffman is a
grad student at Columbia University _ a marathon runner who runs
afoul of former concentration camp commandant Laurence Olivier. The
script, which was written by William ``Nobody Knows Anything''
Goldman, is pretty convoluted, but all you really need to know is
that Olivier is looking for some diamonds smuggled out of Germany
and that he tries to extract (literally) information from Hoffman
during an after-hours dental session.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Boys From Brazil'' (1978) _ Olivier goes from Nazi to
Nazi hunter (based on Simon Wiesenthal) in this adaptation of Ira
Levin's thriller about aging Nazis still plotting to breed a race
of Aryan supermen. Olivier's portrayal won him his 11th Academy
Award nomination (he lost to Jon Voight in ``Coming Home''). But
the performance most people remember is upstanding, heroic Gregory
Peck _ our Atticus Finch, for goodness' sake _ cast against type as
the nasty Nazi mastermind Josef Mengele.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Music Box'' (1989) _ OK, so the Nazi posing as the
kindly old man across the street who always says hello to your kids
is a scary enough proposition. What if maybe ... just maybe ...
your own father came under suspicion? The great Armin Mueller-Stahl
plays a Hungarian refugee accused of being the leader of an SS
death squad who has managed to disguise his past for almost 40
years. Add one more twist: When Mueller-Stahl goes on trial, his
defense lawyer is his own daughter, played by Jessica Lange. The
atrocities of the Holocaust are a constant echo, but this movie is
less about the father's guilt or innocence than the daughter's
inevitable loss of innocence. After all, what do we ever really
know about our parents' pasts?
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Producers'' (1968) _ For a truly nutty take on Nazis,
you can hardly do better than Mel Brooks' blithely tasteless farce
about an overbearing producer (Zero Mostel) and a meek accountant
(Gene Wilder) who team up on a seemingly foolproof scheme: to sell
25,000 percent of the profits of a show they're sure will be the
biggest flop in Broadway history. The show, they think, will fold
and they'll keep the investors' money. Their author is a deranged
Nazi-in-hiding (Kenneth Mars) who's written something called
``Springtime for Hitler.'' That's also the title of the immortal
opening number, which offers statuesque chorus girls goose-stepping
in swastika-shaped formations that would do Busby Berkeley proud.
The lyrics, if memory serves, go something like this: ``Springtime
for Hitler and Germany / Winter for Poland and France.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie'' (1987)
_ Of all the movies listed here, this is the most important. And
the most compelling. Because it's true. Oscar-winning documentarian
Marcel Ophuls uses the postwar exploits of Klaus Barbie, a.k.a.
``the Butcher of Lyons,'' to examine the human response to evil.
Barbie spent his later years in South America, where various
dictators and drug lords welcomed his expertise in torture with
open arms and open wallets. In 1987, Barbie was finally extradited
to France and put on trial for ``crimes against humanity.'' Yet the
facts of his monstrous resume interest Ophuls less than the
reactions of those who knew him _ as friends, bosses or even
victims. The true heart of darkness that he uncovers is their
indifference; we hear ``that was 40 years ago'' or ``not the Jews
again'' time after time. It is a remarkable piece of filmmaking
with implications that stretch far beyond the Third Reich.

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: Reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Hope Floats'' (PG-13) _ The Lifetime Channel writ large.
There's nothing wrong with this sweet drama about a former beauty
queen (Sandra Bullock) who gets dumped by her hubby and moves back
home to live with Mom (Gena Rowlands, having to do eccentric,
life-affirming shtick for the zillionth time). There's just not a
lot that's compelling about it. Gee, will Sandra let herself fall
for hunky, sweet, perfect Harry Connick Jr.? The suspense is
killing me. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Big Hit'' (R) _ The big ho-hum. Treading territory that
``Grosse Pointe Blank'' covered better last year, ``Hit'' ponders
the problems of a professional killer trying to maintain a domestic
life. Mark Wahlberg plays Mel, a hit man torn between mowing down
mobsters and romancing a girlfriend (Lela Rochon) and a fiancee
(Christina Applegate).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Species II'' (R) _ Garbage. This sequel casts former Emory
University student Justin Lazard as an astronaut infected with an
alien monster. The result? He has sex with anything that moves,
causing instant pregnancies that make the women explode. Don't say
we didn't warn you. Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Anchoress'' (unrated) _ In this luminous, black-and-white
drama, Natalie Morse plays a medieval woman who agrees to be the
anchoress of a small country church. That means that she allows
herself to be walled up in a tiny room for her entire life, in
honor of the Virgin Mary. The local priest (Christopher Eccleston)
sees her as a great tourist attraction for his parish. But life and
nature prove to be more powerful than doctrine in Chris Newby's
(``Madagascar Skin'') slow but rewarding film. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' (G) _ It's chitty, all right.
This 30th-anniversary re-release of the Dick Van Dyke flying-car
flick might help you understand why the movie musical died. But
your (little) kids will probably dig it. Priced to buy, $14.95.
Grade: C-

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Opposite of Sex'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Don Roos' comedy of bad manners tweaks as many
politically correct taboos as it can. Christina Ricci, that dark
blossom of cinema, plays the 16-year-old anti-heroine, who moves in
with her adult, gay half brother (Martin Donovan) and does all she
can to wreck his middle-class life. That includes seducing his dim
boyfriend, insulting his schoolteacher friend (Lisa Kudrow) and
kidnapping the urn containing his dead lover's ashes. Surprisingly,
as the film spins along on its smart-aleck quips, it heads toward a
resolution that's sweet and romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Other movies written by Don Roos: ``Love Field,'' ``Single White
Female,'' ``Boys on the Side''

</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has been told he can box again. Isn't that like
telling Bill Clinton to energize his libido?
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East peace negotiations no doubt have taken a lot out
of Mr. Clinton, but we bet he's liked them more than his summer
vacation talks with Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House spokesman Mike McCurry says Mr. Clinton is a
``richly gifted leader'' but ``exasperatingly stupid in his
personal life.'' We think he meant sexasperatingly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The list of folks unofficially running for president grows: Gary
Bauer, Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, John Ashcroft, John Kasich,
Dick Gephardt, Al Gore, Bill Bradley. But the only guy officially
campaigning is Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his new White House chief of staff, John
Podesta, ``has a tough hide.'' More important now is knowing where
to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The 105th Congress certainly hasn't done much. And we're not
sure if the country is doing well because of _ or despite _ that.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial has been interesting so far, but would be
even better if someone could figure out how to blame O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has recovered much of the ground it had lost
since August. But probably it will need to rise a lot more before
some financial analysts recommend small investors get back in.
</P>
<P>
   In a doctoral thesis, Saddam Hussein's son predicts the U.S.
will lose its superpower status. And will Iraq become Kuwait's
closet space?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit is growing due to the Asian financial
crisis. So should we order out more or less Chinese food?

 &HT;    In all their glorious variety, appetizers of Italy are an
enticement
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antipasto is singular. Antipasti is plural.
</P>
<P>
   There now. You're on your way to learning about Italy's great
appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   The country's range of antipasto dishes is great, and the
intricacies in regional varieties mind-boggling. But you don't have
to learn it all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Just know that by absorbing the following 10 terms, all adapted
from John Mariani's ``The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink''
(Broadway Books, $17), you can begin to master antipasto in all its
forms:
</P>
<P>
   -- Affettato (ah-feh-TAH-toh) _ Sliced, cold meats, including
prosciutto and mortadella.
</P>
<P>
   -- Assaggio (ah-SAH-j'yoh) _ A taste of something, a morsel or
little bit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bocconcini (boh-kohn-CHEE-nee) _ ``Small mouthfuls.'' Also
refers to small balls of mozzarella about 1 inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bruschetta (broo-SKEH-tah) _ Toasted bread, often rubbed with
garlic and drizzled with olive oil and spread with various
toppings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bufala (BOO-fah-lah) _ As in buffalo mozzarella. Milk from
the water buffalo is the basis for Italy's best cheese.
</P>
<P>
   -- Crostini (kroh-STEE-nee) _ Thinner than bruschetta, they are
slices of toast with toppings. They are a Tuscan specialty.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gnocchi (N'YOH-kee) _ Dumplings, usually cooked in water or
broth, but also baked. They are made with flour (sometimes
semolina), egg and often potatoes, but also Parmesan, ricotta,
spinach, pureed pumpkin and more. For antipasto, they're often
served unsauced as finger food.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mortadella (mohr-tah-DEH-lah) _ Finely ground pork meat and
lard formed into large sausages. Think bologna, but a kind so
superior it could be stamped ``made in heaven.'' Usually flavored
with peppercorns and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   -- Parmigiano (pahr-mee-J'YAH-noh) _ Cow's milk cheese made in
wheels and aged. The best is Parmigiano-Reggiano, made only in the
morning and aged at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Prosciutto (proh-SHOO-toh) _ Superior ham cured in a minimum
of salt for at least 300 days (it is forbidden to use nitrites,
sugar, smoke, water or additives in the curing process). It's
usually served in paper-thin slices.

</P>
<P>
   This Italian sausage ragu, from Lorenza De'Medici's ``Lorenza's
Antipasti'' (Broadway Books, $40), works well on bruschetta but
also can be used quite successfully as a fettuccine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   10ounces sweet Italian sausages
</P>
<P>
   7ounces lean boneless pork meat
</P>
<P>
   1small carrot
</P>
<P>
   1celery rib
</P>
<P>
   1small onion
</P>
<P>
   4ripe plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   6large slices coarse country bread, 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Peel the sausages and crumble the meat into a bowl. Finely chop
the pork, carrot, celery and onion. Peel and chop the tomatoes.
Heat half the oil in a frying pan. Add the carrot, celery and onion
and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly,
or until the onion is translucent. Stir in the sausage meat and
pork and cook for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, fennel seeds, wine,
thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan, lower the heat
to a minimum and cook for about 1 hour, stirring from time to time
and adding a little water if necessary to keep moist.
</P>
<P>
   Uncover and let the juices evaporate completely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the bread
slices on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes,
or until barely golden, turning them once. Brush with the rest of
the oil and arrange on individual dishes. Spread with the sausage
ragu and serve immediately while still very hot.

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This recipe, also from ``Lorenza's Antipasti,'' works well as an
antipasto with drinks because, De'Medici says, the semolina coating
will be crisp enough to allow the gnocchi to become tasty finger
food.
</P>
<P>
   3cups ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1large egg
</P>
<P>
   3ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pinch grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3cups coarse semolina
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put the ricotta in a bowl. Add the
flour, egg, cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, stirring

   Who wouldn't order this succulent dish from Rao's, the popular
10-table Italian restaurant in New York's East Harlem? It comes
from Frank Pellegrino's ``Rao's Cookbook: Over 100 Years of Italian
Home Cooking'' (Random House, $40).
</P>
<P>
   1pound fresh, small squid with tentacles, cleaned (see notes)
</P>
<P>
   2cups lemon juice, divided
</P>
<P>
   4tablespoons salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   8large shrimp (see notes)
</P>
<P>
   1cup fine quality olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2garlic cloves, peeled and halved
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2cups jumbo lump crab meat or imitation crab meat (see notes) or
1 cup jumbo lump crab meat or imitation crab meat and 1 pound
cooked fresh lobster meat
</P>
<P>
   6lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Rinse squid in a colander under cold running water. Separate
bodies and tentacles, as they must be cooked in different water to
keep the tentacles from coloring the rings. Place about 1 quart
cold water in a medium pot. Add squid bodies, 1/4 cup fresh lemon
juice and 2 tablespoons salt.
</P>
<P>
   Place about 1 quart cold water in another medium pot. Add squid
tentacles, 3/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 2 tablespoons salt. Bring
both pots to a rolling boil. Lower heat to a gentle boil and cook
until squid are very tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
run cold water directly into each pot until water is cool. Drain
the bodies, pat dry and cut into rings. Holding the tentacles, run
warm water into the pan. Under the running water, gently rub
between the palms of your hands, pushing the black specks and
colored skin from the tentacles. Use a small paring knife to scrape
the skin, if necessary. Drain well and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the rings and tentacles in a colander. Cover with a damp
cloth and set aside to drain for about 20 minutes. Refrigerate if
not using immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Peel, devein, remove tails and butterfly shrimp. Cover with
water and bring to a boil in a small saucepan. Immediately remove
from heat, drain and refresh in cold running water. Gently press in
a clean kitchen towel to dry well. Cut into quarters. If not using
immediately, cover with a damp towel and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonreactive bowl, whisk together the oil, remaining lemon
juice, garlic, parsley and salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Add shrimp and squid to the oil mixture. Toss to coat. Using a
slotted spoon, remove seafood from oil mixture and place on a
serving plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat to oil mixture and very gently turn to coat. Using
a slotted spoon, remove crab from oil mixture and gently fold into
the shrimp-squid mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Add lobster to the oil mixture. Gently toss to coat. Using a
slotted spoon, remove lobster from oil mixture and place on top of
salad. Discard garlic from oil mixture. Pour remaining oil mixture
over salad and serve immediately, garnished with lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: When purchasing fresh, whole squid, always look for those
that are clear-eyed, smooth-skinned and very fresh smelling. Have
the fishmonger clean and cut the squid to your specifications. Some
fresh squid are sold precut into rings with the tentacles removed;
however, the rings and tentacles are usually sold together. As the
squid cooks, skim off the foam that accumulates at the top.
</P>
<P>
   To butterfly shrimp: Peel and devein, leaving the tail on for
most preparations and removing it only when called for in a
specific recipe. Using a knife, make a shallow cut from head to
tail along the center but not through the shrimp and remove the
dark vein. Lay the shrimp open, deveined side up, and make shallow
cuts diagonally out from the center on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Handle the crab meat carefully so that the lumps remain whole.
But do check for cartilage and shell remnants.

   Michele Scicolone's autumn specialty, from her ``The Antipasto
Table'' (Ecco Press, 1991), is the Sicilian dish called Fegato dei
Sette Cannoli (Liver of the Seven Cannons). The resourceful
Sicilians used inexpensive squash to make it resemble a meat dish.
</P>
<P>
   Extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1butternut squash, small pumpkin or other winter squash, (about
2 pounds)

<P>
   1/3cup chopped fresh mint, basil or flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Generously brush two jellyroll pans
with olive oil. Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scrape out the
seeds and membranes. Peel the squash and cut into 1/4-inch-thick
slices. Arrange the squash in the pans in a single layer. Brush the
slices with additional oil. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the slices
and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, heat the vinegar, sugar and salt and stir
until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Arrange a single layer of
the squash in a shallow dish. Sprinkle with some of the garlic and
mint. Continue layering the remaining squash, sprinkling each layer
with herbs. Pour the vinegar mixture over all.

 &HT;    Two Atlanta brewpubs find gold in Denver
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, silvers; this year, golds.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which wasn't on the craft-beer industry's map only a
few years ago, is making a name for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, two Buckhead brewpubs _ John Harvard's and
Rock Bottom _ became the first Atlanta breweries to win gold medals
at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, the most prestigious
blind competition in the country. John Harvard's beat out 34 other
entrants in the Scottish-Style Ale category, and Rock Bottom was
best among 42 entrants in the American-Style Brown Ale category.
</P>
<P>
   No other Atlanta brewers won a medal _ gold, silver or bronze _
at this year's competition, which drew almost 2,000 entries in more
than 50 styles.
</P>
<P>
   For Kurt Harrison, head brewer at John Harvard's in Buckhead,
winning had a special satisfaction. Last year, judges found nothing
worthy of a gold in the Scottish-Style Ale category, but the entry
Harrison's designed and brewed for John Harvard's
Massachusetts-based chain of restaurants was awarded the silver.
(Sweetwater Ale, brewed in Atlanta, won a silver last year in the
English-Style Bitters category.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scottish ale was the first recipe I did when I came to
John Harvard's, just after we opened,'' says Harrison, who grew up
in Stone Mountain and trained at the White Horse pub in London and
at Manhattan Brewing Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Scottish ales are on the malty side, with little
hop character but a roastiness to the malt that counters the
natural sweetness of the grain. A few craft brewers, notably Bert
Grant's in Yakima, Wash., have broken with that tradition and given
their Scottish ale a pronounced hop note. Harrison's stays true to
the style, and it's been one of the top sellers at the Buckhead
brewpub.
</P>
<P>
   A gold medal at the GABF speaks for itself and yet there are
those who aren't sure the Scottish Ale is Harrison's best. His
India Pale Ale, following the British rather than the Pacific
Northwest style, was already one of the better beers brewed in
Atlanta and now it's acquiring more hop character.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, many beer aficionados would have mentioned the
cask-conditioned IPA or the Iron Horse stout that Clay Gentry brews
for Rock Bottom. The stout, in fact, won a silver medal at the
World Beer Cup competition in August (no gold medal was awarded).
</P>
<P>
   But if the Sweet Magnolia Brown Ale was a sleeper to some, it
wasn't to others. ``It's the personal favorite of the majority of
our staff,'' Gentry says. And, among the half dozen or so styles on
tap at Rock Bottom, the Sweet Magnolia Brown accounts for 20
percent of beer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Light to medium in body, brown ales are somewhere between the
maltier, fuller-bodied Scottish ales and the hoppier pale ales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who actively look for browns,'' Gentry says.
``It's also a good introductory beer for people who aren't
experienced in craft beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry (whose beer was registered as the entry of corporate
partner Big River Brewing Co., based in Chattanooga) sought a more
American flavor profile than the familiar British style _ less
nutty, a little more chocolate malt character, a touch hoppier. In
England you won't find many brown ales brewed with Mount Hood hops,
popular with American microbrewers. ``I'm a particular fan of Mount
Hoods,'' Gentry says. ``They give a spicy aroma that I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainier wins gold
</P>
<P>
   Generic beer _ the kind pitched at ballparks and advertised on
billboards _ also has its category at the GABF. It's called
American-style lager, to distinguish it from real lager, and the
winner among 18 entries was ... Rainier, made in Seattle, a city
more associated with microbeers. Second went to last year's gold
medal winner, Old Milwaukee, brewed by Stroh's. More interesting
was the winner of the bronze _ Schlitz, the Beer That Made
Milwaukee Famous but today as forgotten as Falstaff. Wonder where
the King of Beers ranked.

 &HT;    Cornwell serves up feast of recipes, bite of plot
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Cornwell's fictional medical examiner Kay Scarpetta is
known more for slicing and dicing bodies than for whipping up
holiday recipes. But apparently there's more to the good doctor
than meets the eye. In ``Scarpetta's Winter Table'' (Wyrick &AMP; Co.,
$19.95), Cornwell takes a break from her best-selling whodunits to
show the softer sides of Scarpetta, her niece Lucy and her police
sidekick, Pete Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Written as a novella, ``Scarpetta's Winter Table'' follows
Scarpetta and friends as they gather to celebrate the days between
Christmas and New Year with their favorite foods. And, along the
way, they manage to rescue a delinquent child.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 10 chapters feature a recipe concocted by one of the
principal characters, from Marino's ``cause-of-death eggnog'' to
Scarpetta's famous pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patsy really does make great pizza,'' says Charles Cornwell,
the author's ex-husband and an editor at Wyrick &AMP; Co. in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   He says the writer first approached him about a cookbook. ``She
said she keeps getting requests from her readers for recipes, since
she writes about food in her novels. It started out literally as a
book of favorite recipes of the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are woven into the story line and illustrated with
black-and-white photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The book is expected to be the small publisher's biggest seller
since Richard Lederer's ``Anguished English.'' A first printing of
75,000 copies will be shipped this week.
</P>
<P>
   YESTERDAY'S BEST: If you're looking for a first-edition William
Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway, the best place to find it this
weekend is at the Atlanta Antiquarian Book Fair at the Gwinnett
Civic Center. Nearly 100 dealers from the United States and England
will display their wares Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find books from $5 to $5,000,'' says book fair manager
Giles Hollingsworth. Among the selection are first editions of
``Gulliver's Travels'' for $5,750, ``Life of King Charles'' by Sir
Francis Bacon for $950 and ``Gone With the Wind'' for $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   A new feature of the book fair is the Advanced Book Exchange, an
Internet locating service that allows collectors to connect with
3,400 used and rare book dealers and browse their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingsworth has this advice for beginners: ``Don't collect
books with the idea of making money on them. If it happens, fine,
but don't count on it. And always buy the best-condition book
available. In their haste to build a collection, many collectors
settle for less _ for example, books without dust jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the most collectible Southern books, Hollingsworth cites
``Gone With the Wind,'' ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' ``Uncle Remus,''
``Absalom, Absalom'' and ``The Yearling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gwinnett Civic Center is located off Exit 42 on I-85 north.
Admission to the book fair is $4 for each day or $5 for both. Hours
are 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday and noon-5 p.m. Sunday. Information:
770-518-1393.
</P>
<P>
   WOLFE FOR DINNER: Tickets are still available for a Nov. 18
cocktail and dinner party with Tom Wolfe at the Atlanta History
Center. Before the dinner, Wolfe will discuss his forthcoming book,
``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $28.95, Nov. 10), at 7
p.m. at McElreath Hall, 130 W. Paces Ferry Road N.W. Dinner guests
will receive priority seating for the lecture and signed copies of
``A Man in Full.'' Tickets are $600, with proceeds benefiting the
Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum. Information: 404-249-7012, Ext.
15.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE NEWS: More than 10 years ago, Thomas Harris captivated
readers _ and scared the wits out of them _ with his best-selling
thriller ``The Silence of the Lambs.'' Harris reportedly has been
working on a sequel featuring his famous villain Hannibal Lecter,
but there's no word from Bantam Books on when the manuscript will
be completed. Meanwhile, St. Martin's Press has reissued a
10th-anniversary edition of ``Lambs'' in an oversize paperback for
$13.95. If you haven't read it, it's great for curling up with a
nice glass of chianti and some fava beans.

 &HT;    Peterson principle: Seize the moment
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody should cook with Jim Peterson once. Not only cook with
him, but accompany him to the market and watch as he stares
intently at a pile of potatoes and ponders the age-old question:
What's for dinner tonight?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Peterson is the only cookbook author who proudly, almost
defiantly, claims that he never cooks the same thing twice. How
does he test recipes? ``I have my assistant take care of that,'' he
answers with a laugh. ``I can't bear it.''
</P>
<P>
   His assistant did a fine job of translating the Peterson
philosophy and the Peterson palate into more than 300 appealingly
simple and reliable recipes in ``Vegetables'' (Morrow, $35). But
the real pleasure of this book is Peterson's cleanly written text
that encourages you to think about every step of the process. If
you're going to cook great vegetables, you have to know how to shop
for them, how to cut them, how to cook them and what seasonings you
should be thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   To see Peterson in action, I took him to the DeKalb Farmers
Market while he was in Atlanta and let him loose. Not impressed by
the sheer vastness of the store, Peterson was disappointed that
little farm-fresh produce was in evidence. The fennel was brown and
scuffed. The leeks were droopy.
</P>
<P>
   Then he caught sight of the fresh field peas in the shell and
visibly brightened. ``These look good, and I've never cooked with
them. Let's start here.''
</P>
<P>
   We loaded our basket with a bulging bag of black-eyes, purple
hulls and zipper peas. We got a couple of ears of corn, and he
marveled at what a good idea it was to shuck it in the store. He
loved the shiny, unblemished poblano peppers, and grabbed one.
</P>
<P>
   After a long tour of the fish/meat side of the store, he settled
on pork tenderloin. He picked up a bunch of concord grapes to make
a sauce, and the menu was set: pork with some kinda grape glaze,
and pea-corn succotash that's almost but not quite Southwestern. It
sounded vague but wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my kitchen, I watched closely, chopped when asked and
noted that there were three important considerations for cooking
the Peterson way:
</P>
<P>
   -- You need to have a sharp knife and know how to use it. That's
how he transformed simple boiled field peas into the succotash of
dreams with additions of chopped roasted pepper, corn kernels,
cooked bacon and basil.
</P>
<P>
   -- You need to know how to saute. Forget every other method.
With a little olive oil and a majorly cheap, formerly Teflon-coated
pan he transformed 2-inch-thick pork pieces into crusty, succulent
medallions. His trick was even, steady heat and a brief trip to a
warm oven as he made the sauce.

   -- You need to experiment, but let your palate guide you. He
made a perfectly balanced glaze from concord grapes, sherry vinegar
and some Turkish grape syrup called ``pekmez'' I had on hand. I
doubt these three ingredients have ever been combined before, and I
doubt they ever will again.

 &HT;    Fall into the season with delicious apple dishes
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure signs of the season are the sumptuous heaps of gleaming
apples overflowing and perfuming supermarket aisles.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have found evidence that humans have been
enjoying apples since at least 6,500 B.C. As then, most people
today like their apples straight up, crunching into about 18 pounds
per person of the fresh fruit per year. Applesauce, apple juice
and, of course, apple pie and other desserts are regularly enjoyed
as well, but too many people remain unfamiliar with myriad other
delicious manifestations of the apple.
</P>
<P>
   Although we are most familiar with names like Delicious, Granny
Smith, Rome and McIntosh, there are more than 7,500 known varieties
grown throughout the world. A search of the Internet quickly
reveals hundreds of recipes, not only for the more familiar dishes
but also for recipes where apples are used in a more unexpected
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Take a peek at http://www.seanet.com/Users/tberry/recipe.html
for lists of the familiar, with new twists, including 17
mouthwatering versions of apple pie including Apple Ginger Pie With
Cider-Bourbon Sauce.

   Apple Ginger Pie With Cider-Bourbon Sauce
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings Preparation time: 1 hour Chilling time: 1 hour
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes Cooling time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   It is said that bourbon was first distilled in 1789 by a
Virginia minister, and by the 19th century it had become an
important regional industry. It makes a great cocktail, of course,
but we also like it in this rich sauce.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CRUST:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon apple pie spice
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup chilled solid vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   7tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE FILLING:
</P>
<P>
   3pounds Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and cut into
1/2-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   2/3cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons minced crystallized ginger
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons bourbon
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon apple pie spice
</P>
<P>
   Milk
</P>
<P>
   Sugar
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla ice cream
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CIDER-BOURBON SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   5cups apple cider
</P>
<P>
   5tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons bourbon
</P>
<P>
   To make the crust: Mix flour, sugar, salt and apple pie spice in
food processor. Add butter and shortening and cut in until mixture
resembles coarse meal. Add sour cream and blend in, using on/off
turns just until dough forms. Turn out dough onto lightly floured
surface. Divide in half. Form each half into a ball; flatten into
disc. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   To make the filling: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl,
toss together apple slices, sugar, flour, ginger, bourbon and apple
pie spice.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out one dough disc between sheets of plastic wrap to
12-to-13-inch round. Peel off top sheet; invert dough into 9
1/2-inch deep-dish glass pie dish. Peel off plastic. Roll out
remaining dough disc between sheets of plastic wrap to
12-to-13-inch round. Peel off top sheet of plastic. Mound filling
in pie dish. Invert dough over filling. Peel off plastic. Pinch
edges of dough to seal. Trim excess crust. Crimp edges
decoratively. Cut 5 slashes in top of dough to allow steam to
escape. Brush top with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake until
golden brown, covering with foil if browning too quickly, about
45-50 minutes. Let pie stand until just slightly warm, about 1
hour. Serve pie with ice cream and Cider-Bourbon Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To make the Cider-Bourbon Sauce: In a heavy medium-size
saucepan, boil apple cider until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 45
minutes. Add butter and sugar and whisk until butter melts. Boil 3
minutes, whisking occasionally. Remove from heat. Whisk in bourbon.
Cool sauce completely before serving. Makes 1 cup. _ Adapted from

<P>
   If you have a taste for the Tropics, your request might match a
simple one from Betty Mullins of Lawrenceville, Ga., who asked for
a Pina Colada Cake.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three recipes were sent in by readers, along with high
praise from coconut lovers, such as, ``This is my favorite cake
recipe. I bake it every month.''
</P>
<P>
   Most began with a cake mix topped with some combination of
nondairy topping, flaked coconut, pineapple and sometimes pecans
and maraschino cherries. Some added a splash of rum or rum
flavoring, while others omitted the namesake spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This one, sent by Shelia Skinner of Decatur, Ga., came with the
high recommendation that it is both easy and very moist, the best
she has found that starts with a cake mix. Our tester approves.

 &HT;    R.E.M. redefined
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_Dressed in an awkwardly undersized black suit, plastic
click pens in his pocket and geeky glasses perched on his nose,
Michael Stipe looks anything but a rock 'n' roll deity. Standing
silently in a production studio in a low-rent area of Astoria, in
Queens, he appears more like a high school kid on his way to a
costume party, the theme being ``Revenge of the Nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing here on the dark set of the music video
``Daysleeper'' that smacks of the glamour world of rock 'n' roll is
the catering _ a table spilling over with tiny spring rolls,
asparagus spears, bright yellow bananas and an espresso machine _
and a small group of foreign journalists plopped down in folding
chairs, waiting with microphones in hand for the moment Stipe will
talk to them. It's not clear when that will happen, but then
nothing ever seems to go predictably with the members of one of the
world's most revered rock bands, R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   Take the band's much-debated new album, ``Up,'' which arrives in
stores Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Warner Bros. executives
provided a sneak peek to staffers and curious critics, who reacted
as if they had just been jettisoned through some kind of
mushroom-induced musical directed by Ken Russell, guru of '70s film
excess. The closely guarded CD may have the name ``R.E.M.''
scribbled on a homemade label, yet the sound is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things we had been used to doing, the ways we used to
work in the studio, were totally thrown out the window,'' Stipe
says of the new project. ``Typically, we would go into the studio
and do a basic track with a guitar, drum and bass. But this record
was nothing like that. Everything was backwards and sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Band mates Peter Buck and Mike Mills aren't here today; their
video scenes will be shot later. Neither particularly likes the
tedium of making music videos. They've opted to head back into the
studio for one last listen to ``Up.'' Buck and Mills are
preoccupied with final mix of the project, like sculptors running
their hands over a bust before a public unveiling. And their
concerns may be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the albums R.E.M. has produced in its 18-year career,
this one is perhaps being dissected and probed the most. It's the
first without longtime drummer and founding member Bill Berry, who
shocked his musical family in October 1997 by announcing he was
quitting the band. ``Up'' is also the second album recorded under
R.E.M.'s huge financial deal with Warner Bros., a reported $80
million contract Buck, Stipe, Mills and Berry inked with the label
in 1996. The band's previous CD, ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi,'' was
critically acclaimed but flopped commercially, yielding no hit
singles, despite the presence of some lovely ballads and vaulting
rock numbers. This record is being released at a time when
America's musical landscape is changing, the moody sounds of
alternative _ which R.E.M. virtually invented _ being edged out by
the more in-your-face rhythms of rap, hip-hop and bubbly
Hanson-pop.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest pressure for Athens' most famous export
comes from the calendar. Stipe is 38. Buck is 41. And Mills is 39.
Their fan base, the young
</P>
<P>
   end of the baby boomers and the ``whatever'' clump of Gen X'ers,
are now raising families and signing up for 401(k)s. Yet much of
R.E.M.'s mystique and appeal is built squarely on the band's
iconoclasm, an attitude stitched to the members like a Prada label.
With the band and its core of followers squarely into middle age,
and the original lineup reduced to a trio, it is inevitable for the
media and music community to cast R.E.M. in the light of survival
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, boomer rocker John Mellencamp mused to The New York
Times, ``I'm interested in seeing what happens to R.E.M. because
they've entered my world now. The alternative era is over, and it
will be interesting to see how they handle being mature artists
rather than being this year's model.''
</P>
<P>
   It all begs the question: Can a group that has been the essence
of ennui and hipness for an entire generation remain vital well
into its graying, second decade?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question we had to ask ourselves,'' Buck says, relaxing
on a couch in the suite of the posh Hotel Plaza Athenee on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan. He responds to hints of a midlife
crisis this way: ``Rather than get a 22-year-old girlfriend and
drive a sports car, we decided to redefine ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From the sounds of ``Up,'' R.E.M. certainly has.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Berry's departure, and a tenacious desire to continue
to be perceived as artists as opposed to a product, the band has
come up with perhaps the most unexpected and avant-garde album of
its career. ``Up'' is a grand experiment, a quirky, somewhat
psychedelic journey into the possibilities of sound and studio
production. The band has virtually thrown its drum/bass/guitar
style out the window, opting for a more electronic and ethereal
mood drenched in alternative percussion (drum machines, xylophone,
bells, Mellotron) and production tricks that remind you of the days
when rock music careened through fat headphones from one ear to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about this album is it really doesn't sound like
us,'' Buck says. ``Except for Michael's vocals, you couldn't tell
who was playing on it. Structurally, the songs are different than
anything we've ever done. There isn't such a band feel. A lot of it
is done to drum machines, not a lot of guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   All three band members concede the radical shift in style and
direction was, in part, due to Berry's exit from the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole impetus for this record sounding like it does is,
when Bill quit, I didn't feel like going and getting another
drummer and go right on rocking,'' Buck says. ``It's a record where
we're coming to terms with the fact that there's only three guys in
the band. We don't really have a drummer. We just don't approach
playing music the same way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift in R.E.M.'s style apparently began in the final days
of Berry's tenure in 1996. Gathered in Hawaii to talk about where
to go musically, Buck and Mills were already preoccupied with
Buck's extensive collection of circa-1960s studio tricks _ drum
machines, old synthesizers and sound effects gadgets. As they each
hovered over the primitive demo tapes they were making, they
realized they liked the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going differently even before we found out Bill was
quitting,'' Mills says, nursing a sprained wrist he damaged while
playing pingpong. ``We were already suggesting to him, `Hey, why
don't we on this record do less drums and bass and maybe do some
drum loops and rhythm loops and have some fun with that?' We were
started on that anyway, so when he quit, it just accelerated the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The band and producer Pat McCarthy began using the studio as a
toy, pushing the envelope on sounds, harmonies and instrumentation.
For example, on the second single ``Lotus,'' there's a barking
chorus with a voice shouting ``HEY HEY HEY!'' It's actually a
snippet of an old reel-to-reel tape Buck discovered after someone
had tossed it on a trash pile in his Seattle neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album was more experimental than any other R.E.M. album
I've been connected with,'' says John Keane, the Athens-based
producer who helped engineer ``Up.'' ``I'd say when Bill left the
band, it really kind of pulled the rug out from under everybody. It
left them in kind of a quandary as to what direction to go in for
the next record. Peter and Mike had already created a lot of demos
based around drum machines and synthesizers, a lot of distorted
drum loops and things like that, which normally they would have
replaced with real drums. But I think they were sort of influenced
a lot by new groups like Radiohead and Massive Attack, where a lot
of different types of rhythm are going on. A lot of the finished
product is basically the demos they started with, with a lot of
other stuff built up around it, weird sounds that have been twisted
and looped and turned around backward.''
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. seems delighted with its creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Well, if we can get away with this, then we're
gonna be OK,'' Mills laughs. ``People know we're not a jukebox.
We're the kind of band that's always going to take a left turn, or
try to anyway. Maybe people like to be challenged. Maybe people get
tired of being spoon-fed. Any record is a reflection of what's
going on in your life personally and professionally. We've been
though a lot in the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and industry insiders who have gotten a preview of
``Up'' say they feel like the band did exactly the right thing by
changing its sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they made a really smart move. It would have been
foolish to do anything else,'' says New York rock critic Anthony
DeCurtis (Rolling Stone), who is writing a biography of the band.
``I don't think this is a commercial record, but artistically, it's
an extraordinary record. It's impressive for a band that's been
together for almost 20 years to now be doing some of their
strongest work.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Fram, program director of Atlanta's modern rock station
99X (WNNX-FM 99.7), got a chance to hear the album and calls it
``very, very different. But that's what R.E.M. fans appreciate,''
she says. ``The true R.E.M. fans relish the fact that the band goes
wherever their hearts take them at the time. The '80s
alternative-radio listener is now moving into a more stable phase
of life. They've got a job, kids and a mortgage payment. But these
people still listen to music, and they want to be turned on by new
music from a band they grew up with. And even though our listeners
are a little bit older, Michael Stipe is still the voice of this
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impressive that Stipe has been able to stay in this kind of
demagogue relationship with his audience. Maybe it's because he's
really the anti-rock star, the guy who made being you start doing
songs that reflect the happiness and secure feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. Tritt admits that going from the
halls of Sprayberry High School(Ga.) to the fast lanes of the music
business was a ride he wasn't quite prepared to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fame and success, which is what I spent the first part of
my life chasing after, became almost addictive. I didn't know how
to handle it, all the sudden attention. I'm lucky to be alive. I
lived with a devil-may-care attitude, and pretty much didn't take
anything seriously at all. After I started getting recognition for
being this outlaw, I probably started feeding into it. I probably
said, 'well, if that's what they think of me, I'll show 'em what an
outlaw is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road for most of his early career, Tritt partied hard. He
says he went through women ``like picking apples in an orchard.''
All the while, he wore a gold nugget around his neck _ melted down
wedding rings from two previous marriages _ to remind him never to
do this again. But then came Theresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was really ready for the other two marriages,
as much a I would like to talk myself into that I was. When I met
Theresa, there was just this feeling that `this is right. This is
really right.' If I look back and am honest with myself, I've never
really felt that way before. I can't explain why it happened when
it did, but it's the most wonderful experience I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics like to write off Tritt as a dumb redneck, a
guitar-slinging rube with Lynyrd Skynyrd hair. But in person, he's
polite, confident, and refreshingly unapologetic about his
middle-class tastes and Southern heritage. When he speaks, he wraps
his thick Georgia accent around references to books (he's reading
``The Man Who Listens to Horses : The Story of a Real-Life Horse
Whisperer''), complex musical analyses and ``buck up'''
philosophical insights straight out of a Scott Peck book.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as living on the edge, I was doing it,'' he says. ``And
I had fun. I'm not really sorry for any of those times except that
I let myself get somewhat out of control for a few years. There
were a lot of different women, a lot of wild and crazy alcohol and
drug-filled encounters. Nobody really ever got hurt. It was
something everybody wanted to take part in. But that's something I
look back on now with mixed emotions. In a way, I'm kind of ashamed
of the fact I let myself get to that point. On the other side of
that coin, I'm kind of glad I had those experiences, because it
taught me an awful lot, and I don't think I could be nearly as
happy now if I hadn't gone through them. But it's not what I'm
looking for anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ed Norman, the head of the Nashville division of Warner
Brothers records, believes Tritt has survived the fickle climate of
today's country music precisely because of his introspection.
``There are phases to each artist's career in this business, and
Travis has transcended most,'' Norman says. ``You can see great
entertainers like George Jones or Waylon Jennings go through the
first phase of a career in which they develop and build their
relationship to the marketplace and their constituent base. Then
there's a transition, where they tend to sit back a bit and look at
themselves in the context of the work they've done and how it makes
a contribution to the world of music. To some extent, that's how I
see Travis and what he's doing, which is making the best music he's
ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tritt has indeed stepped back to look at his life and music,
as those who know him testify, his thoughts have led him back home.
Though he has toured the world, made movies and become a household
name, he has never left Georgia for the chic haunts of Nashville or
Los Angeles. When he wears Armani, it's with cowboy boots. Theresa
laughs when she confesses they love to shop at Wal-Mart: ``Travis
makes fun of me `cause I even make the bus stop there when we're
out on the road.'' Though she could certainly afford designer duds,
Theresa's favorite pastime is taking advantage of sales at mall
stores like Clothestime. One of Tritt's favorite possessions is his
Massey Ferguson tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've realized that the very thing you're running from often
ends up being the very thing you're running to,'' Tritt says,
gazing out his window at the rolling countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like living on this farm, for example. My dad (James Tritt,
who still lives in Marietta) used to have gardens that would feed
third-world countries. He'd plant four rows, 200 yards long of
corn. Four rows, 200 yards long of okra. Six rows, 200 yards long,
of butter beans. I've hoed more beans than anyone could imagine.
We'd spend our summers working, and I absolutely hated it. I said,
'if I ever get away from this I'll never, ever do this again in my
life. ''
</P>
<P>
   Tritt says he ``wrote a song about this not too long ago, but
it's so personal I've never put it on an album: I remember how I
cussed/that old hillside dust/in the hot summer sun/that burned my
back.'' It talks about a young man who says he wants to get away
from everything, to run from all this stuff, and he does. A few
years later, he returns and realizes this is where he belonged all
the time. The thing he would love to do more than anything is pick
up a hoe and plant 200 yards of corn, and snap beans and okra.
That's exactly me.''
</P>
<P>
   Out back of the house, there's proof positive that Tritt isn't
kidding about getting back to his country roots. Eight rows of
painted white gourds hang gracefully in the fall sunshine, awaiting
the comings and goings of the purple martins. ``This is exactly
where I want to be, personally and professionally,'' he says.
``This is home.''

 &HT;    `ER' slips on trends as viewers switch to cable
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``ER'' Nielsen numbers tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago at the start of the new TV season, the tube's No. 1
show debuted with 31.85 million viewers. The next week, ``ER'' got
30.63 million. Then 29.34 million. And in the latest ratings for
Oct. 12-18, ``ER'' remains No. 1 with 27.87 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, viewership is falling. And not just for ``ER,''
but for the four major networks as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The household share for NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox so far this season
is 56 percent, down 6 percent from last year, according to The
Hollywood Reporter. In 1996, the share was 65 percent. In 1995, it
was 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer people are watching the major networks (CBS is the only
one that can boast a rise _ a 2 percent jump in its target audience
of viewers age 25-54). Last season, ``Seinfeld'' finished No. 1 and
averaged 33.58 million viewers per week. This season, ``ER's''
Nielsen-leading average is 29.92 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 13 million people are watching ABC's Wednesday night
``20/20.'' And that's good enough to rank the show in this season's
Top 25. Last season, 13 million viewers would rank the show at No.
35.
</P>
<P>
   So where is everybody going?
</P>
<P>
   They're following their friends to cable. Among viewers 18-49,
for example, ratings for all basic cable networks _ like TNT, AMC
and USA _ are up 13 percent.

   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has been told he can box again. Isn't that like
telling Bill Clinton to energize his libido?
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East peace negotiations no doubt have taken a lot out
of Mr. Clinton, but we bet he's liked them more than his summer
vacation talks with Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House spokesman Mike McCurry says Mr. Clinton is a
``richly gifted leader'' but ``exasperatingly stupid in his
personal life.'' We think he meant sexasperatingly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The list of folks unofficially running for president grows: Gary
Bauer, Lamar Alexander, Dan Quayle, John Ashcroft, John Kasich,
Dick Gephardt, Al Gore, Bill Bradley. But the only guy officially
campaigning is Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his new White House chief of staff, John
Podesta, ``has a tough hide.'' More important now is knowing where
to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The 105th Congress certainly hasn't done much. And we're not
sure if the country is doing well because of _ or despite _ that.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial has been interesting so far, but would be
even better if someone could figure out how to blame O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has recovered much of the ground it had lost
since August. But probably it will need to rise a lot more before
some financial analysts recommend small investors get back in.
</P>
<P>
   In a doctoral thesis, Saddam Hussein's son predicts the U.S.
will lose its superpower status. And will Iraq become Kuwait's
closet space?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit is growing due to the Asian financial
crisis. So should we order out more or less Chinese food?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Library of Congress, the world's most voluminous library,
grew by the equivalent of 2 million books on a single day last
week. But rather than build thousands of new stacks to accommodate
the growth, the library could fit the new addition into a small
filing cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the latest donation to the library came in the
form of computer disks _ 44 of them, each carrying 40 gigabytes of
information. The disks include a snapshot of the entire contents of
the World Wide Web during the first two months of 1997, including
each of the millions of individual Web sites _ the good, the bad,
and even the smutty stuff Congress does not want kids to see.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was gathered, stored and donated by Alexa
Internet of San Francisco, which has developed a tool bar that
makes it easy to view Web-site background information like where
the site is located, whether it has a privacy policy, or if it has
won third-party endorsements or awards. The company's president,
Brewster Kahle, said the donation preserves a moment in the life of
the ever-evolving Web and can become a resource for sociologists
and, eventually, historians who want to understand our era.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, while the disks are on display at the library _ as part of
an interactive sculpture _ their contents are not _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a laboratory experiment for us,'' said Guy
Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library of Congress, noting that
some of the material was not suitable for the collections, and the
library was still working out copyright issues. ``We will be using
it to explore how to preserve digital materials, and how to provide
access to these materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahle, who also oversees the non-profit organization Internet

   Videophone Call-Ins On a Cable TV Channel
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has made it possible to perform all sorts of tasks
without leaving the house _ banking, working, even dating. Credit
ZDTV, a fledgling 24-hour cable channel with programming focused on
computer issues, for using the Net to make a virtual community out
of yet another group: the studio audience. The San Francisco-based
network urges viewers to call in to its programs using
Internet-based videophones, which transmit not just voices, but
faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry King says, `We'll go to Altoona, Pa., for our next
call,' '' said Greg Derbin, senior vice president for programming
and production at the network, ``and you'll hear the caller. With
ZDTV, you'll see the caller.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage wider participation, ZDTV will give away up to
10,000 videophones, called Netcams because they transmit their
audio and video signals over the Internet. From Oct. 26 to 31, it
plans to give away one videophone every hour, on its Web site,
Drebin said.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lingering questions like whether viewers want to
see each other in the slow-motion video that comes across a
videophone with a modem connection. Then again, there may not be
too many viewers to complain. ZDTV, which is owned by Ziff-Davis
and began broadcasting in May, reaches only 8 million homes, a
strong start, but a far cry from a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   Survey Will Track Internet Audiences
</P>
<P>
   The question is not whether people are tuning in to radio
programs over the Internet _ they are, albeit not in mass numbers.
The question is whether the listeners count.
</P>
<P>
   As radio stations decide whether to spend money to stream their
audio content over their Web sites, many are struggling with the
business model. They want to be able to measure the size of their
Internet audience _ and, in turn, market it to advertisers _ before
they make the investment in audio streaming.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, The Arbitron Co., which measures traditional
radio audiences in local markets, last week announced plans to
modify its surveys to track which of the stations' listeners tune
in over the Internet. The new plan is a joint effort between
Arbitron NewMedia and RadioWave.com Inc., the interactive radio
subsidiary of Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,708 radio stations worldwide that stream audio, up
from 763 a year ago, said BRS Media, an Internet radio consulting
agency. But thousands of others _ among them, CBS Corp., which owns
about 160 radio stations and has a policy against streaming audio _
have abstained, in part because they want to be able to accurately
measure the audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers Answer Questions Via Internet
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The copious information available on the Net is all
well and good, as far as Steve Gordon, a New York lawyer is
concerned, except that Gordon figures that people spend hours
trying to find the one bit of expertise they are looking for. So he
decided to put a bunch of the experts in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon recently launched Allexperts (www.allexperts.com), a Web
site that allows visitors to question 2,000 e-mail volunteers on
topics like entertainment, computers, and medicine and get a free
reply.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the volunteers are not exactly experts _ the television
and music volunteers are entertainment fanatics whom Gordon
discovered in chat rooms, news groups and on Web sites _ but in the
case of the medical sites, most volunteers are doctors or
academics, Gordon said. ``If you have a keen or critical question,
you don't spend two hours researching it,'' Gordon said. ``You can
spend two minutes researching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says the site does not vouch for the replies, which he
says are meant to serve as general information, not specific advice
or diagnosis. ``It's a chance to talk to people that you might not
have a chance to,'' he said. ``For example, I personally don't know
any neurologists.''

   New Inkjet Printer Has a Darkroom Inside
</P>
<P>
   One clear trend in electronics is to package ever more functions
in a single device, turning a cellular phone, for example, into a
beeper, e-mail receiver, messaging center, bottle opener _ and, by
the way, a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with this trend, Lexmark International Inc. of
Lexington, Ky., is scheduled next week to ship a new inkjet printer
that is also a digital darkroom. The Lexmark Photo Jetprinter 5770
is designed to print digital pictures without a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Photo Jetprinter has a slot into which users can insert a
digital film cartridge. This means users no longer have to upload
the pictures onto a PC, format them and send them to the printer,
said Patrick King, Lexmark's general manager for Digital Photo
Printer.
</P>
<P>
   The printer is expected to sell for $349, and individual
pictures will cost around 60 cents, taking into account the cost of
ink and paper, King said. He said that compared with a cost of 40
cents to 70 cents per print for pictures developed at a
conventional lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the upper end,'' King said. ``But the difference is,
with our printer, you're only paying for the ones you want.''
</P>
<P>
   With some estimates that the digital camera and photoprinter
industry will reach $6 billion a year by 2002, Lexmark believes the
new printer is worth an investment in research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Group Wants to Free Software Source Code
</P>
<P>
   A group of concerned hackers and Netizens met on Oct. 9 at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to fight for the transparency
of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Free Software Foundation, met to celebrate its
philosophy that the source code that underlies software programs
should be freely and openly distributed. The group reasons that, if
the software were readily available, it would be easier for
programmers to enhance programs and fix bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Already, thousands of developers freely and openly distribute
their source code. Still, and not surprisingly, the concept meets
with no small friction from companies that are no keener about
publishing their source code than Coca-Cola is about publishing its
secret formula.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which was started by Richard Stallman, on Friday
presented its first Free Software Award to Larry Wall for his
contribution to free software development. Wall worked on Perl
software, a robust and widely used language for text manipulation
and system management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Wall,'' wrote the Free Software Foundation, ``has always
promoted keeping his implementations free for all to study, enhance
and build on, without restrictions, and the freedom for all to
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the group may want to schedule next year's meeting
for Berkeley.

FOOD RESEARCH GROUP ATTACKS HIGH CONSUMPTION OF SOFT DRINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans consume twice as much soda pop as they
did 25 years ago, a habit that can result _ especially for
teen-agers who down two to three 12-ounce cans a day _ in obesity,
tooth decay and loss of bone mass, according to a new report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are drowning in soda pop _ it's become their main
beverage,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive director the Center
for Science in the Public Interest, a food research organization
that sponsored the study. The center has issued earlier reports
attacking the nutritional value of theater popcorn, many fast foods
and many Chinese, Mexican and Italian dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said at a news conference that ``soda is squeezing more
nutritious foods and beverages out of (youngsters') diets. It's
high time that parents limit their children's soft drink
consumption and demand that local schools get rid of their
soft-drink vending machines, just as they have banished smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Soda consumption has displaced milk, a prime source of calcium,
which is essential for bone growth, the report said. Teen-age boys
and girls drink twice as much soda pop as milk while 20 years ago
they drank twice as much milk as soda, it added.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said that about a quarter of the teens who drink
soda get 25 percent or more of their daily calorie intake from it.
``Those calories, of course, come from sugar, and teens consume two
to three times as much sugar as government guidelines recommend,''
Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's report said that while excessive soda
consumption can lead to obesity, tooth decay and bone-density loss
in teens, it is also linked to such ailments in adults as kidney
stones and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of bone density is a particularly disturbing trend in
girls, said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, a professor of medicine at
Tufts University in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many young women whose bones have fractured, often
during team sports,'' she said at the news conference. ``Almost
routinely, they report diets low in calcium and often high in soft
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Excessive soda consumption ``sets up these teens for
osteoporosis in later life,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   The center urged Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala to commission a study on the impact of soda pop on the
nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside a wall of 868 cans that the center said
represents the annual consumption for the average soda-drinking
male, Jacobson also called on the soda industry to cease marketing
campaigns aimed at children and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   The soda pop industry blasted the report. The National Soft
Drink Association said the research group ``yet again ... is
promoting unfounded consumer alarm by attacking a perfectly safe
and enjoyable food or beverage product, in this case soft drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's ``strained efforts to blame soft drinks for
various health issues simply are not supported by the facts and are
an insult to consumer intelligence,'' the association said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Finkelstein, a spokesman for the association, added that the
industry never claimed that soft drinks provide nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has always been that there's room for water, milk
fruit juice, soft drinks and other beverages'' in a healthy diet,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Grabowski, a vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, said the soda study was ``another tiresome tirade against
the food industry. The alarmists should quit attacking food and
beverage companies that provide consumers with the products they
want and instead join us in educating everyone about proper
nutrition,'' Grabowski said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the average 13- to 18 year-old male who
drinks soda consumes more than three 12-ounce cans of it a day. Ten
percent of soda-drinking males consume seven cans a day, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   Girls drink about a third less than boys. The average 13- to
18-year-old female soda-drinker consumes more than two cans a day,
and 10 percent of them drink five or more cans daily.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the statistics were based on consumption data by
the Department of Agriculture.

MAKING BOOKS: AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In today's popular culture, the journey between fast buck and
sheer greed has a stopover called ``sequel.'' Book publishing,
alas, is no different in this from the movies or television.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent excursion into what could become publishing's
latest nostalgia black hole is a sequel to the Hollywood classic
``Casablanca.'' This time it's a novel, titled ``As Time Goes By,''
which is actually both a sequel and a prequel, with the melancholy
memories from the movie as the cream in the middle of the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Can the sequel movie to this sequel novel be far behind? If
nothing else, whatever happens to the book, it could become a
trivia-question answer. For at last, after years of postulation and
theorizing, this novel may be the first genuine and true piece of
entertainment synergy, that Shangri-La of the media business. That
is, Warner Books commissioned the fiction at the behest of Warner
Bros., its moviemaking sibling, which owns ``Casablanca'' and
recently released a special video edition of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Time Goes By'' was launched with a huge advertising and
publicity campaign and a whopping first printing of 250,000 copies,
making it a Warner big book for the fall. Maureen Egen, president
of Warner Books, said: ``It's a great story of very brave people
doing extraordinary things. It's one of the greatest unfinished
love stories ever.'' True enough.
</P>
<P>
   And, Ms. Egen added, ``There's so much of the story not known
because the movie couldn't tell it all.'' What was needed was ``a
writer who could do great research and put the characters into
historical context, not just tell what happened to the
characters,'' she said. Also true.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of this, the novel has gotten off to a rather slow
start in its first two weeks in the bookstores, and, like movies
themselves, it is often the first two weeks that determine the
future of a book as commercially planned as this.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is money to be made overseas. The rights for this
novel, written by Michael Walsh, a novelist and a former music
critic for Time magazine, have already been sold to 15 foreign
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, booming sales are predicted in Germany,
though the movie is hardly neighborly about Germans. At the recent
Frankfurt book fair, its German publisher, Schneekluth, more or
less replicated Rick's cafe as its booth, and it reportedly is
already taking reorders for the novel, titled there ``Fuer Immer
Casablanca,'' which translates to ``For Always Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   However well the book sells, one thing seems certain. People
won't be quoting the dialogue in it as they still do from the
movie. ```Where are we going?' asked Ilsa. `To the headquarters of
the Czech government-in-exile since the fall of France,' he said as
he closed the door behind them. `To London.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The list of literary sequels that disappeared or did only
moderately well is long.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, John Wheatcroft revisited Wuthering Heights with
``Catherine, Her Book'' (Cornwall Books), which deftly captured the
Gothic but not an abundance of readers with Catherine Earnshaw's
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Tennant did two Jane Austens for St. Martin's Press,
``Pemberley'' and ``An Unequal Marriage.'' ``She did a great job of
writing Jane Austen, but they sold OK, not great,'' Sally
Richardson, president and publisher of the St. Martin's Press trade
division, said. ``The books got more esteem than commercial
success.'' Each sold about 20,000 copies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a ``Rebecca'' sequel, ``Mrs. de Winter'' (William
Morrow &AMP; Co.) by Susan Hill, made The New York Times' fiction
best-seller list for one week.
</P>
<P>
   With this history of paltry sales, why do publishers keep trying
to resurrect our fictional heroines and heroes and our romantic
memories?
</P>
<P>
   For several reasons. Who wouldn't like one more journey with
Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) or Heathcliff (Olivier), on the
page or on the screen?
</P>
<P>
   And despite appearances at times to the contrary, publishers do
like strong characters. Moreover, some few in book publishing have
even retained a tinge of the rhapsodical.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly it's business, the wish for the big payoff. Sometimes
it hits. ``Scarlett'' (Warner Books, 1991) by Alexandra Ripley, the
823-page sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' sold
about 4 million copies in hardcover and about 2 million in
paperback, Ms. Egen said.
</P>
<P>
   It was on The Times' hardcover fiction best-seller list for 34
weeks; in its wake ``Gone With the Wind'' was pulled onto the list
for 10 weeks, which made the whole thing worth the $4.95 million
Warner Books had to pay Mitchell's heirs for the rights to the
sequel she herself never would write.
</P>
<P>
   Now a second sequel to ``Gone With the Wind'' is in the works,
but not at Warner. Ms. Egen says, somewhat happily, ``We felt that
we had done the sequel and we weren't going to do another.''
</P>
<P>
   The project for the second sequel is lost for the moment in the
maw of negotiations at St. Martin's Press, where, Ms. Richardson
said, ``we've been negotiating for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's was said to have paid the Mitchell estate $4.5
million for the sequel to the sequel, and originally planned to
have its Jane Austen, Ms. Tennant, change literary hats and become
its Margaret Mitchell for this book. That plan went by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson will only hint that when the final negotiations
are over, the publishing world will be astonished by the fame and
the accomplishment of the novelist who will do this sequel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough business, making a sequel work, no matter how
astounding the writer. Even the great Mark Twain couldn't do it. He
tried to earn his way out of heavy debt by writing two sequels to
his ``Adventures of Tom Sawyer'' (1876) about 20 years later _
``Tom Sawyer, Abroad'' (1894) and ``Tom Sawyer, Detective'' (1896).
Both flopped.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The San Francisco Ballet, truly a world-class
company, opened its weeklong season at City Center on Tuesday night
with a gala program _ but not any old gala program.
</P>
<P>
   After William Forsythe's astonishing new ballet shot out with
cannonball force at the start of the evening, one wondered how the
company could go on to match the fabulous dancing in this ballet or
even the Forsythian oddity of its title, ``The Vertiginous Thrill
of Exactitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The other titles grew less strange, but Helgi Tomasson, the San
Francisco Ballet's artistic director, knew exactly what he was
doing. He put virtually all his principals and some of his soloists
on display in a showcase that was clearly devoted to excellent
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Some were new, including the striking young Spanish ballerina
Lucia Lacarra, and some were familiar, better than ever and even
stunning. It was a shrewd move. The San Francisco Ballet appears
only occasionally in New York (the last time was in 1995) and
audiences cannot acquaint themselves with its breadth of talent
during a short run.
</P>
<P>
   If any further proof were needed to demonstrate how Tomasson has
transformed a regional ballet troupe into a first-class classical
company since he became director in 1985, it was on this program.
</P>
<P>
   Like all one-time galas, it had eclectic fare: excerpts from
George Balanchine works and 19th-century ballets as well as short
pieces by contemporary choreographers, including Tomasson.
</P>
<P>
   The range of the dancers was obvious. Tina LeBlanc could speed
through the experimental complexity of Forsythe's most neoclassical
ballet and also lend her perfection of traditional style to the pas
de deux from ``Le Corsaire,'' where she danced an interpolated solo
from ``La Bayadere.'' She was partnered by Roman Rykine, one of
several high-jumping Russian-trained dancers that Tomasson brought
to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   A company that has superb dancers attracts major choreographers.
Forsythe, the American director of the Frankfurt Ballet, was one of
the first to do a new work in 1987 at Tomasson's invitation.
``Vertiginous Thrill,'' created in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1996 and
staged for San Francisco this year, is an eye-opener (it will be
repeated Thursday at City Center, 131 West 55th St.).
</P>
<P>
   Here is William the Good, not William the Terrible: no more
dark, alienated mood, no spoken text, no electronic music with a
strong beat from a faithful collaborator, the Dutch composer Thom
Willems.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe goes back to his roots. He has used a Schubert score,
the last movement from the composer's Ninth Symphony, to stress the
purity of ballet's classical idiom while extending its dynamic
potential. Taking his cue from Schubert's subtitle, this work is
``allegro vivace.'' It is sunny, bright and intricate. Ms. LeBlanc,
Kristin Long, Katita Waldo, Parrish Maynard and Christopher Stowell
are sensational in it.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. So much of the choreography depends on
perfect body placement and clarity, a contemporary extension of the
classical style. For all his experiments with spectacular
production trappings in the past, Forsythe has always been a
brilliant classical choreographer. ``Vertiginous Thrill'' lets us
see it, yes, thrillingly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maynard was once with American Ballet Theater, and Ms. LeBlanc
was long ago identified as one of the best ballet dancers in the
United States when she was with the Joffrey. It is how Tomasson has
used them that makes the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Stowell, always impressive in his precision and energy,
and Maynard, both bare-legged in rust leotards (by Stephen
Galloway), set the tone and pace of the piece. Their classroom
positions would be echoed by the full cast at the end, becoming a
metaphor for the basic exercises from which ballet choreography
springs. When the three women entered in disc-shaped green tutus,
the mood evoked a festive sideshow with Picasso's saltimbanques
made happy.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe's focus is on change and speed. The choreography's
structure plays off the music, although the score's occasional
canons are visualized onstage. Note the high-flying jumps (pas de
chat) that set the entire cast springing toward an exciting finish.
</P>
<P>
   Less concerned than usual with a loose torso than fast footwork,
Forsythe has the cast face different directions and move in and out
of formations, often diagonals. The end of one phrase can contain
the germ of the next. But as Maynard and Ms. Long show splendidly
in an acrobatic duet, the steps are unpredictably joined. Charles
Barker conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the program included three excerpts from ``Swan
Lake.'' The Pas de Trois from Act I showed off Claudia Alfieri, as
sparkling as she was in Ballet Theater; Vanessa Zahorian, and
Guennadi Nedviguine, blessed with a light jump and clean style.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Swan pas de deux had another stylish Russian, Vadim
Solomakha, partnering Yuan Yuan Tan, girlish and proficient. Ms.
Lacarra, partnered by Cyril Pierre, carried off the difficult task
of radiating emotional depth in Odette's adagio from Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Star presence comes naturally to Yuri Possokhov. ``Aria,'' which
Val Caniparoli choreographed to an aria from Handel's ``Rinaldo,''
has plain movement. But Possokhov, searching for an identity behind
a white mask that he momentarily sheds, has a Pagliacci poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he and Joanna Berman made something substantial of
Tomasson's neo-Romantic duet ``Twilight,'' set to Mendelssohn.
(Michael McGraw was the pianist and Emil de Cou the conductor.)
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson's ``Two Bits,'' set to music by Aaron Jay Kernis,
served Evelyn Cisneros, who will retire this year, and David Palmer
more than well. They were vibrant and hip in this flashy
contemporary encounter. Muriel Maffre, with her ultra-stretched
extensions, and Benjamin Pierce gave a smooth if acrobatic view of
Balanchine's duet from ``Agon.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet will be repeated, as will ``Shogun,'' by a Brazilian
choreographer, Ivonice Satie. Here Chidozie Nzerem was felled by
Peter Brandenhoff in a bizarre and rarefied duel inspired by
martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson brought the corps onstage for a final parade,
``Polonaise Defile,'' set to Dvorak, a fine close to a fine
evening.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Theater of Drawing,'' an exhibition of
Robert Wilson's early artwork at the Harvard University Graduate
School of Design, offers evocative emanations of the director's
performance events. The carefully selected items _ drawings, pages
from his notebooks and sculptural objects _ conjure atmosphere and
environment. On their own terms they have an artistic appeal. The
display, which runs through Oct. 29, coincides with the
presentation of Harvard's Excellence in Design Award to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's theater pieces are created for the moment, although
that moment, at least in his early work, can last a week. This was
the case with ``Ka Mountain and Guardenia Terrace,'' which took
place on a mountain near Shiraz, Iran, over a period of seven days
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, the work is evanescent, living on in the memories
of those who witnessed it. Some of the plays, like ``Einstein on
the Beach,'' have been preserved on tape. But a printed text cannot
capture the full flavor of Wilson's work in performance. The vision
is so vast that no theater is likely to attempt a production of
``Einstein'' or his other plays, at least not without the active
participation of the director.
</P>
<P>
   While all this is true, something else does survive from the
original productions: the design elements and the details of the
process that led to the finished piece. Wilson is a graphic artist
as well as a performance artist and director with a great sense of
the visual. In that sense, he is in the theatrical tradition of
Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud, who were artists as well as
playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's art has been exhibited in museums and in galleries,
more in Europe than the United States. Many of his drawings _ and
his furniture _ are in private collections. The Harvard show
(curated by Brooke Hodge) is small, compact and representative of
the range of his artistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery at Harvard, the work is aligned like a series of
stage sets. Clean white boxes, the size of rooms, contain diverse
creative material: storyboardlike pages from his 17 notebooks,
large framed drawings, chairs, costumes and photographs. The
pristine quality of the show and its emblematic nature are
characteristic of the director's work on stage.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Ka Mountain,'' there is a short film (by Paul Kaiser) in
which Wilson's spoken comments are interspersed with animated
drawings of the event itself. He recalls the expedition spiraling
up the mountain while the film omits a visualization of the more
ambitious aspects, of what Wilson describes as a ``30-foot spinning
fire'' and adds, ``Then we blew up the top of the mountain with
dynamite.'' At least in this case, one would have had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilson was in Crete preparing that project, he kept
notebooks, some of which are on exhibition. As Geoffrey Wexler,
Wilson's archivist, writes in the brochure accompanying the show,
those notebooks ``reflect both a focused concentration on detail
and a passionate desire to break out into limitless open spaces.''
``Ka Mountain'' represented a turning point in his career. Since
then, his work has been indoors and primarily on a proscenium
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition helps restore ``Ka Mountain'' to a live event.
The same sense of restoration, or at least approximation, is true
of ``The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin,'' ``Einstein on the
Beach'' and ``A Letter for Queen Victoria,'' the other plays
covered in the Harvard exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph Stalin,'' a dusk-to-dawn vigil, recapitulated aspects
of previous work (including ``Deafman Glance''), becoming a kind of
Wilsonian compendium. Here it is illustrated by excerpts from his
lavish notebooks and a pair of chairs (fiberglass covered with
thick lead sheeting). Over headphones, in an odd anachronism, one
can hear the melancholic singing of Woody Guthrie's ``Going Down
the Road Feeling Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein,'' the operatic collaboration with Philip Glass that
was Wilson's debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1976,
introduced him to a wider New York audience. In the exhibition
there is a model set of a courtroom scene and a large drawing that
looks like a mysterious tower. Actually it is Wilson's depiction of
a Sanitation Department building that he can see from a window in
his West Side apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's chairs are like no other furniture: The large blocky
armchairs designed to conjure the British monarchy are giant
monoliths. Next to the thin-wired Einstein chair (constructed from
galvanized pipe) is a placard informing the viewer that Einstein
said that if his life had taken a different turn, he would have
preferred plumbing as a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs are the opposite of welcoming, but in a photograph in
the brochure the director is seen sitting in one of his creations
looking as comfortable as if he were watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Though the director always has a team of supportive helpers,
some scenic effects have disappeared, perhaps partly as a result of
his peregrinations across Europe. The ``Queen Victoria'' chairs
were found in storage in Zurich, and the backdrop from that show
was discovered in a Dumpster outside the director's New York
office.
</P>
<P>
   Not on exhibition are examples of his lighting techniques, those
pillars of white light that he has used to scenic effect in plays
and operas, including ``Lohengrin,'' which opened last March to a
vocally negative Metropolitan Opera audience. When that opera
recently returned to the repertory, it was greeted with enthusiasm,
as the audience chorused its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Although the items in the exhibition were integral to the
productions, they exist as art objects unattached to a performance
event. Some notebook sketches, collaged with clippings and picture
postcards (one of the main street in his hometown, Waco, Texas) are
not so distant from artists like Joseph Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any lingering question about Wilson's credentials as
an artist, it is answered in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts,
currently the home for an exhibition of Monet. Near the Monets is a
room of contemporary sculpture: a Sol Lewitt boxlike construction
made from sprayed aluminum, a collage of cardboard boxes by Robert
Rauschenberg, a pair of Josef Beuys light bulbs, all of which could
be used with scenic effectiveness in a Robert Wilson play. Next to
them is one of Wilson's ``Einstein'' chairs, looking very much at
home in company with work by other experimental artists.

SOME CRITICS AREN'T SOLD ON COMPUTERS IN CLASSROOMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As schools increase technology budgets and parents rush to buy
home computers, the value of computers in education has become a
topic of debate.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators and teachers need to keep in mind that if
they simply drop a lot of computers into the classroom, ``nothing
miraculous is going to happen,'' said Sherry Turkle, a professor of
the sociology of science at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and author of two books on computers. ``The question is,
how are they being used?''
</P>
<P>
   Students need to be taught to read Web information with care,
she said, and to ask questions like: Is this information accurate?
Who wrote this? Does the writer have an ax to grind?
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also have to decide what is best taught by computer and
what is not.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said her 7-year-old daughter once had questions
about magnets. A computer program about magnets didn't help so
professor Turkle bought some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once she was holding it in her hands, she got it,'' Turkle
said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer isn't the best tool for teaching something like
appreciation of certain literature, she added. ``You need a teacher
and a conversation to teach the beauty of poetry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Turkle favors computers in the schools, she also urges
school district officials to consider what they may be cutting to
put the computers in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools really need to look carefully at the opportunity
costs,'' she said. ``They need to make sure they've made a careful
set of decisions about what is being taken out to let the computers
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Stoll, an author of books on technology including ``The
Cuckoo's Egg'' and ``Silicon Snake Oil,'' recently has spoken out
against technology in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to teach basic learning,'' he said from his Oakland,
Calif., home. ``The computer doesn't do that. They don't encourage
love of scholarship. They encourage you to browse the Web.
Technology doesn't provide education. If you like TV, you'll love
the Internet. It teaches you how to watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are pushed on parents much as televisions were in the
late 1950s, he said. ``I feel that our public schools are being
sold down the river, a river of technology, a river of easy
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is worthwhile is cooperation, a love of scholarship, art,
music, reading and writing. That's tough stuff. Shooting down UFOs
to learn math is dumbing down the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a third grader doing research worthy of a World Wide Web
search? I'm delighted if a fourth-grade student does research by
reading a book.''
</P>
<P>
   His views will not get an argument from all teachers. Ellen
Specter, a Cherry Hill, N.J., kindergarten teacher, said that in
her 32 years of teaching, she has seen creativity drop.She
attributes part of that to computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect the visual image to come up before them,'' Specter
said. ``Creativity has plummeted. Everything is instant. They don't
have to play. When you ask them to color whatever they want, many
will say, `I don't know what to color.' That's where you see a
difference.''

CATCHING CARNIVAL FEVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 25) 
(JT) 
 By PETER WATROUS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cultures get carnivals that reflect them, and Martinique's
careful, deliberate carnival, with its strains of political satire
and its eruptions of beautifully lyrical vulgarity, has the
island's number. Martinique is worldly on its surface, but under
that sheen lies all sorts of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public display takes place downtown in the island's
capital city, Fort-de-France. The five-day festival lasts one day
longer than most other Lenten carnivals, ending late in the evening
on Ash Wednesday. The floats and drum groups march around the
city's green square, La Savane, along the harbor front, along the
town's main boulevard, down the canal that separates downtown from
the working-class neighborhoods that produce most of the carnival
drumming, and back along the harbor front. The walk takes 10
minutes, and in that 10 minutes one moves through centuries of
Caribbean history, past gingerbread houses, women laden with
ornate, gorgeous Creole gold jewelry, people of African, Chinese,
Indian and European descent and combinations thereof.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities this year began at sunrise in the poor
neighborhood of the Bo Kannal, with a traditional Creole breakfast
(green bananas, codfish, avocado and smoked herring salad) and one
of Martinique's great drum groups, Tambou Bo Kannal. They end five
days later with the burning of Vaval, the carnival's king _ almost
always portrayed in a large float as a crooked politician _ on a
small beach on the harbor, the sun going down as cruise ships line
up to enter the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival in Martinique is casual and refined, and onlookers can
watch or join in and follow the small floats or the absolutely
precise drum groups. You can wander into the stream of the parade,
then stop for a croissant and coffee _ it's a French island, after
all _ do some people watching, then head to the river again. This
is an outwardly polite society, and there is no bumping, or thick
crowds or obviously inebriated revelers. This carnival is great for
children.
</P>
<P>
   The first two days demand nothing; they're mostly pageantry
suitable for younger children. But the rest of the days are more
ribald, with themes that most people embrace, dressing accordingly.
Monday is a day for burlesque weddings (cross dressing is a must),
Tuesday is red-devil day, Ash Wednesday is a day of mourning for
carnival, so people wear black and white clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the country another carnival rules. The smaller towns
send their floats or drum groups to play in the largest nearby
town. The floats have more character, and humor, and the feeling at
Riviere Salee, for example, 35 minutes down the road from
Fort-de-France, is more playful and more political; this year's
floats celebrated the 150th anniversary of the emancipation of the
slaves in Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   If you dig a little deeper, you'll find some of the best
festival music in the Caribbean, and if you work at it a bit,
access into one of the last places where an older Creole culture
still exists.
</P>
<P>
   At La Fontane, an elegant restaurant in a planter's home, on the
green hills that mark off the boundaries of Fort-de-France, a band
of older musicians plays waltzes and beguines, using a clarinet as
a lead instrument. The complicated dances are performed by elders _
the men in starched white suits, the women dressed in long white
outfits with elaborate madras headdresses drenched in gold; the
various knots in the headdresses indicate their marital status. The
food is Creole and French, with conch and fish fritters and ragouts
of squash. It's New Orleans during the last century.
</P>
<P>
   For a different type of formality, the best bands in a
music-rich country all play during carnival, and they usually play
in some sort of outdoor setting. Up the coast a bit from
Fort-de-France, the Marouba hotel has large tents set up next to
the beach. This year, the hit of carnival was ``En la Casa de tu
Mama,'' part in Spanish and part in Creole _ imagine what happens
in your mother's house _ and thousands of young Martinicans, many
back from jobs or studying in France, all seemingly knowing each
other, were there to hear the music. Taxi Kreol', a modern
Caribbean dance band, with horns and guitars and choreography, had
the place hopping until four in the morning, with people going from
the bar and the food tables to the music and back; the food and
liquor are free, after you've paid the $27 admission.
</P>
<P>
   Then, several sweaty hours and plenty of exuberantly rude
carnival songs later, the crowd left. Suddenly, from a distance,
the drums started, and the cascading sounds of a Martinican drum
choir _ in this case Plastic System Band _ rolled through the
place. The drum choir marched through the tent and hotel grounds,
with the people following, dancing and singing to the music; it all
ended after the sun came up.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more. Down south, in Ste.-Anne, a seaside town with
perfect stone bungalows covered in flowers and an immaculate
square, a large Guadeloupean drum orchestra, with chants sung over
the roiling drums, played for free to a large audience relaxing in
the sweet humidity. Out in the rural suburbs of Fort-de-France,
Lamentin, a special carnival version of the Guadeloupean superstar
Zouk group Kassav was playing in a huge shed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after 3 in the morning, out came Matjilpa, a drum group
with its own records and a dance group. It's surreal, after dancing
all night, to see highly choreographed, wildly athletic young girls
moving to the rolling extravagance of a drum group. Then, as the
light of dawn makes its way through the early morning mist, as the
people drift away, walking through the empty fields to their cars,
all that is left is the sound of joy, as expressed through the
drum.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of music festivals around the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Aruba's Carnival, which runs from Jan. 7 to Feb. 16, includes a
calypso contest (Jan. 26 to 28), along with traditional parades
with marching bands and floats; the 45th Grand Carnival Parade
takes place on Feb. 14. Information: (800) 862-7822.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbados Jazz Festival, on Jan. 13 to 17, will feature Kenny
G and Earth, Wind and Fire, among others. (888) 227-2236. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curacao holds its Tumba Festival on Jan. 25 to 29, toward the
end of carnival, with the best bands on the island competing.
(Tumba, unique to Curacao, is based on African tambu rhythms.)
(800) 270-3350.
</P>
<P>
   The Creole Music Festival, in Dominica, Oct. 30 to Nov. 1,
features some of the best Creole groups from all over the world.
This year bands include Tambo Combo from Haiti, Aurelus Malbele et
Loketo from Congo and Buckwheat Zydeco from Louisiana. (767)
448-4833.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's Jazz Festival, Nov. 6 to 8, will include American pop
acts like Kool and the Gang, Chaka Khan and Brian McKnight, along
with light jazz stars like George Duke and Dianne Reeves. The
island's Reggae Sunsplash Festival takes place Nov. 3 to 7. (800)
233-4582.
</P>
<P>
   Martinique's 13th Biennial Guitar Festival takes place Dec. 5 to
13, with performers from the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, the United
States and Canada. (212) 838-6887.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Lucia Jazz Festival on May 10 to 16 mixes serious jazz
musicians, including Elvin Jones, Ravi Coltrane and Loston Harris,
with pop singers like Patti LaBelle and the world music star
Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Outside of Cuba's jazz festival, it's the
best Caribbean jazz and pop event. (800) 456-3984.

MANY SENATE REPUBLICANS REVOLT AND OPPOSE MAMMOTH SPENDING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surprising number of Senate Republicans revolted
against their party's leadership Wednesday to vote against the huge
federal spending bill that the Senate passed and sent to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rebels criticized the 40-pound document as too
pricey, too rushed and so huge that members barely knew what was in
it.
</P>
<P>
   The $520 billion appropriations measure combined eight of the 13
spending bills needed to fund the government for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1, along with $20 billion earmarked for emergency
spending, and a host of pet projects slipped in at the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost accounted for about one-third of the $1.7
trillion federal budget for the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Senate vote of 65-29 for passage included 20
Republicans and nine Democrats in the ``nay'' column.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., defensively conceded that the bill ``is too big, and the
process isn't the preferred way'' to complete spending bills. But,
Lott added, ``It is what is needed to keep important government
programs working.''
</P>
<P>
   With Congress headed home to campaign for the Nov. 3 mid-term
elections, the chaotic final days of the session reflected the
harsh reality facing Republicans. Their options were either to
accept the mammoth spending package or face a government shutdown.
The last time that happened _ in 1995 _ the public blamed the
Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators called into question the tenure of the Senate
leadership. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who voted against the bill,
said Republicans ``are going to have some questions'' about whether
the present GOP leadership should be retained. He called the
spending bill ``the irresponsible product of a dishonest process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., another ``nay'' vote, faulted
Republican committee chairmen for taking ``feet-in-the-cement
positions'' and failing to compromise on spending issues earlier
this year, forcing Congress to take up the eight spending bills at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said Republicans were forced to ``turn the ball over to
the White House'' and agree to extra spending for
Democratic-sponsored programs because Congress failed to get its
job done.
</P>
<P>
   Senate critics of the jumbo package said the annual
appropriations process became bogged down this year. They blamed
the lag on the zeal of some lawmakers to pass anti-tobacco
legislation or overhaul the managed care system or the
time-consuming efforts to investigate the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the last vote of his 18-year congressional career, retiring
Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., voted against the bill and criticized the
budget process as ``deeply flawed.'' He derided his colleagues for
approving $20 billion for emergency spending on what he deemed
non-emergencies. That emergency spending included money for farm
relief, natural disasters and fixing the year 2000 computer problem
in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Many members said a major reason for the breakdown was the
absence of a budget resolution. That blueprint for spending
programs and taxes is supposed to be approved in the spring so that
congressional appropriators then will know their spending targets
in time to pass spending bills before August.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional budget negotiators failed to pass the budget
resolution for the first time since the Congressional Budget Act
was enacted in 1974. Negotiators intentionally delayed their work,
hoping to carve out a major tax cut, which eventually failed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another GOP naysayer, denounced the
bill for being chock full of ``pork-barrel spending projects.''
McCain cited several examples of what he called pork, including $1
million for peanut quality research in Georgia, $250,000 for a
lettuce geneticist in Salinas, Calif., and $2.5 million for the
federal Office of Cosmetics and Color.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism came from both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.V., an acknowledged expert at sliding
pork into spending bills, denounced the bill as ``a monstrosity''
and voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said it was ``terrible'' for Congress ``to wait until the
last minute and then pass an elephantine monstrosity and call it an
appropriations bill... There's no living person that knows
everything that's in this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there in the real world, when you don't do your work, you
are fired,'' Byrd added. ``On the real job site, colleagues, we
would be gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., another ``nay'' vote, said
the breakdown in the budget process, which led to lawmakers voting
on millions of dollars in programs no one even debated, indicates
``Congress is getting ominously careless with its rules and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats griped that they were left out of the process
while Republican leaders cobbled together the final details of the
jumbo spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to resemble a kind of bastard parliamentary
system'' in which ``the real decisions are made in a closed room by
three or four people,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said he voted against the bill because
it contained ``several hundred pages that are a complete mystery to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said it was impossible to make decisions about the public
interest because it was impossible to know how that interest jibed
``with a bill whose 3,800 pages were not even published until the
dark of last night.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the Republican leadership for failing to schedule the
Senate's time properly over the course of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said never before in his memory had
the Senate been confronted with such massive appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the wretched process which produced this bill
and cannot in good conscience vote for it,'' Levin said.

SENATE CONFIRMS MORDUE FOR FEDERAL JUDGESHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Wednesday unanimously approved the
nomination of Norman Mordue, a Supreme Court justice in New York,
as a federal judge for the state's northern district.
</P>
<P>
   During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., called Mordue ``a great lawyer, a great judge, a
great citizen, a patriarch of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``You're
an example of what a federal judge ought to be and what a human
being ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Mordue, the Senate confirmed 16 of President
Clinton's nominations to federal judgeships Wednesday, bringing the
total for the year to 65.
</P>
<P>
   That is 29 more than last year, but Democrats continue to
grumble over what they see as a politically motivated effort by
Republicans to slow the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   Mordue, of Syracuse, N.Y., was born on June 26, 1942, and
received an undergraduate degree in 1966 and a law degree in 1971
from Syracuse University. From 1966 to 1968, he served in the U.S.
Army and received the Purple Heart and other awards for his service
in Vietnam before being discharged as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1982, Mordue served with the district attorney's
office in Onondaga County, first as a clerk, then as an assistant
district attorney. From 1982 to 1985, he was a Onondaga County

TOTALLY TILED: IT'S AWESOME  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIANNE ROHRLICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tile has always been long on service, but it's no
longer short on style.
</P>
<P>
   Subway-white may still be their basic black, but after 50 years
of an institutional lull, tile makers are rediscovering tile's
fabled power to please and inspire. Thanks to a new market of
colors, sizes and materials, the simple tile wall has become a
world of options.
</P>
<P>
   The textures and palettes of North Africa, Latin America and the
Middle East are being translated into some of today's most
surprising interiors _ with tile. American artisans, too, are
revisiting the idea of an arts and crafts movement, with
reproductions from the turn-of-the-century and new designs. Today,
there is tile for every taste _ for modernists who revel in intense
color fields and preservationists who need historical replicas. One
has only to survey the dozens of new stores in New York to
appreciate the abundance of tiles. Heeding the call, the
manufacturer Bisazza, based in Vicenza, Italy, and Ex Inc., with
roots in Sardinia, opened sparkling new showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of the old look of ostentatious, marble-slab
surfaces,'' the New York designer Stephen Sills, said. ``The look
of handmade ceramic tile is more personal and less slick. And for
people who like color, Italian glass-mosaic tile corresponds to the
modernist palette of the 1960s that is so popular now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tile is also teaming up with other materials like metal and
stone, taking some of the blank boredom from the traditional
totally tiled look. David Mullman, a New York architect, used both
glass-mosaic tile and broad, thin blocks of limestone in a recent
loft bathroom construction, playing them for their gem-toned
translucence, suede-like texture and subtle shades. ``A whole room
of either would have been too much,'' Mullman said. ``One material
is too hard to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Tile has been the face of civilization for 6,000 years, but at
the end of this century, it still has a few tricks up its sleeve.
Advances in technology have strikingly affected small producers
working in ceramic workshops as much as giant factories. Shapes are
breaking the grid, too, with brick-like oblongs and scallop-edged
border panels. And innovations in glass are bringing a bright
eyeful of color options.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the most advanced tile production today looks
still delightfully low tech, as it did in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might look that way, but the technology has allowed small
kilns to use improved clays, glazes and firing techniques,'' said
Marcello Napoleone, who owns Ex: Inc., with his wife Amy. ``Three
thousand years ago _ even a few years ago _ small-tile production
in America and in Europe depended on local clays and minerals for
glazes. Now, materials can be brought in from any place to improve
the process and the glazes.''
</P>
<P>
   And 50 years ago, only small tiles _ four or five inches square
_ could be pressed. Now, it's not unusual to find 12-inch and even
16-inch squares. ``Designers are using large tiles,'' said
Christina Abbate, a consultant to the Italian tile industry,
``because they say large tiles make small rooms look bigger.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sallick owns Waterworks, a group of 20 stores in the
United States that specialize in handmade American ceramic tile
from small workshops. He sells a collection of architectural tiles
that are larger in scale and inspired by building materials. When
installed, they look like white wainscoting or bead board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ceramic tile is becoming almost like wallpaper or paneling,''
he said. ``People are more comfortable with tile and more
sophisticated about the way they use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stamberg of the architecture firm Stamberg &AMP; Aferiat uses
tile to infuse Matisse-like colors into modernist architecture,
like his addition to a '60s ocean-front home designed by Charles
Gwathmey. The floors were originally tiled in earth tones; the firm
is replacing them with vivid new ceramic tiles to make the house
look less rustic.
</P>
<P>
   In an Upper East Side kitchen, the designers used one of the
industry's newest innovations, terrazzo tiles made with chips of
intensely colored glass in a polymer base, to an urbane effect.
Unlike classic terrazzo, made of stone chips set in cement, this
terrazzo comes in manageable 12- or 16-inch-square tiles _ and many
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing tile is similar to choosing fabric for upholstery: some
people prefer wool to cotton, and not everyone can afford silk.
Both ceramic and glass are hard, durable surfaces, impervious to
moisture. The choice, then, between glass and ceramic is either
esthetic or budgetary.
</P>
<P>
   Some basic tile talk: Ceramic tile has been fired in a kiln. The
more highly fired a tile, the stronger it is. Low-fired tiles are
appropriate for walls, but should not be used on floors. A handmade
tile is not as strong as an industrially made tile that's stamped
out with presses of enormous strength.
</P>
<P>
   Glass tile is a combination of sand with minerals added for
color. The tile is cooled very slowly by a process called
annealing, which makes the glass less brittle than, say, tumbler
glass. Glassmakers also add a very fine sand called silica to the
basic sand mixture, which gives the tile a higher impact
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Both glass and ceramic tiles are available with textured and
embossed surfaces and in dozens of colors. Tiny glass-mosaic tiles
now come on mesh sheets that are easy to install and have greater
flexibility to cover curved surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In a small room, glass reflects light and appears to give depth
of field to a wall. ``Glass tile twinkles, it's vibrant,'' said
Marcia Barkin, a designer who considers herself a modernist. She
has just designed a curved, 28-foot glass-mosaic wall in khaki
color for a client's living room. The floor is also tiled in the
same glass in black, pewter and copper.
</P>
<P>
   But ceramic tile has qualities that no glass tile can offer. The
architect Peter Marino is drawn to ceramic handmade American tiles
inspired by turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts designs. His
favorites are custom-made by ceramists in small workshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two tiles come out the same when they are handmade, and
today people like that craftsy quality,'' he said. He just used
American handmade tiles for a swimming pool he designed _ in
Athens, Greece.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Handmade ceramic tile is still a cottage industry here. The
number of artisans has grown; they are located mainly in
California, with hundreds more throughout the Midwest and the East,
near colleges that have large ceramics departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artisans are phenomenal,'' said Nancy Epstein, the owner
of Artistic Tile in New York, which is starting to export American
tiles to Europe. ``That's a switch,'' she said. ``Handmade ceramic
tiles are more expensive than machine-made tile, but you are buying
artwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from esthetic considerations, there is one major reason to
consider ceramic instead of glass tile: It's cheaper. There is a
wide choice of inexpensive ceramic tiles. But there is no cheap
glass. A press can turn out many more ceramic tiles in the same
time that a machine can cut a square foot of glass mosaic. In
addition, raw materials for glass must be pure for clarity and
color.
</P>
<P>
   Basic ceramic will cost $1 to $3 a square foot for solid-color
material; glass starts at $8 to $10 and more.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleone said that 95 percent of the glass tile used in the
United States is machine made and comes from Italy, and the best
Italian glass is made by two manufacturers _ Bisazza and Sicis.
Both companies offer dozens of colors, some with opalescent-look
finishes and others of gold and platinum. Sicis' glass is made with
enamel, which produces a color that is denser and less translucent
than the glass from Bisazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tile is a fashion item,'' Napoleone said, addressing the
trend. ``But that doesn't mean you can't do a nice bathroom that
will last forever on a limited budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paone, the president of Sicis North America, said that in
the last five years, his company's glass-mosaic sales have
increased 25 percent a year. Donato Glasser, a consultant to the
Italian Ceramic Tile Association in New York, said the ceramic-tile
market here has expanded 8 to 10 percent a year over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Marino's favorite tiles are not new; he is in love with
antique tiles and uses them to great decorative effect, sparingly,
as insets over stoves in kitchens or as fireplace surrounds.
Antique tiles are as one-of-a-kind as old china or silver; dealers
who specialize in antique tiles can be found at antique shows and
fairs. Pedro Leitao, who opened Solar Tiles in 1989, has been
collecting since childhood in his native Portugal. In 1947, his
father, an antiques dealer in Lisbon, started buying tiles for
their own 17th-century home. ``My father overbought,'' Leitao said,
``and a business was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his inventory is 18th- and 19th-century tile, 85 percent
from Portugal, the rest from Holland, China, Germany and Turkey. He
also produces a collection of custom-made, readily available
reproduction tiles. They cost $17 to $30 a tile, compared with
antique tiles that can cost hundreds and thousands for rare
specimens. Leitao will advise customers on the proper way to
install antique tiles so that they can be removed should a customer
move.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember to shop carefully. Many tile stores have similar
merchandise but at varying prices. And choose tiles you love. Art
is long and life is short.

 Judge gives school board credit, warns against accusations of
racism  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal judge Tuesday credited the Kansas
City, Mo., Board of Education for making a decision on
Superintendent Henry Williams _ but not before warning members to
stop making race an issue in district affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if the last superintendent was white, black,
yellow or any color, and I don't care if the next superintendent is
white, black, yellow or any color,'' U.S. District Judge Dean
Whipple said. ``It does nothing but throw gas on the fire when
heated debates take place for board members to defend their
position by calling their opponent a racist. You can't help the
school district by throwing that word out in heated debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple's comments came at the end of a hearing to review a
court-appointed committee's recommendations on ways to move the
district forward.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing comes less than a week after Williams' termination,
a move that caused sharp divisions on the board. At least one black
board member, Lee Barnes Jr., called white board members Connie
Clark and Lance Loewenstein racists after they initially voted to
fire Williams. The board ultimately agreed instead to buy out the
last 8 months of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Whipple ordered the school board to immediately
begin looking for a search firm to help identify a new
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered the board to complete a long-range plan by Dec.
31, scheduled a hearing next week to determine whether to allow
Phyllis Chase to continue as interim superintendent and held off on
a recommendation to force the resignation of about 20 top district
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Whipple was not in the closed meeting at which
Barnes made the comment about Clark and Loewenstein and had no idea
of the context. He said the board's private discussion should have
remained private.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to control ourselves in public,'' said Barnes, one
of three board members to attend Tuesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple also expressed his strong support for the work of the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee, the three-member panel of
educators that Whipple appointed in October 1997 to oversee
district operations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Whipple reinforced his desire that the committee be
intimately involved in district decision-making and that the
relationship not be adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I selected what I thought were three of the top experts I
could find,'' Whipple said. ``I think one of the problems we had
making any progress was Dr. Williams' refusal to work with the
DMC.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple ordered the school board to work with the DMC to
identify a search firm to help locate the next superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Delaney, an attorney for the district, said school board
members hoped to begin soliciting applicants about Jan. 1 and
complete contract negotiations by the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, lawyer for the plaintiff schoolchildren,
questioned whether any candidate could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's a superintendent out there who can run
this district in the atmosphere that exists,'' Benson said. ``I
think you could name the number of good superintendents in the
United States on the fingers of one hand, and none of them want to
come to Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, DMC chairman, agreed that Kansas City would be a
tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has to happen systemwide and communitywide to make this
an attractive position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than being just a good leader. It's getting the
community and the school board to focus on the importance of the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple, meanwhile, scheduled a hearing Oct. 29 to determine
whether Chase should be allowed to continue as interim
superintendent. The school board appointed Chase to the top spot
last week after agreeing to a severance package with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring committee had recommended that two persons,
including Chase, take over the district's leadership during the
search for a new superintendent and that neither person be allowed
to apply for the permanent post.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members say Chase should be allowed to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple noted that the school's board action in appointing only
Chase was in direct violation of an earlier court order that said
disputes between the DMC and the board should be resolved in a
court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios said the board's executive committee
planned to meet with the DMC before next week's hearing to resolve
as many issues as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The school board agreed at Tuesday's hearing with a DMC
recommendation to develop a long-range plan for dealing with
charter schools, decentralizing many administrative office
functions to individual schools and reducing the achievement gap
between black and white students.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the long-range plan should identify problems that
prevent the district from progressing and plans for addressing
those problems. The plan also should include a system that holds
every principal, teacher and student accountable by setting
benchmarks and then measuring for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple ordered the district to work with the DMC and complete
the long-range goals by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Benson argued that long-range goals had been in place since June
1996 for raising achievement, improving teacher training and
implementing a new curriculum, a new accountability plan and new
student assessments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have goals,'' Benson said. ``What we don't have is
visionary leadership to pull all this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple took no action on a DMC recommendation that the current
top-level administrators submit their resignations effective June
30 and reapply for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last week to Whipple, the DMC wrote: ``It cannot be
emphasized enough that any superintendent cannot be successful if
changes are not made in key personnel positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said such a measure would devastate employee morale and
impair the district's ability to move forward with planning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Raisher, an attorney for the teachers' union, agreed that
top administrators should not be left hanging until the summer. The
DMC should help identify those who need to be removed immediately
and then do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel putting all the administrators under a cloud...raises
a problem,'' Raisher said.

   If there is one institution that would seem to be threatened by
the information superhighway, it's the U.S. Postal Service. The

   The answer is that it won't compete directly, but it will keep
applying the same kind of computer power that underlies e-mail and
other electronic wizardry to the task of moving paper mail. The
fact is that new technology rarely destroys the old. It usually
melds with the old, allowing both to do what they do best.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, letter carriers delivered 630 million pieces of mail
a day. The post office now uses computerized sorting machines to
route most of the mail. Most bulk mail, like bills, is printed with
bar codes that are representations of ZIP codes and easy for
computers to understand. The machines direct the path of a letter
with house-level precision. Mail with bar codes goes directly to
machines that can read the codes. Mail without bar codes but with
printed addresses is handled by large mail-sorting machines with
built-in cameras for taking pictures of addresses. A computer
interprets the images, finds the best matching addresses and
directs a printer to mark bar codes on the envelopes to speed
further sorting.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the post office is concentrating on building even more
sophisticated computer systems, with advanced optical character
recognition (OCR) technology, that will read handwritten envelopes.
Bill Dowling, a vice president for engineering at the Postal
Service, said, ``Our online OCR machines handle 40,000 envelopes an
hour and 80 percent of machine-printed mail we read.''
</P>
<P>
   When letters without bar codes go into the first sorting
machine, the computers try to interpret the address in the fraction
of a second between when the letter passes by the camera and when
it passes by an ink-jet printer that sprays on bar codes in
fluorescent ink. Finding the answer in this short amount of time is
called online processing.
</P>
<P>
   The original computer machines doing this job relied upon VAX
minicomputers, which were manufactured by the old Digital Equipment
computer company that is now a division of Compaq. Today, each
machine is equipped with 11 additional 200-megahertz Pentium Pro
chips that analyze the address images together. These extra chips
run a stripped-down version of Linux that the Postal Service
customized for high-speed parallel processing of addresses.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 875 OCR machines distributed throughout the
country at different sorting centers. Many smaller branches and
local post offices have cheaper, faster sorting devices that can
read only bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer cannot recognize the address in the short amount
of time available to it _ perhaps because the address is
handwritten _ the letter and the digital image of the address are
put aside for off-line processing. First, a Silicon Graphics
computer tries to interpret the image with more sophisticated
algorithms (mathematical approaches) that take several seconds to
search for an answer. If these computers cannot read the address,
the image of the address is finally given to a human, who reads it
and types it into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Then the batch of envelopes with addresses that were hard to
read are processed again. This time, the correct bar code is
sprayed on each envelope so it can be sorted at local post offices.
</P>
<P>
   Both the printed-character and handwritten-character recognition
packages rely heavily on a large database containing every address
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an excellent digit recognizer so we can recognize the
ZIP code and correlate the city and state,'' said Ed Kupert, a
manager of image-handling technology for the Postal Service. ``Then
we can recognize the house number. From this, we can create a
lexicon of every street that has a house with that number in the
ZIP code, and the computer picks the best match.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupert said the current software recognized about 37 percent of
handwritten addresses. The Postal Service hopes to increase this
rate to 50 percent with a new software version that will be
installed in time to handle the Christmas rush, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is also following the lead of other delivery
companies and using technology to add new features to the seemingly
simple process of delivering a letter. One option would use special
bar codes to track the flow of individual envelopes in much the
same way that package delivery businesses like Federal Express and
United Parcel Service follow packages. Credit-card companies and
mortgage holders may want to be able to know if the payment check
is really in the mail _ and if so, when it got there, Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking individual envelopes moving through the system is
technically possible, and advertisers are interested in the
capability. Dowling said the Postal Service would be able to tell
direct-mail companies exactly when a piece of mail arrived,
allowing them to coordinate other marketing efforts, like follow-up
phone calls or television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling conceded that the Postal Service would face some stiff
competition from electronic bill-paying systems using the World
Wide Web. But he said the people who assume that Web-based systems
will win underestimate the value of printed material to the people
sending the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you open your utility bill,'' he said, ``you probably get
some warm and touchy statement about how good they did during the
last heat wave. The bill itself is an advertisement.''

PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA: A STAND-IN AND A SOLOIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Wolfgang Sawallisch, the music director of the
Philadelphia Orchestra, announced that he had to remain in Germany
recently because of the illness of his wife, finding a conductor to
cover the all-Brahms program the orchestra presented in
Philadelphia last week and at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night was
challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Not many conductors know the two works that constituted the
first half of the program. In addition, Maurizio Pollini, the
exacting and intellectually imposing Italian pianist who performed
the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1, had to be accommodated. And this
came in the thick of the fall season, when most conductors are busy
with concerts long booked.
</P>
<P>
   But the orchestra was able to hire Andreas Delfs, a 39-year-old
German conductor best known for his work as music director of the
Hannover State Opera and Orchestra and his new post with the
Milwaukee Symphony. Delfs was free because his wife is expecting a
baby and he was beginning a period of paternity leave. Such are the
often circuitous ways that classical musicians reach career
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to estimate the depth of Delfs' capacity from this
single save-the-day debut. He is a dynamic, technically gifted
conductor, and he clearly knew the Brahms choral works, because he
conducted them from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Brahms wrote a lot of music for amateur chorus, but ``Naenie,''
a setting of a Schiller poem about the ephemerality of beauty, and
``Schicksalslied,'' a Hoelderlin ode to immortality, are
contemplative, compositionally sophisticated works. Delfs, his
players, and the fine Philadelphia Singers Chorale gave beautiful,
luminous accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pollini's performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto abounded
with the musical insight and pianistic elegance that place him
among the most admired of today's senior pianists. This is a
rhapsodic, ruminative, youthful score, a work Brahms struggled
with. Textural and structural clarity are not its strong points.
</P>
<P>
   But the music has seldom sounded so lucid as it did in Pollini's
account, which revealed intertwining contrapuntal lines, startling
asymmetries of phrase structure, and complex chromatic harmony
where so many other performances are clouded over with thick
pianistic mists. And of course he had the requisite pianistic power
and stamina for the double octave outbursts and the thick, leaping
chords.
</P>
<P>
   Those who respond to his restrained approach find Pollini's
playing aristocratic. Those who don't find him cool, as I sometimes
do.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while he let go with what seemed, for him, real
abandon, as in the finale of the first movement, which he played
with demonic fervor, and the climax of the Adagio movement, in
which he could be heard singing along with the surging melody. I
wish he would let this side of himself out more often.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a distinguished performance, and the audience
responded rapturously.
</P>
<P>
   Delfs did his best to keep Brahms' thickly scored orchestra part
from swamping the soloist, but sometimes it did anyway. Yet, given
the constraints of the occasion, Delfs did solid work.
</P>

 Employment outlook better than layoff figures suggest, analysts
say  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ A new wave of layoffs is lapping at the American
work force. Among sizable downsizing announcements so far this
month:
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. will trim 4,300 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Co. will let 3,100 workers go.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Oil Co. will cut 20 percent of its exploration and
production staff.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. will ax 14,000 defense sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts are seeping even into Kansas City's bedrock-strong economy.
Among them: Western Auto Supply Co., Dickinson Theatres, the J.C.
Nichols Co., Sun Publications, Hallmark Cards Inc. All are taking
payroll nips here, cost tucks there in efforts to operate more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it looks as if American business has begun
fighting an economic undertow that formed on foreign shores and
this summer rippled through American financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But most authorities say don't fly the red storm-warning flags
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The employment outlook is mostly optimistic, according to a
study made public today by the American Management Association. The
report says U.S. firms are scaling back their hiring plans somewhat
but still are expecting overall job growth through June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses, disappointed with lower quarterly earnings and
slower growth projections, are cutting staff, speeding retirements
and encouraging other forms of staff attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate mergers also promise to add to the layoff numbers,
employment experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put Bank of America and NationsBank together and not
have duplication of resources,'' said Michael D. Gunter, a
Winston-Salem, N.C., lawyer whose firm specializes in employment
issues related to downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   But this new job-cut ripple, at least at its outset, is sending
different signals from the downsizing tsunami that hit in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies learned that earlier staff slashings weren't the
cure-all for financial ills. They still needed people, though
perhaps in different positions from the ones cut, to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   Among all companies reporting job cuts to the American
Management Association, there was nearly a one-for-one exchange of
job cuts and job creations in the 12 months that ended in June
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Also, overall U.S. employment growth continues. Most layoff
victims are finding re-employment quickly. Thus, if it's possible
to speak of job loss in kinder, gentler terms, the layoffs of 1998
_ so far _ may qualify.  &LR; brk:Net growth  &LR; tx:According to the
American Management Association staffing report released today, net
job growth should continue through June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slightly fewer companies planned new hiring, and slightly more
projected new job cuts, but the real change is in the average
projected net work force growth, down to \P4.6 percent from \P6.9
percent a year ago,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's projected net work-force increase of 6.9 percent
was exceeded. Surveyed companies actually reported a 7.7 percent
net work-force growth for the 12 months ending in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The association surveyed 1,231 member organizations this summer.
About 44 percent of the respondents said they planned to add jobs
in the 12-month period beginning in June 1998. Only about 17
percent said they planned job cuts in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that, based on previous survey results, those
percentages would change as the year goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The share that actually cuts jobs is often double the share
(that has) cuts planned at the outset of the period, while the
share that creates new jobs is more than 50 percent higher than
planned,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate hiring managers expressed some caution about the
future job environment because of the ongoing ``correction'' in the
U.S. stock market; political uncertainties in Washington; and
economic turmoil in Southeast Asia, Japan, Russia and Latin
America.  &LR; brk:Gentler downsizing  &LR; tx:When Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said last month that ``it is just not credible that
the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity'' among strained world
economies, American industry listened _ but didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment this year hit a 28-year low. Economic expansion has
been undergoing one of its longest sustained runs in history.
Generally, both private and public balance sheets are solvent. And
consumers continue to spend their earnings, which have stayed ahead
of the nearly invisible inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent stock market gyrations, sick foreign markets and
U.S. business realignments _ especially mergers _ are causing many
industries to project lower short-term profits. When that happens,
layoffs often follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merger-related layoffs, in particular, are going to happen
because of cost-cutting reasons,'' said Gerald L. Miller, professor
of economics at Rockhurst College. ``And desperation layoffs are
going to happen when some execs search for quarterly profit
increases and preservation of their bonuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Miller said, ``As our economic expansion continues,
companies are going to be less and less capable of keeping up with
the double-digit growth rates they set at the beginning of the
expansion. There will be shakeouts _ especially in the auto,
aerospace, and oil and gas industries. And there will be mergers
across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of downsizing, while painful to the workers let go,
may be occurring under a more humane umbrella, observed Gunter, the
North Carolina lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gunter said there was an evolution of thinking among many
employers. Five or 10 years ago, downsizing companies often asked
their corporate attorneys, ``What's the minimum we can do?'' when
letting staff go, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I see a little more of the employers' thinking as
`Let's do what we can that's fair and hopefully leave these folks
with a good taste in their mouths,' '' Gunter said.
</P>
<P>
   This gentler downsizing has at least three characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   More generous severance pay for rank-and-file workers. Severance
typically amounts to one month's pay for each year of service, up
to a maximum of 24 months, Gunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies seem to be paying the agreed-upon severance even
if the laid-off worker gets a new job within the severance-pay
period, he added.
</P>
<P>
   An extended period of health insurance coverage beyond the
severance date.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, companies are continuing to fund their employer
contribution for about six months, he said. More rarely, employers
will pick up the costs of their former employees' COBRA premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Access to outplacement services.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-file workers are getting employer-financed help in
finding new jobs through the resources offered by outplacement
firms, a perquisite previously limited to executives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing authorities say payroll size always will be scrutinized
when profit pictures change. Thus, even if the domestic economy
avoids recession, no one expects a layoff-free climate.
</P>
<P>
   Given current economic signals, the consensus calls for net job
growth. That means a layoff slip is not a ticket to long-term
unemployment, though some job retraining may be required to fit
current hiring needs.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the downsizing wave is swimmable.

 Missouri Supreme Court overturns man's conviction for child sex
abuse  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
it was unconstitutional for prosecutors to tell juries in child
sexual-assault cases about other abuse allegations and convictions
against defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in a Jackson County case could result in the
overturning of convictions of dozens of people, prosecutors and
defense attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court overturned the 1997 conviction of Robert L.
Burns, 21. Burns was sentenced to 15 years in prison for sodomy
involving a 7-year-old boy behind a Kansas City church in 1995.
Prosecutors called on witnesses in an alleged assault of another
boy to bolster their case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Claire McCaskill said Tuesday that Burns would be
retried as quickly as possible. McCaskill said she would seek high
bonds to keep Burns, as well as others to be retried because of the
ruling, behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that Jackson County would have to retry about a
half-dozen or more cases. A spokesman for state Attorney General
Jay Nixon said that his office did not know how many cases would
have to be retried.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors statewide have used the law since it was enacted in
1995, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to introduce all the evidence you legally can,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Fry, assistant county prosecutor and chief trial
assistant, said Burns would not face an easy retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a free man,'' Fry said. ``He's just back for another
dose of due process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Denzel, the Columbia assistant public defender who
represented Burns, praised the court's ruling and predicted:
``There will be a lot of ripples.'' Public defenders are
re-examining cases and will make use of the new ruling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri has historically recognized the right to be tried
only for the crime charged,'' he said. ``It's too easy to think if
they (defendants) did it before, they did it this time.''
</P>
<P>
   A round of sex-crime retrials or releases followed a similar
ruling in 1993, when the state Supreme Court severely limited the
use of prior crimes as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly responded by passing the 1995 law allowing
such ``propensity'' evidence. High courts in some other states had
found such laws constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday stood by its 1993 ruling
that such evidence of prior sexual misconduct was allowed only if
crimes were so bizarre, unique and distinctive as to create ``a
signature'' for a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson County also had to retry or take pleas on about
a half-dozen cases after the 1993 ruling, McCaskill said that ``by
and large, we were able to get about the same results.''

 Social Security is just part of scam  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ The money Uncle Sam ``borrows'' from Social Security
is merely the most visible example of how the looting of federal
trust funds perverts the fiscal process.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have begun to understand Social Security's
accounting subterfuge. Its trust fund comprises nothing more than
nonmarketable Treasury securities. The fund is credited with these
IOUs as excess Social Security tax revenues are spent. What most
Americans don't understand, however, is how the Social Security
ripoff is only part of a much larger scam.
</P>
<P>
   There are various ways to put this misrepresentation into
perspective. One way is to compare the $70 billion budget surplus
being claimed for fiscal 1998 to the simultaneous $112 billion
increase in the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling view of this curious phenomenon is offered by a
recent Congressional Budget Office analysis. It shows that of the
current $1.75 trillion in national debt held by government
accounts, only $736 billion is debt owed to the Social Security
trust fund. The remaining 60 percent or so is owed to accounts
other than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   A third way of looking at this bogus system is to focus on the
handling of a trust fund unknown to most Americans. This
perspective is important because it speaks to the claim of the
system's defenders. Their defense holds that even if Social
Security's IOUs are only government promises to pay, it's
unthinkable Washington wouldn't honor those promises.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Tuesday's Investor's Business Daily about the
unemployment insurance trust fund may cause these defenders to
think again. It reveals as well as anecdotal evidence can the
extent of Washington's fiscal chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   Employers pay a tax rate of 0.8 percent on the first $7,000 of
each employee's wages to fund state employment assistance programs
that are closely supervised by the federal government. The tax,
which will raise $6 billion this year, is kept at its current level
even though the program's trust fund has swelled to $23 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund continues to grow, the story relates, because
Washington sends less than 60 percent of the collected tax receipts
back to the states to help the jobless.
</P>
<P>
   The revenue from this dedicated tax is like all other such
programs _ including Social Security, highway construction, air
transportation and the like. The money not spent on its intended
purpose goes to pay for unrelated budget items. The trust fund gets
a Treasury IOU, which has no economic value except as a claim
against government.
</P>
<P>
   Why have all these other trust funds beyond Social Security's
grown to $1 trillion plus worth of IOUs? Washington used the
surplus revenue as a cash cow _ earlier to make deficits seem
smaller, now to create the illusion of surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has two honest choices here. It can reduce the burden
of the dedicated tax, or it can spend all revenues as intended. It
does neither. It applies some revenue toward its dedicated purpose
and confiscates the rest. It then uses an accounting pretense to
create the impression that the money was only borrowed from its
intended beneficiaries rather than misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
   The way trust funds have been handled is convincing proof that
Washington can't be trusted to do the right thing. Thus, who's to
say political leaders won't shortchange Social Security when the
promises made in behalf of its trust fund must be kept?

SPENDING BILL WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO HIRE MORE FOREIGN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labor-hungry technology companies will be able to
hire more skilled foreign workers under a provision lumped into the
mammoth spending bill that cleared Congress Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and computer companies in California's Silicon Valley
have lobbied for the measure, which would double the number of
employment visas for foreign computer programmers and others with
high-tech skills.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say there is a scarcity of skilled Americans, but
organized labor says the provision is a sellout of American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, spearheaded by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
would increase the number of so-called H1-B work visas from 65,000
to 115,000 in 1999 and 2000, and 107,500 a year later. President
Clinton supports the change.
</P>
<P>
   The visas have been used in recent years to recruit computer
programmers, many of them from India, Taiwan and Europe. Holders of
H1-B visas are allowed to remain in the United States for up to six
years, but many settle here permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, which
represents 218,000 engineers and computer scientists, said the
measure didn't include enough protections for Americans who may be
displaced by an influx of skilled foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy grows at a substantial rate, there may not be a
detrimental effect,'' said Vin O'Neill, a policy analyst at the
institute. ``But if it turns down, we are concerned _ especially
about older workers over age 45.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said he wasn't surprised that the measure cleared
Congress because ``it was clear that the (Clinton) administration,
the Republican congressional leadership, and the high-tech industry
wanted it pretty badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Golodner, president of the Department for Professional
Employees of the AFL-CIO, which represents 4 million union members,
said the legislation would hurt college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will retard the increases in their salaries and benefits,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was lumped into the legislation that included $520
billion to round out the government's $1.7 trillion federal budget.
The spending package was approved by the House Tuesday and the
Senate Wednesday and is expected to be signed into law by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the labor provision would
``allow dynamic American companies and research labs to hire more
skilled foreign professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was confident the measure included adequate
safeguards ``to protect American workers and provide substantial
funding to educate and train Americans to fill the lucrative
high-tech jobs that are available across our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure appeared in jeopardy earlier this month when Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, threatened to block it, questioning the claims
of a worker shortage. But the measure sailed through Wednesday,
attached to the spending bill that many members of Congress were
anxious to dispense with so they could return home to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he would challenge the need for importing foreign
high-tech workers when Congress reconvenes next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, if 15 percent or more of a company's
employees hold H1-B visas, the company must attest that the workers
have not replaced qualified Americans.
</P>
<P>
   However, companies hiring H1-B workers with at least a master's
degree or at salaries of $60,000 or more would be exempt from
having to provide the information. Small businesses and start-up
companies also would get exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also requests that the Labor Department look
into any reported abuses of the program, and places a $500 filing
fee on visa applications and renewals, which would raise more than
$75 million for scholarship and training programs for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, pushed for a similar
bill that originally would have provided broader safeguards for
American workers.

IN CALIFORNIA, BOXER RUNS FROM COMPARISONS TO FEINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Within weeks of her inauguration as a U.S.
senator, Democrat Barbara Boxer showed just how different she can
sometimes be from her colleague, Dianne Feinstein, despite pundits
lumping them together during the ``Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, the six women who had just been elected to the
Senate were asked whether Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who had been
accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women, should
resign. While five of the six, including Feinstein, urged caution,
one senator was not ready for deep introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he ought to resign,'' Boxer said that Jan. 18, while
the Packwood investigation was still going on. ``What is to come
will be very painful and it would be best for him, the women and
the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein bristle when they are compared.
</P>
<P>
   But they share many bonds, like being elected at the same time
(Feinstein in a special election), becoming the first two women to
represent the same state in the Senate, and they are both champions
of women's issues and Democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   While their voting records on many key issues are remarkably
similar, they differ most in personal style.
</P>
<P>
   It's that ephemeral issue of style, some analysts say, that may
account for why Feinstein is viewed in polls as the most popular
politician in California and Boxer is struggling in her re-election
fight against Republican state Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   A recent San Francisco Examiner poll showed for the first time
during the 1998 campaign that more voters viewed Boxer negatively
than positively _ usually a serious danger sign for an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Fong taking a slight lead in the race. But
Boxer's numbers have always been low, she acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people I know who are Democrats basically dislike (Boxer)
intensely as an individual,'' said Laura Stoker, a political
scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``Certain
people engender very strong reactions. Bill Clinton is one, Barbara
Boxer is another. It's based on personality and impressions they
present to others.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to recent major votes, Feinstein and Boxer rarely
disagree. Of the 12 key votes in the 104th Congress (1994-'96)
tracked by the Almanac of American Politics, the senators differed
on only one: Boxer voted against allowing Congress and the states
to ban desecration of the American flag while Feinstein voted for
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein agreed on increasing the minimum wage,
prohibiting job discrimination against gays, keeping late-term
abortions legal, protecting the endangered-species list, and
extending funding for troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, dozens of votes over the past six years in
which Boxer and Feinstein were on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, for example, voted against rewarding states with money
for reducing their out-of-wedlock birth rates without increasing
their abortion rates. Feinstein voted for the measure. Boxer voted
against increasing the number of generals in the Marine Corps;
Feinstein voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be little-noticed measures like these that account for
the view that Feinstein is more moderate than Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative public interest groups that rate lawmakers
consistently give Boxer their lowest marks, while granting
Feinstein some slack.
</P>
<P>
   These differences do not surprise the Boxer campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an expectation by some people that because
they are both women elected in the same year and they made history,
that they should abandon their views on the issues,'' said Boxer
campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski. ``I don't think they would be
doing their jobs as senators if they didn't look at each issue
seriously.''

</P>
<P>
   Perceived as a hard-core liberal, Boxer defeated conservative
Republican Bruce Herschensohn in 1992, the same year President
Clinton was swept into office. In her six years in the Senate,
analysts say, Boxer somehow hasn't been able to acquire the same
senatorial stature that Feinstein has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican political consultant in Los
Angeles, said Boxer appears to be a diligent senator but comes
``across as more of a rabble-rouser than a thoughtful senator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me she's a real hard worker, that she works on
California problems,'' Hoffenblum said. ``But when she comes before
the cameras, she's got a petition in her hand and she's seen as
showboating. That's hurt her badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Behr, a Boxer campaign adviser, said comparing Boxer's poll
numbers in the middle of the campaign to Feinstein's ratings is not
meaningful. Feinstein is not campaigning, Behr noted, and naturally
is viewed more positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you attach the word `candidate' to somebody, they
are seen in a different light,'' Behr said. He noted that when
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth considered running for
U.S. Senate in 1992, his ratings dropped precipitously even though
he had done nothing but file candidacy papers.
</P>
<P>
   And Behr said there is as much of a style difference between
Boxer and Feinstein as ``there is between any two people. I think
there are some people who love her style and some people who
don't,'' he said of Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Feinstein has endorsed Boxer, and the two have
appeared a few times together on the campaign trail, mainly at
fund-raisers. They held a rally recently where Feinstein praised
Boxer for having ``backbone, courage and ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Feinstein told a news conference that she and Boxer
were ``a good team for California.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she ended, Feinstein directly addressed the issue of
comparisons, saying nobody talks about the differences between
Massachusetts Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, both
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we're different,'' Feinstein said. ``Just as two men
doing the same job would be different, two women doing the same job
would be different. You come from different perspectives. I was a
mayor, Barbara was a member of Congress. It is different in that
regard. That doesn't mean we can't be fast friends. That doesn't
mean we can't work together.''

WASHINGTON STATE MOVES TOWARD ONLY REFERENDUM THIS YEAR ON
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a closely watched replay of pitched battles in
California and Houston over government preferences for women and
minorities, Washington state is moving toward the nation's only
referendum this year on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   A measure on the Nov. 3 ballot, known as Initiative 200, would
bar the state and local governments from granting ``preferential
treatment'' to women or minorities in hiring, education or awarding
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in California, the nation's most populous state, approved
a similar proposal two years ago. But Houston voters last fall
defeated an attempt to dismantle the municipal affirmative action
program, although a state judge has ordered a second election.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, opponents of affirmative action are looking to the
outcome in Washington state to determine how _ or perhaps even
whether _ to take their campaign to other states and localities.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the preferences hope a campaign pitched strongly at
women will help defeat the measure here and provide a guide if
other electoral fights on the emotionally charged issue are in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
   Women are the critical element in Washington because the state
is 86 percent white. Preferential treatment for blacks and
Hispanics, so at play in the California and Houston campaigns, is a
subsidiary point in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pull back the curtain and expose the Trojan horse.
Women and their families are targeted by this,'' said Sue Tupper, a
Democratic political consultant advising the Stop!200 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action backers contend the measure represents an
assault on equal rights for women, and have aimed at the
pocketbooks as well as the hearts and minds of female voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will roll back the progress women have made in getting
equal pay for equal work,'' Democratic Gov. Gary Locke contended in
Stop!200's first TV commercial opposing the initiative. Another ad,
citing the League of Women Voters' opposition to the measure, says:
``200 will cut the training women need to get family-wage jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of affirmative action dispute the contention that the
measure harbors any adverse economic prospects for women.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, the Sacramento businessman who sponsored the
California initiative and bankrolled the Washington measure, said
the same ``scare tactics'' were used in his state and raised in
legal challenges, which finally failed at the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea that (the initiative) sets women back to the era
when they were kept barefoot and pregnant is just absolute
nonsense,'' said Connerly as he left Sacramento for several days of
campaigning in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Given the small numbers of minority voters in Washington, the
opponents' focus on women in the final weeks before the election is
not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning we knew they would have to appeal to a
significant portion of the population and so would be aiming at
women,'' said Brett Bader, a Republican political consultant
working with the initiative's advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly told the Seattle Times: ``In order to win, they have to
scare the crap out of white women.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argue the initiative ``means that affirmative action
could reach out with opportunity but not keep out with quotas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing us together,'' concludes one television ad touting
Initiative 200.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot question asks: ``Shall government be prohibited from
discriminating or granting preferential treatment based on race,
sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in public employment,
education and contracting?''
</P>
<P>
   Locke, in his television ad, conceded that the measure ``is
written to sound good,'' but he added, ``It's full of hidden
consequences.'' Opponents contend it would gut a dozen or more
affirmative action programs. The measure would also, he warned, set
off a round of ``expensive lawsuits that waste our tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent interview Locke said the initiative looks to a
world that does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we were in a period where affirmative action was no
longer needed, but we're not there,'' said Locke, a
Chinese-American who said he was helped into Yale Law School by
programs seeking public school graduates and applicants from
outside the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action supporters have their work cut out for them.
A statewide poll taken two weeks ago for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer and KOMO-TV showed likely voters favored the
initiative 55 percent to 35 percent. But when the same respondents
were told the measure would virtually wipe out affirmative action
programs, the margin of approval dropped to 46 percent to 40
percent, giving opponents hope that their ads are properly focused
and may yet help defeat the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the initiative are far better financed. The most
recent reports showed the campaign in favor of the initiative had
raised almost $240,000 and had about $136,000 on hand. The No!200
campaign had raised almost $1 million and had almost $350,000 for
the final pre-election push.
</P>
<P>
   Bader conceded the ads aimed at women will ``have an effect,''
but Connerly said: ``I just believe we have enough steam in the
engine to counter it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Washington comes after California voters in 1996
adopted Proposition 209, which outlawed racial, gender and ethnic
preferences in state affairs, including college admissions. The
measure was sponsored by Connerly, a University of California
regent who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Houston voters defeated a measure aimed at
dismantling the affirmative action program that set goals for the
percentages of construction, purchasing and personal service
contracts with the city that should be taken by woman and
minorities. A state court judge in June, however, threw out the
result, ruling that the ballot language adopted by City Council did
not reflect the intent of the proposal's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   As originally submitted by a group led by Houston investment
adviser Edward Blum, the proposal said the city ``shall not
discriminate'' in hiring or contracting on the basis of race,
gender or minority status. Under pressure from Mayor Bob Lanier, a
proponent of affirmative action, Council rewrote the ballot
language to say the city shall ``end the use of affirmative
action'' for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A new election in Houston is not expected until a potentially
lengthy appeals process is completed. In a related case, which
could make a new Houston election moot, a federal judge is
considering a separate constitutional challenge to the city's
affirmative action program. A federal judge has already struck down
a similar program of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, a decision
that is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is unquestionably moving in this direction,'' said
John Carlson, chairman of the Washington State Civil Rights
Initiative. ``It doesn't matter if there's a bump in the road or an
adverse court decision here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Connerly had said earlier in the campaign that a defeat
in Washington state might stunt his effort nationally, he said
Tuesday that ``win or lose'' in Washington state, ``obviously the
movement continues for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said the next initiative effort might be in Nebraska or
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly _ and his checkbook _ were called in when the signature
drive to get the measure on the ballot was sagging. Connerly's
American Civil Rights Institute put up more than half of the almost
$400,000 spent on gathering the required petitions. Connerly's
group is also paying for a separate television and radio ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative opponents have called Connerly and his proposal
``carpetbaggers'' from California, but Connerly replied: ``The day
they keep Al Gore, Jesse Jackson and the NAACP out of here is the
day that I, too, will say that I, as a federal taxpayer, have no
right to be here.'' Vice President Gore was featured speaker at a
No!200 fund-raising event earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Locke called on _ ``strong armed,'' said proponent
Bader _ Washington state businesses to oppose the initiative, and
several major firms have.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the state's largest private employer, donated $50,000
and Microsoft and Costco each gave $25,000. Starbucks chief
executive and his wife gave $10,000. Corporate contributions are
permitted in initiative campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the dam had broken,'' Carlson said, but after about
a quarter of the state's major corporations lined up against the
initiative, the endorsements ``just stopped cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Most major banks and the state's leading retailer, Nordstrom's
department store, have stayed on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents have impugned Boeing's motives, suggesting the
aerospace giant is attempting to buy goodwill as it faces several
employment discrimination lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives have expressed concern about being seen to
oppose affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to take the grief that disclosure would
bring,'' Bader said. Opponents of the initiative wrote major donors
backing the measure to say: ``We intend to publicize, in various
ways, the support or the opposition of businesses on this vitally
import issue confronting our community.'' &QL;

PRINCIPAL SEES RED, BANS THE COLOR AT SCHOOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Fearful that a gang called the Bloods would
terrorize the town and her students, too, the principal of Round
Rock High School decided one day to ban the color red.
</P>
<P>
   Red was the gang's color, said Sherry Blackett, the new
principal of the town's largest high school. Red was the color of
violence. Red was a color she connected with the town's first
drive-by shooting late last month, the vandalism of a school art
project one week later and frequent fights among students. Red
could endanger your life, just by wearing it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to create an environment that will not allow gangs
to flourish, so I banned the color red,'' she said. The principal,
who spent most of her career in Corpus Christi, Texas, added that
she knew of kids killed for wearing gang colors.
</P>
<P>
   So for three weeks this month, students who showed up in scarlet
were asked to change clothes or were sent to in-school suspension.
Some shrugged. Others rolled their eyes. One girl, whose wardrobe
was dominated by red, cried. A group of vocal parents grew irate.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blackett is reversing the ban and asking all of her students
to wear red on Friday as a kick-off to the national ``Red Ribbon
Week.'' Students will cut red ribbons in memory of lives lost to
drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be bringing the red back. I feel like the
lesson has been learned and the point made,'' Blackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal insists that the point is school safety, an issue
that strikes a receptive chord with parents concerned about school
shootings around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Blackett's ban has raised anew questions about gangs, the
right to self expression and whether dress codes or even uniforms
have any affect on conduct. And several Round Rock students
question whether banning red makes common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like red. Red's a good color,'' said Andrea Miller, a
sophomore. ``For somebody like me to have a color banned from my
wardrobe is really kind of silly. It's really kind of pointless.''
</P>
<P>
   Student Brandon Bennight said he doesn't care about the ban, but
``I think it's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, James Payton, said if it makes the principal
feel better or makes the school safer, he's all for it. He added,
however, ``Red is not one of my colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin Henry, donning a bright red Mickey Mouse sweatshirt two
days before the ban's formal lifting, said she didn't understand
why Blackett banned red for the Bloods but not blue for the rival
Crips or yellow for a third gang called the Latin Kings. Indeed,
local police have identified at least six colors associated with
gangs, including the color maroon, which is one of the school
colors of Round Rock High.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down to wearing khaki and white, they're going to
find some other way to identify themselves,'' said Deirdre Feehan
at the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which plans to send
the principal a letter outlining their concerns. ``We are
questioning whether this policy falls within the bounds of
constitutionality under freedom of expression, free speech and
freedom of association.''
</P>
<P>
   Round Rock police Officer Rod Hampton, who is assigned to the
school, said the town's gangs are so new that their colors and
symbols are not firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the reds, you've got the blues, you've got the
greens, you've got the maroons. You can go down the rainbow,''
Hampton said. ``They just go to another color.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said the vandalism at the school, the defacing of
artwork, did not appear gang-related, in spite of the fact that it
was carried out with red spray paint.
</P>
<P>
   To a mural of Darth Vader of Star Wars fame, for example,
vandals added a red smiley face over his mask. Two figures included
in the mural had what appear to be red bullet wounds as did a
separate mural of Superman. A painting of a car had the letters MHS
imposed over it, with the S in the form of a dollar sign. One
parent said she thinks the letters stand for a rival high school in
the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this is not a case of gang graffiti,'' said Sgt.
Jack Abbott, gang specialist for the Round Rock police force. ``It
was more just an attack on the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said the drive-by shooting occurred in the wee hours of a
Sunday morning in late September and did not take place near the
school. Of the five suspects arrested, two different gangs were
represented in the car, he said. Members of one of the gangs wear
red, he said, and one of the two young women wounded in the attack
was a student at the high school. Neither of the women was wearing
red, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't the purpose of the shooting, because of the color
red,'' he said. ``As far as a connection between the drive-by and
the criminal mischief at the high school, I haven't found that.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said Blackett didn't consult with police before
connecting either incident to a gang that wears red or connecting
the separate crimes to each other, a point that annoys Debbie
Weaver, a parent whose son was sent home from school for wearing
red in protest of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he ought to be able to wear whatever color he wants
and I agree,'' she said. ``You shouldn't punish the kids for
something that may or may not happen, and banning a color is silly.
Are we advertising gang colors by flying our flags outside the
school?''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents are troubled as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Ross said she was upset that her son, who is black, was
asked to remove his red shirt earlier in the year before the ban
went into effect. What bothers her most, she said, is it appeared
to be a selective color ban aimed at minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some other way to deal with this because I
can't personally sacrifice the self-esteem of my children,'' said
Ross who has been assigned to a task force to recommend dress code
policies. ``You're taking the shirt off his back and that destroys
all I've worked for.'' &QL;

 By SERGIO R. BUSTOS, with BARBARA BELEJACK in Mexico City, LAURA
COVILL in Frankfurt and JIM RUSSO in Madrid 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The scene in Mexico City was a familiar one. A banquet room full
of businessmen wanting to hear about investment opportunities in
Mexico. On hand were plenty of Mexican government officials touting
the benefits of the country. But the businessmen mingling with the
Mexicans earlier this year weren't from the United States. They
were Europeans, mostly British, thirsty for information about the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other business
opportunities in Mexico.
 &HT;    As the global economy expands, European companies and investors
are flocking to the region to make up for lost ground and tap what
has become one of the world's most attractive emerging markets.
 &HT;    ``The importance of Mexico wasn't always evident in Europe,''
says Jacques Lecompte, currently the head of the EU delegation in
Mexico. ``NAFTA brought a new conception of Mexico.''
 &HT;    With its long-standing ties, its proximity and its historical
relationship _ both good and bad _ the United States has long
dominated much of the rest of the world in terms of trade with
Latin America and the Caribbean. Within the last few years, the
domination has increased, mainly because of NAFTA.
 &HT;    However, with the improved European economies, many companies
there are increasingly looking to Latin America for new business.
 &HT;    Trade among the eight largest Latin American economies and their
five top European partners reached a total of US$61.3 billion last
year, an increase of 10.2 percent over 1996, according to IMF data
compiled by Latin Trade.
 &HT;    Germany remains the undisputed top trading partner, followed by
Italy, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, in that order. (see
chart).
 &HT;    Brazil. In terms of Latin American partners, Brazil tops the
list, followed by Mexico and Argentina. But while Argentina saw
modest growth in trade with Europe and Brazil a respectable 10.8
percent increase, it was Mexico that saw the strongest growth last
year _ a whopping 24.2 percent, largely spurred by strong trade
growth with Italy and the UK.
 &HT;    Still, European companies remain a far cry from their U.S.
counterparts as far as foreign direct investment is concerned,
according to a recent report by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). It found
the United States well ahead of the European Union as the biggest
source of foreign direct investment. It also found that Spain,
Germany and the United Kingdom were among the leading countries
with investment interest in the region.
 &HT;    ECLAC's Michael Mortimore, who authored the report, says most
European investment is destined for the Southern Cone because of
Mercosur. But, he says, European companies have yet to develop a
true investment strategy in Latin America.
 &HT;    ``I don't find much to call a European strategy,'' says
Mortimore, who says each European country seems to have a different
plan. Spanish firms appear bent on concentrating on electricity,
banks, telecommunications and airlines, while German firms seem
focused on automotive and chemicals. The British firms, he says,
seem particularly keen on targeting oil, banks, telecommunications
and gas distribution.
 &HT;    The strategy of the Spanish firms seems to be related to their
inability to compete within Europe on the one hand and the cultural
affinity with Latin America and the Caribbean on the other, he
says. Germany's interest seems to be based on firms with a
long-standing presence in the region _ Volkswagen, Bayer, BASF and
Hoescht. The British expansion is closely related to sales of
assets and new concession for natural resources.
 &HT;    Mexico. The European Union is Mexico's second most important
trading partner and is the second largest source of foreign direct
investment. But it's far behind that of the United States. Last
year, trade between Mexico and the European Union was $12 billion
compared with $176 billion between Mexico and the United States. On
the other hand, Mexican exports to Europe are showing signs of
growth. Last year, Mexican exports exceeded $43 billion, up 14
percent from 1996.
 &HT;    Britain's ambassador to Mexico, Adrian Beamish, blames NAFTA. He
says the European share of the Mexican market ``has plummeted since
NAFTA became effective.'' Indeed, the share has been cut roughly in
half from what it was in 1990.
 &HT;    Yet, despite such figures, Mexican trade and commerce officials,
including Undersecretary of Commerce Jaime Zabludovsky, continue to
pitch Mexico as the bridge between North and South America, and
between East and West. Mexico, says Zabludovsky, is intent on
diversifying its markets, especially since trade figures show 80
percent of all Mexican goods and services are traded with the
United States.
 &HT;    One step toward diversification was taken this year when the
European Union and Mexico embarked on negotiating a trade
agreement. Mexico sees talks with the EU as a way to lessen its
dependence on the United States as a trade partner. But any sort of
agreement may be a long way off because several EU members,
including France, would rather see the EU develop trade ties
through the World Trade Organization and not through individual
countries. France also balked at a similar agreement with Mercosur.
 &HT;    In the meantime, European countries with existing ties to Latin
America are expanding and new European companies are trying to
figure out where best to invest. Mexico, thanks to NAFTA, is a
favorite country for investment for Europeans who see it as a
convenient gateway to the lucrative U.S. market. They also are well
aware of the benefits of Mexico in terms of its natural resources
and its infrastructure needs.
 &HT;    For example, the Mexico subsidiary of France's Suez Lyonnaise
des Eaux currently operates water service contracts for about
one-quarter of Mexico City's residents. The parent company also has
business interests in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. British Oxygen
Co. (BOC) plans a $1 billion investment in Mexico's state oil
company Pemex, the largest British investment in Mexico.
 &HT;    Along with its Mexican-U.S. partner ICA Fluor Daniel, BOC plans
to construct the world's largest nitrogen complex to inject
nitrogen into the wells at the Cantarell crude oil field off the
coast of Campeche.
 &HT;    Among those most keen to enter Mexico is British Airports Group,
created by Britain's Ministry of Commerce to pursue opportunities
overseas. England was the first country to privatize all its
airports. During the Mexico City meeting, sponsored by London-based
Canning House, an organization that promotes ties between the
United Kingdom and Latin America, BAG officials spent time talking
up the company's track record and the potential commercialization
and tourism boom that airport privatization might bring to Mexico.
 &HT;    Few European companies are as deeply entrenched in Latin America
as Germany's automaker Volkswagen. The company, which will
manufacture more than 125,000 Beetles in its Puebla, Mexico
factory, is among the region's top European investors in Latin
America. Much of the production of cars in Mexico will be exported
to the United States. Volkswagen ranked first among the top 20
foreign enterprises in Latin America, according to an ECLAC report.
Eight other European countries made the list, including Italy's
carmaker Fiat, U.K./Holland-based oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell,
France's retail chain Carrefour and Switzerland's food processor
Nestle.
 &HT;    Long-term. Shell is a prime example of the kind of European
company that has had longstanding ties to the region. It first sank
money into the region during the early part of the century and
company officials remain as bullish about Latin America's long-term
prospects as they did at that time.
 &HT;    ``The Shell Group has ambitious growth aspirations for the
region,'' says Phil Watts, who is in charge of the company's
operations in Latin America. ``Latin America offers us the ability
to use a well-established presence to develop businesses in rapidly
growing and deregulating markets.''
 &HT;    The company has $5 billion worth of investments in oil and gas
exploration, production, distribution, marketing, oil refining,
petrochemicals, liquefied natural gas, coal and forestry in Latin
America. Most of its investment is tied up in oil refining,
distribution and marketing.
 &HT;    Despite Shell's huge investment, the region accounts for less
than 10 percent of all company revenues. Watts is not discouraged.
``As the region matures _ politically, economically and socially _
we want to be part of [it's] growth, and for Latin America to be a
growing part of our business,'' he says.
 &HT;    Shell's long history and commitment to the region are unusual
for European companies, according to European trade experts, who
say that the signing of recent trade pacts _ especially NAFTA and
Mercosur _ have suddenly drawn the curiosity and interest of
European companies.
 &HT;    Some European firms see Latin America as a manufacturing site,
while others, especially Spain, view the region as a growing
consumer market for its products.
 &HT;    ``The Spanish market is small, so I think that it is more likely
that most companies will look to Latin America as a consumer market
as a first step,'' says Rafael Dominguez, a spokesman for the
Spanish government's Ministry of Economy and Trade. ``Manufacturing
would come later, once a market is established. ''
 &HT;    ``Right now, the general feeling is that the region's economies
have turned around and there's a strong feeling of confidence in
Spain concerning Latin America,'' he says. ``The Latin American
market has a solid future.''
 &HT;    The fallout from the Asian crisis, says Dominguez, is benefiting
Latin America in the eyes of Spanish investors.
 &HT;    One of the most aggressive Spanish companies to invest in Latin
America is Banco Santander. The bank was founded in 1857 as a small
provincial bank in the port of Santander, where most trade
originated with Latin America. It opened its first offices abroad
in the 1950s in Havana and Mexico City.
 &HT;    Until a few years ago, Spanish companies were not as prepared to
invest in the region as companies from other parts of Europe. That
is no longer the case, says Keith Grant, a spokesman for Santander.
``Spanish companies are more lean and efficient than before and are
strong in areas [such as] banking, energy and telecommunications,
where the possibility for growth is greatest in Latin America.''
 &HT;    Privatization. The ongoing trend toward privatization in Latin
America is especially appealing to Spanish companies, according to
Grant.
 &HT;    ``Spain is a small market, so the privatization going on in
these sectors coincides with those areas in which Spanish companies
are ready for expansion,'' he says. ``It's natural that Spanish
companies look to expand in a market that lacks the kind of
services and infrastructure these companies can provide.''
 &HT;    Wolfgang Handtke, who heads the North America and Latin America
division of the German Economics Ministry, hopes more German
companies will follow in Spain's footsteps to take advantage of the
current opportunities now available in Latin America.
 &HT;    ``We wish companies would take a greater interest in Latin
America than they have done in the past,'' says Handtke.
 &HT;    The privatization of telecommunications, energy, airports and
ports are prime opportunities for German companies with the ability
to sell plant machinery and provide know-how. But, because of lack
of experience, German companies are reluctant to invest in
state-owned companies now being privatized, according to Handtke.
 &HT;    Germany remains bullish on improving trade relationships with
the region. In the first quarter of this year, for example,
Germany's exports to Latin America reached $3.4 billion _ almost 20
percent higher than during the same period last year.
 &HT;    The trade relationship has changed over the years, says Handtke.
Latin American companies are now exporting products the Germans
used to export to Latin America, including electrical machinery and
precision tools.
 &HT;    Latin American interest in Germany remains very strong, says
Handtke, noting that more than 220 Brazilian firms recently
attended the annual German-Brazil trade fair in Munich.
 &HT;    ``The Brazilians were interested in contacts with German
companies that could supply sophisticated equipment to help improve
the efficiency of Brazilian manufacturing plants,'' he says.
 &HT;    Still, despite the increased trade, it is Germany's huge
multinational companies that remain the dominant players in the
region. Smaller companies are not so active because of the distance
and cost of transport, the credit risk and the language barrier.
 &HT;    Being closer to the market is precisely why Mercedes Benz AG
chose to move its Latin American headquarters to Miami. The trip to
visit dealers in the region was so long and tiring that company
officials often made only one trip per year, says Mercedes-Benz
Latina Inc. President Matthias Luehrs. Now, with flights available
to every major city in the region and with the distance trimmed
from two to five hours to most markets, company officials will be
visiting as much as six and seven times per year.
 &HT;    Success. There are perhaps few companies that have taken as much
advantage of the increasing trade between Europe and Latin America
as Netherlands-based TNT, the international package and mail
express company. It is enjoying enormous success in Latin America,
with sales having doubled since 1995, according to James
Hartenstein, a TNT vice president who is regional manager for Latin
America and the Caribbean.
 &HT;    With more and more flights to the region, the growing amount of
trade and the improvement of airports, Latin America and the
Caribbean are filled with opportunities to expand the reach of TNT,
says Hartenstein.
 &HT;    TNT has taken an approach to doing business in the region that
is growing more and more common. Instead of setting up its own
facilities in some of the smaller markets, it is teaming up with
local partners who already know the pitfalls and profits of the
market.
 &HT;    ``We have done phenomenally well in the region,'' he says.
 &HT;    More European companies would surely like to be able to say the
same.

 Por SERGIO R. BUSTOS, con BARBARA BELEJACK en Mexico D.F., LAURA
COVILL en Frankfurt y JIM RUSSO en Madrid 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    La escena en la capital mexicana era familiar. Un salon de
banquetes lleno de empresarios deseosos de conocer las
oportunidades de inversion en Mexico, y la presencia de numerosos
funcionarios del gobierno explicando las ventajas del pais. Pero
los empresarios que conversaban con los mexicanos a principios de
este ano no ern de Estados Unidos. Eran europeos, en su mayor parte
britanicos, ansiosos por conocer detalles sobre el Tratado de Libre
Comercio de America del Norte (TLC) y otras oportunidades de
negocios en Mexico.
 &HT;    A medida que se expande la economia globalizada, las empresas e
inversionistas europeos llegan a la region para aprovechar uno de
los mercados emergentes mas atractivos del mundo.
 &HT;    ``La importancia de Mexico no siempre fue evidente en Europa,''
apunta Jacques Lecompte, que preside la delegacion de la Union
Europea (UE) en Mexico. ``El TLC aporto una nueva vision de
Mexico.''
 &HT;    Debido a sus viejos vinculos, su proximidad geografica y sus
relaciones historicas, Estados Unidos ha superado al resto del
mundo en el comercio con America Latina y el Caribe. En los ultimos
anos, esa ventaja ha crecido, sobre todo a causa del TLC.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, con un mejoramiento en las economias europeas,
muchas de sus empresas buscan abrir nuevos negocios en America
Latina. El comercio entre las ocho mayores economias
latinoamericanas y sus cinco principales socios europeos alcanzo un
total de US$61.300 millones el ano pasado, un 10,2 por ciento mas
que en 1996, segun datos del FMI compilados por Latin Trade.
 &HT;    Alemania se mantiene como el mayor socio comercial, seguida por
Italia, Francia, Espana y el Reino Unido, en ese orden.
 &HT;    Brasil. Entre los socios latinoamericanos, Brasil encabeza la
lista, seguido por Mexico y Argentina. Pero aunque Argentina tuvo
un modesto crecimiento de su comercio con Europa, y Brasil un
respetable aumento del 10,8 por ciento, fue Mexico el que disfruto
de la mayor alza el ano pasado: un 24,2 por ciento, estimulado
principalmente por un fuerte incremento del comercio con Italia y
el Reino Unido.
 &HT;    No obstante, las empresas europeas aun estan muy a la zaga de
las norteamericanas en inversion extranjera directa, segun un
informe de la CEPAL, que plantea que Estados Unidos supera con
creces a la UE como la mayor fuente de inversion extranjera
directa. El informe tambien apunta que Espana, Alemania y el Reino
Unido estan entre los paises desarrollados con mas inversiones en
la region.
 &HT;    Michael Mortimore, de la CEPAL, quien redacto el informe, dice
que la mayor parte de la inversion europea se destina al Cono Sur
debido al Mercosur. Pero agrega que las empresas europeas tienen
que desarrollar una verdadera estrategia de inversion en America
Latina. ``No veo nada que pueda llamarse una estrategia europea,''
afirma Mortimore al senalar que al parecer cada pais europeo tiene
su propio plan. Las firmas espanolas se concentran en la
electricidad, la banca, las telecomunicaciones y las aerolineas,
mientras las alemanas apuntan a los sectores automotor y quimico.
Por su parte, las empresas britanicas se interesan en el petroleo,
el gas, la banca y las telecomunicaciones.
 &HT;    La estrategia de las firmas espanolas parece estar vinculada a
su incapacidad de competir con Europa, por una parte, y a su
afinidad cultural con America Latina y el Caribe, por la otra, dice
Mortimore. El interes de Alemania se basa en firmas con una
trayectoria en la region: Volkswagen, Bayer, BASF y Hoescht. La
expansion britanica esta muy relacionada con la venta de activos y
las nuevas concesiones de recursos naturales, agrega.
 &HT;    Mexico. La UE es el segundo socio comercial de Mexico y la
segunda mayor fuente de inversion extranjera directa. Pero esta muy
a la zaga de Estados Unidos. El ano pasado, el comercio entre
Mexico y la UE fue de US$12.000 millones, mientras que con Estados
Unidos fue de US$176.000 millones. Pero las exportaciones mexicanas
a Europa crecen: el ano pasado superaron los US$43.000 millones, 14
por ciento mas que en 1996.
 &HT;    Adrian Beamish, embajador de Gran Bretana en Mexico, culpa al
TLC. Dice que la participacion europea en el mercado mexicano ``se
ha desplomado desde que el TLC entro en vigor.'' En efecto, esa
participacion es aproximadamente la mitad de lo que era en 1990.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a pesar de esas cifras, los funcionarios mexicanos
de comercio, entre ellos el subsecretario de Comercio, Jaime
Zabludovsky, siguen presentando a Mexico como puente entre America
del Norte y del Sur, y entre el Este y el Oeste. Mexico, agrega, se
propone diversificar sus mercados, sobre todo porque las
estadisticas del comercio muestran que el 80 por ciento de todos
los productos y servicios mexicanos se comercian con Estados
Unidos.
 &HT;    Este ano se dio un paso hacia la diversificacion cuando la UE y
Mexico iniciaron las negociaciones de un acuerdo comercial, que
Mexico considera una forma de reducir su dependencia de Estados
Unidos como socio comercial. Pero cualquier tipo de acuerdo puede
estar lejos porque varios miembros de la UE, entre ellos Francia,
prefieren que la entidad desarrolle vinculos comerciales a traves
de la Organizacion Mundial de Comercio y no a traves de paises
individuales. Francia tambien se opuso a un convenio similar con el
Mercosur.
 &HT;    Mexico, gracias al TLC, es un pais favorito para los
inversionistas europeos, que lo consideran un comodo puente hacia
el lucrativo mercado estadounidense. Tambien conocen los recursos
naturales de Mexico y sus necesidades de infraestructura.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, la subsidiaria mexicana de Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux,
de Francia, administra contratos para suministrar agua corriente a
la cuarta parte de los habitantes de la capital mexicana. La
compania matriz tambien tiene intereses comerciales en Argentina,
Brasil y Chile. British Oxygen Co. (BOC) tiene planeada una
inversion de US$1.000 millones en Pemex que se considera la mayor
inversion britanica en Mexico.
 &HT;    Junto con su socio ICA Fluor Daniel, de Mexico y Estados Unidos,
BOC proyecta construir el mayor complejo de nitrogeno del mundo
para inyectar nitrogeno en el yacimiento de petroleo de Cantarell,
frente a la costa de Campeche.
 &HT;    Entre los mas interesados en entrar en Mexico esta British
Airports Group (BAG), creado por el Ministerio de Comercio de Gran
Bretana para buscar oportunidades en el extranjero. Inglaterra fue
el primer pais en privatizar todos sus aeropuertos. Durante la
reunion en la capital mexicana, auspiciada por Canning House, de
Londres, una organizacion que fomenta vinculos entre el Reino Unido
y America Latina, varios funcionarios de BAG explicaron el
historial de su compania y la comercializacion y el auge turistico
que la privatizacion de los aeropuertos podria aportar a Mexico.
 &HT;    Pocas empresas europeas estan tan arraigadas en America Latina
como la alemana Volkswagen. La compania, que fabricara mas de
125.000 Escarabajos en su planta de Puebla, en Mexico, es uno de
los principales inversionistas europeos en America Latina. Un gran
numero de los autos producidos en Mexico se exportara a Estados
Unidos. Volkswagen ocupo el primer lugar entre las 20 principales
empresas extranjeras en la region, segun un informe de la CEPAL. En
la lista hay otras ocho empresas europeas, como la automotriz Fiat,
de Italia; el gigante del petroleo Royal Dutch/Shell, de Holanda;
la cadena minorista francesa Carrefour y la compania suiza de
alimentos Nestle.
 &HT;    A largo plazo. Shell es un ejemplo excelente de la clase de
empresa europea con presencia en la region desde hace mucho tiempo.
Sus inversiones en America Latina se remontan a principios de
siglo, y sus ejecutivos sienten el mismo optimismo hacia las
perspectivas de Latinoamerica a largo plazo que el que sentian sus
antecesores hace cien anos.
 &HT;    ``El Grupo Shell tiene ambiciosas aspiraciones de crecimiento
para la region,'' dice Phil Watts, que esta a cargo de las
operaciones de la empresa en America Latina. ``America Latina nos
da la capacidad de aprovechar una presencia bien establecida para
desarrollar negocios en mercados de rapido crecimiento y
desregulacion,'' agrega.
 &HT;    La empresa tiene inversiones de US$5.000 millones en
exploracion, produccion, distribucion y mercadeo de petroleo y gas
natural, refinacion de petroleo, productos petroquimicos, gas
natural licuado, carbon y explotacion forestal en America Latina.
La mayor parte de su inversion esta destinada a la refinacion, la
distribucion y el mercadeo de petroleo.
 &HT;    A pesar de sus enormes inversiones, la region representa menos
del 10 por ciento de todos los ingresos de la Shell. Pero Watts no
se desanima. ``A medida que la region madura (politica, economica y
socialmente) queremos participar en el crecimiento de la region, y
que America Latina sea una parte creciente de nuestro negocio,''
comenta.
 &HT;    La larga historia y el compromiso de Shell con la region no ha
sido la norma de las empresas europeas, dicen expertos en el
comercio europeo al senalar que la firma de recientes pactos
comerciales, sobre todo el TLC y el Mercosur, ha despertado
subitamente la curiosidad y el interes de las companias europeas.
 &HT;    Algunas firmas europeas ven a Latinoamerica como una base
manufacturera mientras otras, sobre todo las espanolas, la
consideran un creciente mercado para sus productos.
 &HT;    ``El mercado espanol es pequeno; por eso creo que lo mas
probable es que la mayoria de las empresas consideren inicialmente
a Latinoamerica como un mercado de consumo,'' dice Rafael
Dominguez, portavoz del Ministerio de Economia y Comercio de
Espana. ``Mas tarde podria venir la manufactura, una vez que el
mercado este establecido.''
 &HT;    ``En estos momentos, la opinion general es que las economias de
la region se han recuperado y Espana tiene una gran confianza en
America Latina,'' anade Dominguez. ``El mercado latinoamericano
tiene un futuro solido.''
 &HT;    El efecto de la crisis asiatica, dice Dominguez, beneficia a
Latinoamerica a los ojos de los inversionistas espanoles.
 &HT;    Una de las empresas espanolas mas dinamicas a la hora de
invertir en America Latina es Banco Santander, fundado en 1857 como
un pequeno banco provincial en la ciudad portuaria de Santander,
cuya mayor actividad comercial era con Latinoamerica. Banco
Santander abrio sus primeras sucursales en el exterior en los anos
50, en La Habana y en Mexico.
 &HT;    Hasta hace pocos anos, las empresas espanolas no estaban tan
preparadas para invertir en la region como las empresas de otros
paises europeos. Pero ya no es asi, afirma Keith Grant, portavoz de
Santander.
 &HT;    ``Las empresas espanolas son mas agiles y eficientes que antes y
tienen una gran fortaleza en sectores como la banca, la energia y
las telecomunicaciones, sectores con las mayores posibilidades de
crecimiento de America Latina,'' senala.
 &HT;    Privatizacion. La actual tendencia en America Latina hacia la
privatizacion es muy atractiva para las companias espanolas, segun
Grant.
 &HT;    ``Espana es un mercado pequeno, de modo que la privatizacion que
tiene lugar en estos sectores coincide con las areas en las que las
empresas espanolas estan preparadas para expandirse,'' indica. ``Es
natural que las empresas espanolas procuren extenderse en un
mercado que carece de los servicios y de la infraestructura que
esas companias pueden aportar.''
 &HT;    Wolfgang Handtke, que dirige la division de America del Norte y
Latinoamerica del Ministerio de Economia de Alemania, espera que
mas empresas alemanas sigan los pasos de Espana en aprovechar las
oportunidades que ofrece America Latina.
 &HT;    ``Quisieramos que las companias sientan un mayor interes por
America Latina que el que han tenido en el pasado,'' subraya
Handtke.
 &HT;    La privatizacion de empresas de telecomunicaciones, de
electrogeneracion, puertos y aeropuertos representan grandes
oportunidades para las companias alemanas que ofrecen maquinaria y
asesoria tecnica. Pero Handtke apunta que las empresas alemanas
estan renuentes a invertir en empresas estatales que se privatizan
debido a la falta de experiencia en ese campo.
 &HT;    Alemania mantiene su optimismo sobre el mejoramiento de las
relaciones comerciales con la region. En el primer trimestre de
este ano, por ejemplo, las exportaciones alemanas a Latinoamerica
alcanzaron US$3.400 millones, casi el 20 por ciento mas que en el
mismo periodo del ano pasado.
 &HT;    La relacion comercial ha cambiado con el paso de los anos, dice
Handtke. Las empresas latinoamericanas ahora exportan productos que
los alemanes solian exportar a Latinoamerica, como maquinaria
electrica y herramientas de precision.
 &HT;    America Latina tiene un gran interes en Alemania, afirma Handtke
al observar que mas de 220 empresas brasilenas asistieron
recientemente a la feria comercial germano-brasilena en Munich.
 &HT;    ``Los brasilenos estaban interesados en establecer contactos con
empresas alemanas que pudieran suministrarles equipos avanzados
para mejorar la eficiencia de las fabricas brasilenas,'' relata
Handtke.
 &HT;    No obstante, a pesar del aumento en el comercio, las enormes
multinacionales alemanas mantienen la hegemonia en la region. Las
companias menores no tienen tanta presencia debido a la distancia y
al costo del transporte, al riesgo de credito y a la barrera
idiomatica.
 &HT;    Precisamente para estar mas cerca del mercado, Mercedes-Benz AG
decidio trasladar sus oficinas latinoamericanas a Miami. El viaje
para visitar las agencias de la region era tan largo y fatigoso que
los ejecutivos de la empresa solo lo hacian una vez al ano, dice
Matthias Luhrs, presidente de Mercedes-Benz Latina Inc. Ahora, con
vuelos a todas las ciudades importantes de la region y con una
reduccion de dos a cinco horas en el tiempo que toma trasladarse a
la mayoria de los mercados, los ejecutivos de la compania visitaran
las sucursales hasta seis o siete veces al ano.
 &HT;    Exito. Quiza haya pocas empresas que hayan sacado tanto partido
del incremento del comercio entre Europa y America Latina como TNT,
una compania holandesa de correo expreso y envios internacionales.
TNT disfruta de un gran exito en la region y ha duplicado su
volumen de ventas desde 1995, segun James Hartenstein,
vicepresidente de TNT y gerente regional de America Latina y el
Caribe.
 &HT;    Con mas vuelos hacia la region, un volumen comercial en
crecimiento y mejoras en los aeropuertos, en America Latina y el
Caribe abundan las oportunidades para ampliar el alcance de TNT,
asegura Hartenstein.
 &HT;    La estrategia de negocios de TNT en la region es cada vez mas
comun. En vez de montar sus propias instalaciones en algunos de ls
mercados mas pequenos, se asocia con empresas locales que ya
conocen las ventajas y las desventajas del mercado.
 &HT;    ``Nuestro exito en la region ha sido fenomenal,'' afirma
Hartenstein.
 &HT;    Sin duda, a mas empresas europeas les gustaria decir lo mismo.

<P>
   SABRATHA, Libya _ Among majestic Roman ruins set against an
azure sea, Sebastian Cuisenier walked alone, a rare visitor to a
site that almost anywhere else in the world would be thronged with
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked pariah countries,'' Cuisenier, 27, a
Frenchman from Marseilles, said when asked why he had included
Libya to a two-month journey through the region. ``And I have a
certain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyan
authorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Cuisenier
to take the same step. It was not until three years ago that Libya
even established a Ministry of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.N. sanctions, which prohibit international flights, the
only way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88,000
visitors, about one-third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt in
an average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that even
this number may be inflated.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, has
nevertheless now pronounced tourism to be ``the industry of the
21st century.'' And if real and psychological barriers could be
removed, one diplomat said, ``the potential is absolutely
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered along Libya's 1,100-mile Mediterranean coast are
Greek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of the
region's richest archaeological treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was first
inhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and also
boasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920s by Italian experts.
</P>
<P>
   The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes to
Tripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100,000
people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage
Site.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanest
in the Mediterranean. The vast desert includes another World
Heritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 miles
south of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4,000 years ago
by the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population. In Wadi
Mathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be found
that date from neolithic times.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, government officials say, they are making progress in
luring visitors to such sites. A crowd that gathered recently for a
cultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin.
</P>
<P>
   Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious about
a land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing to
endure the five-hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, the
nearest international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necks
are no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although both
are still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost their
appetite for crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places,'' said
Francois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France. ``What I like most is
that I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I can
have some peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Gattus, Libya's undersecretary of tourism, said that a
recent two-day conference held in Tripoli was intended to help
train local tour operators in order to put the industry ``on a
sound foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles to
travel within Libya _ particularly by independent visitors _ remain
considerable. The official exchange rate is wildly inflated, and
the government has not yet settled on a plan to establish a more
realistic rate for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car. One
effect of the U.N. sanctions, imposed since 1992 because of Libya's
refusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airliner, has been to ground most of the country's domestic air
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has been
relatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declares their country is a ``state of
the masses,'' has created what Cuisenier described as ``not exactly
a service-oriented economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and if
the U.N. sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become big
business. And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful that
animosity from the West, and particularly from the United States,
has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is simple: we cannot ignore America,'' Salah
el-Fathali, the executive director of the National Cancer
Institute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visiting
French doctors around the Sabratha site. ``But at the same time,
you cannot ignore us.''

   Wednesday, wet flakes of snow were observed in the hills of
southwest New York as a stream of very cold air crossed the
relatively tepid waters of Lake Erie. The trend toward very cool
weather will prevail over the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States
on Thursday as brisk breezes from the northwest import chilly air
southward from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As the cold air gathers heat and moisture in transit over the
Great Lakes, numerous clouds will form throughout the interior
Northeast. Scattered rain or snow showers will also occur over
northern Pennsylvania, upstate New York and northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, air sinking on descent from the Appalachian
Mountains will punch holes in the cloud cover along the Northeast
coast, causing intervals of sunshine from Washington, D.C., to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Northerly winds will direct cool air into the Southeast. After a
chilly start, ample sunshine will only boost afternoon readings
into the 50s from the upper Tennessee Valley to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Clear skies and diminishing winds will promote rapid cooling
Thursday night, setting the stage for frost over portions of the
interior Southeast. Meanwhile, scattered clouds and showers will
surround a slow-moving cold front draped over south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and spotty thunderstorms will cover much of the interior
West as a jet stream disturbance intercepts a moist flow of air
from the southeast. Elsewhere, a surge of warmer air will arrive
over the northern Plains while mainly sunny and seasonably warm
conditions continue along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE CLOUD MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year the cloud machine goes to work in
earnest over the Great Lakes. Each fall when the first wintry chill
sweeps south from central Canada, the air near the Great Lakes
becomes filled with roiling bands of clouds. The temperature of the
surface of the water at this time of year is mainly in the 50s.
Meanwhile, a few thousand feet aloft air temperatures can be in the
teens and 20s. The strong temperature contrast fuels rising
currents of moist air which produce clouds and snow squalls, much
as heating of the earth by the summer sun fuels the updrafts that
support thunderstorms.

LAUGHS MIX WITH PATHOS AT RICHARD PRYOR TRIBUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A laughing group of comedians and actors who have
been inspired in their work by Richard Pryor gathered on Tuesday
night at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to pay tribute
to him. Robin Williams brought all the loose ends together when he
recalled the Mark Twain observation that sorrow is a greater source
of humor than happiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the laughter far outweighed the sorrow. The performers' acts
served to remind the audience that Pryor, whose health problems
include multiple sclerosis, was a pioneer among comics in creating
characters who spoke in the true voice of the streets, obscenities
and all.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the words heard during the tribute were probably coming
from a Kennedy Center stage for the first time, and many cannot be
repeated here. But the Comedy Central cable channel taped the event
for showing on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The event was to honor Pryor as the first recipient of the
Kennedy Center's award for humor, the Mark Twain Prize. Pryor sat
in a box, but he was so weak that he could not rise to acknowledge
the loud applause from the audience in the center's concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see you up there,'' said one of the entertainers,
Morgan Freeman, who echoed another hallowed Twain remark by adding,
``Reports of your death were greatly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   At a party after the show, Pryor, 58, was unable to rise from
his wheelchair and was barely able to say, in a low moan, ``Thank
you,'' when James Johnson, the chairman of the Kennedy Center, gave
him the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Mark Twain, you made us laugh and also think,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said at the party that Pryor had been alert to the
tributes paid him. ``He lights up,'' Williams said. ``You can see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own appearance at the concert hall, Williams came
onstage, saying he was scalping tickets to the hugely popular van
Gogh show at the National Gallery of Art. ``I've got two tickets to
van Gogh,'' he said. ``Check it out. Two tickets. Two hundred bucks
and you'll see `The Potato Eaters.' '' He refused to take a check.
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came, Freeman recalled yet another Twain
observation, that he would rather see a taxidermist coming toward
him than a tax collector. ``The taxidermist isn't going to take
more than your skin,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Damon Wayans said in his routine that he had drawn
inspiration from Pryor, to a point. ``I wanted to be just like
him,'' Wayans said, ``except for the drug habit, the failed
marriages and the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg also cited Twain in her remarks, saying:
``Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of
Congress. Oops, I repeat myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Chris Rock said that Pryor had come on the scene
``between the two great plagues, disco and AIDS.'' Another comic,
Richard Belzer, recalled one of his worst stage experiences, having
to follow Pryor's act at the Improv in Manhattan. ``It's like
having to paint a picture next to one by da Vinci,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian and social activist Dick Gregory was on hand, not
as a performer, but as a friend of Pryor's. ``It must have thrilled
him to be there and look down on it,'' Gregory said. ``It had to do
a lot for him, to see that, to feel that.''

CLINTON'S LAWYER CLAIMS JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ADOPTING UNFAIR
PROCEDURES FOR TAKING TESTIMONY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee has adopted unfair
procedures for taking testimony during its upcoming impeachment
inquiry, President Clinton's lawyer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gregory Craig, emerging from a 90-minute meeting with a
House panel investigator, said the Republican-run committee is
forcing Clinton to play ``a game with the rules being made by one
side.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee spokesman derided the attack as an effort to obscure
Clinton's allegedly impeachable attempts to cover up his
extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the president's special counsel, accused the panel of
violating Clinton's rights to ``fundamental fairness'' and ``due
process'' by failing to state clearly the specific charges it will
level against the president regarding his efforts to keep secret
his escapades with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr, in a report to Congress last
month, alleged that Clinton committed 11 impeachable offenses. The
committee's chief Republican investigator, David Schippers,
expanded that list to 15, but panel Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
has reportedly winnowed that number to the three offenses of
perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the committee has failed to disclose which of the
three lists it will pursue, making it extremely difficult for
Clinton's attorneys to present a strong defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a right to know what the charges are,''
Craig said. ``We will have no fair chance to represent our client,
the president of the United States, adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig met with Schippers to express the president's concerns
regarding his ability to present witnesses and testimony during the
as yet unscheduled impeachment hearings. Unfortunately, Craig said,
the committee has shown no willingness to alter its controversial
procedures, which require panel approval before the president can
present witnesses and evidence on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the committee's planned procedure will permit
Clinton's attorneys to present evidence and testimony only after
they submit to the panel a written request containing ``precise
summaries'' of what items they plan to show or state ``precisely
and in detail'' what the witness will tell the panel. The
committee, after considering the lawyers' requests and summaries,
will decide if the proposed evidence and testimony is, again in the
words of the panel, ``necessary or desirable to a full and fair
record'' in the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial procedure places due process on its head,
Craig said. ``You (on the committee) are gathering facts and then
looking for an offense to charge him with,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also derided Republican accusations that the president is
trying to delay the process, saying his client wants hearings to
begin as early as Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a fast proceeding; we want to have a fair
proceeding; we want to have a just proceeding,'' Craig said. ``We
are still hopeful we can improve the process and make it fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But committee spokesman Paul McNulty defended the panel's
planned process and said Craig's effort is part of the president's
move to ensure the American people ``never get to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's defenders have got to get away from these
partisan attacks,'' McNulty said. ``It won't work. We're going to
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will proceed in a fair and efficient manner,
consulting with legal scholars on what constitutes the ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' the Constitution states are grounds for
impeachment, McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said that the committee's controversial procedure
was modeled on the process the panel used in investigating whether
President Nixon committed impeachable offenses. The panel, then
chaired by Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., concluded in 1974 that the
president should be impeached. But Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974,
before further action. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ As high stakes Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
slouched through their seventh contentious and inconclusive day in
an isolated compound in rural Maryland, a profound question
emerged: what ARE they doing out there?
</P>
<P>
   For seven days and nights, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and scores of their top aides have been
closeted at the Wye River conference center trying to strike a deal
that would advance a five-year-old peace process.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has journeyed to the Eastern Shore
retreat five times since talks began last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he brought in ailing Jordanian King Hussein to try
to spirit the talks along.
</P>
<P>
   There have been formal dinners winding late into the evening,
relaxed luncheons and walks through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat even took an hour-long bicycle ride the other day to
clear his head and, presumably, contemplate the prospects for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all glamour.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart described the atmosphere at a
two-hour dinner Clinton hosted for the parties on Monday night as
''cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   He later confirmed, however, that Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon snubbed Arafat at the soiree, refusing to shake the former
commando leader's hand.
</P>
<P>
   And the hours these guys keep.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who's own late-night work habits are legend, met for
three hours Tuesday night with Netanyahu, wrapping up at 1:25 a.m.
Wednesday before boarding the presidential helicopter for the
flight back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Albright stayed up and called Netanyahu right
after Clinton left to wish the Israeli leader a happy birthday,
before launching into a discussion centered on land and peace.
</P>
<P>
   What the talks are designed to do is to create an atmosphere
conducive to tough decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, after all, is being asked to turn over land to
Palestinians. They, in turn, are being asked to crack down on their
own people -- if they pose a threat to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   There are arguments over maps, tiffs over history and squabbles
about the meaning of words.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes there is a dispute on what constitutes an
agreement,'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, told reporters at
Wye on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The issues, to be sure, are difficult, the compromises required
to get a deal are painful and the risks both sides are being asked
to take for peace are incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   When push comes to shove, doubts inevitably creep in.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat wonders whether Netanyahu is negotiating in good faith.
Netanyahu ask whether Arafat will, or can, make good on his
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Both deal with anxiety about their place in history. Would an
agreement under the terms available be judged by future generations
as a triumph or a sell-out?
</P>
<P>
   Threats and counter-threats are exchanged. One side or another
packs its bags and swears it's ready to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, the mediators, in this case Clinton and
his battery of Middle East diplomats, must work to assuage fears,
dispel doubts and, when all else fails, even point out that a
failure to reach an agreement can also carry risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The art is knowing what's conceivable, to start with, what's
possible, in the second instance, and what's doable in the third,
and knowing how to convey the results of that analysis in some
persuasive way, to get the parties to take the next step, or steps,
forward,'' said former U.S. diplomat Harry Barnes, director of the
conflict resolution program at the Carter Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' said Barnes, who's been closely involved in
negotiations over peace in Bosnia, Sudan and North Korea, ''there's
always the problem that sometimes neither side can face up to
making that agreement on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolving such an impasse often requires a delicate mix of
empathy and pressure, a mix that, by Wednesday, U.S. officials were
searching hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secretary Albright has now been here for seven days and seven
nights. The president has spent an enormous amount of time here.
The vice president has been here. Other key players have been
here,'' said Rubin. ''We are trying to provide all the assistance,
the creativity, the persuasive powers that we can so that we can
advance the security and the prospect for peace for the peoples of
the region. But we can't make decisions for them.''

THE POP LIFE: LOSSES RECALLED IN `ELECTRO-SHOCK BLUES'; A MUSIC
FESTIVAL WITH LITTLE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ There are two things that listening to
``Electro-Shock Blues,'' the second album by the Eels, makes one
want to say when talking to E (formerly Mark Oliver Everett), the
band's singer, songwriter and guitarist. The first is ``I'm
sorry''; the second is ``Congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The first response is out of sympathy for the recent tragedies
that inspired the album: the suicide of his sister, the diagnosis
of terminal cancer for his mother, the deaths of several friends
and, years earlier, the heart attack of his father, whom E
discovered dead.
</P>
<P>
   The second response is out of admiration that E, on the verge of
becoming the only surviving member of his immediate family, managed
to create such a beautiful, profound and moving album out of these
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm sorry, congratulations, is the card I'd like to get from
people,'' E said in an interview on Tuesday. ``That's why I called
it `Electro-Shock Blues.' The electro-shock part is based on the
experiences my sister had in the mental hospital, and the blues
part is because _ though it's not blues music per se _ it's what
blues singers do. They take seemingly negative situations and turn
them into something positive by processing them and telling people
the story.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Congratulations' is also the right response,'' he continued,
``because when you have tragedy in your life, you have two choices.
You can get weighted down by it and give up, whether by killing
yourself or numbing yourself. Or you can let it make you stronger.
It's a thin line. I've accepted that I'm an inch away from going
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The harrowing result, ``Electro-Shock Blues'' (released this
week on Dreamworks), is a concept album in the best sense of the
word, a testament not to self-pity but to self-awareness. It is a
grim journey that begins in the mind of E's sister as she loses
consciousness for the last time on her bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   As the album moves through birthday parties and funerals,
hospitals and sanitariums, E spares no details about chemotherapy,
hospital food and coffins. But E arrives at a happy ending,
affirming, ``Maybe it's time to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That part's really genuine,'' E said. ``I really have a lust
for life that keeps me going _ just barely. When you have all these
tragedies happen, you figure out what's really important. That's
why I made a record like this rather than what people would have
wanted me to make, which is something that didn't have the word
`cancer' in it so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles trio's previous album, ``Beautiful Freak'' from
1996, was a slightly more upbeat affair, spawning the hit
``Novocaine for the Soul.'' A much more revealing and unsettling
project, ``Electro-Shock Blues'' is filled with strings, brass,
turntable scratching, samples of past Eels songs, meditations on
everything from the meaning of life to the meanness of life and,
most disturbing, the process of a human being coming to terms with
the death of a loved one and arriving at important realizations too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs about my sister are the truest tributes I can do
because they're not some `Candle in the Wind' thing,'' E said.
``I'm doing songs from her point of view because I think I
understand. We grew up together. We have a lot of the same problems
in common. I wanted to see how difficult it was for her, and I
don't blame her. I think that's an amazing tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eels are to perform at Mercury Lounge in New York on Sunday
and Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Deleting the Music
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary rock, the presence of political-activist
organizations amid the concession stands, notably on Lollapalooza
tours, has become a staple at festivals. More recently, the
political sideline of Lollapalooza has become the driving concept
of festivals like the Beastie Boys' Tibet Freedom Concert and Sarah
McLachlan's Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California's Berkeley campus on Sunday, the
idea was taken to its extreme by the Spitfire Tour, which drew
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other festivals, the Spitfire Tour was conceived by a
musician, Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine. The
difference is that Spitfire is a music festival with hardly any
music.
</P>
<P>
   The performers _ Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, Michael Franti of
Spearhead, Exene Cervenka of X and the former Nirvana bassist Krist
Novoselic _ perform few or no songs. They mainly speak about
political issues that mean something to them _ race, sexuality,
environment, personal responsibility and political representation _
hoping to spark a social consciousness in their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Besides musicians, other speakers include the actor Woody
Harrelson, the MTV personality Kennedy, the medical-marijuana
advocate Todd McCormick and the environmental activist Julia
``Butterfly'' Hill, who has been living in an endangered redwood
tree for 10 months, a real-life equivalent of the protagonist in
the Italo Calvino novel ``The Baron in the Trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Lilith Fair, which tested its concept with smaller
concerts before planning a big tour, Spitfire is experimenting.
Berkeley was one of just four dates at colleges this month (the
final stops will be in Nashville, Tenn., on Monday and Gainesville,
Fla., on Tuesday) as a trial run for a 30-to-40-date tour in the
spring. Will students and fans show up for speeches without an
entertaining concert to help the medicine go down?
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Sarah Haynes, one of the tour's organizers, the
results have been encouraging. At the tour's first stop at Clemson
University in South Carolina, protesters accused tour organizers of
holding the event to proselytize for homosexuality, but 3,000
people showed up. Tickets range from free to $3. After the
addresses, the speakers have in-depth discussions with interested
members of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of creating the tour is to educate and entertain
at the same time, to make learning fun, and to speak about topics
that aren't necessarily brought up in college,'' Ms. Haynes said.
``We want to make an impact, to instigate action, and to show
people what they can do without fame and money.''

TEXAS GOV. BUSH'S POPULARITY ISN'T CARRYING OVER TO OTHER GOP
CANDIDATES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A new statewide poll released Tuesday shows that
despite the likelihood that Gov. George W. Bush's would score a
major re-election victory, his popularity is not carrying over to
other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is leading Democratic challenger Garry Mauro 66 percent to
21 percent in the latest Texas Poll, with 12 percent undecided or
refusing to answer.
</P>
<P>
   But 38 percent of those voters who say they are backing Bush
also say they will be casting ballots for Democratic attorney
general candidate Jim Mattox. Mattox is leading Republican John
Cornyn 47 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in two other major contests, a quarter of the Bush voters
say they will cast ballots for Democrat John Sharp for lieutenant
governor and Democrat Paul Hobby for state comptroller. Sharp and
Hobby are running even with their Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted that Bush was campaigning in
Dallas on Wednesday with Cornyn and Republican lieutenant governor
candidate Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is working hard to make sure good people like
Rick Perry and John Cornyn get elected,'' Tucker said. ``The final
determination of how successful this campaign is going to be will
be seen on Nov. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 764 likely voters was conducted Oct. 5-18 by the
Office of Survey Research at the University of Texas for Scripps
Howard and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox's political comeback has continued to be one of the
surprises of this election season.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox was attorney general from 1983 to 1990, but then lost
races for governor and U.S. Senate. Mattox was expected to fade
quickly this year against Cornyn, a former Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattox has remained strong since summer, and Cornyn has
gained only slightly in the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're very pleased. They (the voters) know who I am
and they're glad to have me back,'' Mattox said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the race will tighten up but added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they understand the contrast between Cornyn and me.
He's for the big folks, and I'm for the little guys. I've had a
strong record to run on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn spokeswoman Michele Kay said the Texas Poll was conducted
before Cornyn made his heaviest television advertising purchases.
She said Mattox's lead is based on people remembering his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week that we run TV, we do a lot better,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Bush's coattails will show up when voters understand
which candidates he is supporting in this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and Election Day people will understand that the
person George Bush is supporting is John Cornyn and not Jim
Mattox,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Texas lieutenant governor is heading into the
final weeks with Sharp tied with Perry. Each enjoyed 37 percent
support from likely voters, with Libertarian Anthony Garcia holding
5 percent support and 18 percent still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer Texas Poll, Perry led Sharp 36 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp spokesman Kelly Fero said the poll demonstrates that the
election is moving in Sharp's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a choice between John Sharp's independent leadership
and Rick Perry's partisan followership,'' Fero said. ``The
independents are clearly breaking for the candidate with his proven
record of independent leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan said Republican polls show their
candidates doing better than the Texas Poll does. But he said the
Texas Poll shows that Sharp's critical television ads about Perry
is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sharp will lose because he has no vision, no plans and no
interest in getting out of the gutter,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The race for state comptroller also has narrowed since summer.
Hobby now is in a statistical dead heat with Republican Carole
Keeton Rylander at 36 percent to 33 percent. But in the summer
Texas Poll, Hobby trailed Rylander 30 percent to 35 percent.
Rylander's summer lead was outside of the poll's margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for state land commissioner, Republican David
Dewhurst is leading over Democrat Richard Raymond 34 percent to 29
percent, with more than a third saying they were undecided or not
wanting to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   For state agriculture commissioner, Democrat Pete Patterson had
moved up statistically even with Republican Susan Combs. Combs led
34-31 percent in the summer poll. But now the race is Patterson, 35
percent, Combs, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Tony Garza is leading over Democrat Joe Henderson 38
percent to 26 percent in the race for a seat on the Railroad
Commission. &QL;

   Arthur Miller leads a list of playwrights named by more than 800
authors, actors, directors, theater professionals and arts
journalists in a poll by Britain's Royal National Theater to select
significant 20th-century plays. Among 188 playwrights nominated for
377 plays, Miller was followed by Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett
in the balloting, which is aimed at guiding the National in
celebrating the century. The plays that received the most
nominations were Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot,'' Miller's ``Death
of a Salesman,'' Tennessee Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire,''
John Osborne's ``Look Back in Anger'' and Eugene O'Neill's ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night.'' Throughout next year, in a program
called NT2000, the National will stage 45-minute presentations from
100 plays to reflect the range of drama and illustrate the
development of English-language theater in the last 100 years.

   NEW YORK _ In conjunction with a retrospective devoted to Mary
Cassatt (1844-1926) at the Art Institute of Chicago, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art opened an exhibition from its extensive
collection of light-sensitive Cassatt drawings and prints
Wednesday. ``Mary Cassatt: Drawings and Prints in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art'' reflects the theme that became her signature,
mothers or nurses tending children. The exhibition runs through
Jan. 24.

   In Transit
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1935, under the patronage of the Museum of the
City of New York, the photographer Bernice Abbott (1898-1991) got
help from the Federal Arts Project to spend four years documenting
the transformation of the city from its 19th-century trappings.
Thursday through Jan. 19, in an exhibition organized by the Museum
of the City of New York and titled ``Changing New York,'' the
National Museum of the Women in Arts in Washington will display 126
of Abbott's 305 prints, many for the first time.
</P>

   Star-studded Sidewalk
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hollywood has its Walk of Fame. Now Greenwich Village
is going to get a Playwrights' Sidewalk. Roughly 50 feet long, the
walk will be filled with bronze stars inscribed with the names of
43 playwrights, from Edward Albee to Paul Zindel, whose work has
been performed off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The Playwrights' Sidewalk will be unveiled and dedicated by
Lucille Lortel at 6:45 p.m. on Monday in a ceremony directed by the
Tony Award-winning choreographer Donald Saddler in front of the
Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher St. Ms. Lortel, a producer
and theater owner, has been a driving force in off-Broadway since
1957.
</P>
<P>
   Among the playwrights expected to attend are Carter Beane,
Horton Foote, William Hoffman, Larry Kramer, Marsha Norman, Murray
Schisgal, Paul Vogel, Michael Weller, Lanford Wilson and Zindel.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Out
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a student of piano and composition was
summoned on a few hours' notice to substitute for an ailing
conductor. No, this is not the Leonard Bernstein story. It's the
story of the event that won acclaim for Simone Young when, at age
24 in 1985, she made her debut at the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young went on to become an assistant to James Conlon in
Cologne and Daniel Barenboim in Paris and Bayreuth, and to conduct
in many of the world's foremost opera houses. Next year she will
become music director of the Bergen Philharmonic in Norway, and in
2001, music and artistic director of the Australian Opera. Thursday
and Friday at 8 p.m., her story converges with Bernstein's when Ms.
Young will lead the New York Philharmonic in works by John
Harbison, Copland and Respighi in concerts that begin the
orchestra's seventh annual Conductor Debut Week and its third
annual American Classics Initiative.

GLENN DISQUALIFIED FROM PORTIONS OF KEY MEDICAL EXPERIMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn has been disqualified from portions of a key medical
experiment to be conducted aboard the shuttle Discovery next week,
but NASA characterized the impact of the move as minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77, was quietly dropped in August when he failed to meet
the criteria established by the experiment's principal
investigator, Dr. Charles Czeisler of the Brigham and Women's
University in Boston. The decision was not disclosed until this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which has flown earlier this year, is designed
to study why astronauts in space, like many elderly on Earth, do
not sleep well and to what degree it impairs their performance of
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was disqualified from the portion of the experiment that
would have required him to take small doses of melatonin, a hormone
produced in the brain that some researchers believe enhances sleep
and could serve as a countermeasure for weariness among astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The use of melatonin constitutes about one-third of the sleep
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored and excited that Senator Glenn has volunteered for
(other portions) of the sleep experiment,'' said Czeisler. ``This
is a very special opportunity to study the sleep patterns of older
astronauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn still plans to don a sensor-laden sleep helmet and swallow
a cold capsule-sized thermometer/transmitter every two to three
days as part of the research project.
</P>
<P>
   The high tech sleep cap and other gear will furnish Czeisler's
team with data on Glenn's pulse, respiration, eye and muscle
movements as well as readings on the levels of melatonin his body
secretes naturally as he rests. The ingestible transmitter will
send core body temperature readings to an electronic recorder on
Glenn's waist.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler said federal medical privacy requirements and his
institution's own medical ethics prevented him from disclosing the
reasons for Glenn's disqualification from portions of the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dave Williams, the physician-astronaut who serves as the
director of NASA's life sciences research, would say only that
either the health of the astronaut or the experiment's criteria
would serve as a basis of disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to protect the non-coercive manner of
that decision-making,'' said Williams. He added the policy extended
to NASA's decision not to voluntarily disclose a decision made
months ago until it was uncovered by a New York Times medical
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese physician-astronaut Chiaki Mukai will participate in
all phases of the sleep experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, meanwhile, remains a full participant in the mission's
second major medical experiment _ an assessment of how the body
metabolizes the proteins that contribute to muscle development in
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   That experiment will require more than a dozen blood draws and
regular urine specimens. &QL;

SYRIA AGREES TO STOP SUPPORTING KURDS, DEFUSING CRISIS WITH
TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A three-week-old crisis between Turkey and
Syria appears to have been at least temporarily defused by the
signing of an agreement in which Syria agreed to stop supporting
Kurdish rebels, who are demanding a homeland in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey had demanded that Syria cease all support for the
guerrilla force known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which
is fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey. It also
demanded that Syria expel the guerrillas' leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   According to a text made public by Turkish officials, the
agreement stipulates that Syria ``will not allow the PKK to receive
military, logistic or financial support or to carry out propaganda
on its soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's current whereabouts are unclear. He asserted in a
telephone interview with journalists last week that he is ``in
Kurdistan,'' which could mean either southeastern Turkey or
northern Iraq. Other reports place him in Russia, Cyprus, Iran or
Armenia. Some say he remains in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been in a Moscow suburb for a week,'' Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said on Tuesday. ``We have taken serious
initiatives for his extradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian ambassador in Turkey, Alexander Lebedev, denied that
Ocalan was in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey set off the crisis this month by threatening to take
military action against Syria if it did not stop supporting Kurdish
rebels. Officials from the two countries met on Monday and Tuesday
in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has not yet been officially announced in Syria,
but Turkish officials said that it had been signed by a senior
Syrian officer, Gen. Adnan Badr al-Hassan, and that they assumed it
represented Syria's official position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document should be considered as an agreement which ends
the crisis and starts dialogue,'' said Necati Uktan, a spokesman
for the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria extends its hand of friendship to us,'' Uktan said. ``If
everything is realized on the framework of the agreement, we will
then shake this hand. If we consider the worst scenario and think
that this will not be realized, our military measures will be
enforced at this stage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two countries were brought together in part through the
efforts of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that we helped defuse the crisis between the
two countries,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in Cairo
Wednesday. ``All we care about is that both sides reach a
settlement, which could certainly spare the region lots of
tension.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials had insisted that talks with Syria cover only
the question of support for Kurdish insurgents. They said they
would not discuss Syria's grievances against Turkey, which include
water issues and the status of Hatay Province, which is part of
Turkey but claimed by Syria. On Tuesday a Syrian television station
broadcast a commentary asserting that Hatay ``is an integral part
of Syria and cannot be surrendered.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats in Turkey who monitor developments in the
Middle East said they would reserve judgment on the accord
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians have always said that they don't support the PKK
and that Ocalan is not there,'' a diplomat said. ``So what they've
promised doesn't really change much officially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The Clinton administration, increasing the
pressure on oil companies to build a pipeline for Caspian Sea oil
that suits U.S. interests, said Wednesday that it would give Turkey
$823,000 to help plan its part of the line.
</P>
<P>
   As oil company executives appear close to making a
recommendation on a pipeline route, the United States is making a
major push for a plan that would send oil across Turkey to the
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Administration officials say a
pipeline along this route would help stabilize the region and serve
long-term U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option from
environmental, economic and strategic standpoints,'' said
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat. ``No one should
underestimate our determination to make Baku-Ceyhan a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies favor the U.S.-backed pipeline route but believe
that its projected cost of $2.8 billion makes it too costly to
build anytime soon. Indeed, some executives believe that the
project could cost $4 billion or more. Eizenstat's announcements
were apparently part of a last-minute campaign to make it more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to give Turkey financial help to lay the
groundwork for this project,'' said an official in Ankara who was
briefed on this week's meetings. ``It's to help Turkey prepare a
financial package, figure out how to line up financing and firm up
details of the route.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of oil companies active in the Caspian region said
Wednesday that they still favor a shorter pipeline route running
from Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, to the Georgian port
of Supsa on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat concluded three days of meetings with Turkish
officials on Wednesday. He said that the Trade and Development
Agency, which supports U.S. business projects abroad, would provide
the money to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of several top administration officials who are
traveling to push for the Baku-Ceyhan route. Jan Kalicki, a senior
Commerce Department envoy, was in Azerbaijan last weekend.
President Clinton's special envoy to the Caspian region, Richard
Morningstar, and the head of the Trade and Development Agency, are
due in Istanbul next week.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of large amounts of oil and gas under and around
the Caspian has attracted dozens of energy companies to what may be
the century's last big bonanza. Because the new nations in the
region are unstable and wedged into a strategic region between
Russia and Iran, they have also become an arena for big-power
competition. The decision on where to build an oil-export pipeline
could have profound geopolitical as well as economic effects.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies active in the Caspian _ among them Exxon, Pennzoil
and the newly merged BP-Amoco _ are expected to announce soon which
pipeline route they favor. Officially they are making only a
recommendation to the government of Azerbaijan. Since they will pay
for the pipeline, however, their recommendation is likely to be
decisive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the oil consortium, Pamela Mounter, said
executives hoped to recommend a pipeline route next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our contract calls for us to make a draft recommendation to
the Azerbaijani government on a pipeline route.'' Ms. Mounter said
in a telephone interview from Baku. ``The deadline is the end of
this month, and we hope to meet that deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mounter said executives of the oil consortium were not
available for comment, because ``they are working flat-out to meet
the deadline.'' Asked if their recommendation would be made public,
she replied, ``Yes, to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   An executive close to the consortium, however, said intense
international interest would probably force the companies to make
their recommendation fully public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendation is being made to Socar,'' the executive
said, referring to Azerbaijan's state-owned oil company. ``They've
asked for a delay of a week or two because they're still working on
next year's budget and some other matters that have to be discussed
at the meeting. It's a legitimate delay, nothing horribly
nefarious. The basic facts haven't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Published reports suggesting that the companies will not
recommend immediate construction of a pipeline across Turkey have
set off waves of protest and denial in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baku-Ceyhan will definitely be constructed,'' President
Suleyman Demirel of Turkey assured anxious Turks. ``It is the
safest route and has the backing of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told
Turkish journalists that ``an obituary for the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline
is at least premature and, we believe, wrong and inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, has announced
plans to meet with senior oil executives to discuss the pipeline
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to know what he's going to say or to whom,'' said
a specialist in Caspian oil issues who asked not to be identified.
``It's fairly unclear to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The date originally set for the companies' announcement, Oct.
29, is also the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish
Republic. The presidents of Azerbaijan and Georgia will be in
Turkey for the celebrations, and they are expected to join Demirel
in a statement committing themselves to the Baku-Ceyhan route.
Since their governments will not be putting up the money for the
pipeline, however, the statement will be largely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   A short-lived military uprising in Georgia this week reflected
the fragility of the new nations around the Caspian, and forced a
one-day halt in work on a small-gauge oil pipeline being built
across Georgian territory.
</P>
<P>
   President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia blamed the uprising on
forces opposed to the construction of an oil pipeline across his
country. In the past, he has charged that Russia is fomenting
instability in his country. Russia wants the main export pipeline
built across its territory instead of across Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five or six years we have been doing everything possible
to solve problems over the construction of the oil pipeline, and
they are trying to interfere with that,'' Shevardnadze said.
``Fortunately this adventure is over, and Georgia has shown that it
can defend its democracy. I have received many letters from big oil
companies saying they are ready to continue cooperation with
Georgia.''

   The New York Times computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times computer model collapses runaway scores and takes note
of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than earlier
games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Minnesota (No. 2) and Jacksonville (3), but a
much smaller difference between Denver (1) and Minnesota (2).

 &HT;    MICROSOFT: NETSCAPE MEMO UNDERCUTS ANTITRUST CASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON A Microsoft lawyer sought on Wednesday to rip apart
the government's antitrust case against the software giant by
accusing Netscape Communications Corp., its chief rival in the Web
browser wars, of once having secretly wooed Microsoft's hand in a
technological marriage of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   As the landmark trial entered its third day, Microsoft attorney
John Warden cited an e-mail message that Jim Clark, Netscape's
co-founder and current chairman, sent Microsoft executives seeking
``a financial investment.'' In return, Clark suggested Netscape
would allow Microsoft to extend its Windows monopoly to the then
fledgling Internet without any interference.
</P>
<P>
   In that message, dated Dec. 29, 1994, at 3:01 a.m., Clark wrote:
``We'd like to work with you. Working together could be in your
self-interest as well as ours. Depending on the interest level, you
might take an equity position in Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark went on to note that ``Microsoft is the de facto standard
'client' software company and we have never planned to compete with
you, so we have never considered a 'client' as being our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in my organization knows about this message,'' Clark
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice contends that Microsoft sought to use
its powerful Windows hold over the world's 100 million personal
computers to undermine Netscape as an effective competitor by
giving away its browser, which was beginning to become a lucrative
cash cow for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Warden sought to discredit James Barksdale,
the government's key witness, who had submitted 127 pages of
written direct testimony, alleging that in a June 1995 meeting
Microsoft tried to divide the Internet market between the two firms
in return for taking a stake in Netscape, which was still more than
a year away from selling its shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale, who became Netscape's president and chief
executive officer a few weeks after Clark wrote his 1994 memo to
Microsoft, disavowed the document and minimized its weight.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale told the court the memo had played no role in the
crucial June 1995 meeting, a session which if the testimony is to
be believed government lawyers view as a violation of the 1890
Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Clark has described this (memo) as a moment of weakness,''
Barksdale said on the witness stand in his flat Mississippi twang.
``Netscape was burning through money and not making much cash and I
think Mr. Clark was looking to get Microsoft to make an
investment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the trial, Netscape attorney Christine Varney
said Clark had written the memo in a moment of desperation. ``It
was the end of the year, they were out of money and at 3:00 a.m.,''
she said. ``Microsoft rebuffed him the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Also outside the courtroom, David Boies, the government's lead
counsel, called Warden's move ``another attempt by Microsoft to
change the subject because that is a subject that Microsoft doesn't
like.''
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand Barksdale, asked if he regarded Clark as
``a truthful man,'' replied: ``I regard him as a salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to touch that one, Mr. Barksdale,'' Warden said
to the witness, whose 5 million shares in Netscape are currently
worth about $100 million.

TEXAS NUCLEAR DUMP APPEARS TO BE IN DANGER OF REJECTION  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas environmental regulators take a final vote
Thursday on an embattled and politically charged proposal to build
a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility in the West Texas
desert community of Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the site less than 20 miles from Mexico would serve
as a permanent graveyard for contaminated items from nuclear power
plants in Texas, Vermont and Maine, as well as waste from hospitals
and universities in Houston and other Texas cities.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the vote, the proposal appeared to be in
danger of rejection, due to the site's geological instability and
proximity to Mexico. And political implications hung over the issue
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, political operatives have said that approval of
the Sierra Blanca site could hurt Gov. George W. Bush's
gubernatorial re-election bid and might harm his presidential
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission are Bush appointees, and the governor is being pressured
by Mexican officials to lean on the panel to reject the Sierra
Blanca site.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said the decision is in the hands of appointed
regulators, who should make their decision based on science, not
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize their fervent opposition to the Sierra Blanca site,
anti-nuclear protesters from Mexico and the United States held a
vigil outside the commission offices on Wednesday, as well as at
the Texas Capitol and Governor's Mansion. One protester, dressed as
the grim reaper, carried around a black barrel marked radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   Similar events are expected Thursday when protesters,
politicians and reporters from Mexico fill the normally sedate
commission meeting room for the morning meeting. The panel will
only hear final legal arguments from the state, public counsel,
proponents and opponents. Commission members would not discuss the
case publicly before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Houston operators of an existing storage site 200
miles to the northeast are mobilizing to offer their dump as an
alternative. Operated by Waste Control Specialists of Houston, the
Andrews County site is ``the answer to all the drawbacks that the
Hudspeth County site has,'' said Lloyd Eisenrich, one of the
proponents. He said it could accommodate the radioactive waste in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities, hospitals and other groups supporting the Sierra
Blanca site on Wednesday were steadfast in their backing of the
proposal, which calls for digging deep trenches and lining them
with concrete to store huge concrete canisters of waste.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Selig, manager of Advocates for Responsible Disposal in
Texas, said his group of waste-producing entities, including
Houston Lighting &AMP; Power, remained hopeful the commission would
grant the license for Sierra Blanca. The commission will be
considering its own staff's conclusion, after four years of study,
that the site is safe, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agreed that scientifically, geologically and
hydrologically, it will be a safe facility,'' Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with approval, ``there are still some significant
challenges that lie ahead,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have threatened to file suit if the license is
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's major political parties decided this week to prepare a
complaint against the United States to be filed in the World Court
in The Hague. The complaint would allege violations of the North
American Free Trade Agreement and an international pact on
environmental controls known as the La Paz agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sierra Blanca site is rejected, the 17-year-old debate
over where to safely store hazardous waste would be tossed back to
the Legislature.

FORMER COMMUNIST SWORN IN AS ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Massimo D'Alema was sworn in Wednesday as Italy's prime
minister and appointed an eclectic Cabinet that has something for
everyone: Communists, conservatives, and six women _ twice the
number who served under the departing prime minister, Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, 49, who will head Italy's 56th government since the end
of World War II, is the first former Communist selected to become
prime minister of Italy. If in the coming days Parliament approves
his Cabinet, he will be the only former Communist to head a major
Western European country.
</P>
<P>
   But his is not a solidly leftist government by any means. Among
other compromises, D'Alema was forced to name to such key
ministries as Defense and Communications supporters of Francesco
Cossiga, a former Christian Democrat who now leads a small
center-right party.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 17 parties in Parliament. Seven are
represented in the new government, eight if Prodi's Olive Tree
coalition is included.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's effort to forge across-the-board allegiances to secure
a majority signals a classic Italian paradox: a government whose
stated goal is the introduction of a two-party system is itself a
mirror of the patchwork quilt of small, constantly mutating parties
that is the source of Italy's chronic political instability.
D'Alema, who tried and failed to pass reforms in Parliament this
year, has already pledged to make electoral reform a top priority.
Many Italians wonder how he will manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that so heterogeneous a coalition
will be prepared to reform the electoral system,'' said Sergio
Romano, a former diplomat and political expert. ``Too many people
behind this government, like Cossiga, thrive on the very system of
proportionality that the reform is supposed to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Cossiga, 70, is distrusted by both left and
right in Italy. Having survived the collapse of the old political
system dominated by the Christian Democrats, of which he was a
leader, he created the Union of Democrats for the Republic six
months ago and is now a key power broker.
</P>
<P>
   Cossiga navigates noisily from one political side to another.
While Cossiga was president of Italy in 1991, D'Alema's party
sought to have him impeached. Cossiga's new bond with D'Alema has
infuriated his former allies in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall see how men who only yesterday insulted and attacked
each other can stay clasped together in a grab for power,'' said
Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon and former conservative prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, Italians are waiting to see how the Communists
and Cossiga's men will clash at Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Some government priorities, like passing a 1999 budget that
allows Italy to meet the requirements for joining a single European
currency in January, seem widely shared and well within reach.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema reappointed the two top economic ministers who are
credited with helping Prodi trim Italy's bloated economy and
qualify for membership in the euro last spring: Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi will stay on as treasury and budget minister, and Vincenzo
Visco will continue as finance minister. Italy's respected foreign
minister, Lamberto Dini, was also reappointed.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has already said he will present the same budget to
Parliament that caused Prodi's center-left government to collapse
two weeks ago. Fausto Bertinotti, general secretary of the Marxist
Communist Refounding party, withdrew his support from Prodi over
budget disputes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Bertinotti's intransigence quickly split his own party. A
more moderate faction led by Armando Cossutta, unwilling to be
blamed for sabotaging the first center-left government in 50 years,
split off, forming yet another small leftist party, the Italian
Communists' Party. A week ago, Cossutta vowed that he could never
join forces with Cossiga. He relented, and his party was rewarded
with the Justice Ministry and the Ministry of Regional Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are new faces, like Giovanna Melandri, 36, a member of
D'Alema's Democratic Party of the Left, who was named minister of
culture and sports, and Enrico Letta, 32, a member of the Popular
Party, who will take over European Affairs and is the youngest
member of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema also brought back Giuliano Amato, 60, a former prime
minister and one of the few Socialist leaders who escaped unscathed
from the scandals that toppled former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi,
who is now living in exile in Tunisia. Amato was awarded a newly
revived post, minister of institutional reform, which includes
drafting new electoral laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have found a balance between the need for political
representation that exists in a coalition government and personal
competence and quality,'' D'Alema said of his Cabinet.

BARTOK AND STRAVINSKY: ODD COUPLE REUNITED? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(af) 
Richard Taruskin is the author of ``Stravinsky and the Russian
Traditions.'' 
 By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
  ``I never could share his lifelong gusto for his native
folklore,'' said Igor Stravinsky of Bela Bartok in 1959. And what
is more, ``I couldn't help regretting it in the great musician.''
Stravinsky was seeking distance from a composer with whom, he felt,
he was too often compared.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Friday evenings, the Hungarian pianist Andras
Schiff, the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest
Festival Orchestra bring their countryman and the latter's
unwilling Russian counterpart back together at Carnegie Hall,
setting Bartok's three piano concertos in what the performers
evidently consider their proper Stravinskian context. It's about
time.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's declaration about Bartok wasn't made under oath, so
it may not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. But like
most of what the aging composer told his many interlocutors, it was
a half-truth at best.
</P>
<P>
   By 1959, a dozen years into the Cold War, Stravinsky was
following the herd and trying to establish credentials as a 12-tone
composer. That meant seeking the ``universal'' (and politically
safe) truth of numbers to validate his art, rather than the
particular (and politically risky) reality of nation.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian living in America might have had especially strong
reasons just then to repudiate his national heritage, but
Stravinsky's reasons went farther back, to his years as a ``white
emigre'' in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, lecturing in French at Harvard University, the Parisian
Stravinsky went out of his way to deride the ``dancing collective
farm'' and the ``symphony of Socialism.'' These were the musical
emblems, popularized by Shostakovich, of the Red Russia Stravinsky
abhorred, where an art ``national in form and Socialist in
content'' (in Stalin's words) was official, enforceable cultural
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Stravinsky originally made his name as a staff composer for
Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, purveying music that positively
dripped with native folklore. He continued to write in this vein
until the early 1920s, when it became clear that the Bolsheviks
were there to stay and he could never go home again. His
extraordinary knack for blending folklore and modernism was an
inspiration to many composers, Bartok most of all.
</P>
<P>
   A practicing ``comparative musicologist'' (as ethnomusicologists
were known in those days) and a matchless connoisseur of not only
Hungarian but many kinds of folk music, Bartok was convinced of the
authenticity of Stravinsky's folk sources. And that, he believed,
was what gave Stravinsky's modernism its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   In a lecture of 1943 (also, as it happened, given at Harvard),
he asserted flat out that Stravinsky's Diaghilev ballets were based
on ``Russian peasant music,'' and that in the most modernistic of
them, ``The Rite of Spring,'' the peasant influence was most
pervasive of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the motives'' in that ballet, Bartok said, ``seem
to be Russian peasant music motives or their excellent
imitations.'' And what is more, it was precisely the most novel
aspects of Stravinsky's music, its form and rhythm, that were most
heavily indebted to folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the origin of the rough-grained, brittle and jerky
musical structure backed by ostinatos,'' Bartok marveled, ``which
is so completely different from any structural proceeding of the
past, may be sought in the short-breathed Russian peasant
motives.''
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky fairly screamed denial until the day he died, but
Bartok was right. We now know that at least a dozen themes in ``The
Rite'' (besides the opening bassoon melody, the one acknowledged
borrowing) came from published folk song anthologies, and we'll
never know how many more may have come from oral tradition. So sure
was Bartok of Stravinsky's fidelity to the folk that he actually
thought he needed to defend the possibility that ``among the
thematic material of Stravinsky's there are some of his own
invention.'' However Stravinsky might have winced, this was meant
as highest praise.
</P>
<P>
   Bartok did not live to witness or react to the Cold War, but he
suffered its consequences posthumously. His legacy, which drew its
authenticity in his own eyes from its seamless Stravinskian blend
of folklore and modernism, was ruthlessly partitioned, like Europe
itself, into Eastern and Western zones.
</P>
<P>
   In his homeland, the works in which folklore was perceived to
predominate were touted by the culture politicians as obligatory
models, and the rest was anathematized or, in some cases, banned.
</P>
<P>
   The Western European avant-garde, meanwhile, made virtual
fetishes of aggressively modernistic works like the Third and
Fourth String Quartets, and accused the composer of the late but
audience-friendly Concerto for Orchestra of ``compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of World War II, that word _ applied to Bartok
by Rene Leibowitz, an early mentor of Pierre Boulez, in an infamous
article of 1947 _ had a chilling ring. Never let it be said again
that modern music evolved in lofty or innocent detachment from
modern politics.
</P>
<P>
   But it's yesterday's politics. It lives on in pockets of
superannuated opinion like Washington think tanks and academic
music departments, but if we don't want Bartok and Stravinsky to
become yesterday's music, we need to put their work in new
contexts, like the one Schiff and Fischer are proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Each of their programs will feature a Bartok concerto or two as
centerpiece, flanked on one side by one of Stravinsky's later,
ostensibly cosmopolitan works (Symphony in Three Movements on
Wednesday, ``Jeu de Cartes'' on Friday) and on the other by a
folkloric ballet (``Firebird'' Suite and ``Petrouchka'').
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky, you might say, will provide the antitheses, Bartok
the synthesis. It's a neat idea. And when ``Petrouchka'' follow's
Bartok's Second Concerto, which practically quotes from it (and
from ``Firebird'' as well), but in a decidedly ``Neo-Classical''
context, the idea is bound to hit home.
</P>
<P>
   All the labels we customarily apply in our efforts to sort out
the politics (er, styles) of modern music are arbitrary, simplistic
and in their origins invidious. Juxtapositions like the ones Schiff
and Fischer will offer invite us to approach the crosscurrents of
20th-century taste and idiom with less prejudice and a heightened
awareness of the complex interaction of the personal and the
political.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pity, though, that Schiff is not going to perform
Stravinsky's Concerto for Piano and Winds alongside Bartok's First
Concerto, because that would have been the most ear-opening
juxtaposition of all. The concertos were composed two years apart,
Bartok's under the strong impression not only of Stravinsky's score
but also of Stravinsky's performance of it as pianist in Budapest
in March 1926.

SENATE APPROVES FINAL SPENDING BILL, BRINGS 105TH CONGRESS TO AN
END 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a final spending bill for
fiscal 1998 Wednesday, bringing the 105th Congress to an end and
sending members home to face the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 65-29 brought the bill worth nearly $600 billion to
President Clinton, who signed it before a fifth stopgap funding
measure was set to expire at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure that included eight of the 13
major appropriations bills Tuesday night on a 333-95 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although members on both sides of the aisle squawked about the
massive size of the bill, in the end it proved too much for most of
them to resist because of the political pork that could help in
their re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   From roadways to historic preservation projects, nearly every
incumbent, regardless of party, was able to claim something for the
folks back home or the special interests who help finance
campaigns. The spending ranged from the vital to the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The vital included a $1.9 billion increase in funding for the
National Institutes of Health. A lot of that money will end up
going to Houston medical facilities, where research on cancer and
other diseases will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The absurd included a provision added at the last minute by
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that would lengthen the
duck-hunting season in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The special interest items in the budget angered a lot of new
members, especially conservative Republicans who said they ran for
Congress hoping to change the traditional way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from they call that pig-picking. Forty pounds of
pork and everybody trying to pull off a piece,'' is the way Rep.
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., described the final bill which weighed in
at nearly 45 pounds and stacked up at almost 2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senators opposed the measure because it was hammered
together at the last minute by Clinton, Lott and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., for example, said the
process resembled a ``bastard parliamentary system'' with the final
decisions being made ``in a closed room by three or four people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators were cut out of the last-minute negotiations,
which began after the House and Senate passed only two of the 13
major appropriations bills needed to fund government by the Oct. 1
start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Some members, including Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,
complained about the $20 billion in so-called emergency spending
for defense projects, the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and aid to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was certainly disappointed in both the process and the
product,'' said Gramm spokesman Larry Neal, noting the oddity of
placing the Bosnia peacekeeping mission, which Congress has funded
for the last three years, in the category of emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, Texas, joined Gramm and four
other Texas House members in voting against the bill because he
said it would ``consume one-third of the expected (budget)
surplus'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money should have gone first to preserving Social Security
and, with what's left over, providing tax relief to help families
make ends meet,'' Brady added.
</P>
<P>
   The measure includes nearly $1.2 billion in additional education
money for hiring new public school teachers, $18 billion for the
International Monetary Fund, $10 billion for building a missile
defense system, nearly $6 billion in drought and flood relief for
farmers. The bill covers just about every government department.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of the largest states, Texas won big in the budget
negotiations. For example, the state will reap about $97.2 million
this fiscal year for hiring new teachers and reducing class sizes.
Only California and New York will receive more.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of the $7.2 billion earmarked for border patrol,
immigration and drug enforcement efforts will also end up in Texas
and the other Mexico border states.
</P>
<P>
   Texas youth will benefit from the $871 million summer jobs
program included in the budget. The money will help employ about
41,000 of the state's most disadvantaged young people next summer,
including about 5,000 from the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   The failure pass spending bills by by Oct. 1 was due primarily
to a loose work schedule and disagreements among conservative and
moderate GOP members over legislative priorities and policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's threatened vetoes of some bills and Democratic
delaying tactics complicated matters even more. But some GOP
members said it was the pressure from the Republican conservative
and Christian right elements that helped tie Congress up by knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent time fighting battles we had already lost on
abortion, school prayer and other conservative issues ... (that)
could have been spent on things we had a chance (of passing),''
said one disgruntled GOP member.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that many elements of the so-called ``family values
agenda'' went down to defeat was not lost on leaders of the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the Senate vote, Christian
broadcaster Dr. James Dobson, blasted the Republican leadership for
failing to deliver on the promises they made conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson chastised Lott by name for having what he called a
``stunning lack of commitment to families.'' He also criticized
Gingrich for not working hard enough to eliminate funding for
Planned Parenthood and other family-planning programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there just aren't enough true conservatives in
Washington,'' he said. &QL;

 UNDATED: March 1926.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Bartok scholar David Schneider has recently demonstrated
in fascinating detail, Bartok found Stravinsky's work at once
irresistible and repellent. The tension this ambivalent reaction
created in him was one of the most powerful stimulants he ever
received. It roused him from a three-year creative block and led
him to his maturest style.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's concerto was the bellwether of its uprooted
composer's ``objective'' or ``Neo-Classical'' manner. It spoke (or
tried to speak) neither Russian nor any other particular dialect
but rather a musical Esperanto, its vocabulary laced with
references to Bach, the perceived fountainhead of ``universal'' or
``timeless'' values.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Bartok's wife to his mother about Stravinsky's
performance expressed serious reservations about this project. ``We
very, very much enjoyed the evening,'' she wrote. ``Truly one gets
caught up in his miraculously beautiful-sounding machine music,
music of pulsating rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a music in which ``there is absolutely no room for
feelings, in which you can find no part that causes tears to come
to your eyes.'' In short, she wrote, ``this music is not my
homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartok saw it as his task to reconcile that dynamic pulsation,
in which he sensed the lingering reverberations of Stravinsky's
earlier manner, with a sense of homeland that would restore the
missing feelings and tears. The First Concerto, the most direct
emulation the pianist-composer Bartok could have offered the
pianist-composer Stravinsky, was the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The love-hate relationship with Stravinsky is manifest at all
levels of the concerto's form and substance, from reflexive
near-quotations on the surface to profound transformations in which
Stravinsky's monumental abstract rhythmic gearshifts are morphed
into what Laszlo Somfai, the leading Hungarian Bartok scholar,
calls ``Hungarian culmination points'': sudden heavy infusions of
national style at an abruptly broadened tempo. Hearing the two
concertos side by side would have been electrifying.
</P>
<P>
   And so it would have been to hear Bartok's Concerto for
Orchestra alongside Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements. The
Third Piano Concerto, composed in America just before Bartok's
death, will be a serviceable stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   It, too, will make the point that the war years brought a new
urgency of communication to the work of both composers, and a sense
of social solidarity that mitigated their earlier commitment to
modernism. But whereas the piano concerto makes the point serenely
and perhaps a bit sentimentally, the Concerto for Orchestra retains
a characteristic Bartokian ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   That ambivalence is heard most clearly in the famous put-down of
Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony that ``interrupts'' the concerto's
fourth movement. When overdone (or when politically mandated),
Bartok seems to imply, even urgent communication and sincere social
commitment can turn destructive and lead art into blatancy and
banality. The exiled Hungarian seems here to be echoing the exiled
Russian's contempt for ``symphonies of Socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   But interestingly enough, the Symphony in Three Movements shows
Stravinsky himself coming perilously close to writing a Socialist
Realist score at the prompting of wartime emotion. Much of it
sounds like movie music. And indeed, much of it was. The second
movement was written on spec for the 1943 film ``The Song of
Bernadette'' (20th Century Fox wasn't buying; the job went to
Alfred Newman), and the third, by Stravinsky's own admission, was
an imaginary newsreel soundtrack to accompany scenes of battle and
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky even recovered a sense of Russian patriotism in
wartime Hollywood. A couple of scores from the mid-1940s secretly
quote Russian folk tunes, and the scoring of the Symphony in Three
Movements pays covert homage to Glinka. Its first movement features
a piano obbligato. In the second, a solo harp holds forth. In the
third, the two solo instruments play in tandem, producing a silvery
tinkle in which any Russian opera lover will recognize the
evocation of the minstrel's ``gusli'' (a Russian folk psaltery) in
the Prologue to ``Ruslan and Ludmila,'' that great national epic of
heroic deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky, as we know, lapsed quickly back into modernist
respectability and social indifference. In the 50s, he suffered a
Schoenberg crisis as profound and transforming as Bartok's
Stravinsky crisis had been in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Few, though, would claim today that he weathered his crisis as
successfully as Bartok had done, or that his capitulation to
historical determinism was less damaging a ``compromise'' than
Bartok's reconciliation with the public.
</P>
<P>
   By now it is obvious that there were envy and repressed
repentance in the barbs he hurled not only at Bartok but at all and
sundry in his late memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Bartok ended his career in a state of neglect and seeming
weakness. In the Third Concerto's slow movement, written literally
on his deathbed, he wistfully paraphrased Beethoven's ``Heiliger
Dankgesang,'' the ``Solemn Song of Thanksgiving'' from the A minor
String Quartet, which celebrated a recovery from illness that
Bartok knew he would not duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect that he will emerge, at Carnegie Hall this week,
as the stronger, more compelling human presence. If he does, and if
we are able to count his humanity as a musical plus, then the
musical Cold War is truly over.

<P>
   ARVADA, Colo. _ Twenty-five years after an oil embargo proved
that fuel supplies were neither reliable nor endlessly cheap, the
United States has given up nearly all the gains it made in
conserving energy. On average, Americans have returned to consuming
nearly as much energy as ever before.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973, when Arab oil producers choked off their shipments to
the United States, through 1983, the nation reduced its energy
consumption even as the population and economy expanded. Prodded by
higher costs and led on conservation crusades by Presidents Nixon,
Ford and Carter, Americans learned to do more with less.
</P>
<P>
   That effort is still yielding substantial benefits. Owners of
older buildings and homes installed thicker insulation and tighter
windows. As technology improved, every new home, factory and car
came with far more efficient appliances, machines and engines than
in the 1970s. But energy demand has risen so much since the
mid-1980s that, next year, the Energy Department predicts,
consumption per person will come to within 2 percent of the peak in
1973, before any of these energy-saving advances had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Declining energy prices _ now lower in real terms than before
the first embargo _ have made the difference. In the
dollar-a-gallon era, why spend much time or money saving a gallon
or a watt?
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the more energy-intensive lifestyle is everywhere.
Since the early 1970s, as the average household has shrunk by a
sixth, the average new home has grown by a third. Even moderately
priced homes are now stuffed with energy-hungry features, from
central air-conditioning to Jacuzzis and security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Look at families like T.C. and Michael McCracken and their
year-old daughter, Lydia. The McCrackens, avid hikers, are far more
willing than most Americans to shop for energy-saving appliances or
ride the bus to work. But here in Arvada, outside Denver, standard
features of their nearly completed tract home include ceilings so
high that overhead fans, finding a new season and purpose, are
required in winter to blow rising heat back down. With 2,600 square
feet to fill, McCracken plans to install a home office, a home
theater and a home brewery fed by its own gas line. What Mrs.
McCracken calls a ``killer kitchen'' has all the standard
appliances and the electrical capacity for more than a dozen
others, plus room to seat a family of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Energy use is rising even faster on the roads. Next year,
Americans are expected to burn more fuel per person than in 1973,
before the government began setting efficiency standards for cars.
More families have two earners, and the suburbs continue to sprawl,
so Americans are driving more than ever. As for fuel economy, the
growing popularity of light trucks _ minivans, sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks _ has begun to reverse two decades of
efficiency gains.
</P>
<P>
   The daily hour to hour and a half that Mrs. McCracken, a
personnel manager, has spent commuting and running errands in her
Dodge Caravan minivan will stretch by another half-hour once she
moves. And McCracken will put more miles on his sport utility
vehicle, an Isuzu Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate habits are going the same way. Businesses saved more
energy than individuals did through the mid-1980s but have used the
most extra energy ever since. Chemical producers, among the
heaviest energy users, say that in the 1990s they have all but quit
making improvements solely to save energy. Electric utilities are
cutting reimbursements for installing more efficient heating,
cooling, lighting and other equipment at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap, abundant energy has in fact produced great benefits,
fueling an era of rising standards of living and dormant inflation.
Lower demand from Asia has pushed oil prices down even further
lately, with shortages unlikely for years.
</P>
<P>
   Growing energy demand is a natural result. But it conflicts with
the nation's declared goals of reducing dependence on imported oil
and lowering carbon dioxide emissions, thought to cause global
warming. It also requires the nation and its oil companies to spend
billions of dollars laying pipelines through unstable regions,
building drilling platforms in deep seas and defending foreign
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the nation relies more than ever on overseas oil.
Imports account for a record 50 percent of American consumption, up
from 35 percent in 1973. Though a rising share comes from secure
neighbors like Mexico and Venezuela, the United States still gets
about 10 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf, twice the level
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The rising use of fossil fuels has also raised the atmosphere's
level of carbon dioxide. The Clinton administration pledged at a
conference in Kyoto, Japan, last December to cut these emissions.
That is not a simple task, said Daniel Yergin, chairman of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``Environmental concerns
point one way and prices point the other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is now striving to put energy efficiency back
on the nation's agenda. He asked Congress for $6.3 billion over
five years, including $3.6 billion in tax incentives and $2.7
billion for research and development. Accelerating the introduction
of electric cars and other technologies would make energy savings
nearly painless, he argues. Administration officials note that
improving technology has already allowed Americans to live better
with far less energy than they would otherwise use. Since the
mid-1980s, however, these advances have slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporate executives and members of Congress call global
warming a distant peril with uncertain causes. They portray the
administration's plans as a costly threat to the nation's
prosperity. They also discount the danger of rising imports, saying
that free markets will relieve high prices or tight supplies by
promoting increased output and efficiency. In a compromise this
week, Congress allowed $473 million for research this year but
nothing for tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this month, and again in late 1978, that
vengeful Middle Eastern oil exporters squeezed their supplies to
the United States and raised prices worldwide. A nation that was
virtually self-sufficient into the 1950s had become a petroleum
captive. Gasoline prices soared, lines at the pump stretched beyond
frustration and the economy fell into repeated recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans turned down their thermostats and bought
fuel-efficient Hondas, Datsuns and Toyotas. At work, they replaced
millions of inefficient motors, lighting fixtures and generators.
Nixon called for a national effort on the scale of the making of
the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us set as our national goal,'' he said, ``with the
determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this
decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy
needs without depending on any foreign energy source.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, wearing a sweater in a televised speech to drive home
his point, termed energy conservation the equivalent of fighting a
war.
</P>
<P>
   But traumatic memories of oil shocks have long been soothed by
plentiful, low-cost supplies. At about $1 a gallon _ compared with
$1.10, adjusting for inflation, in 1973 _ fuel is as cheap as ever.
U.S. gasoline prices remain less than half those in Western Europe
and Japan, where energy is heavily taxed to discourage overuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that, in the
absence of efforts to curb growing energy use, carbon emissions
from burning fuel will rise 34 percent from 1990 to 2010, while the
president has pledged to lower them by 7 percent. The agency's
experts scoff at the prospects of meeting Clinton's goal unless
energy prices rise significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our actions rather than words, it's evident we
don't care,'' said Dwight French, a specialist on consumption
trends. ``Only the next crisis will again make conservation a
priority. End of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arvada, in the subdivisions carved into the sagebrush
hills of Denver's suburbs, the McCrackens' new home will have far
more efficient heating, air-conditioning and major appliances than
the homes of 25 years ago. Modern weatherstripping and vinyl-sealed
windows will help keep the Colorado cold out and the heat in. In
energy consumption per square foot, the home of the late 1990s is
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But not the overall champion. Since the early 1970s, the average
size of a new home has risen to 2,100 square feet from 1,600, even
as the average household has shrunk to three people from 3.6.
``It's almost like the trend to sport utility vehicles,'' said Donn
Eley, chief financial officer of Village Homes, the McCrackens'
builder. ``They can't build them big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Home builders are also bringing to tract homes the expansive
features once reserved for mansions. ``Wow factors,'' they are
called in the trade. In the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, the
confined quarters of yesteryear just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Larger homes with fewer people but more things to plug in have
pushed home energy consumption back to the levels of the 1970s.
Residential energy consumption per person fell by a tenth from 1973
to 1983 but has since risen about as much.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter federal standards for homes and major appliances promise
to save enough energy over the coming years to offset what goes to
heat and cool larger homes. But then come the computers,
videocassette recorders, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers
that have been using about 5 percent more energy a year since 1990.
Early in the next decade, the Energy Department predicts, such
appliances will consume even more energy than heating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these devices are always on, ready at the push of a
button. Razors and electric toothbrushes have chargers, fax
machines are poised to send and receive, televisions and
videocassette recorders merely go dormant, not off.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these items use more power than a refrigerator.
``They're called vampires,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, a senior
adviser for efficiency at the Energy Department. ``They suck
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Central air-conditioning, in less than 40 percent of new homes
in 1971, is now in more than 80 percent. Dishwashers have gone from
luxuries, found in 19 percent of households in 1970, toward
necessities, found in 57 percent as of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The standard ceiling height has risen to nine feet from eight,
meaning more space to heat and cool. ``Even though the efficiency
of larger homes has improved,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, research
director for the National Association of Home Builders, ``the total
volume, the use of glass, the fireplaces and the appliances lead to
higher energy consumption. They will not buy a home without these
energy-inefficient features.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coloradans who believe weekends were made for hiking and
cross-country skiing, the McCrackens, trim 31-year-olds, say they
would like to live greener. To save water and energy, they plan to
pay about $300 extra for a high-efficiency washer and dryer.
McCracken has even joined the declining 5 percent of Americans who
ride mass transit _ for him a bus _ to his job as a consultant and
programmer for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But their new house, like many today, is another story. Join the
McCrackens in the Wyndham Park subdivision as they open the door to
a 2,600-square-foot model home like the one they are buying nearby
for $270,000. A towering entryway and its clerestory windows tilt
their gazes upward. The two-story, 21-foot spaces continue on into
the living room and the family room, with nine-foot elevations
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about this is the high ceilings,'' Mrs. McCracken
volunteered. ``I know they are terribly inefficient. But it does
make it seem so spacious.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was nodding as Jack Zelkin, a senior marketing
executive with the builder, listed the features. McCracken was
already making plans to take advantage of the upgraded phone, cable
and data wiring, for internal video and computer networks, that
became standard a year ago, even in homes costing less than
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saving energy has become a dormant issue, said Zelkin, who was
once an energy-efficiency expert for the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a tree-hugging, granola-eating, environmental zealot,'' he
said. ``But if you give these buyers a choice between a Jacuzzi tub
or extra insulation, they'll take the Jacuzzi tub every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not only living in spacious new homes. They're
also living in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Lakewood, another Denver suburb, Mrs. McCracken
has driven her minivan about 20 minutes to Golden to drop off her
daughter at day care. Then it is 10 minutes back to her office in
Lakewood, at Harveys Wagon Wheel Hotel/Casino. Or, a couple of
times a week, she drives 20 minutes to the casino itself in Central
City.
</P>
<P>
   After work, Mrs. McCracken reverses the pattern, often adding a
stop at the King Soopers grocery store, the Blockbuster video store
or the cleaner's.
</P>
<P>
   From her new house, it will be 15 minutes more each way, meaning
that she will spend up to two hours in the car every day.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of T.C. McCrackens who have entered the work
force have become a prime factor pushing energy use for travel up
12 percent for each American since 1983, back to the previous peak
in 1978. In 1975, only 47 percent of American women with children
younger than 18 were working or looking for work. By 1997, it was
72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many households have almost enough cars to create their own
traffic jams. Nearly one in five households has three or more cars,
up from about one in 25 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters of both sexes also live farther from work. The average
commuting distance grew by more than a third from 1983 to 1995, to
11.6 miles, even as car-pooling and the use of mass transit
declined.
</P>
<P>
   While covering more miles, Americans are getting fewer miles per
gallon now that they are buying nearly equal numbers of cars and
light trucks. Back in 1975, light trucks accounted for only a fifth
of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are meanwhile becoming more powerful. Automakers that once
concentrated on building leaner, more efficient models have instead
been adding the muscle that customers crave. Average horsepower has
risen to 156 in 1996 from 99 in 1982 _ and the time needed to zoom
from zero to 60 has fallen to 10.7 seconds from 14.4.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president for operations at AAA Colorado, Vickie Stark's
job is to encourage travel. But even she decided she was spending
too much time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, a computer network manager, had followed her in
assignments from Washington to Florida to Cheyenne, Wyo., where
they bought a home north of town. When Ms. Stark got a job in
Denver in 1995, he refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   And so Ms. Stark began driving more than two hours each way, or
127 miles, not counting her monthly one-day round trips to each of
six offices elsewhere around the state.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after she began the long haul from Cheyenne, Ms.
Stark made a habit of calling her husband and two children on her
car phone just as she was passing the exit for Windsor, Colo., the
halfway point. ``If we lived here, I'd be home,'' she always said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, they moved again _ to Windsor. As a family,
they did not save any driving, but they did redistribute it. Her
husband now has a 52-mile trip north, and Ms. Stark a 63-mile trip
south.
</P>
<P>
   All Ms. Stark has sacrificed by moving are bragging rights to
the longest trip to work. Her neighbors next door and just across
the street also work in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, 100-car trains more than a mile long arrive
brimming with coal at the Celanese Ltd. chemical plant near Pampa
in the Texas Panhandle. The trains dump their contents into chutes
that form a pile 10 stories high. Coal dust dances in the flatland
winds.
</P>
<P>
   The coal is burned to boil water, providing the heat for
producing chemicals like acetic acid, which is used in clothing
fibers and plastic parts. The plant also uses enough electricity to
power a city of more than 50,000. In one of the most energy-hungry
industries, Pampa makes chemicals that are twice as energy
intensive per pound as the Celanese average.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which opened in 1952, initially treated energy as if
it were as cheap and plentiful as the air. Steam and heat were
simply vented.
</P>
<P>
   The oil embargoes of the 1970s brought a new outlook. Steam used
in one process was rerouted to other processes. As a result, Pampa
and other Celanese plants raised their energy efficiency 2 percent
to 3 percent a year through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, with lower energy prices reducing the payoffs,
they have improved at less than half those rates, if at all. ``The
emphasis is simply elsewhere these days,'' said Thomas Parker Jr.,
managing director for tax policy and energy at the Chemical
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Across all businesses, industrial and commercial energy use fell
18 percent from 1973 to 1983, then jumped 37 percent by 1997. The
growing corporate appetite for energy comes despite the economy's
shift from smokestack industries like steelmaking to software and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Managers in many industries say they achieved the easiest energy
savings long ago. ``We picked the low-hanging fruit first, in the
'70s and '80s,'' emphasized Edward Quick, the environmental manager
for Celanese. ``As we move into the 1990s, we're finding the
available technology much more costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Amory Lovins, whose Rocky Mountain Institute promotes energy
efficiency, will hear none of it. He rattles off a half-dozen
technologies like computerized controls that he says the chemical
plants have failed to adequately exploit. ``When the Celanese guys
say you're running out of low-hanging fruit, the only thing I can
say, based on the experience of people in this industry, is that
the fruit is bushing up around our ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Riley Kothmann, who runs the Pampa plant, has some ready
answers. His tour includes a room where walls of dials and meters
have been succeeded by banks of computer screens and controls.
</P>
<P>
   But at times, it seems, fruit from higher branches drops on
plant supervisors' heads. Even without reaching for energy savings,
they find, the savings often land on them.
</P>
<P>
   Compelled by law to contain emissions, Pampa's technicians found
that those emissions could go back through a turbine to raise the
plant's electricity production by nearly 10 percent. Or there was
the time three or four years ago when managers began wrapping
insulation around the joints where pipes are bolted together.
``Pampa just had a tradition of not doing it,'' Kothmann said.
``It's so much easier to continue doing things the way you used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the goals of the Kyoto treaty for reducing emissions,
Celanese executives say they would have to improve their energy
efficiency by 3 percent a year through 2010, or as rapidly as in
the '70s and '80s. All the technology they know of cannot meet that
goal unless they cut production, said R. David Damron, the
company's director for government affairs. If Washington insists,
he said, ``you're going to stifle growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Celanese is still hedging. In early June, a company energy
committee was assigned to find ways of meeting the goals, whatever
the costs. The next step probably will be to find ways of doing the
suggested projects at manageable costs. Kothmann, a member of the
committee, recalls that environmental controls expected to cost
$800 million a few years ago were delivered for less than $300
million. ``Our experience has shown that we can achieve much more
for much less than we anticipated it costing us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy use is rising in corporate offices as well as plants.
Like homes, they have far more efficient heating, lighting and
cooling, but also far more electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Electric utilities have cut their support for installing more
efficient equipment to $1.9 billion in 1996 from $2.7 billion in
1994. They say they cannot afford these programs in the competitive
new era of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and most of
Westchester County, N.Y., cut its efficiency program to $31 million
last year from $125 million in 1993 and has now eliminated it.
Customers had been rewarded for deeds like installing more
efficient appliances and compact fluorescent light bulbs instead of
standard incandescents.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, Con Ed, with state backing, plans to spend $25
million to $30 million a year on programs including low-cost loans
for companies to develop more efficient electrical products and
incentives to help them sell these products more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``For less of an incentive per light bulb, appliance or motor,
you can get a lot more in energy savings,'' contended Stephen
Pertusiello, the company's program manager for market
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York State Public
Service Commission from 1987 to 1995, said Con Ed's case was at
best uncertain. ``You are replacing a known and proven set of
programs with speculation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents going back to Richard Nixon have tried to arrest the
nation's growing energy use. In the face of the 1973 oil embargo,
he urged the nation to turn down its thermostats, form car pools
and more. He announced that December that the lights on the
national Christmas tree would be kept off. The next month, he
signed the Emergency Highway Conservation Act, setting a speed
limit of 55 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The first fuel-efficiency standards for cars took effect in
1975, requiring the average to double, to 27.5 miles a gallon, over
a decade. By 1977, Jimmy Carter was promoting the search for
renewable sources of energy like sunlight, wind, wood and wastes.
He called his conservation campaign ``the moral equivalent of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1978 and 1979, another round of production cuts by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, compounding
shortages caused by American price controls and regional
allocations, brought the gas lines back. More than half the
nation's gas stations were closed during the first summer weekend
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As gasoline climbed by 1981 to $2.05 a gallon in today's
dollars, the nation began its most successful peacetime
conservation effort. Americans used 43 percent less energy for
every dollar of gross domestic product in 1986 than at the peak in
1972. From 1987 through last year, energy use per dollar of output
declined by only an additional 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, OPEC was in disarray and energy prices had
declined. Reagan cut back conservation and renewable-energy
programs. The rural speed limit was raised to 65 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This decade brought a reminder that foreign oilfields have their
risks. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 provoked a stock market
selloff and a run-up in energy costs that contributed to the
decade's only recession, the third in a row that came after oil
supplies were pinched.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, taking office in 1993, asked Congress to raise taxes on
all fuels, including coal, by the equivalent of a dime a gallon. He
got 4.3 cents on motor fuels only. In 1995, Congress repealed the
national speed limits, and most states set their own at 65, 70 or
even 75.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Clinton has sought to make energy efficiency
a renewed national priority. But to keep down the costs of reducing
emissions, the United States plans to achieve only about a quarter
of the required reductions itself. The trading of emissions rights
would allow America to pay other nations to achieve the rest.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the White House wants to promote advances in electric
cars, renewable energy and the like. ``My gut is, we will see the
introduction of these new technologies very quickly,'' said Ernest
Moniz, the under secretary of energy, whose responsibilities
include the efficiency programs. With much of the technology
already available, he said, ``We're not waiting for some magic
bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have portrayed the Kyoto accord as a
dangerous effort to shape energy policy by raising false
environmental fears. It leaves out developing nations, they say,
and by requiring drastic energy savings, it threatens the United
States with job losses resulting from much higher costs than the
administration acknowledges. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who led the
Senate's delegation to Kyoto, says that for all the risks of
growing dependence on imported oil, ``The answer is not just to say
we're going to lower everybody's standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such opposition, Clinton has not yet sought
Senate ratification, saying that he, too, wants to include
developing nations. But Europe and Japan are clamoring for the
United States to take action, and the administration has promised
to submit the treaty next year.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation is now so unpopular that its advocates shun the
label. ``Use the term efficiency,'' said Lovins at his Rocky
Mountain Institute headquarters in Old Snowmass, Colo.
``Conservation to a third of Americans means doing less, worse or
without. It means privation, discomfort and curtailment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cause of energy conservation has a last, remote redoubt,
it is his stone-and-glass compound 7,100 feet high on the western
flanks of the Continental Divide. There, he shows off an indoor
tropical forest, luxuriant with pink and yellow bougainvillea and a
banana tree that has yielded 26 crops. Despite temperatures as low
as 47 degrees below zero, he has no heating bills and no furnace.
Instead, he has triple weatherstripping and heat-trapping windows
and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Technological efficiencies, or what Lovins calls negawatts, can
capture energy far more cheaply, in his view, than spending
billions to build more power plants or produce more oil from remote
or politically volatile regions.
</P>
<P>
   With energy prices so low, however, some in Washington say that
high demand is only a sign that free markets are working in
everyone's best interests. ``Those who have an energy fetish argue
that saving energy is more important than saving money or time,''
said Fred Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute
there. Low energy prices allow more people to afford
air-conditioning and cars, he says. ``If we raise the price of
energy, we will push some people back onto the buses.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as open-heart surgery is far more traumatic than
regular exercise and a low-fat diet, other experts say that an
abrupt response to another oil shock or environmental crisis could
make the earlier discipline of gradual energy savings seem mild.
</P>
<P>
   For Joseph Romm, who until recently ran the Energy Department's
efficiency programs, it is only a question of when the nation will
return to conservation, not if. Contending that the world's oil
supplies will eventually tighten and temperatures rise, he said,
``Ten years or 15 years from now, people will be desperate to take
action.''

GLOBAL DISTRESS TAKES TOLL ON CITIGROUP RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup Inc., the world's largest financial
services company, Wednesday reported a 65 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings, reflecting the impact of trading losses in
volatile global markets this summer that offset strength in its
domestic consumer businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The results of $729 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, for
the three months ended Sept. 30 was close to analysts' expectations
of 29 cents a share. Comparable earnings from the year earlier were
$2.1 billion, or 96 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 8, Citigroup estimated that it would report earnings of
$700 million for the quarter after it suffered hundreds of millions
of dollars of trading losses from the slump in financial markets,
particularly in Russia and developing counties.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup was created by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers
Inc., announced in April this year and completed at the end of last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real message here is the global consumer business seems to
be doing quite well,'' even as the firm ``absorbs the body blows on
the capital markets side of the business,'' said Judah Kraushaar, a
banking analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like putting all this Russia, emerging markets aside,
the underlying businesses are either OK or have yet to
deteriorate,'' said John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide, a
financial services consulting firm in New York. ``Behind some of
these dramatic losses _ these events of biblical proportions _ are
some strong businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Citigroup tried to take the third-quarter
earnings slump in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed with the results,'' Sanford
Weill, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, said in an
interview Wednesday. But, Weill added, he and his colleagues are
encouraged by the continuing strong performance in their consumer
businesses and by the helpful steps taken by governments in recent
weeks to stabilize international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Weill cited congressional agreement to provide further funding
to the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve's second
interest rate cut, which he said showed clear understanding of the
liquidity problems in markets, and Japan's plan to inject more than
$500 billion to help to revive its troubled banking system.
</P>
<P>
   But Weill cautioned that the fourth quarter was not proving to
be easy. ``I think we're still going to have lingering problems in
the fourth quarter, but they won't be of the same kind of degree as
the third quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the turmoil has necessarily been bad for the company,
Weill added, saying that it had caused some depositors to turn to
larger institutions, like Citibank, the company's bank subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Weill also said that the combined company was well positioned to
take advantage of more difficult markets. The combined firm's
equity strength, he said, would ``prove very useful'' as Citigroup
came across opportunities to expand its own businesses or acquire
other firms in markets that have been hard hit by the recent
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with analysts Wednesday, Weill and his co-chairman
and co-chief executive, John Reed, set out how they were cutting
costs to reposition the firm for the changes in financial markets,
according to some who attended.
</P>
<P>
   In reply to analysts' questions, the two financial leaders
played up the potential for revenue growth and the benefits from
cross-marketing insurance, banking and brokerage products at the
newly combined firm.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also told analysts that results for 1999 should look
good compared with those for 1997, according to Joan Solotar, a
banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, who said that the
leaders had projected a 15 percent average growth rate for the next
five years. &QL;

SOME BRAZILIAN WORKERS MAY BE PAID PARTLY IN GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In normal times, even before the Christmas
decorations go up, Nilton Silveira knows how he will spend the
extra month's salary that comes at the end of each year. There are
the presents for his wife and two children. There is the tree, with
tinsel glistening like rain. There is the 26-hour bus ride to see
family in Bahia, the only chance the children get to know their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Silveira, who works in a glove factory, fears
there will be only gloves _ and scrambling like a beggar, and
foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Silveira, 43, is employed by Alpha Glove Industries, a small
company that is struggling, like thousands of Brazilian businesses,
through a sudden recession brought on by the financial crisis
jarring many emerging market nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a move reminiscent of the far more devastating breakdown in
Russia, companies in Sao Paulo, the industrial nerve center of
Brazil, are floating the idea of paying workers like Silveira their
13th month's salary in products instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   While Silveira's employers have not actually proposed paying him
in gloves, the local newspapers have been full of stories
suggesting that such payment ideas are in the works, and the matter
is dominating workers' conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do us any good to receive products,'' said
Silveira, whose family scrapes by on his $300 a month, and on the
sewing his wife takes in. ``You'd have to know how to resell the
goods, but I have no idea how to do that. That's what the company
is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Couri, president of the Association of Small Industries
in Sao Paulo, said that with access to credit shrinking, companies
might not have much choice but to pay workers in products instead
of cash at the end of the year. ``It's a real possibility,'' he
said, ``because the financial system is highly selective, interest
rates are high and there's a great difficulty in gaining access to
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13th month's salary is not a bonus, but a legally mandated
payment due all workers. Employers pay salaries on a monthly basis
in Brazil, but because the payments cover four weeks, the 13th
payment at the end of the year compensates for the extra days each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's plight is not nearly as severe as Russia's, where the
trade in, say, shoes for shirts, has replaced cash as the dominant
form of commerce in parts of the country. And unlike in Russia,
barter is being proposed only for the 13th-month payment in Brazil,
not for full salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The political leadership here is poised to announce a $20
billion austerity package that should bring down spending and raise
revenue. The government retains good relations with an array of
international lending agencies led by the International Monetary
Fund, which has promised to release a package of aid for Brazil
that will likely total around $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with two rounds of national elections this month, the
government has delayed spelling out the painful measures it must
use to bring Brazil in from the financial brink, and the nation's
financial position remains shaky. This week, J.P. Morgan ranked
Brazil as the fourth-riskiest country for doing business, after
Russia, Indonesia and Ecuador _ all of which have devalued
currencies or defaulted on foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs to think about how to survive,'' said Roberto
Faldini, a board member of the Industrial Federation of Sao Paulo.
``It's a possible solution to the lack of money for the company and
the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials, led by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
have held fast to a commitment not to devalue the currency, the
real, which means ``royal'' in Portuguese. The Real Plan's success
in cutting inflation to its current 3 percent a year from 36
percent a month in 1994 delivered Cardoso the presidency in 1994
and won him re-election earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brasilia, the capital, argue that the country's
exchange-rate policy, which allows the currency to gradually fall
in value around 7.5 percent a year within an exchange-rate band,
allows flexibility without instability. They insist that any
devaluation, given Brazil's history, would bring back indexing and
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think Brazil can have 10 percent inflation and it will stop
there is completely wrong,'' said Demosthenes Madureira do Pinho,
head of international relations at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Economists who propose a policy permitting moderate inflation,
notably Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, are misguided,
Pinho argues. ``What they're saying is `I don't know that country's
reality; I don't know anything about Brazil,''' Pinho said.
</P>
<P>
   But an important consequence of the decision not to formally
devalue is a recession that is hitting Sao Paulo especially hard.
Without devaluing, the government had to raise the ceiling on
interbank loan rates to 50 percent to defend the currency, choking
off credit for industrial expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Business loans, available only to the most creditworthy, are
running 40 percent to 50 percent a year, while consumer lending
rates exceed 120 percent. The overvalued currency is shrinking the
market for exports. The current account deficit, a broad gauge of
trade in goods and services, is running at 4 percent of the gross
national product, or $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And, Couri said, the government appears to be relying on raising
taxes, including those on businesses and financial transactions, to
make up a substantial portion of the $20 billion it must save next
year to win IMF backing. ``It's the same as raising the cost of
credit for banks, and consequently the same as raising interest
rates,'' he said. ``It runs exactly counter to what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   He said individual companies were reluctant to speak openly of
the difficulties that are pushing them to consider paying workers
with goods. Doing so, they fear, would undermine their standing
with creditors and clients. Faldini of the industrial federation
said companies would work out barter agreements on a case-by-case
basis with workers and unions, perhaps offering only partial
payment in goods.
</P>
<P>
   He described barter as way of meeting obligations to workers,
instead of not paying them, and said it would likely be tried in
consumer-goods industries like textiles, food and toys.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of sending them to court to receive what they need to
receive in three or four years,'' he added, ``there are some
companies that said: `Well, I don't have money. I know I have to
pay the 13th salary, and maybe I cannot sell my merchandise because
of crisis. Why not make an agreement that I would pay part in goods
and part in money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is running at 19 percent in the Sao Paulo area and
8 percent nationally, with some economists predicting an increase
half that again in national unemployment. Workers see the barter
proposal as the harbinger of worse times to come. ``It's the
situation of the country that's in crisis,'' Silveira, the glove
maker, said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have already granted broad concessions in an effort
to avoid layoffs. At car and appliance factories, workers have
agreed to collective vacations and to staying home when they are
not needed on the factory floor, making up the time when demand
picks up. But they say that passing up a month's salary, or
receiving it in screwdrivers or shoes, is beyond the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a humiliation for the worker,'' said Joao Antonio
Felicio, general secretary of the United Workers Center, an
umbrella group of 2,000 unions and 19 million workers throughout
Brazil. ``The companies always take out whatever problems they're
having on the workers.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of employees did not dismiss the proposal out of hand.
Claudio de Souza, 25, who sells stereo equipment and television
sets at the Mappin department store here, said he would not mind
taking his 13th month in goods. Recently married, he had no debts,
and the store sold many items he would buy as Christmas gifts
anyway, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Silveira, worry about ending the year
shortchanged. Over the last four years, business at his factory,
which makes industrial gloves for metal workers, has dropped 40
percent. The work force has shrunk to five from 11. ``We could lose
our jobs because of this crisis,'' he said.

EUROPE'S LARGEST MALL HAS LEIPZIG'S MERCHANTS WORRIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEIPZIG, Germany _ The immense railway terminal in this eastern
German city, erected in the heady years before World War I and
faithfully restored after the destruction of World War II, stands
like a temple to modern transport and commerce. But store owners in
narrow downtown lanes are praying that it will not mean the end of
their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year marked the completion of a two-year, $230 million
overhaul of Europe's largest rail terminus into Europe's largest
shopping mall. Turning train stations into shopping centers is in
vogue, and now in Leipzig 140 stores plus a dozen or so restaurants
line three levels of the station's 845-foot-long main concourse.
</P>
<P>
   So impressive is the finished product, with glass-enclosed
elevators and escalators buzzing shoppers from one level to the
next, that the head of France's national railways, Louis Gallois,
said during a visit that it impressed him, ``like a church, like a
cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   But such hyperbole is little edification for people like
Eva-Maria Bachmann, who runs a quaint book shop in the 16th-century
Old Town Hall, on Market Square, a 10-minute walk from the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the available buying power is not getting
bigger,'' she said. ``Roll the dough ever thinner, and at some
point it tears.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she said, the new stores have benefited from
federal laws that permit shops in train stations to stay open later
and to open on Sundays for ``travelers' supplies,'' while ordinary
stores must close.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Saxony, taking advantage of Bonn's indulgence
toward the economically lagging eastern states, has chosen to
interpret the law unusually generously in the case of the Leipzig
station, which is under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Such tensions are familiar to Americans who have seen again and
again the arrival of a Wal-Mart cripple Main Street merchants. But
in Leipzig, population 430,000, in the heart of eastern Germany,
they assume a special quality. With the region's manufacturing
wiped out by the transformation of old East Germany's economy,
unemployment is 15 percent, said Angelika Rusch-Ziegner, a city
government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   That may be modest in eastern Germany, where some regions suffer
double that level, but the only hope for creating new work in
Leipzig lies ``in the service industries, in banking, and above all
in retail trade,'' said Ms. Rusch-Ziegner, who supported the train
station development.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal project is not the Leipzig area's first push into
shopping malls. After the collapse of Communism in 1989, efforts to
restore the heart of the city were hampered by property disputes.
Much downtown property in Leipzig, a major prewar publishing
center, was owned by Jewish families who perished in the Holocaust,
and tracing heirs has been time consuming. That, coupled with the
low cost of farmland outside the city, led large western German
department store chains to throw up shopping centers in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the train station developers, led by the Deutsche Bank,
Germany's largest bank, argue they have reversed that trend by
creating the first major shopping center downtown. They have
created 800 new jobs, they say, and the rising tide of shoppers
should help lift the boats of shopkeepers all across the city's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view ourselves as a magnet for the downtown area,'' said
Michael Mehnert, a spokesman for the developers. ``If the old city
is strong, we're strong, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   WMF, the big manufacturer of cutlery and household utensils,
appears to agree. Despite two stores in Leipzig, it opened a third
at the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not only browse, they buy, too,'' said Liane Zunft, the
store manager.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the train station has its magnetism. On an average
day, 100,000 people pass through, including 30,000 railway
passengers. Annual sales in the stores are projected to be more
than $5,000 per square meter, one-third more than in shopping
centers on the edge of Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a success, and we wouldn't have thought it,'' said Inis
Scheithauer, a shopper from the outskirts of Leipzig, as she sipped
soda with her husband and son at Ovidio's, an ice cream parlor.
When relatives visited recently from Hanover, in western Germany,
the one thing they wanted to see was the train station. From the
station, she often goes to the downtown area for more shopping, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Sparschuh, who follows retail trade at Leipzig's Chamber of
Commerce, said inner-city retailers are now divided between those
who feel the train station attracts shoppers like Mrs. Scheithauer,
who then go on to visit the downtown stores, and others, notably
big inner-city department stores, who say they are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is supporting a lawsuit, now pending before a court,
to test the legality of the station's late closing hours as
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot allow unfair conditions,'' she said.

ARCHER BLOCKS UNABOMBER'S BROTHER FROM DISTRIBUTING CASH TO VICTIMS
TAX FREE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, Wednesday blocked an
effort on Capitol Hill to enable the brother of Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski to distribute a cash reward to his brother's victims
without Uncle Sam taking a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously approved a measure Wednesday that would
have granted a special exemption to allow David Kaczynski to hand
over $750,000 in reward money tax free.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and
the most powerful tax writer in the House, refused to allow a
measure to go to the floor for a vote without a hearing. That
effectively killed the proposal for this year.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who had alerted authorities after realizing his
reclusive, older brother was responsible for a 17-year-long mail
bombing spree that left three dead and another 29 injured, had
originally been awarded $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski used $250,000 of the award to pay his brother's
lawyer, who had saved the Unabomber from a possible death sentence
by negotiating a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He hoped to turn over the rest of the reward to the victims and
their families. But that plan didn't take the tax laws into
account, which Congressional staffers estimate would have required
David Kaczynski to pay about $335,000 to the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski traveled to Capitol Hill to lobby lawmakers for
an exemption and picked up the support of New York Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance
Committee, the Senate's tax-writing body. Kaczynski could not be
reached for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats raised the issue with Archer's office on Oct. 2, when
lawmakers were battling over a Republican-backed tax-cut plan.
Archer refused to allow Kaczynski's request to be added to the tax
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Archer supports this proposal, at least in principle, but
he's unwilling to use his authority as chairman to give a special
exemption to this particular provision when everyone else's special
case doesn't get the same treatment,'' said Sean Rushton, Archer's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Archer was ``very clear in telling the tax staff `We can't
insert any special provisions in this or this whole thing is going
to turn into a free-for-all for all,' '' Rushton said.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, however, Archer did agree to insert a
provision to give a tax break for students working at Texas' state
universities. That provision would enable Texas, Pennsylvania and
New Jersey to exempt full-time students who work at their
state-supported universities from paying Social Security taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton said that provision was a different case, since it was
not granting anyone special privileges but merely granting students
in these three states an opportunity to take advantage of a tax
break enjoyed by students in all other states.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has agreed to have the Ways and Means Committee take up
the matter when lawmakers return to Washington for the new Congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton noted, however, that commitment did not mean Archer _
who is concerned about the precedent the issue would set _ would
necessarily vote for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has not always been so loathe to provide special tax
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, he offered to intervene himself when IRS
officials indicated they might try to assess sports fans gift taxes
if they turned over baseball slugger Mark McGuire's record-breaking
home run baseballs to the player rather than keep the highly prized
balls themselves. Rushton said Archer would have held a hearing on
that issue as well, if the IRS had not backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, Archer was the target of Democratic
criticism when he refused during negotiations on an IRS overhaul
bill to correct what administration officials described as a
technical error discovered in last year's tax bill. The result was
a $200,000 tax break to people inheriting estates worth $17.2
million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the philosophical debate, the Kaczynski provision also
had become embroiled in a turf battle between the Ways and Means
Committee and the House Appropriations staff over who had
jurisdiction on such an issue. The tax writers had suggested
Congress allow David Kaczynski to pay the tax and then make a
special authorization to the victims and their families of an equal
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the floor of the House Tuesday, Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., argued Ways and Means officials had blocked the measure
``because of dumb, Hill considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a more disgraceful action on the part of
anyone in this Congress than that action denying those funds to the
victims of the Unabomber,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Maffei, press secretary for Democrats on the Ways and Means
Committee, said, ``It's so very frustrating for us that we can't do
this for this guy, who is simply trying to help the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw this as addressing a situation that the Internal
Revenue Code could not have possibly anticipated,'' Maffei said.
``And that's, frankly, why actual people come to Congress and meet
and discuss these issues.'' &QL;

MANY SENATE REPUBLICANS REVOLT AND OPPOSE MAMMOTH SPENDING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 2ndgraf to update with Clinton signing bill into law;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A surprising number of Senate Republicans revolted
against their party's leadership Wednesday to vote against the huge
federal spending bill that the Senate passed and sent to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican rebels criticized the 40-pound document as too
pricey, too rushed and so huge that members barely knew what was in
it. Clinton signed it into law Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The $520 billion appropriations measure combined eight of the 13
spending bills needed to fund the government for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1, along with $20 billion earmarked for emergency
spending, and a host of pet projects slipped in at the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost accounted for about one-third of the $1.7
trillion federal budget for the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Senate vote of 65-29 for passage included 20
Republicans and nine Democrats in the ``nay'' column.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., defensively conceded that the bill ``is too big, and the
process isn't the preferred way'' to complete spending bills. But,
Lott added, ``It is what is needed to keep important government
programs working.''
</P>
<P>
   With Congress headed home to campaign for the Nov. 3 mid-term
elections, the chaotic final days of the session reflected the
harsh reality facing Republicans. Their options were either to
accept the mammoth spending package or face a government shutdown.
The last time that happened _ in 1995 _ the public blamed the
Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators called into question the tenure of the Senate
leadership. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who voted against the bill,
said Republicans ``are going to have some questions'' about whether
the present GOP leadership should be retained. He called the
spending bill ``the irresponsible product of a dishonest process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., another ``nay'' vote, faulted
Republican committee chairmen for taking ``feet-in-the-cement
positions'' and failing to compromise on spending issues earlier
this year, forcing Congress to take up the eight spending bills at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said Republicans were forced to ``turn the ball over to
the White House'' and agree to extra spending for
Democratic-sponsored programs because Congress failed to get its
job done.
</P>
<P>
   Senate critics of the jumbo package said the annual
appropriations process became bogged down this year. They blamed
the lag on the zeal of some lawmakers to pass anti-tobacco
legislation or overhaul the managed care system or the
time-consuming efforts to investigate the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the last vote of his 18-year congressional career, retiring
Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., voted against the bill and criticized the
budget process as ``deeply flawed.'' He derided his colleagues for
approving $20 billion for emergency spending on what he deemed
non-emergencies. That emergency spending included money for farm
relief, natural disasters and fixing the year 2000 computer problem
in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Many members said a major reason for the breakdown was the
absence of a budget resolution. That blueprint for spending
programs and taxes is supposed to be approved in the spring so that
congressional appropriators then will know their spending targets
in time to pass spending bills before August.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional budget negotiators failed to pass the budget
resolution for the first time since the Congressional Budget Act
was enacted in 1974. Negotiators intentionally delayed their work,
hoping to carve out a major tax cut, which eventually failed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another GOP naysayer, denounced the
bill for being chock full of ``pork-barrel spending projects.''
McCain cited several examples of what he called pork, including $1
million for peanut quality research in Georgia, $250,000 for a
lettuce geneticist in Salinas, Calif., and $2.5 million for the
federal Office of Cosmetics and Color.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism came from both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.V., an acknowledged expert at sliding
pork into spending bills, denounced the bill as ``a monstrosity''
and voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said it was ``terrible'' for Congress ``to wait until the
last minute and then pass an elephantine monstrosity and call it an
appropriations bill... There's no living person that knows
everything that's in this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there in the real world, when you don't do your work, you
are fired,'' Byrd added. ``On the real job site, colleagues, we
would be gone!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., another ``nay'' vote, said
the breakdown in the budget process, which led to lawmakers voting
on millions of dollars in programs no one even debated, indicates
``Congress is getting ominously careless with its rules and
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats griped that they were left out of the process
while Republican leaders cobbled together the final details of the
jumbo spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to resemble a kind of bastard parliamentary
system'' in which ``the real decisions are made in a closed room by
three or four people,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said he voted against the bill because
it contained ``several hundred pages that are a complete mystery to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said it was impossible to make decisions about the public
interest because it was impossible to know how that interest jibed
``with a bill whose 3,800 pages were not even published until the
dark of last night.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the Republican leadership for failing to schedule the
Senate's time properly over the course of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said never before in his memory had
the Senate been confronted with such massive appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the wretched process which produced this bill
and cannot in good conscience vote for it,'' Levin said.

ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR, TRAILING IN POLLS, LOOKS TO COME FROM BEHIND _

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Part of the political legend of Fob James Jr.,
the pugnacious Republican governor of Alabama, is that he likes to
play from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fob is a strong finisher,'' said Roger McConnell, the state
Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a fourth-quarter player,'' explained Tom Blackerby,
chairman of Conservative Christians of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   So as the clock ticks down in James' campaign for re-election,
his allies are trying to convince voters _ and themselves _ that
his current predicament simply reflects the natural order of
things. But even as the James camp brushes off poll after poll
showing him trailing Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman, other Republicans are
getting nervous, and some sound downright defeatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be real surprised if he can pull this one out,'' said one
prominent Republican strategist in Alabama, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the Nov. 3 election, James is not alone. In one
of the real surprises of this very fluid election year, Republican
gubernatorial candidates are locked in tight races in three
conservative Southern states that have voted increasingly
Republican in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, polls have shown that the incumbent
Republican, Gov. David Beasley, holds the thinnest of leads over
his Democratic challenger, Jim Hodges, the former minority leader
of the state House. And in Georgia, where Republican leaders have
asserted that this will be the year they break the Democrats'
126-year lock on the governor's office, Guy W. Millner, a
Republican businessman, is running just ahead of Roy E. Barnes, a
longtime Democratic legislator.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the races hinge on local issues and dynamics,
including the quality of the candidates. And it is certainly
possible that the Republicans will win in all three states. But
several authorities on Southern politics said Wednesday that the
closeness of the races demonstrates that Southern Democrats are
learning the lessons taught by their two most successful mentors,
Georgia Gov. Zell Miller and North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The message, said Wayne Flynt, an historian at Auburn
University, is that there may still be enough core Democrats and
swing voters in the South, including blacks and working-class
whites, to reward Democratic candidates who keep their campaigns
focused on issues like education, jobs and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the issues are all about social concerns, like abortion and
school prayer and vouchers, Republicans win,'' Flynt said. ``But
Democrats can still succeed if they can make the case that they are
the party of the common people, and that the Republicans are the
party of big business and the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that theory being tested more than in the Alabama
race. During the last two years, James has earned a national
reputation for his fervent stands in support of school prayer and
state autonomy from federal control. But even diehard Republicans
acknowledge that he has allowed Siegelman to control the discourse
of this year's campaign with a proposal for a lottery to finance
education.
</P>
<P>
   Four different public polls taken during the first two weeks of
October showed James behind by between 5 and 13 percentage points.
He has raised significantly less money than Siegelman, and started
his advertising campaign more than a month later. National
Republican officials consider James the most vulnerable of the 18
Republican governors running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Within Alabama, Republican strategists are grumbling that James
seems to not want his job all that much, and that his seeming
dispassion could hurt fellow Republicans in important races for the
legislature and state Supreme Court. ''There's a feeling that he's
a drag on the ticket,'' one strategist said. ``It's just
frustrating as all get out to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There is enough of an impression of inertia in the James
campaign that its chairman, Montgomery Mayor Emory Folmar, felt the
need to energize the troops with a tough speech at a rally last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the fight in this campaign I'd like to see,''
Folmar said, according to news accounts. He urged James supporters
to resort to ``some scratching, biting and clawing'' in exposing
Siegelman as a liberal, adding, ``I love the smell of napalm early
in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But James does, in fact, have a history of making late dashes to
victory, often with the help of Christian conservatives whose
enthusiasm does not always register in polls. As a challenger in
1994, James trailed Gov. Jim Folsom by 10 percentage points in the
polls with less than a week to go and came back to win by 1
percentage point. In this summer's Republican primary, he was
forced into a runoff and was thought to be in peril but came back
to win by a convincing 12 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In his race against Siegelman, James' most significant problem
is the Democrat's popular lottery proposal, which would provide an
estimated $150 million a year to pay for merit-based college
scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and classroom computers. A
disciplined, if scripted, campaigner with an experienced staff,
Siegelman has promoted the lottery relentlessly on the trail, in
his advertising and in debates like the one held here on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proposed an education plan that will change education
in this state forever,'' Siegelman said in the televised forum. ``I
say yes to a lottery. Fob James says no.''
</P>
<P>
   With the lottery a big success in two of Alabama's neighboring
states, the Siegelman plan has placed James utterly on the
defensive. The governor has responded with a three-pronged
rebuttal. He has proposed a far less ambitious plan for college
scholarships that would be financed with existing state funds. He
has argued that Siegelman will need to raise taxes to pay for his
proposals, even with the lottery. And he has warned that the
lottery would lead to other forms of legalized gambling in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, for instance, James has run a series of
television advertisements that question Siegelman's integrity by
showing his nose growing like an animated Pinnochio. One of them
depicts a cockfight as the narrator asks, ``Why should we believe
Siegelman when he says that later he won't let his gambling friends
sneak other games of chance into Alabama behind his lottery?''
</P>
<P>
   James aides said that the campaign's polling suggests that the
ads have closed the gap significantly in recent days. But it may be
too late to reach swing voters like Brenda J. Crain, a 49-year-old
Mobile woman who owns a used car lot with her husband. Although she
voted for James four years ago, Ms. Crain said she would vote this
year for Siegelman because she agrees that Alabama should have an
education lottery and because she has been embarrassed by some of
James' pronouncements, like his contention that the Bill of Rights
does not apply to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm normally a Republican so this is a hard choice,'' she said
while shopping Tuesday at Bel Air Mall. ``I don't think Fob James
is a bad person but he's just a little more of a backwards type and
Alabama could use a better image. And with the lottery, people are
going to gamble whether it's here or in Florida or Mississippi. The
tax money should stay here in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie M. Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham Southern
College, said that the lottery had become a wedge issue for
Democrats just as social issues have for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often think of wedge issues as abortion, prayer, that kind
of thing,'' she said. ``But what has happened here is that
Siegelman has used the lottery to pull apart a predictable
Republican constituency.''

SPENDING BILL WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO HIRE MORE FOREIGN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates with Clinton signing spending bill into law.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labor-hungry technology companies will be able to
hire more skilled foreign workers under a provision lumped into the
mammoth spending bill that President Clinton signed into law
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology and computer companies in California's Silicon Valley
have lobbied for the measure, which would double the number of
employment visas for foreign computer programmers and others with
high-tech skills.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say there is a scarcity of skilled Americans, but
organized labor says the provision is a sellout of American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, spearheaded by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
would increase the number of so-called H1-B work visas from 65,000
to 115,000 in 1999 and 2000, and 107,500 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The visas have been used in recent years to recruit computer
programmers, many of them from India, Taiwan and Europe. Holders of
H1-B visas are allowed to remain in the United States for up to six
years, but many settle here permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-USA, which
represents 218,000 engineers and computer scientists, said the
measure didn't include enough protections for Americans who may be
displaced by an influx of skilled foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy grows at a substantial rate, there may not be a
detrimental effect,'' said Vin O'Neill, a policy analyst at the
institute. ``But if it turns down, we are concerned _ especially
about older workers over age 45.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said he wasn't surprised that the measure cleared
Congress earlier Wednesday because ``it was clear that the
(Clinton) administration, the Republican congressional leadership,
and the high-tech industry wanted it pretty badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Golodner, president of the Department for Professional
Employees of the AFL-CIO, which represents 4 million union members,
said the legislation would hurt college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will retard the increases in their salaries and benefits,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was lumped into the legislation that included $520
billion to round out the government's $1.7 trillion federal budget.
The spending package was approved by the House Tuesday and the
Senate Wednesday and Clinton signed it into law Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the labor provision would
``allow dynamic American companies and research labs to hire more
skilled foreign professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was confident the measure included adequate
safeguards ``to protect American workers and provide substantial
funding to educate and train Americans to fill the lucrative
high-tech jobs that are available across our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure appeared in jeopardy earlier this month when Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, threatened to block it, questioning the claims
of a worker shortage. But the measure sailed through Wednesday,
attached to the spending bill that many members of Congress were
anxious to dispense with so they could return home to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he would challenge the need for importing foreign
high-tech workers when Congress reconvenes next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, if 15 percent or more of a company's
employees hold H1-B visas, the company must attest that the workers
have not replaced qualified Americans.
</P>
<P>
   However, companies hiring H1-B workers with at least a master's
degree or at salaries of $60,000 or more would be exempt from
having to provide the information. Small businesses and start-up
companies also would get exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also requests that the Labor Department look
into any reported abuses of the program, and places a $500 filing
fee on visa applications and renewals, which would raise more than
$75 million for scholarship and training programs for U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, pushed for a similar
bill that originally would have provided broader safeguards for
American workers.

 &HT;    Olympic gymnast suing her parents
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu's parents knew from the day she was born that
she would become a gymnast. That was the promise the Romanian
immigrants made to each other before the birth of their first
child.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moceanu, who turned 17 on Sept. 30, has sued for
independence from her parents, Dumitru and Camelia. She claims they
have squandered the fortune she has earned since becoming a
professional at age 10 and, in the process of making her a
champion, robbed her of her childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, a member of the United States' ``Magnificent Seven''
gold-medal winning team at the '96 Olympic Games in Atlanta, told
the Houston Chronicle her relationship with her parents ``always
had to be about the gym. I would think, `Don't you guys know
anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream? Can't
you be my mom and dad instead of me being your business?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu also said her father has hit her ``a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast ran away from home on Sunday and has been staying
with friends ``like a fugitive'' so her parents can't find her.
After her lawsuit was filed Monday in state district court in
Houston, a judge signed a temporary restraining order saying the
parents must stay away from the gymnast until a Nov. 11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Her father held a press conference Wednesday to plead for his
daughter's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love her very much,'' Dumitru Moceanu said. ``And I hope
she change her mind and come home, start training again. She's just
a child, she's just a minor. I don't believe this comes from her.
It comes from other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu told the Houston newspaper that ``things have been
getting rough for a while ... . We've been trying to keep things
hidden.'' But the last straw came Saturday, when her father
threatened to fire her coach, Luminita Miscenco, and have her
deported to Romania. Miscenco, 26, arrived in January, and Moceanu
credits her with revitalizing her career and her interest in the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   When she won the Goodwill Games' all-around title in July,
Moceanu said, ``I could have never done it without (Miscenco).
She's so close to me, she's like my sister, like my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The gymnast said Miscenco helped her with her ``outlook in
life,'' which apparently included advising her to look into where
her money was going.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu spent $4 million building a gym in Houston that
opened June 1997 and bills itself as ``the largest gymnastics
facility in the United States,'' with 70,000 square feet and room
for 10,000 spectators. Other ventures under Moceanu Gymnastics Inc.
include a clothing outlet that specializes in leotards.
</P>
<P>
   Other gym owners in the Houston area say the facility is too
big. Said James Holmes, who runs Acrofit Gymnastics in Bela
Karolyi's old gym, ``Whoever built that gym parked it between the
two most successful recreational gyms in the city. The parking
lot's empty half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, no one answered calls at the gym, but the chirpy
voice on the answering machine said, ``Hi. This is Dominique. You
have reached Moceanu's Gymnastics.'' Then she lists the hours it is
supposed to be open.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, born in 1981 in Hollywood, has spent countless hours in
the gym since age 3, when her father first called Karolyi, the
legendary coach who tutored Mary Lou Retton and Nadia Comaneci, and
asked to enroll his daughter in his program. Karolyi told him to
wait a few years.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 10, Moceanu drove his daughter to Houston where
she, Camelia and sister Christina have remained. Dumitru, who
always regretted giving up his own gymnastics career as a
teen-ager, continued working at a used-car lot in Florida before
joining the family in Houston several years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a childhood,'' said Moceanu, who was the youngest
member of the 1996 gymnastics team at age 14 and hopes to compete
in the 2000 Games in Sydney. ``When I went to compete when I was
young, I always was in fear because I would get yelled at by my
father, and I would say to myself, 'I'm 13 years old; come on,' ``
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of talking to me, they're always yelling with me,
fighting with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu and her lawyer, Roy W. Moore, did not reveal how much
money she has made or how much they think is gone. Her lawsuit said
a trust that had been established for her is all but empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she asked. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
</P>
<P>
   To receive adult status, Moore said, Moceanu must prove that she
is living away from her parents and can support herself. Once she
has the status, Moore said, Moceanu will be able to demand through
legal channels to see an accounting of her money, and would be
entitled to proceeds from the businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ziert, publisher of International Gymnastics magazine who
works closely with Olympians Bart Conner and Nadia Comaneci, said
the gymnastics community knew there was friction in the Moceanu
household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying the whole thing is the kid has had some problems,''
Ziert said. ``She has always wanted to be a star, and she learned
that gymanstics was her way to be a star. Then she decided she
wanted to be a star without having the gymnastics.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Moceanu ``a cash cow'' for the family. As she wavered
in her interest in gymnastics, she moved from gym to gym, including
Kurt Thomas's gym in Plano, Texas, a gym in Boston and finally her
family's facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spark wasn't there,'' Moceanu said last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tours dried up, and so did endorsement money for Moceanu, still
the most popular gymnast in the U.S. Her website hasn't been
updated in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all those Mag 7 girls, {from the Olympic team). the money
went away real fast,'' Ziert said. ``If you're earning a lot of
money and it continues, you don't look over your shoulder so much.
Because there seems to be a lot there. When it goes away ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is Moceanu's mother, of whom Ziert says,
``Thereis no sweeter woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The really tragic thing is she's in a terrible position,'' he
said. ``She loves her kid so much, but she's also in a marriage. I
felt really bad that her mom is grouped in with that; she's not a
stage mother at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Maiers of Atlanta, whose daughter Tanya trained with
Moceanu in Houston, agreed. She was friendly with Camelia Moceanu
and expressed shock at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how surprising it is to hear this,'' Maiers
said. ``The mom was always particularly warm and soft. Although the
father wasn't my favorite person _ I thought he was a bit cold _ I
never saw any unkindness toward his child.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't have been smiling all the time if she was so
unhappy, she was such a cute bubbly thing. Things must have changed
after we left.''
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't think Dumitru ``made a lot of smart
decisions,'' Ziert pointed out that ``all of her money is visible.
It isn't like he went to Las Vegas and gambled it away.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the parents do work, by running the club, and that
Dominique has enjoyed some of the fruits of her success by driving
a Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu started taking more of an interest in her finances last
year, but got no answers from her parents. The senior at the
private Northland Christian School also wants independence in other
areas of her life. She says she has to hide from her father when
she calls friends and has had only one date, which was chaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed she is doing this on her own, partly to protect her
9-year-old sister, also a gymnast, from the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my parents,'' Moceanu said. ``I hope that after all
this is over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who coached Moceanu when she was a junior, remembered
her good nature and her smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants her money; that's going to be her future,'' he said.
``More than anything, she wants Dominique back, the fun, to be
happy with no pressure.''

COMMENTARY: DEALING WITH DICTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TURKEY-SYRIA) 
(JT) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are good Kurds and bad Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bad'' Kurds _ the PKK, headed by Abdullah Ocalan _ have
been fighting a guerrilla war against Turkey in hopes of breaking
off a piece of that country to establish an independent state. PKK
headquarters is in Damascus; Syria's dictator, Hafez Assad,
provides a base for operations the Turks consider terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Turkey got tired of allowing Assad to provide sanctuary
and moved forces toward the Syrian border. Assad was told: Close
down Ocalan's PKK operation or we'll come and get him.
</P>
<P>
   Dictator Assad counted his rusty tanks, compared his forces with
those of the fierce Turkish divisions, and chose survival. He
kicked the rebel headquarters out of Damascus and denied it had
ever been there in the first place. Ocalan is now living in the
village of Odintsovo outside Moscow under the protection of his
longtime sponsor, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   That's power politics. It stands in sharp contrast to impotence
politics _ the pushmipullyu policy of threatening and backing-off
that we now conduct against another of that area's dictators,
Iraq's Saddam Hussein. He has humiliated President Clinton and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan by shutting down inspections, thereby
allowing his thousands of scientists time and workspace to develop
nuclear and germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Without the forces in place to impose his lack of will on
Saddam, Clinton has come up with a strategy to save face. He is
reluctantly going along with frustrated hawks in the United States
who hope to put at least some pressure on the dictator by turning
to ``the good Kurds.''
</P>
<P>
   These include Massoud Barzani, the legendary Mullah Mustafa's
son, who has been helping the Turks with the PKK, and his main
Kurdish rival, Jalal Talibani, whose ties are to Iran. A third Kurd
is Ahmed Chalabi, who has little following on the ground but
lobbies effectively in the U.S. Congress, which wants desperately
for somebody _ anybody _ to organize an overthrow of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   With our no-fly zone restraining Baghdad's sovereignty over
northern Iraq, we have already created a ``virtual Kurdistan'' _
3.5 million strong-minded people in a country the size of Austria.
Until recently, the factions were foolishly fighting among
themselves. Two years ago, Barzani _ promised a better deal from
Baghdad than from Washington _ let Saddam's forces wipe out many
Talibani followers and Chalabi's nascent CIA operation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typical Middle Eastern bottle of scorpions. But this
month, our State Department brought Barzani and Talibani to
Washington to shake hands, while Chalabi persuaded Congress to
authorize (but not appropriate) $100 million in an Iraq Liberation
Act, which can be dribbled out as Clinton sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   Our hawks say: Since we're not about to use our military power
against Saddam, at least let's try something in the overthrow line.
He is said to have stomach cancer, and his generals may not want to
wait around. Clinton aggressive multilateralists say: As long as
we're not committing our own forces, we'll give it a cushion shot.
But don't blame us for a Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? In the presence of a threat of mass
destruction, and in the absence of a command decision to remove
that threat, a half-measure of trying to foment an indigenous coup
is better than no measure at all.
</P>
<P>
   Step One is to give the Kurds in Iraq real security: not just a
no-fly zone, but a no-go zone. If one Iraqi tank goes over the
border of virtual Kurdistan, we should guarantee to send a plane to
take it out. Secret winks mean nothing; the Kurds know we have sold
them out before. Clinton should ask for, and Congress agree to, a
written security pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two must come from the Kurds: elections soon to a
functioning parliament in their area with the Shiites in the south
and Sunnis elsewhere represented, and a unity government with a
national leader. Needed are a legitimate place for Iraqi soldiers
to defect to, and a safe base for propaganda broadcast and
overthrow operations.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three is a presidential finding for covert action, with
close oversight but no second-guessing. Congress just added nearly
$2 billion to the intelligence budget; the CIA can no longer plead
poverty or fear of political reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   If this is all we can do, let's do it right.
</P>

SO FAR, SO BAD: NETWORKS BEGIN HACKING AWAY TO SALVAGE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two shows are axed. Several have been sent off to the
regenerative waters of ``Hiatus.'' A few are hits, or close enough
to pass. We've identified this year's good show that hardly anyone
is watching.
</P>
<P>
   So it must be official. We have a television season in progress,
even if the network bunting grows more threadbare by the year.
</P>
<P>
   The public appears to have corroborated the critical impression
of the 1998-99 season. Which is to say, the airwaves are skunked up
to the max, so turn off the set and break out the Parcheesi board.
Or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   No one can gaze clearly at the programming array until the World
Series ends and postseason baseball is no longer affecting the
regular-series matchups.
</P>
<P>
   But perfect vision wasn't required to gauge as failures Fox's
``Costello'' and CBS' ``The Brian Benben Show.'' They're gone. And
``Costello'' won the parting gift of a case of Turtle Wax, as the
season's first canceled show.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shows that seem destined to join them, soon:
``Conrad Bloom,'' ``Encore! Encore!'' _ on second thought, skip the
curtain call _ ``Living in Captivity'' (pulled from the air but not
yet pronounced dead), ``Holding the Baby'' (also in limbo), ``The
Army Show,'' ``To Have and to Hold'' (just can't get a grip),
``Wind on Water.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything labeled UPN can be added to the list. ``Mercy Point''
has already been sent packing to Hiatus, which is believed to be in
the Cape Cod area. It's unlikely to return. Last season, UPN shows
were posting ratings, albeit slim, between 1 and 2. This season,
closer to a bare 1.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Fantasy Island'' and ``Cupid'' are suffocating on
Saturday night. You'd need a metal detector to find ``Vengeance
Unlimited'' on Thursday. NBC's ``Trinity'' needs time, like maybe
20 years, to build an audience.
</P>
<P>
   And, alas, a couple of million households leave CBS when ``Buddy
Faro'' begins on Friday nights. Half of them come back for ``Nash
Bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes no sense to me; ``Buddy Faro,'' with Dennis Farina,
isn't castor oil. It's breezy entertainment. Why it is so deeply
offensive to ``Candid Camera'' viewers, who are bailing out en
masse after their show ends, is a mystery. Geez, you'd think it was
``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN is gagging on its paltry ratings, but Fox is hemorrhaging.
October baseball is the main thing propping up the network; the
numbers for series programming are off dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Fox expects improvement when ``The X-Files'' begins its season
next month. But the network is slapping bandages on its wounds for
the November sweeps. That means more of its comically shocking
specials, led by ``When Good Pets Go Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd point at Fox and giggle some more, but from NBC comes news
that a version of Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' has been yanked
from the sweeps and repositioned for mid-December. That's after
``Crime and Punishment'' tanked. And in November, NBC's prime-time
programming will include a special called ``Exposed: Pro
Wrestling's Greatest Secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Good Wrestlers Go Bad'' sounds like a natural for
February.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is being heavily criticized for its supremely bad decision
to break up its perfectly fine Sunday lineup, moving ``King of the
Hill'' to Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Fox might take some convincing, though. This week, a Fox press
release raved about how ``King of the Hill'' has goosed the
network's Tuesday ratings compared with a year ago. But ``King of
the Hill'' is averaging a 4.3 rating in the key 18-to-49-year-old
demographic bracket, which is barely half its 18-to-49 average last
season on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' is Fox's only success among new shows. The
Sunday comedy has been green-lighted for the entire season, but its
ratings are only moderately encouraging and it isn't meeting its
creative potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' on the WB, is the tidy little hit it was expected
to be. But in ratings it's being eclipsed on its own network by
Shannen Doherty's new series, ``Charmed.''
</P>
<P>
   All of TV is in a funk, it seems, except the WB. At least it has
``The Army Show'' and the static ``Hyperion Bay'' to enforce its
humility.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that ``Maggie Winters'' is improving on its
``Nanny'' lead-in? That ``Two of a Kind'' will keep the Olsen twins
in clover in their dotage? That ``The Hughleys,'' bolstered by
``Home Improvement,'' is succeeding on ABC? That ``L.A. Doctors''
is hanging in with little CBS support on Mondays? That somehow
``The King of Queens'' is doing fine?
</P>
<P>
   It matters to the respective networks, but that's all. The more
significant success in the early season is ``Will &AMP; Grace'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is a polished little comedy, so its
apparent health is good to see purely on an aesthetic basis.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Will &AMP; Grace'' also tests whether a gay lead, Eric
McCormack as Will, will poison the ratings. What, exactly, had
``Ellen'' wrought?
</P>
<P>
   Lots of good, it appears, and perhaps no lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' are being excruciatingly
cautious, though. What if Will ever discovers that he has a sex
organ? He does have a sex organ, doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, that sounds like a ``Dateline NBC'' story
to me.

Triple Five Corp., a Canadian conglomerate that built the Mall of
America in Minnesota and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, is

Mesa, Ariz.,

   that would include high-end botiques, outdoor cafes and
galleries topped by condominiums. The company is also eyeing sites
in Gilbert and Peoria for future projects, and plans to set up a
satellite office in the Phoenix area. By LISA GONDERRINGER. Story
will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CANON (Undated) - In the imbecilic culture wars that currently
ravage the intellectual countryside, the lines are drawn between
ignorant armies. On one side, you find right-wing reactionary
fossils fighting to maintain the canon of mainly European classics.
On the other side, there is a cadre of victimization that wants to
eliminate anything written by dead white males. A pox on both their
houses. With

MRSCASTANEDA (Undated) - They were improbable lovers. For decades,
he denied she even existed. She was a tall Southern belle with
Cleopatra bangs and a seductive patter; he, short and serious,
recently immigrated from Peru in hopes of becoming a successful
artist in America. Yet, their paths crossed in Los Angeles during
the mid-'50s, and in 1960 Margaret Evelyn Runyan married Carlos
Castaneda, the man who would become the most famous literary
sorcerer in the world. By THOMAS ROPP. Story moved in the ``E''

   TOO-MUCH-SODA (Los Angeles) _ Super size. Big Gulp. These are
the sales pitches for America's addiction to soda, an addiction
that particularly jeopardizes the health of teen-agers, according
to a new study. ``The average American is drinking twice as much
soda pop as in 1974,'' said Michael Jacobson, head of The Center
for Science in the Public Interest. By David Baker and Melissa

   FOOTBALL-DEVELOPER (Los Angeles) _ The Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum Commission voted Wednesday to put its hopes of winning a
National Football League team into the hands of developer Edward
Roski Jr. and his New Coliseum Ventures Inc. The commission, in a
rare unanimous 8-0 vote, approved a two-year contract with Roski
and NCV to negotiate with the NFL to get an expansion team or have

   CHARTER-SCHOOLS (Los Angeles) _ In the Northeast San Fernando
Valley where there are some of the worst-performing schools in Los
Angeles, Cristina Moran says her two daughters are farther ahead
than many students their age. And the reason is simple, she
asserts: They attend Fenton Avenue Charter School in Lake View
Terrace, one of three charter schools in the region and nine in the
Los Angeles Unified School District. By Sherry Joe Crosby. (Will

<P>
   CHARTER-SUCCESS (Los Angeles) _ Health education teacher Larry
Marshall has worked at Palisades Charter High School for 33 years,

the West Los Angeles school has doubled its enrollment, reaching
its maximum capacity of 2,500 students. Marshall and others credit

of a charter in 1993. By Sherry Joe Crosby. (Will move in the ``a''

<P>
   CHARTER-SIART (Los Angeles) _ When Bill Siart failed to get the
nod as the new superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School
District, he didn't stop his plans to reform the nation's
second-largest district. Instead, the former First Interstate CEO
formed a private company that is helping charter schools take the
next step of independence from the LAUSD by becoming financially
independent. By Terri Hardy. (Will move in the ``a'' national and

SERIES EMPLOYS ELEMENT OF SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   CASTAIC, Calif. _ Dispersed throughout Saturday's 10- to 15-mile
mountain bike course, 6- to 8-mile trail run and a one-hour kayak
at Castaic Lake will be several ``mystery'' events.
</P>
<P>
   The special disciplines race officials create to cull the cream
of teams from the crop have come to define the Hi-Tec Adventure
Racing Series, one in a new order of ``extreme'' races that are
becoming increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Kept strictly hush-hush by race officials until participants
stumble onto them during their three- to five-hour run through the
course, the mystery events serve as the series' great equalizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be in top physical shape, but some of the special
events can stump you and set you back. They're full of mental
surprises,'' said Tim Foy, 28, of Agoura Hills, who will be
competing in his first series event with the men's division team
Toe Jam.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who competed at the Castaic event last year recounted to
Foy the horrors of a memory-recall stage, in which teammates had a
few seconds to memorize items on a board and could not proceed
without successfully naming them off to overseers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the mystery events revolve around mud pits, and those
who fail the memory segment at some race sites have had to jump in.
``If you don't get it right, you are going to sit there for a
while,'' Foy said. At Castaic, the 4:30 p.m. start means some of
the race will take place in darkness, which also means the mud
could get pretty chilly. Put on your thinking cap.
</P>
<P>
   Other mysteries in the theater:
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Completing the running portion with one shoelace.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Carrying a teammate across a wooden beam without
the suspended person touching the beam.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Pulling hay bales or railroad ties.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Making a shoulder-high river crossing in the
middle of the mountain-biking stage.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Rappelling.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Climbing oversized Lincoln logs, and scaling a
15-foot wall with the aid of only 2{ feet of rope dangling from the
top.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow! &UR; !off! &LR; Traversing bodies of water while suspended by
pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors hedge their bets by watching televised portions of
the series or scouring the Internet to learn what mystery events
have been employed. But one never knows what's going to pop up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just stressful because you don't know what they are,''
said Diann Fried, 44, of Woodland Hills, who competed at Castaic
last year and will return Saturday in the masters' division with
the team Nu-Rad On Fire. ``You can't really prepare for it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no time penalties; racers must finish each task or
risk disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are very simple,'' said race spokeswoman Lori Hall.
``Complete the courses. Wear a helmet during the mountain bike
course. Wear a life preserver in the kayak.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing monkey wrenches into the competition seems to be
drawing more teams, as evidenced in the rise in popularity of the
Castaic race. The inaugural race in 1996 attracted 40 teams; as of
Monday, 271 were registered for Saturday's contest, which is billed
as the world's largest adventure race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triathlons are too commercialized,'' said first-time adventure
racer Bob Doyle of Saugus. ``They are clean-cut and dry, from
starting point to finishing point. They don't have the element of
surprise. I can get dirty and still do it.''

TRIP-HOP RE-INVENTS ITSELF TO TAKE ON THE WORLD

messaging and entertainment service, a division of America Online.

<P>
   When Massive Attack came on the British dance-music scene in
1991 with its debut album, ``Blue Lines,'' the group's bass-heavy
beats and brooding spirit of introspection became the sonic
blueprint for trip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   A studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and reggae
that set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead and
Tricky, trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware,
culturally fragmented times. Spawned by the latest recording
technologies, yet resolutely human in its message, it was steeped
in the ironic film-noir paranoia of 60s spy movies and apocalyptic
angst.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the '90s, Massive Attack has maintained its
underground appeal, partly because its music _ like trip-hop itself
_ is a constantly mutating, sometimes clashing hybrid of styles and
influences. Now Massive Attack is metamorphosing again, this time
into a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   The group's muscular new sound, which was on display during the
group's recent U.S. tour, signaled its continuing evolution from a
loose confederacy of DJs, singers and studio wizards into a more
conventional band that performs with live drums and guitars. On
songs like ``Angel'' and ``Group Four,'' both from the group's new
album, ``Mezzanine,'' the undulating dance pulse repeatedly morphs
into spiraling electric guitar riffs.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic response to the album and concerts was
especially satisfying for Robert Del Nada, aka 3-D, one of the core
members of the group and the catalyst behind its new sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really did bring in all the elements that made us,'' he
said. ``Funk, soul, reggae, hip-hop and punk thing _ it was all
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It also showed that trip-hop has expanded well beyond the
confines of its dance-beat origins, reflecting the multi-ethnic
makeup of the genre's urban international audience. Most trip-hop
bands are racially and sexually mixed, and their lyrics, while
seldom overtly political, are charged with the social and economic
apprehensions of the latest CNN headlines.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the rise of world music and a growing appreciation
of native folk traditions, popular tastes are less parochial than
they once were, paving the way for mass acceptance of trip-hop's
polyglot textures. In fact, at a time when the boundaries between
musical genres are increasingly blurred, trip-hop is becoming more
diverse _ and relevant even, wrapping its mordant lyrics and
sinuous beats around influences as disparate as Middle Eastern folk
music, free-form jazz and Burt Bacharach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trip-hop is the new world music,'' said the reggae singer
Horace Andy, a longtime Massive Attack collaborator who contributed
lyrics and vocals to several tracks on ``Mezzanine.'' ``It speaks
to every culture.''
</P>
<P>
   It also speaks to musicians who grew up listening to everything
from Public Enemy and the Sex Pistols to Joni Mitchell and Pink
Floyd and who are searching for open-ended forms of expression that
will not limit their choices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, trip-hop's atmospheric strains have spawned a
slew of ambitious new acts, including England's Pressure Drop, the
Belgian band Hooverphonic and Canada's Esthero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think music in general has kind of grown up in the past few
years,'' said Del Naja. ``Everyone seems to have understood you
could go in any direction that you want, and it's not something
that has to be a cliche or generic. People are prepared to
experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Del Naja joined his fellow Massive Attack
co-founders, Grant (Daddy G) Marshal and Andrew (Mushroom) Vowles,
in starting their own record label, Melankolic. Among its first
releases were ``Skylarking Volume 1,'' a compilation of songs by
Andy, and ``Come from Heaven'' by the British trip-hop newcomer
Alpha, whose music has a breezy, retro feel and features samples of
Herb Alpert and the Percy Faith Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   For some bands, the trip-hop trend has provided a vehicle for
exploring other musical terrain. While Morcheeba's 1996 debut
album, ``Who Can You Trust?'' was squarely in a trip-hop mode, the
commercial success of that album and a collaboration with David
Byrne on his album ``Feelings'' freed the group to tap its '70s
rock roots.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, its even stronger second album, ``Big Calm,'' moves
away from dance club grooves and takes a more song-oriented
approach, incorporating sitar, banjo and peddle steel guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never really considered ourselves a trip-hop band, although
we jumped on that bandwagon to get a record deal and get some
profile,'' said Paul Godfrey, the band's lead lyricist and
self-styled conceptualist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been way diverse,'' he said, ``and the music that
we were creating before `Who Can You Trust?' was country blues with
fiddles and hip-hop beats. So `Big Calm,' in a way, was really a
return to where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Trip-Hop's founders, in fact, now reject the term as outdated
and limiting. ``It doesn't describe our music at all,'' said
Marshall of Massive Attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are certain threads that continue to run through the
genre, particularly a tendency toward slow, surging rhythms,
minor-chord progressions and lyrics that evoke alienation and fear.
There is also a palpable ambivalence toward technology, which can
manifest itself in menacing drones and beeps or mellifluous
rainbows of synthesized sound.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a free-floating sense of dread that has as much to
do with race riots and terrorism as the emotional risks of
post-modern romance.
</P>
<P>
   On the song ``Darkness,'' from Pressure Drop's album,
``Elusive,'' Anita Jarrett, accompanied by ominous bass lines and a
funereal beat, sings: ``Something inside, under the skin/Deep, deep
down, Deep within/You can't feel a thing/That's what darkness
brings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we write tracks we try to represent things going on
around us,'' said David Henley, who along with Justin Langlands
makes up the creative core of Pressure Drop. ``And in this world
that were living in now, of mass communication and people not
contacting each other physically as much, a lot of people are
feeling quite insular, because they've sort of lost that contact of
meeting people and interacting face to face. And I think that's
increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Maurice Bernstein, the president of Giant Step records and a
British concert promoter who produced the first American concerts
for Massive Attack and many other trip-hop acts, the music's
downbeat vibe can at least be partly attributed to the social and
cultural realities of the working-class British communities where
the movement was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coming from their experience,'' said Bernstein. ``And
they're offering an alternative to the groovy Cool Britannia image
that usually gets offered to people. This is England the way they
see it, and its a very dark score.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Trip-hop bands also tend to eschew traditional song structures
in favor of panoramic soundscapes that unfold and evolve with long
instrumental passages, more like classical or jazz compositions
than typical pop songs.
</P>
<P>
   On Pressure Drop's album, ``Elusive,'' woodwinds, trumpet and
saxophone give the mix a bluesy, be-bop flavor, while on
Hooverphonic's new album, ``Blue Wonder Powder Milk,'' Geike
Arnaerts ethereal vocals float over lush string arrangements and
gently pulsing rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The propensity toward longer, more amorphous tracks springs from
trip-hop's roots in the ambient techno raves of the late 80s and
early 90s, in which music, lighting effects and sometimes
psychotropic drugs were used to induce an ecstatic, trancelike
experience that could last all night.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernstein sees another explanation. ``Kids spend most of
their time now walking around with headphones on,'' he said. ``The
Walkman has become part of our everyday reality. So what people are
doing now is writing the soundtrack to their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For trip-hop bands like Massive Attack, that sense of detachment
translates into music that mixes well with visual images, and that
compatibility has been noticed by filmmakers looking for fresh
sounds to complement their work.
</P>
<P>
   Massive Attack has contributed to the soundtracks of ``Batman
Returns,'' ``Welcome to Sarejevo'' and the sci-fi thriller ``Phi.''
Craig Armstrong, the Scottish composer who arranged the strings on
Massive Attacks 1994 album, ``Protection,'' and whose album, ``The
Space Between Us,'' was released this year on Melankolic, has
contributed to the soundtracks for ``Romero and Juliet'' and ``The
Saint.'' And Hooverphonic's song ``2wicky'' was featured on the
score of the Bernardo Bertolucci film ``Stealing Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such exposure, few trip-hop bands have been able to make
their mark in an increasingly crowded market. ``All of the musical
scenes that there have been in the past 5 or 10 years, each of them
seems to be strong in its own right,'' said Del Naja. ``You've got
an enormous drum-and-bass scene, and an enormous techno scene, and
then you've got places that play more mellow stuff and jazz. And
once in a while something pops up and gets big and everything else
stays underground, which is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is whether trip-hop, either in its
original or mutated form, will ever gain amass following outside
Europe's dance-club scene. ``Is the next Massive Attack somewhere
in America making the U.S. version of trip-hop?'' asked Bernstein.
``It would be pretty sad if there isn't. Because that's what it
will take to push this to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but in the United States, where many hit songs reflect
the optimism of the American dream, trip-hop's dark streak of
realism has failed to catch on with the record-buying public. That
could change. If political cynicism and a gyrating stock market
continue to take their toll on the public mood, trip-hop may yet
prove to be the perfect soundtrack for our anxious times.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Alazraqui was just a comic from Los Angeles doing
voice-overs on the side when he got that fateful call in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was his agent. ``She said, `You're playing the voice of a dog
for Taco Bell,' '' he recalled. ``I said, `All right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so, history was made. Or at least voice acting history.
Alazraqui, 36, a second-generation Argentine-American, became the
man behind the talking Chihuahua in Taco Bell's attention-grabbing
commercials. He joined a growing list of voice actors who earn
hundreds of thousands _ even millions _ of dollars a year without
ever having to set face on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `Wow, how lucky I am,' '' said Alazraqui, whose
parents emigrated from Argentina in the '50s. ``It's stupid
money,'' he added, alluding to being paid so much for saying ``Yo
quiero Taco Bell'' while a jug-eared female pooch named Gidget
appears to lip-sync the words of desire for the fast-food chain.
</P>
<P>
   With or without megabucks, voice acting has certain intangible
attractions. ``I like being famous and anonymous,'' said Lorenzo
Music, aka Garfield the cartoon cat and the talking crash test
dummy in those public service ads warning you to buckle up. ``I can
walk down the street and nobody comes up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, neither looks nor age matters. ``Some of the
sexiest-voiced actresses, you wouldn't want to see,'' said Jeffrey
Hedquist, a former deejay turned voice actor.
</P>
<P>
   Alazraqui refused to say precisely how far into six figures he
earns, but he is clearly not the top-paid voice in his field. That
distinction probably falls to someone like Don LaFontaine, a
full-throated Los Angeles actor repeatedly heard saying things like
``Next week on `E.R.' '' on television. ``I make millions,''
LaFontaine, 58, said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Though a handful of star voices have always earned big money,
both the money and the number of actors chasing it have exploded in
the last 5 to 10 years, according to those in the business.
Meanwhile, advances in technology have helped the most popular
voice stars bite off a bigger chunk of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming by busloads with doctorates in voice acting,''
Music said. ``I think people figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added a key point: ``Of all the people who are calling
themselves voice actors and doing voice acting, not all are making
a living at it yet. Most people supplement other income with voice
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while thousands of actors are chasing voice acting jobs,
most of the work is split among no more than 100 actors, said Dick
Moore, spokesman for the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists, which represents 80,000 actors, news broadcasters
and other radio and television performers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when jobs are won, the money is good and it can take only
minutes to earn it, compared with the hours an actor might spend on
an on-screen appearance, Moore explained.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown applicants have to troop to studios and audition each
time a potential job pops up, and this and callbacks can require a
lot of time. But some known voices do not even have to audition.
</P>
<P>
   Music, 61, said of the time he needs to make a commercial in a
studio: ``It takes maybe a half-hour. That includes schmoozing and
donuts.'' To read the script, nail down the lines with guidance
from a producer and create a usable tape, he said, ``takes maybe 10
to 15 minutes on-mike time.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Music might get $500 to $750 for each radio spot, or
more if the commercial is made for a national network program, plus
the same amount all over again each additional 13 weeks. ``You can
tape one thing and it can play for 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Aftra scale is $200 a session for a radio spot, it is
common for popular voice actors to negotiate two or three times
that or to get a contract for far more, he said. In addition, money
is added to the base rate when the commercial is to be played in
major cities. In Los Angeles, the going rate for voice actors is
$350 a session, according to Bob Lloyd, owner of the Voicecaster, a
casting concern in Burbank, Calif. TV sessions are $359.95 under
Aftra scale but go as high as $707.40 in New York, with spots made
for network television paying extra each time they are broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The incomes of voice actors have risen along with network
budgets, Moore explained. He also pointed out that this is a
business in which advertisers are willing to spend hundreds of
thousands or even a million to lure big-name screen actors to be
the unseen voice of their product, believing a familiar sound will
snap consumers to attention.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, Robert Mitchum was the voice for the beef
industry and Oppenheimer, the brokerage firm. Dick Cavett did
commercials for, among others, AT&AMP;T. Richard Dreyfuss was the
unseen voice behind certain previous Apple Computer ads and is now
the voice behind some Honda commercials. Stars once turned up their
noses at such jobs but now, ``I think there's a realization that
there's no shame in doing commercials,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, new kinds of audio work have opened up, with
books on tape and readings for the blind. And shows like ``The
Simpsons'' have led to a resurgence in animation, with a need for
voices. ``Business has just boomed,'' Music said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Technology has also brought higher earnings _ for some. New,
ultra-clear integrated services digital network, or ISDN, phone
lines mean that a voice actor can be directed and even recorded by
a producer at another site.
</P>
<P>
   That means voice actors can live anywhere and still perform,
said Hedquist, who moved from the Northeast to Fairfield, Iowa, to
live among followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and
transcendental meditation. Some top voice actors have ISDN lines in
their home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect, however, has been to concentrate business in
the vocal cords of a few dozen actors in New York and Los Angeles
rather than to spread out the work. If the talent can be in a
backwater town, so can the ad agency or production house that
decides it wants to use big-city talent rather than the local guy.
``Twenty years ago, I used to use a lot of Dallas talent,'' said
Poppy Sundeen, a Dallas writer and producer who creates broadcast
commercials. ``Now, a lot of the time I will just cast someone in
L.A. or New York, and I don't even think about the Dallas talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Music produced such sitcom hits as ``The Bob Newhart Show'' and
``Rhoda'' before becoming a voice. He credits himself with helping
to usher in a more natural sound. Starting in the '70s as the voice
of Carlton the Doorman on ``Rhoda,'' he expanded into other roles
after an agent told him he could make money with his throat. ``I
made the transition from being a big-time Hollywood mogul to being
a voice actor,'' he dead-panned in his laconic Garfield voice.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward more natural voices is such that although radio
deejays used to do a lot of the ads, having a producer find out you
are a radio announcer now can be ``the kiss of death,'' said
Hedquist, who started out as a deejay 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a move away from the resonant, older male voice to
younger men and to women, said Jim Kennelly, owner of Lotas
Productions, a New York company that provides voice talent for
radio and TV voice-overs.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1980s, the Woman's Voice-Over Committee of the New
York branch of the Screen Actors Guild complained that 80 percent
to 90 percent of all voice-over work was being done by men. It
commissioned a study that showed that women could also be effective
voices. More women are being used now, Hedquist said, although men
still dominate the business. A 1995 study showed that 75 percent of
voice-overs were done by men, said Rafe Greenlee, of the Screen
Actors Guild, which represents film actors as well as some
performers on TV and commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Younger men _ especially those with voice attitude _ have gained
as advertisers reach out to Generation Xers. One of the hottest
voices today belongs to a young New Yorker named Paul Christie, who
plays the wise-guy lizard on the popular Budweiser beer
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The lizard, through his agent, refused to talk. Budweiser's
lizards and frogs croak only in character, said Bill Etling,
spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Inc., the company that makes the beer.
The brewery wants the humans behind Louie, Frank, Bud, Weis and Er
to remain anonymous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some voices never go out of style.
</P>
<P>
   The deep-throated growl of Thurl Ravenscroft, an 84-year-old
voice actor and singer, is still going strong for Kellogg's Frosted
Flakes after 46 years. Ravenscroft said he moved from Nebraska to
California in the '30s, hoping to become a set designer or interior
decorator but was sidetracked into singing for commercials and _
off camera _ in movies. Through the years he has been heard as the
soloist in ``Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,'' the
Russian wolfhound in ``Lady and the Tramp'' and a mouse in
``Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   He snared the role of Tony the Tiger because Kellogg Co. knew
him from his singing in another of its commercials.
</P>

   He still remembers the day in 1952 when he went to a studio to
make the first Tony the Tiger spot. According to the script, he
recalled, ``Tony would say, `Good? Why they're great' '' _ but in a
regular voice. ``I said we had to do something with the word
`great' _ to make it explode _ to make it special.''
</P>
<P>
   And voice acting history was made.

COMMENTARY: ANYTHING GOES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a headline in The New York Times Wednesday
that said, ``The Holocaust as a Teaching Tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was about the use of a CD-ROM, produced by Steven
Spielberg, to bring the lessons of the Holocaust to a group of
struggling high school students on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   If the story had been about Alfonse D'Amato, the headline might
have read, ``The Holocaust as a Political Tool.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, New York's undistinguished junior senator showed up
at the Holocaust Memorial Wall on First Avenue, across from the
United Nations, to claim, in effect, that his Jewish opponent, Rep.
Charles Schumer, does not care as much as he should about issues of
concern to Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very low blow, but we should expect that by now. You
want ethnic politics? You want divisive politics? You want the
trivialization of a profound and tragic moment in history? Welcome
to the campaign of Al D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to D'Amato's self-righteous ranting about one of
Schumer's alleged offenses:
</P>
<P>
   ``He missed the vote to make the Capitol Rotunda available for a
magnificent Holocaust commemoration ceremony. That's the
difference. I've been there. I understand that you've got to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Been there? The vote to use the Capitol Rotunda was a routine
measure that passed 406-0. To suggest somehow that missing that
vote was an offense against the Jewish community was disgusting.
The truth is that Al D'Amato is in the race of his life and has
been flailing about from the beginning for an issue _ any issue _
that would stave off Schumer and secure for D'Amato a fourth
six-year term in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As Judith Hope, the state Democratic chairman, remarked:
``There's nothing Al D'Amato would not do for a vote. He would have
a carnival at a Holocaust memorial if he thought it would get him
another vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This election should have been about the fundamental differences
between the two candidates _ on abortion, on gun control, on
education and the environment, on foreign policy. But D'Amato is a
particularly slippery politician who deftly conceals much of what
he really stands for, while his outrageous attacks on his opponents
get tremendous attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, after 18 years in the Senate, most New York voters do
not realize that he is one of the most unrelenting opponents of
abortion in Congress, or that he has an abysmal record when it
comes to support for federal aid to education.
</P>
<P>
   His instinct for the negative has served him well. He has turned
back one Democratic challenger after another since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been a senator all of that time, but he has had a
lot of trouble acting like one. If you want a sense of dignity with
your senator, you will have to look elsewhere. D'Amato once
criticized a Democratic anti-crime bill by standing up in the
Senate and singing, to the tune of ``Old MacDonald Had a Farm'':
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton had a bill, E-I-E-I-O. And in that bill was
lots of pork, E-I-E-I-O ...''
</P>
<P>
   He had to apologize on the Senate floor in 1995 after he went on
the radio and used a mock Japanese accent to ridicule Judge Lance
Ito, the trial judge in the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, at a solemn ceremony in lower Manhattan at which
ground was broken for the city's Holocaust memorial, D'Amato
erupted in a thuggish display of threats and curses because he was
dissatisfied with the seating arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote at the time: ``Onlookers were astonished as they watched
Mr. D'Amato confront Martin Algaze, an aide to Deputy Mayor Fran
Reiter. `I thought he was going to hit me,' said Mr. Algaze. `He
said, ``I'm a U.S. senator! Who moved my seat?'' And then he
started cursing.'''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato apparently thought that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, with
whom he was feuding, had ordered his seat moved to a less prominent
spot. He said he would show Giuliani the difference ``between a
United States senator and first-term mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Al D'Amato can't help himself. He may be a U.S. senator, but his
instincts and behavior patterns are closer to those of a mindless,
disrespectful adolescent. He's an embarrassment in search of six
more years.

 &HT;    TALKS AT MIDDLE EAST SUMMIT BOG DOWN, ISRAELIS THREATEN TO LEAVE
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-SCENE-1022.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Working to push the parties to an
Israeli-Palestinian negotiating marathon the final steps toward the
finish line, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright challenged
both sides Wednesday to embrace a U.S.-authored land-for-peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a tense seventh day of negotiations, however, Israelis
threatened to walk out of the talks, Palestinians accused them of
rejecting the American formula and U.S. officials suggested the
summit was oscillating almost hour by hour between failure and
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a roller-coaster,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters gathered at the Wye River conference center in
rural Maryland. ''We can't answer the question of which way this
will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat have been meeting since last Thursday at Wye, under
the auspices of Albright, who has been on hand night and day to try
to shepherd the talks toward a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton, who made five trips to the secluded
retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore during the first six days of
talks, pointedly stayed away Wednesday for the first time since
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent nearly 60 hours talking with, listening to and --
figuratively, if not literally -- holding the hands of the two
leaders, Clinton was sending a signal to Netanyahu and Arafat that
there were limits to the time he was willing to invest in the
talks, unless they were advancing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has been very closely and personally engaged in
trying to build an atmosphere where the parties can make the tough
choices they need to make to move
</P>
<P>
   forward,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ''The
parties need to work through the issues that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House left open the possibility that Clinton might
return to Wye on Thursday, if that's what it takes to close a deal
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Albright presented Arafat and Netanyahu with a
text of what the United States regards as points of agreement, and
remaining issues of contention, in efforts to move the two parties
beyond a 19-month stalemate in the peace process set in motion by
the 1993 Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart described the text as a ''working document,'' and said
it was meant to lay out a set of road maps toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will codify some agreements that have been reached and
focus attention on the
</P>
<P>
   significant gaps that remain,'' Lockhart told reporters at a
White House briefing. ''I think that's where the proper focus is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. text, which was not made public, centered around the
core issue in an Israeli-Palestinian dispute that spans half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for Israeli troops to withdraw, in phases, from an
additional 13 percent of the occupied West Bank, and hand over
control of the territory to Palestinians, in a deal that would
eventually leave the Palestinians with authority over 40 percent of
the West Bank lands c aptured during the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Palestinians, aided by the U.S. intelligence
community, would launch an aggressive campaign against terrorists
who target Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that Israeli negotiators had rejected the U.S. plan,
Palestinian spokesman Ahmed Tibi broke with a U.S.-imposed news
blackout to talk with reporters at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Tibi appealed to the Israelis to accept the plan and not to walk
out on the talks, as Israelis threatened to do several times
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there will be substantial progress, we will stay,''
Netanyahu said in a statement, the Associasted Press reported. ``If
not, we will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibi said, however, that it was the Israelis who were bogging
down the talks by rejecting the U.S. plan. ''We said 'Yes' to the
American initiative,'' Tibi told CNN television network. For
Israelis to back out of the summit without an agreement, Tibi
added, ''would be a dangerous step, very unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said that he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state by May 4 unless a permanent Palestinian-Israeli agreement is
reached by then, as called for in the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oslo deadline looming, U.S. officials have cast the Wye
talks as a last-ditch effort to get the peace process moving toward
permanent status talks in time to head off a showdown next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're worried about is that the peace process is off
track, that the interests of the people are suffering,'' Rubin
said. ''In the absence of tough choices on the part of their
leaders, we can't put the process back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rubin, ''We've been here for seven days and seven nights.
The president has spent tens of hours working the issues. We want
to do all we reasonably can do to provide
</P>
<P>
   constructive solutions to real problems. But we can't hold
people here against their will, and we can't make them make the
tough choices.''

MEXICAN LAWMAKERS PROTEST PROPOSED TEXAS NUCLEAR DUMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, S.C., Utah, Wash.)  (rk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the Texas state environmental agency set to
meet on Thursday to decide whether to license a proposed dump for
storing out-of-state low-level nuclear waste about 20 miles from
Mexico's border, a group of Mexican lawmakers has been in Austin
since Saturday trying to persuade the state to relocate the
proposed site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's a low-level risk, why are they burying all this
material so close to the border where it will affect our water?''
Carlos Camacho Alcazar, a Mexican congressman who represents the
border city of Ciudad Juarez, said inside a cramped mobile home
parked a few dozen yards from the governor's official residence
here.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho, a member National Action Party, arrived in Austin with
more than a dozen other Mexican lawmakers as part of their
continuing effort to meet with Gov. George Bush. Two of the
lawmakers have been fasting in anticipation of the vote, by the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Although Camacho and several other Mexican lawmakers met this
week with the Texas Secretary of State Alberto Gonzales, and asked
for a meeting with Bush, the governor has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said that he had already
met with all of the governors of Mexico's border states and that he
had discussed the project with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regulatory process,'' Edwards said. ``It's not
appropriate for political leaders to intervene in a scientific
regulatory process. Governor Bush believes the people of Texas want
regulatory issues to be based on science and public health and
safety and not on politics.''
</P>
<P>
   If the project is approved, as is expected, the town of Sierra
Blanca _ 90 miles southeast of El Paso, with 600 residents,
two-thirds Hispanic, and a per capita income of $8,000 _ would be
the site.
</P>
<P>
   It would make Texas the fourth state with a low-level
radioactive waste site. The others are South Carolina, Utah and
Washington. The Sierra Blanca site would receive low-level
radioactive waste from Maine and Vermont under a compact that was
approved last month by Congress and signed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho asserts that if the permit is approved, ``West Texas is
going to turn into the trash dump of the world and we consider that
racial discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   David Frederick, a lawyer for the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense
Fund, points out that Bush has said he wants to get 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote for his re-election bid. ``I don't see how he's
going to get it if his appointees approve the license for the
dump,'' said Frederick, who said the permit should be turned down
for technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In July, two state administrative law judges ruled that the
license for the waste site should be rejected because it did not
include a thorough geological survey of the region. The judges also
said the dump could degrade the quality of life for residents of
Sierra Blanca, despite the economic benefits from such a project.

from the Glendale Fire Department _ think they stand a good chance
at winning the contest's men's division: It's more or less what
they do for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like in our jobs,'' said Team Firestorm's Eric
Andrade, 33, of Seal Beach. ``We don't know what to expect. We have
to put a game plan together and attack each event as it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for its ``mystery'' events, the Hi-Tec Adventure Racing
Series _ part of a new genre of ``extreme'' races _ throws surprise
tasks into the primary running, cycling and kayaking elements to
test the emotional mettle and teamwork of participants. (See
related story.) It could be as simple as having to give up one
shoelace before the run or as difficult as carrying a teammate
across a wooden beam without the suspended person touching the
beam.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade and his teammates feel particularly suited for the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit you with special circumstances and you never know
what it is. We'll apply what we do in the fire service,'' said Bob
Doyle, 34, of Saugus, a captain of a fire-truck company who doubles
as the Team Firestorm captain. ``It's a chain of command. I'm the
team leader and we apply the same process in which we do in the
fire business: gather information, take input, make a decision and
execute it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have an advantage, because other people aren't used
to working in that environment. The more of those elements of
surprise, uncertainty, hardship _ any of those types of obstacles _
the better off we are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem-solving aside, these guys _ cookie cutter-sized at
6-foot-1 or 6-foot-2 and 195 to 200 pounds _ are superior athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle is a former reconnaissance Marine _ one of the ``genetic
freaks of society,'' as he calls his counterparts, who at
200-plus-pounds can run 5-minute miles AND bench-press 380 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Andrade was on the receiving end of Steve
Beuerlein passes at Anaheim's Servite High School. He missed the
cut during training camp with the Miami Dolphins in 1988, but he
went on to play pro football in Italy, Edmonton and with the
arena-ball Charlotte Rage.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the team is Mike Richardson, 41, of Burbank, a
former gold medalist in the California State Fireman Olympics
``toughest competitor alive'' decathlon _ 100-meter swim, 100-meter
sprint, 5K run, obstacle course, the number of sit-ups in 90
seconds and total repetitions bench-pressing 80 percent of the
competitor's body weight.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson heard about the Hi-Tec event from some Glendale
police officers who participated last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they told me, I said, `This thing sounds like it's
something I'd enjoy doing,''' Richardson said. ``This would be a
great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenge is clearly an important criterion for firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather die trying than give up,'' Andrade said. ``That's
how most firemen are. They are extremely competitive, no matter
what they do, even playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that type of person who is attracted to this type of
adventurous job. Sometimes a call is going to take everything you
can give to put out a fire. And our job carries over to our
personal lives, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle agreed, noting, ``Our backgrounds are 100 percent
conducive to adventure racing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivation is to win,'' he said. ``It's a physical, mental
challenge. And after being a fireman for so many years, that's
addictive. There are some serious type-A personalities in the fire
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget about rain, the competition better pray for fire. &QL;

ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR, TRAILING IN POLLS, LOOKS TO COME FROM BEHIND _

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ Part of the political legend of Fob James Jr.,
the pugnacious Republican governor of Alabama, is that he likes to
play from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fob is a strong finisher,'' said Roger McConnell, the state
Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a fourth-quarter player,'' explained Tom Blackerby,
chairman of Conservative Christians of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   So as the clock ticks down in James' campaign for re-election,
his allies are trying to convince voters _ and themselves _ that
his current predicament simply reflects the natural order of
things. But even as the James camp brushes off poll after poll
showing him trailing Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman, other Republicans are
getting nervous, and some sound downright defeatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be real surprised if he can pull this one out,'' said one
prominent Republican strategist in Alabama, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the Nov. 3 election, James is not alone. In one
of the real surprises of this very fluid election year, Republican
gubernatorial candidates are locked in tight races in three
conservative Southern states that have voted increasingly
Republican in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, polls have shown that the incumbent
Republican, Gov. David Beasley, holds the thinnest of leads over
his Democratic challenger, Jim Hodges, the former minority leader
of the state House. And in Georgia, where Republican leaders have
asserted that this will be the year they break the Democrats'
126-year lock on the governor's office, Guy W. Millner, a
Republican businessman, is running just ahead of Roy E. Barnes, a
longtime Democratic legislator.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the races hinge on local issues and dynamics,
including the quality of the candidates. And it is certainly
possible that the Republicans will win in all three states. But
several authorities on Southern politics said Wednesday that the
closeness of the races demonstrates that Southern Democrats are
learning the lessons taught by their two most successful mentors,
Georgia Gov. Zell Miller and North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The message, said Wayne Flynt, an historian at Auburn
University, is that there may still be enough core Democrats and
swing voters in the South, including blacks and working-class
whites, to reward Democratic candidates who keep their campaigns
focused on issues like education, jobs and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the issues are all about social concerns, like abortion and
school prayer and vouchers, Republicans win,'' Flynt said. ``But
Democrats can still succeed if they can make the case that they are
the party of the common people, and that the Republicans are the
party of big business and the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that theory being tested more than in the Alabama
race. During the last two years, James has earned a national
reputation for his fervent stands in support of school prayer and
state autonomy from federal control. But even diehard Republicans
acknowledge that he has allowed Siegelman to control the discourse
of this year's campaign with a proposal for a lottery to finance
education.
</P>
<P>
   Four different public polls taken during the first two weeks of
October showed James behind by between 5 and 13 percentage points.
He has raised significantly less money than Siegelman, and started
his advertising campaign more than a month later. National
Republican officials consider James the most vulnerable of the 18
Republican governors running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Within Alabama, Republican strategists are grumbling that James
seems to not want his job all that much, and that his seeming
dispassion could hurt fellow Republicans in important races for the
legislature and state Supreme Court. ''There's a feeling that he's
a drag on the ticket,'' one strategist said. ``It's just
frustrating as all get out to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There is enough of an impression of inertia in the James
campaign that its chairman, Montgomery Mayor Emory Folmar, felt the
need to energize the troops with a tough speech at a rally last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the fight in this campaign I'd like to see,''
Folmar said, according to news accounts. He urged James supporters
to resort to ``some scratching, biting and clawing'' in exposing
Siegelman as a liberal, adding, ``I love the smell of napalm early
in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But James does, in fact, have a history of making late dashes to
victory, often with the help of Christian conservatives whose
enthusiasm does not always register in polls. As a challenger in
1994, James trailed Gov. Jim Folsom by 10 percentage points in the
polls with less than a week to go and came back to win by 1
percentage point. In this summer's Republican primary, he was
forced into a runoff and was thought to be in peril but came back
to win by a convincing 12 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his race against Siegelman, James' most significant problem
is the Democrat's popular lottery proposal, which would provide an
estimated $150 million a year to pay for merit-based college
scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and classroom computers. A
disciplined, if scripted, campaigner with an experienced staff,
Siegelman has promoted the lottery relentlessly on the trail, in
his advertising and in debates like the one held here on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have proposed an education plan that will change education
in this state forever,'' Siegelman said in the televised forum. ``I
say yes to a lottery. Fob James says no.''
</P>
<P>
   With the lottery a big success in two of Alabama's neighboring
states, the Siegelman plan has placed James utterly on the
defensive. The governor has responded with a three-pronged
rebuttal. He has proposed a far less ambitious plan for college
scholarships that would be financed with existing state funds. He
has argued that Siegelman will need to raise taxes to pay for his
proposals, even with the lottery. And he has warned that the
lottery would lead to other forms of legalized gambling in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, for instance, James has run a series of
television advertisements that question Siegelman's integrity by
showing his nose growing like an animated Pinnochio. One of them
depicts a cockfight as the narrator asks, ``Why should we believe
Siegelman when he says that later he won't let his gambling friends
sneak other games of chance into Alabama behind his lottery?''
</P>
<P>
   James aides said that the campaign's polling suggests that the
ads have closed the gap significantly in recent days. But it may be
too late to reach swing voters like Brenda J. Crain, a 49-year-old
Mobile woman who owns a used car lot with her husband. Although she
voted for James four years ago, Ms. Crain said she would vote this
year for Siegelman because she agrees that Alabama should have an
education lottery and because she has been embarrassed by some of
James' pronouncements, like his contention that the Bill of Rights
does not apply to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm normally a Republican so this is a hard choice,'' she said
while shopping Tuesday at Bel Air Mall. ``I don't think Fob James
is a bad person but he's just a little more of a backwards type and
Alabama could use a better image. And with the lottery, people are
going to gamble whether it's here or in Florida or Mississippi. The
tax money should stay here in Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie M. Davis, a political scientist at Birmingham Southern
College, said that the lottery had become a wedge issue for
Democrats just as social issues have for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often think of wedge issues as abortion, prayer, that kind
of thing,'' she said. ``But what has happened here is that
Siegelman has used the lottery to pull apart a predictable
Republican constituency.''

ALASKA'S SILVER SHINES IN FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BENNETT J. MINTZ  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ALSWORTH, Alaska _ In the north country the first sprinkle
of snow is called ``termination dust,'' for it signals the
termination of summer and the end of tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   The caribou know fall is approaching and move into protected
valleys and river bottoms. But anglers recognize that summer is on
its last legs by the first flash of coho salmon _ the silver in
Alaska's autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Coho, or silver, salmon begin schooling off the river mouths in
late summer, waiting for fresh water to trigger some long-buried
desire to procreate. By late July, schools are milling around the
brackish estuaries of every river that dumps into Bristol Bay.
Waters to the southeast, around Petersburg, Juneau and Ketchikan,
begin their silver runs from two weeks and a month later.
</P>
<P>
   By early August, anglers at fishing camps or posh resorts begin
their yearly quest anew. The uninitiated are at the ready to absorb
all they can learn from the river veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough finding anywhere to fish this
morning,'' said fishing guide Don Martin as he surveyed the mud
rolling downstream on a bone-chilling mid-August morn following an
all-night rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   After conferring with other guides, our two small parties
concluded that if all were up for a long boat ride downstream,
Mosquito Creek would be best to target the salmon. Mosquito Creek
generally runs clear even after a gully-washer. Pacific Palisades
fly-anglers Leesa and Jay Bingham agreed instead to scout upstream.
</P>
<P>
   With an icy wind whipping our faces, Martin and I motored 20
miles down the Mulchatna River seeking the clean water and spawning
sockeye salmon of Mosquito Creek. Sockeye eggs attract trout and
Arctic char the way Mark McGwire attracts autograph-seekers; a pink
salmon-egg fly pattern or leech imitation fished below the sockeye
almost always results in a feeding trout or char. But the rains had
dirtied Mosquito Creek so badly we couldn't find a hint of sockeye,
and the waters were running too fast to wade comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Martin nosed the boat carefully back into the main Mulchatna
current.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want to do?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the guide,'' I responded. ``Find us some fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks like a guide. A well-worn hat keeps the
near-constant drizzle off his chiseled face; a handgun at the hip
is bear insurance. But Martin is less than typical. During the
winter months he lives in West Los Angeles, plays the stock market
on the Internet and auditions for acting roles.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to be more convincing in his role as a guide; what had
been a long morning was only getting longer with no fish in the
boat. Martin did what Alaska guides do when they're stumped. He
pulled ashore, built a fire and brewed some coffee.
</P>
<P>
   We were at the mouth of Kiefer Creek, a short, clear-running
stream filled with snags and downed spruce trees. It's a great
place to land a boat and even a greater place to look for coho as
they rest in the soft current.
</P>
<P>
   Most anglers reach for a 6- to 8-weight rod capable of casting a
heavy fly to snub the energetic run of a salmon intent on
self-preservation. In some waters, a sink-tip line is needed; in
others, the fish come within a few inches of the surface and a
floating line will be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared this was going to be one of those years when the
silvers don't show or there are so few of them that they're not
worth fishing for.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee was gone and my Snickers bar was halfway eaten when a
10-pound silver salmon, bright as a dime, jumped not 20-feet from
where we stood. And then another. And another. The fresh water from
the overnight rain had done it. The silver salmon were in.
</P>
<P>
   My hands were cold, wet and trembling as I tied on a bright
silver-and-red flash fly. I cast it 10- or 15-feet above where the
salmon had jumped and instantly was rewarded by a fish. The fly was
tied on a barbless hook (``all the easier to let you go, my dear'')
and, after three or four heart-stopping jumps, the salmon tossed it
clear.
</P>
<P>
   I stripped in the line, recast a time or two, and,
!ital!bang!off!, another salmon. And then another. In two hours I
hooked about a dozen, landed six and released all but one, which
took the fly too deeply to remove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is very important up here,'' Martin said. ``At this
time of year, we really need to check all of our spots a couple of
times a day because the fish come in on a tide after a rainstorm
and they could come in at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   We motored back to camp, where the cook quickly converted that
coho into a cocktail-hour pate.
</P>
<P>
   Back from upstream, the envious Binghams reported plenty of
trout and char, but they wouldn't see silver till the next morning,
when we all struck salmon paydirt. Autumn's normal bumper crop of
coho might have turned into a bummer had it not been for the
wait-and-see attitude of the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Three days and 30 hooked salmon later, there was another dusting
of snow _ more termination dust _ and the heavy, moisture-laden
winds of mid-August felt more like November. It was time to come
home from Alaska, richer in silver for the experience.

 THE CARVER TO THE CROWN WAS A SCULPTOR

June Ducas writes on the arts for newspapers and magazines in
England. 
 By JUNE DUCAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There could hardly be a more English artist-craftsman
than Grinling Gibbons. Master carver to the crown, he invented a
decorative style that dominated interiors in England during the
late 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   His name is imbedded in the consciousness of the nation. Windsor
Castle, Hampton Court Palace, the grand country houses like
Badminton, Burghley and Petworth and, of course, St. Paul's
Cathedral all abound with his baroque cascades of fruit, flowers
and foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no instance of a man before Gibbons who gave to wood
the loose and airy lightness of flowers,'' wrote the collector and
man of letters Horace Walpole in 1763.
</P>
<P>
   Today, David Esterly, an American limewood carver with an
academic bent, is Gibbons' foremost evangelist. Having carved an
exact reproduction of a floral garland destroyed in the Hampton
Court fire of 1986 and advised on the restoration of the court, he
is the sine qua non of knowledge on Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, with missionary zeal, he has devised
the first and probably last exhibition of the virtuoso's
masterpieces. The show, ``Grinling Gibbons and the Art of
Carving,'' opened on Thursday at the Victoria and Albert Museum and
runs through Jan. 24, in commemoration of the 350th anniversary of
Gibbons' birth. A companion book will be published next month by
Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibbons' work is an integral part of the architecture in
churches, universities or palatial settings, and therefore too
difficult and fragile to move,'' Esterly says. ``However, I knew
that many restoration projects were in train, presenting a one-off
opportunity to borrow pieces for a display that would encompass his
entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fascinating exhibition, not least because it is
visualized by a single discerning eye, Esterly's. Moreover, he
traces Gibbons' trajectory from the point of view of a woodcarver,
revealing how as the craftsman's self-assurance and proficiency
blossomed, his artistry rose to unsurpassable heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, his dramatic work for Charles II at Windsor in the
1670s is gargantuan in scale, opulent and deeply impressive,''
Esterly says, standing in the King's Dining Room at the castle.
``It brought him royal favor and fame.
</P>
<P>
   But it is eclipsed by the shadow and air and formal rhythm of
his later designs, like the spectacular Carved Room at Petworth
House and the Cosimo panel from the Pitti Palace in Florence. He
lifted the genre of decorative carving above its station into the
high art of sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Lean and lanky with silvery grey moustache and hair, wearing
owlish spectacles, Esterly, 54, has a distinctly professorial mien.
But he speaks with unbookish zest about his hero, animating the
past, breathing life into wall carvings to thrill the listener.
</P>
<P>
   He has great affection for the myth that Gibbons left his
signature pea pod open if he had been paid, closed if he had not.
In the Wren Library at Cambridge, he adds, a blind man was said to
be able to distinguish a Gibbons carving by touch alone.
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in Southern California, Esterly is a Harvard graduate
and a Fulbright Scholar who earned a doctorate from Cambridge in
English literature. He lives in upstate New York with his wife,
Marietta von Bernuth. In the mid-'70s, because of her, he underwent
what can only be described as a Pauline conversion to Gibbons after
a chance encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Before their marriage, Ms. von Bernuth enticed him into the
church of St. James' in Piccadilly to see the reredos, or altar
screens. ``It was the master carver's first commission for Sir
Christopher Wren, the architect,'' he says. ``I was seduced by the
power of the carving, and its capacity to convey the beauty of
nature. It seemed to me beyond belief that a human hand had
fashioned those seashell swags, drooping bellflower chains, birds
with laurel twigs in their beaks and dense whorls of acanthus. My
fate was sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   At first he considered writing a biography of the carver.
However, only fragmentary documents about Gibbons' life and
workshop exist, though records of his payments survive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to fathom the mind and technique of such a genius,
Esterly taught himself to carve. For nearly eight years, in a cold,
drafty cottage in Sussex, he took up his arsenal of chisels,
slavishly copying 17th-century carvings. ``I felt like a pigmy on a
giants shoulder,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It is a romantic tale, equal to the happenstance discovery of
Gibbons himself by John Evelyn. Peering into a cottage window in
Deptford, Evelyn, a courtier, connoisseur and diarist, glimpsed the
22-year-old carver toiling on a nearly complete limewood relief of
``The Crucifixion,'' after Tintoretto. On entering, he was bowled
over by the prodigy's talent. He presented him to the King, Charles
II.
</P>
<P>
   A diary passage on Jan. 18, 1671, records the date: ``I this day
first acquainted his Majestie with that incomparable young man
Gibson, whom I had lately found in an Obscure place, &AMP; that by
meere accident, as I was walking neere a poore solitary thatched
house in a field in our Parish.'' Not long after, Gibbons was
busily employed at Windsor. The rest is history.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rotterdam of English parents in 1648, Gibbons left
Holland three years before this famous meeting. Posterity owes much
to the accident of his birthplace, says Esterly. Trained as a
sculptor, Gibbons has roots as a carver in continental soil.
</P>
<P>
   As shown by the Tintoretto relief, he possessed a set of tools
infinitely superior to those of his English counterparts. Unlike
them, he was also a fluent draftsman and familiar with European
techniques of small-scale modeling in boxwood. On view are many
exquisite pen-and-ink studies that have seldom been seen, some lent
by the Sir John Soane Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   So too is his earliest surviving box relief, King David playing
the harp ringed by cherubs and incised with the Gibbons monogram, a
back-to-back G.G. Owned by Alfred Taubman of Sotheby's, it is
virtually the only Gibbons artifact to have been auctioned for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   In all events, the master carver's glory rests on the fact that
he introduced limewood to England, spurning the native craftsmen's
preference for oak. ``Accepting fine detail, its close grain is
unsurpassed in its response to the chisel,'' Esterly says
reverently.
</P>
<P>
   No connoisseurship is needed to recognize how Gibbons achieved
exquisite effects with thinness of cut and undercutting. It is
plain to see in the delicate execution of a lace cravat worn by
Walpole, in the looping ribbons and ropes in the Kirtlington panel
and in the illusory quality of his trompe l'oeil tableaux of
musical instruments, trumpeting putti and martial trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Known in America as linden wood, freshly carved limewood is pale
and luminous. Sadly, many of the Gibbons treasures that Easterly
has persuaded the British aristocracy (including the Duke of
Devonshire of Chatsworth House) to lend have been darkened by age
and even varnish. Beside them, a frothy white garland of flowers
carved by Esterly underlines the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``With sheer adornment, Gibbons gave lime a rich texture
compensating for its lack of color; he defines form by playing with
light and shade,'' Esterly explains, and advocates restoring at
least some of Gibbons' work to its original lightness.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the Duke of Beaufort, accustomed to the mellow brown of
Gibbons at Badminton, his home near Bath, a house rarely seen by
the public. Certainly, the overmantel that normally hangs in the
duke's private dining room, celebrating the estate's harvest and
the trophies of countryside pursuits, is a revealing example in the
development of Gibbons' career.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1683 for 50 pounds, or about $6,000 in today's money,
the overmantel was widely imitated in other stately homes, making
Gibbons style all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year before, drawing inspiration from sculpture and
still-life painting, he created what is regarded as his supreme
accomplishment _ the Cosimo panel belonging to the Pitti Palace.
Ordered by Charles II as a gift for the Duke of Tuscany, the panel
has not left Florence since 1682. Almost three-dimensional, it is a
dazzling work of art, representing friendship between princes and
the art of peace, when love conquers war.
</P>
<P>
   When the panel arrived at the Victoria and Albert, Esterly says,
he felt like a small boy, opening his most coveted Christmas
present. Understandably so. It represents not only the apex of the
show, but the culmination of a true disciple's endeavor to honor
his demigod.

OLYMPIAN MOCEANU'S FATHER RESPONDS TO ACCUSATIONS HE SQUANDERED HER
MONEY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a tearful, nervous plea, the father of Olympic
gymnast Dominique Moceanu asked his daughter Wednesday to come back
to her parents' Spring, Texas, home and give up her legal fight to
be declared an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love her very much,'' Dumitru Moceanu, 44, said at his
attorney's office. ``And I hope she changes her mind and comes
home, start training again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, 17, filed suit Monday seeking to be declared a legal
adult because her father has allegedly squandered the money she has
earned as one of the world's top gymnasts. Dominique said Tuesday
that her parents have strained their relationship with her by
overemphasizing her career and frequently arguing with her.
</P>
<P>
   A judge signed a temporary restraining order Monday, telling the
parents, who are Romanian immigrants, to stay away from Dominique
until a hearing Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The parents' attorney, Katherine Scardino, said Dominique's
mother Camelia was so distraught over her daughter's recent actions
that she could not attend the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is physically ill,'' Scardino said. ``She cannot get
through five minutes without crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Scardino said Camelia Moceanu received the court order to stay
away from her daughter on Tuesday, the mother's 37th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu declined to discuss the details of his financial
arrangement with his daughter, but did say that a trust fund set up
for Dominique in 1996 paid for a gym he opened last year at 6120
Louetta.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``all her (Dominique's) money went into building the
gym,'' where he said he works 12 hours to 14 hours a day, six days
a week. He said the gym would not be open if it were not surviving
financially.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu declined to say how much the gym cost. His
attorney Scardino said this was because it was unclear if Moceanu
would sue parents for financial losses if she is declared an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Huggins, a family friend who helped with its construction
and is currently helping Dominique hide, said the gym cost about $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to Harris County Appraisal District 1998 property
records, the building and land have total appraised value of $1.03
million, but the value of the land declined from $231,500 to
$185,000 in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique agreed to use the trust fund to build the gym, her
father said. He said she will not have access to the trust fund
until she is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said he has not pressured his daughter to pursue
gymnastics and that he does not argue with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in this allegation, it's not her. We don't
recognize her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Dominique ``has everything a child can possible have,''
including a new Mustang convertible on her birthday, Sept. 30. He
said Dominique asked to trade in her Mercedes for the Mustang, and
he said, ``fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said Dominique's new coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26, whom
he brought from Romania late last year to work at the gym, is ``99
percent responsible'' for what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru said Miscenco encouraged Dominique to run away because
Miscenco wanted a house, car and more money. He said he had already
doubled her salary and ``enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Miscenco, Dumitru Moceanu said two men have
influenced Dominique recently, stressing they are not boyfriends.
One is Jeff Pudlo, a former coach at the Moceanu gym, and the other
is Huggins.
</P>
<P>
   But Dominique, reached at an undisclosed location Wednesday,
said she acted of her own will and ``had to drag'' Miscenco with
her.
</P>
<P>
   She said Miscenco is paid $1,300 a month and offered to train
Dominique for free. Dominique said she makes payments on her car,
while her parents paid for expensive cars in cash.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Miscenco gave her father $3,000 to buy her a car,
which he put in his name. She said her father offered to buy
Miscenco a house next year if she helped Dominique win the 1999
world championships in China, but Miscenco said she did not need a
house.
</P>
<P>
   Pudlo said Tuesday he was fired as a coach Saturday for the same
reasons Dumitru Moceanu fired Miscenco: helping Dominique
understand her situation.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique said she has tried to talk to her parents about her
financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I tried it would get loud and he would tell me he
would take care of it, I was too young to worry about it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said Dumitru Moceanu told Harris County sheriff's
deputies Tuesday night that his daughter had been kidnapped, many
hours after he had been served the temporary restraining order.
Huggins said deputies went to his home at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and
threatened to arrest his wife unless she told them where Dominique
was.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins said his wife didn't know, but she gave them a phone
number for Huggins and he eventually cleared the matter up by
showing authorities the court documents. He said the deputies said
they would advise Dumitru Moceanu of the seriousness of making
false claims.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office could not verify the events, and Dumitru
Moceanu did not want to speak after his press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu is the only member of the 1996 U.S. gold medal
women's gymnastics team still competing in all gymnastics events.
She revived her sagging career in August by becoming the first
non-Russian to win the all-around competition in the Goodwill
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Geza Pozsar, who helped train Dominique for many years, said
from Minneapolis on Wednesday that Miscenco has helped Dominique
improve tremendously as a gymnast. She said Miscenco called him
Saturday ``like a distress call, like she was fired,'' and he
advised her to call the U.S.A. Gymnastics federation.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is not his policy to pry into the relationships his
students have with their parents, so he did not know if Dominique
has been under stress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He said that based on Dominque's recent showings, she stands a
good chance of making the 2000 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Bonhert, spokesman for the Indianapolis-based U.S.A.
Gymnastics, the governing body for U.S. athletes competing in the
sport, said the organization plans to ``provide whatever support
she (Dominique) feels she may need, but we don't know what we can
do financially.'' &QL;

   WHARTON, Texas _ When the Colorado River seeped over its banks
early Wednesday, Irene Edwards began to unplug the appliances and
stuff her clothes in boxes. When it crossed the road and swallowed
her lawn, she called her uncle to get over in a hurry and bring his
trailer. By noon, when it crested the door jam, she was bouncing up
the street with everything she owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting out of here and I'm never coming back,'' said Ms.
Edwards, 21. ``I'm moving way out in the country where the river
doesn't come into your living room.''
</P>
<P>
   After record flooding that has left at least 22 people dead, the
water that began falling last weekend across central and southern
Texas was still trying to find its way to the sea Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the river towns along Texas' broad coastal plain,
like Victoria, had significant sections under water. Some, like
Cuero, were swamped and virtually cut off. And others, like
Wharton, expected that the worst was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rain had diminished to a drizzle and the sun was
beginning to peek through the clouds here and there, the Guadalupe,
the Brazos, the San Bernard, the Colorado and several other smaller
creeks and rivers were all well beyond their banks Wednesday. Some
were not due to crest until Thursday. Fingers of tea-colored water
wrapped around bridges, spilled across fields and reached into
low-lying neighborhoods. And residents up and down the swampy
flatlands said it was the fiercest flooding they had seen in years,
perhaps ever; state emergency officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Further upstream, in towns like Seguin and New Braunfels, at the
edge of the Texas Hill Country, where the flooding had started on
Sunday, people were just beginning to make their way back home, if
they had a home left. Dozens of properties had been wiped away by
the rushing waters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Early estimates, covering only two counties, put the cost of the
damage at more than $400 million and officials predicted that the
eventual figure would run in the billions of dollars as some
flooding was reported in 60 Texas counties. President Clinton
declared 20 of those counties a federal disaster area Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a saying around here that if you stand on a bucket
you can see for two weeks,'' said Wharton County Judge Lawrence
Naiser. ``It's just flat, flat, flat. But that makes it awful hard
to get rid of the water once it's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wharton Mayor Joel Williams addressed an anxious gathering of
about 300 of the town's 11,000 residents Wednesday morning at City
Hall, which was rapidly being transformed into an emergency command
post. By Thursday, he said, much of the city would be under water
and some of the major highways out of town would be impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several communities have had trouble getting many
residents to evacuate. Some, who had been through previous floods,
suspected that officials were exaggerating the danger, others
worried that their property would be looted.
</P>
<P>
   The result in several instances was that people who stayed
behind had to be rescued by boat and helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that we do have in this instance is we have
plenty of advance warning that the water is coming,'' Naiser said.
``So we have some time to try to convince people to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two feet of rain fell over the weekend in parts of central and
southern Texas, when a weather system caused by two hurricanes in
Mexico met cold air pushing down from the north. The hardest of the
rain _ sometimes dropping as much as five inches an hour _ hit
portions of the counties northwest of Houston and north of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths attributed to the storm system occurred on
Sunday and Monday in San Antonio and the counties just to its
north, where the downpour caused flash flooding that surprised and
overwhelmed many residents. The later flooding, from Monday through
Wednesday, has been more predictable, giving people ample warning
and keeping deaths and injuries low, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected the Colorado River to crest at 50 feet
sometime Thursday afternoon in Wharton, at the center of the
country's largest rice-growing region. The previous record of 46
feet was set in 1991. A map was distributed at City Hall showing
the sections of the city that officials believed would be under
water by the time the river crested late Thursday, about
three-fourths of the town. If so, Wharton would end up as hard hit
as Victoria and Cuero on the nearby Guadalupe River, which saw
anywhere from a third to a half of their streets submerged on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected the river to crest at 41 feet on Wednesday, but it
crested at 49 feet on Monday, so a lot of people got caught in
their homes,'' said DeWitt County Judge Ben Prause in a telephone
interview from Cuero, a town of 6,800 that is the county seat.
``The water is just now beginning to go down and people are
starting to try to get back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous flood record for Cuero was 46 feet, set in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety said Wednesday that five
people were still missing in the floods, including a 7-year-old
boy. About 7,000 people were evacuated during the early flooding
between San Antonio and Austin on Saturday night and Sunday, with a
further 8,000 people displaced in the subsequent flooding that
began Monday night.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday morning in Victoria, a city of 60,000 about 35
miles from the Gulf of Mexico, the Guadalupe River had receded to
just over 31 feet, which was still 10 feet above flood stage. It
had crested Tuesday night at nearly 36 feet, breaking a 1936 record
by almost five feet. About 600 homes in the city had suffered water
damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of lost everything,'' said Janna Schmidt, 61, who uses
a wheelchair. ``I haven't been able to get to my apartment to find
out, but I'm told it's underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schmidt, who was at one of five emergency shelters set up in
Victoria, said she was one of the people who ``were being stubborn
and saying I was going to stay'' when emergency officials came to
evacuate her on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schmidt said she resisted leaving because she is infirm and
on a special diet. ``It's a hassle for everybody,'' she said. ``I
didn't want to be a problem, but when it got down to brass tacks, I
decided to go ahead and be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were going door-to-door in the western and northern
sections of Wharton Wednesday asking people to evacuate and getting
transportation for those who had none. An emergency shelter had
been set up at the civic center in nearby El Campo, but by midday
only a handful of Wharton's expected 2,000 evacuees had showed up.
``They're still in denial,'' said Renda King, the city manager's
secretary who had volunteered to work at the shelter. ``We expect
them all to show up at once later today.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Allen, a Wharton resident, sat on a plush chair in his
upholstery shop on a bluff overlooking the river and said he
thought he'd wait it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``See where that water is?'' Allen said. ``It's still three or
four feet below where it was in the 1991 flood.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though city officials warned that it would rise at
least five more feet, he was doubtful. ``They told us all in `91
that we had to get out, that we'd be flooded, and the water didn't
come up much higher than that.''
</P>
<P>
   A line of mobile homes across the gravel road from his shop was
already deserted, and two of them were already under water.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen and a few relatives sat around the dark workshop and
listened to the bleating of the three cows that he kept fenced in
an adjacent field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it starts coming into the shop, then I'll get out,'' Allen
said.

RESEARCHERS FIND WAYS TO MAKE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTS SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two groups of researchers say they have found ways to make bone
marrow transplant operations considerably safer and to expand the
pool of donors.
</P>
<P>
   The unrelated studies, being published on Thursday in The New
England Journal of Medicine, are milestones in the field of
transplantation, and their techniques can be put into use
immediately, Dr. Jon Van Rood, considered the father of bone marrow
transplants, said in a telephone interview from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   With practice, a method described in one of the articles could
eventually double the number of transplant recipients who survive,
Dr. Van Rood said. The other study suggests that, while 30 percent
of patients today never find a suitable match, eventually none may
have to go without a donor, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 transplants worldwide are performed each year on
patients whose marrow, the vascular tissue that fills the cavaties
of most bones, is unable to make sufficient blood, either because
of a genetic defect or because of a disease like leukemia, which
prevents the body from producing the right combination of blood
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Hansen, a transplant expert at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said that the success of bone
marrow transplants varies with the disease and other factors. For
genetic disorders like aplastic anemia, the transplants work about
90 percent of the time. For cancers that affect the bone marrow,
such as chronic myeloid leukemia, transplants can be effective 70
percent of the time, while for acute leukemia the rate is about 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants are considered to be particularly
difficult. A successful transplant can cure fatal diseases, but the
procedure often results in fatal complications of its own. The
transplanted marrow may reject the body and vice versa, the marrow
may die off without taking hold, or infection may overwhelm the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers try to match the bone marrow type of the donor and
recipient, to decrease the chances of an incompatibility that can
cause a fatal rejection. Rejection is determined in large part by
immune system chemicals called HLA antigens (for human leukocyte
group A).
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties lie in determining the characteristics of an
acceptable HLA match, and in having a wide enough pool of donors to
provide the matches.
</P>
<P>
   In one paper, a team from Kyushu University in Japan and other
centers, led by Dr. Takehiko Sasazuki, reported that using a more
sophisticated matching system, relying on DNA rather than just
blood matching in the selection of donors, can double the survival
rates for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Using 440 patients, this was the largest and most complete study
to examine the critical factors in matching, Dr. Van Rood said. The
paper reported that HLA antigens that appear to match by blood-test
techniques actually have a variety of subtypes that can be
identified only by DNA testing. It is the subtypes that may
actually be the most important determination of success.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the subtype of one antigen (HLA-A) was found to be
important for survival during a transplant. For patients who
received marrow matching in this antigen, 63 percent survived the
transplant, while among those who had a mismatch, only 38 percent
survived.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect match between three antigens resulted in 11 percent of
patients developing severe rejection disease, while mismatches of
two or more led to 43 percent of patients getting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One curious finding was that for one antigen, HLA-C, a mismatch
apparently enabled patients to beat their leukemia at a greater
rate. Only 12 percent who did not match suffered a recurrence of
leukemia during the study period, while 23 percent had relapses
when this antigen matched.
</P>
<P>
   For most donors, a near-perfect match provided the best results.
But for those who cannot find a match from their family or from
donor agencies, the second group of researchers suggested a method
that would still make transplant worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Dr. Franco Aversa and his colleagues at the
University of Perugia, Italy, the study said that some bone marrow
previously considered an unacceptable match could be used if it is
treated before the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-treatment removes from the donated marrow most of the
immune system cells, called T-cells; increases by tenfold the
immature cells that will grow into mature blood cells after the
transplant, and makes sure that the patient's own bone marrow is
destroyed before introducing the donated marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 43 patients who received the pre-treatment in the
Italian study were extremely ill, few, if any, were expected to
survive, but 18 months later after the transplants, 12 of the 43
were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Van Rood said that doctors could start using the techniques
right away. ``But if you think of it as a violin performance, when
you hear a good performance, can you immediately do it yourself?''
he said. ``I think not. It will take much work and practice. But
the potential for higher survival is there.''

SERIES COULD CONCLUDE AS THE WORST-RATED EVER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Yankees-Padres World Series could conclude as the lowest
rated ever. Last year's Cleveland-Florida Series yielded the lowest
previous rating, a 16.7.
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, the 13.4 average rating is down four
percent from last year's 14.0. Game 3 on Tuesday posted a 15.4
(down from 15.6 for Game 3 last year). Expectations of a sweep
weren't likely to send Wednesday night's ratings soaring, so
beating 1989's 16.4 ratings low for the World Series is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the ratings are disappointing, but we don't control
the outcome of the games,'' said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for Fox
Sports, who noted that Fox has won the prime-time ratings in all
three World Series nights.
</P>
<P>
   World Series ratings have been in decline since the late 1980s,
a time when baseball was more potent nationally and cable options
less pervasive. Ten years ago, the five-game Oakland-Los Angeles
World Series rated a 23.9. The classic Mets-Boston fall classic in
1986 weighed in with a 28.6.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when a game could generate a Super Bowl-like
40.0 rating, as the sixth game of the 1980 series did. In 1978's
Yankees-Los Angeles series, none of the six games rated below a
30.1.
</P>
<P>
   An education in quantum mechanics is not required to analyze
Fox's ratings. Pick one or more reasons:
</P>
<P>
   (a) The Yankees were huge favorites, facing San Diego, a smaller
market than Atlanta, which was thought to be a more viable
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   (b) Game 1 was competitive, requiring a Yankee comeback to win
9-5, but Game 2 was a blowout almost from the start, souring
viewers enough to stay away early from Game 3, which, though
exciting, put the Yankees up 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   (c) Neither Mark McGwire nor Sammy Sosa was playing.
</P>
<P>
   (d) Viewers were offended by Fox's salacious promos for ``Ally
McBeal'' in which Calista Flockhart scissors-locked John Ritter's
head with her legs, and can't understand why ``That 70's Show'' is
still labeled a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that can salvage decent ratings for Fox
would be a three-game winning streak by San Diego, to set up a
showdown in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not go around feeling sorry for Fox. They knew they
were buying a property that no longer garnered 30 ratings, and even
at lower levels, the ratings have still enabled Fox to win the
ratings on each of the games' nights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shouldn't World Series ratings be soaring, the fitting
coda to a giddy season made special by McGwire and Sosa's home run
records. Weren't we all persuaded that baseball was no longer
recovering, but was back, at full-throttle, ready to maul football
and basketball? What happened to the autumnal afterglow?
</P>
<P>
   Here's one theory: fans were agog about McGwire and Sosa because
of the sense of anticipation that each game promised. If you
weren't a St. Louis or Chicago fan, you cared only about when each
man would hit his next home run.
</P>
<P>
   So even if one man hit a home run in the first inning, the
anticipation that he would hit another later in the game, would
keep you riveted. Adding to the excitement were the days when each
man would homer on the same day, or one would tie the other, or one
would go ahead of the other.
</P>
<P>
   A World Series that begins with the winningest team in American
League history winning the first two games scores doesn't offer
great promise to casual fans who would tune in believing something
special was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the rating for the first half hour of Game 3
was a mere 10.0. It rose rose steadily, peaking at a 17.2 from
10-10:30 p.m., and settling in at a 15.5 in the final half hour.
But the low initial viewer tune-in hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Fox has not pared its on-air efforts, even if the
ratings are down. Tim McCarver's analysis has been stellar without
being repetitive and Joe Buck's play-by-play has mixed the basics,
analysis and wit into a fine brew.
</P>
<P>
   Noting early in Game 3 how groundskeepers at Qualcomm Stadium
had painted the chewed-up outfield with gallons of green paint,
Buck said, ``They say the game isn't played on paper, but this one
is being played on paint.'' Then he asked, ``What kind of hop do
you typically get off paint?'' Bob Brenly, the second analyst,
said, ``It depends if it's oil-based or water-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's production offered tasty morsels like a split-screen
view of how San Diego starter Sterling Hitchcock's wind-up has
changed from 1995 to 1998, a ``hot zone'' batter's graphic overlaid
on the strike zone, and a soundbite of San Diego's Tony Gwynn tell
batting coach Merv Rettenmund, who was wearing a microphone, that
Yankee starter David Cone's fastball didn't have ``giddyap.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's best moment came in the tough criticism leveled by
McCarver and Brenly of Yankee rightfielder Paul O'Neill's errant
throw in the sixth inning, and San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy's
decision not to use closer Trevor Hoffman to start the eighth, not
using Greg Myers to pinch hit for Carlos Hernandez, and wasting the
ace pinch hitter John Vander Wall as a pinch runner.
</P>
<P>
   And, can you believe it? Only one Fox prime-star _ Gillian
Anderson of ``The X Files'' _ was ``found'' by Fox's cameras inside
Qualcomm. There might have been more, but Fox has canceled a bunch
of series lately.

The following article was reported by Benjamin Weiser, Susan Sachs
and David Kocieniewski and was written by Weiser and Ms. Sachs. &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several months after the bombing of the World Trade
Center in February 1993, one of the suspects tried to bargain with
federal prosecutors in New York, offering inside information about
the bomb plot in exchange for a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The deal never materialized, and the defendant was eventually
found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. But the details he
offered in that secret meeting about his Brooklyn-based circle of
Arab militants are resonating today in another terrorism case.
</P>
<P>
   The accused bomber told prosecutors that he had twice turned to
a Texas acquaintance named Wadih el Hage to buy weapons for his
Brooklyn associates. Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges of
being part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspected
of the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how federal investigators followed up the tip
about el Hage that they received in 1993. But after the embassy
bombings, it is evident that they are ascribing new significance to
el Hage's contacts with the Brooklyn militants who figured not only
in the World Trade Center case, but also in the assassination of
Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and a conspiracy to blow up the United
Nations and other New York landmarks in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the government recently asserted for the first time that
the roots of bin Laden's organization could be traced, in part, to
a sparsely furnished office on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that was
called Alkifah Refugee Center and had for many years been a
gathering place for that same fringe group of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said what role, if any, bin Laden is
supposed to have played in the activities of Alkifah Center. Nor
have they said how the center, which has been closed for about five
years, relates to his global campaign to attack Americans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the government's version so far, bin Laden's far-flung
network is presented as a tapestry of personal relationships
between men of different nationalities and backgrounds who share
his determination to rid the Islamic world of American influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, prosecutors now suggest, such
relationships evolved from Alkifah Refugee Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s the strip of Arab restaurants and Islamic
bookstores on Atlantic Avenue, between Third and Fourth streets,
was the first port of call for many immigrants from the Middle East
and North Africa. Notices posted in the shops advertised jobs,
rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic-speaking
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Alkifah Center, in those years, was a neighborhood hub. It
started out as a desk in Al Farooq Mosque around 1986 and then
moved into a small apartment in a building a few doors away at 566
Atlantic Ave., above what is now a perfume factory, with just
enough room for a desk, a few chairs, a phone and a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The center's stated purpose was to raise money and recruit
fighters to help the U.S.-backed Afghan mujahedeen, who rebelled
against the Communist government in Afghanistan after an invasion
by the Soviet Union in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   People in the neighborhood who remember Alkifah Center say it
appeared to be a shoestring operation, although court papers
suggest that tens of thousands of dollars flowed through its bank
accounts in its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was this ramshackle office that the government says evolved
into the American outpost of bin Laden's international terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The center was set up by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian immigrant.
As his former neighbors recall him, Shalabi was infused with the
same religious fervor for the Afghan cause that galvanized many
young Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate a Muslim
country from Communist domination.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who answered the call to fight in Afghanistan was
Mahmud Abouhalima, who was active in militant Islamic movements in
his native Egypt before moving to West Germany in 1981 and to New
York four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima would later become a well-known figure in New York as
one of the men accused in the World Trade Center bombing. Shortly
after his arrest in that case, he met with government investigators
without his lawyer and provided a detailed account of Alkifah
Refugee Center and its internecine rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   He recounted his brief stint with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan
and told of traveling with a Palestinian man he knew as Mohammed
Odeh to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, the staging area for the
Afghan rebels. Abouhalima said they had spent two and a half months
in separate training camps, learning how to use AK-47 assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they joined a militia unit and fought against Soviet
forces with the American-financed mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that remain unclear, prosecutors rebuffed
Abouhalima's offer of cooperation. But his mention of Odeh is
intriguing in light of more recent events.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian man with a similar name and background, Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, has been charged with driving the truck that delivered
the bomb in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. He has
pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to say whether the Odeh charged in
the embassy attack this year is the same Palestinian whose name
surfaced five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 statement to investigators, Abouhalima made no
mention of bin Laden, although bin Laden is known to have worked in
Afghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing official
Saudi aid money for the mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Abouhalima returned to New York in late 1988, the
Afghan war began to wind down. The Soviet Union withdrew the last
of its troops in 1989. Two years later, the United States agreed to
stop supplying arms to fractious Afghan warlords, and Afghanistan
descended into civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Arab men who had gone to fight, including bin Laden,
stayed on but turned their religious fury against secular Arab
governments and, ultimately, the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in postwar Afghanistan echoed in Brooklyn, where
Shalabi kept Alkifah Center open. With the arrival in Brooklyn in
1990 of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was
later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks,
Abouhalima said, the regulars at Alkifah began to quarrel over
money, political direction and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Abouhalima said he had first met el
Hage, a Lebanese-born naturalized American citizen, at an Islamic
conference in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Just how close the two men became is not clear. Abouhalima's
lawyer in his World Trade Center trial, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, said,
``That case is over, and I know nothing of the government's
information or their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But el Hage was familiar with several of the Arab immigrants
associated with Alkifah Center, say prosecutors and the account
that Abouhalima provided investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in court last
month, for example, that el Hage had a relationship with El Sayyid
A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted on federal charges in
slaying of Kahane. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima, who told investigators that he had been in charge of
protecting Sheik Abdel Rahman during the cleric's stay in the
United States, told investigators that he had gone at least twice
to el Hage to buy guns. Abouhalima said he obtained a 9-millimeter
handgun from el Hage in 1990 for use by the cleric's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima also told investigators that he later gave el Hage
$4,000 to buy handguns and AK-47s to defend his associates from the
Jewish Defense League in New York, an organization founded by
Kahane. Abouhalima said el Hage had been unable to obtain the
weapons and returned most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the transaction was not made clear.
</P>
<P>
   The government cited the weapons transaction in a court hearing
last month to persuade a federal magistrate to deny bail to el
Hage. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said el Hage had acknowledged
dealings with Abouhalima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant has admitted that while in Texas he made efforts
to obtain firearms for Mahmud Abouhalima,'' Fitzgerald said. ``His
claim is that after purchasing the firearms, Mr. Abouhalima failed
to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima told investigators of other contacts with el Hage. He
said that el Hage called him from Texas in early 1991 and said
Shalabi wanted him to come to New York to help resolve a conflict
within Alkifah Center. At the time, Shalabi's leadership was under
fire from dissidents within his circle, including Abouhalima.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did come to New York. A short time later, Shalabi was
found slain in his Brooklyn apartment. No one has been charged, and
the crime remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima said he and el Hage had met one more time in Al
Farooq Mosque on Atlantic Avenue, a few doors from Alkifah Center.
The topic of discussion, he said, was Shalabi's troubles and his
recent killing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that by 1994, el Hage moved his wife and
children to Sudan, where neighbors said they knew him as the
director of Africa Help, a private aid organization. But the
government said he was the private secretary to bin Laden, who by
then had relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the government said, el Hage moved to Kenya,
where he shared a house for a time with a man named Haroun Fazil
and helped bin Laden set up some of his front companies in Africa.
Fazil is accused of playing a role in the August embassy bombings
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The government appears to have been tracking el Hage for at
least a year before the embassy bombings. In September of last
year, he was pointedly questioned by federal agents investigating
bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, who moved back to the United States in 1997, has
pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans and
of lying to federal agents. In court his lawyer, Bruce McIntyre,
denied that his client had any connection to terrorist activities.
McIntyre could not be reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Arab immigrants still congregate along the little
strip of shops on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab food and novelties
are sold alongside Islamic books. A few thousand pray at Al Farooq
Mosque at the main Friday prayers, but it no longer has a
reputation as a hotbed of radical Islamic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men who were drawn to Alkifah Center in its
turbulent days have melted quietly back into their communities, say
people in the neighborhood familiar with the center's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994 this mosque finally settled down,'' said Abdulhakim
Ali Mohamed, the American-born religious scholar who became the
imam, or leader, of the mosque three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one is permitted to misuse the mosque to preach politics or
hate, he added. ``If there's anything to say,'' Mohamed said,
``I'll say it.''

BIG BUDGET INCREASE FOR INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS IS APPROVED
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-ASSESS) 
(sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heeding warnings from the director of central
intelligence that the CIA ``will no longer be relevant'' without an
infusion of money and talent, Congress and the White House on
Wednesday approved the largest spending increase for intelligence
in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The director, George Tenet, has been telling members of Congress
that the machine of U.S. intelligence might rust and falter in the
coming decade without an injection of billions of dollars. He
received secret ``emergency assistance'' from Congress in April,
and on Wednesday, officials said, he received a supplemental
appropriation of about $1.8 billion. In budget requests for coming
years he will seek billions more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow the CIA to become a second-rate
organization,'' he told its employees recently.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, American intelligence has failed to foresee
India's nuclear tests, to quickly and accurately assess a North
Korean missile launch, to come up with a workable plan to undermine
the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, and to provide sharp analysis of
global financial crises. The CIA's evidence to justify a cruise
missile attack on the Sudan in August has been questioned by
administration officials and within the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   These problems illustrate shortcomings in the intelligence
agencies' abilities to analyze world events and to undertake secret
operations, say supporters and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   But intelligence officials and congressional overseers caution
that some of those abilities will take years to build and cannot be
created by money alone. They say _ and CIA officials acknowledge _
that the agency must attract a new generation of talented people:
not just spies, but computer wizards, scientists, engineers,
economists, and experts in foreign languages, cultures and other
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet has warned his employees and members of Congress that the
agency, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, would not
see its 60th year without the money to become smarter, faster and
sharper. This year he undertook a campaign to restore the agency to
its cold-war strength.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 5 speech at the agency, which has not previously been
made public, he said the CIA had to ``rebuild our field strength''
in order ``to stay in the espionage business.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged ``to mount increasingly complex and expensive
operations'' to steal secrets. He vowed to build up the agency's
clandestine service of spies, open more overseas stations,
undertake more covert operations, hire more in-house experts, buy
faster and better computers, and bring in a new generation of
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, moving ahead without more money would be
difficult,'' he said in the speech, which became a basis for his
requests for the billions he says are needed to create a skilled
and agile intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to pay for it all?'' he asked. ``I will work
with the administration and Congress to obtain more funding.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Tenet has done just that, buttonholing
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and key lawmakers.
He convinced them that American intelligence was ``seriously
eroding'' and needed rebuilding, said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.,
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intelligence isn't just something for the cold war,'' Goss, a
former CIA operations officer, said in an interview. ``When you
think back to Pearl Harbor, you can understand why. Unpleasant
surprises are out there, like embassies being blown up. We finally
have a very clear manifestation of a commitment that we are going
to invest in intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The retirement of several thousand employees since 1991 has cost
the CIA a great deal of talent and experience. Past and present
agency officials say those people left because the cold war ended
and lesser missions did not interest them, because they did not
like the Clinton administration, because morale sagged as five
different directors led the CIA over six years, and because of a
lack of spirit, which Tenet is trying to revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the agency have enough people on board to deal with the
challenges it's facing? Not enough,'' said Fred Hitz, who retired
after a long CIA career, including eight years as inspector
general. ``Our stocks have been severely depleted. Trying to
replace these individuals, the knowledge they took out the door,
the elan and the sense of mission that they had is a very difficult
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   An intelligence official outside the agency said that ``the
brain drain can be remedied,'' but ``it's going to take five, six,
seven years of steady rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence officials said that money was not the sole
solution, but that the CIA and the other intelligence services were
assured of more in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to throw money at them,'' one said. ``But this
is not a binge. This is not a one-time huge shot of money. This is
an upward glide'' that Congress intends to continue for years.
</P>
<P>
   The overall budget for intelligence will rise by about 7
percent, to about $29 billion, close to the figure at which it
peaked during the cold war, without accounting for inflation. The
money finances the CIA and a dozen other intelligence services; the
CIA spends about a tenth of the sum.
</P>
<P>
   The spending figures have traditionally been kept secret. But
the increase approved on Wednesday appears to be the largest since
1984, the last of four years when President Reagan's director of
central intelligence, William Casey, presided over
multibillion-dollar annual spending increases, undertook scores of
covert operations and hired several thousand new CIA officers.

AUTO CLUB RESUMES TRACKING GAS PRICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gasoline supplies are plentiful. Adjusted for
inflation, prices are near historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   But the Automobile Club of Southern California is reviving a
relic of the Arab oil embargo when consumers were stuck in long
lines at service stations and purchases were restricted to odd and
even days, depending on license plate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The auto club's monthly ``Fuel Gauge Report'' is back for the
first time in about a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   So residents in the Southern California suburb of Burbank can
find out whether they're getting a good deal on the three grades of
gasoline and diesel fuel compared to someone living 20 miles west
across the San Fernando Valley in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   And if a traveler is planning a road trip to Inyo or Tulare
counties he or she can figure out how much to budget for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this month the average price of a gallon of regular
gasoline cost $1.1678 a gallon in Burbank, or about three-tenths of
a cent cheaper than in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   If a traveler is headed to California's Mammoth Lakes and
stopped in Bishop it would cost $1.3035 a gallon, the most
expensive price in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are supplied to the organization by Oil Price Information
Service of Lakewood, N.J., which also does the organization's
national survey.
</P>
<P>
   California still is the high-price leader when it comes to fuel.
The average price for a gallon of regular in Southern California
this month was $1.183; the average was $1.195 across the state and
$1.066 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Auto club spokeswoman Carol Thorp said the organization is just
responding to consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept getting calls for it, particularly around the
holidays,'' she said. ``But we also got calls whenever prices
shifted up or down. There was a need out there and we are in a
position to fill it.''

 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr offered a broad
defense Wednesday to the repeated criticism that he had overreached
in his investigation of President Clinton's inner circle, using the
forum of an appeals court where he sought to reinstate his criminal
tax case against Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Starr ridiculed as a ``Larry King, bumper sticker argument'' the
accusation that he had gone far beyond his original assignment of
investigating a decades-old land deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a red herring,'' he said. ``It is a shibboleth to think
that this had to do only with a real estate deal in Marion, Ark.
The mandate we were granted in 1994 was much broader than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing Wednesday before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia presented a spirited dialogue about
the limits of the independent counsel's investigation, the
perogatives of the attorney general and the role of the judiciary
in overseeing the two.
</P>
<P>
   And while the precise legal issue before the court primarily
involved the fate of Hubbell, Starr's presentation had clear
resonance in the heated political debate over whether he had
stepped beyond his charter when he began investigating the
relationship between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a seasoned appellate advocate who once served on the
bench that he was arguing before Wednesday, was
uncharacteristically combative and defensive as he talked about the
Hubbell case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing exactly now what I did in 1994 and not a peep was
raised,'' Starr said, waving his arms in exasperation. ``I
shouldn't say me. I'm getting personal. The independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years ago Hubbell, an old friend of Clinton and
former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Rose firm in
Little Rock, pleaded guilty to two felony counts for looting his
former partners and clients. As part of his plea bargain, he agreed
to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But after prosecutors said he was not forthcoming, they filed a
second case against him last April, charging him with conspiracy,
tax evasion and mail fraud in a 10-count indictment based on
financial records Hubbell provided them under a grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   That indictment was dismissed last July by federal District
Judge James Robertson. In agreeing with the legal arguments put
forward by Hubbell's main lawyer, John Nields Jr., Robertson
chastised the independent counsel's tactics, accusing Starr of both
exceeding his authority and reneging on the immunity promise.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also ruled that a special court that appoints and
supervises independent counsels had overstepped its authority last
January when it confirmed Starr's jurisdiction to proceed with the
tax inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The tax case arose out of Starr's investigation of Hubbell and
others for possible obstruction of justice stemming from consulting
payments he received in 1994. Prosecutors have said that Hubbell
accepted more than $700,000 in contracts from friends and
supporters of Clinton at a time when he was unhelpful to
investigators. Hubbell has replied that he told investigators
everything he knew and that he performed legitimate work for the
money he received.
</P>
<P>
   Among those figures who helped Hubbell find jobs was Vernon
Jordan, the president's close friend, who also helped Ms. Lewinsky
find a job in New York earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Starr suggested that he had significant evidence of obstruction
involving Hubbell and that that aspect of the inquiry was not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about literally hundreds of thousands of
dollars in business in which virtually no service was performed,''
Starr told the appeals panel. ``And each of these came from
entities with political ties to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But a defense lawyer, K. Chris Todd, said that it was
inappropriate for Starr to raise the specter of obstruction when
the indictment did not raise any obstruction charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where guidance can be given not to this
independent counsel but every independent counsel about the excess
of power,'' said Todd, who represents Michael Schaufele, one of
Hubbell's tax advisers who was also named in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Through their aggressive questioning of both sides and close
parsing of the independent counsel law, the judges did not
telegraph the outcome of the appeal, although they appeared more
sympathetic to Starr than the lower court on his claim that he had
jurisdiction to bring the tax case. The appeals panel consisted of
Patricia Wald, Stephen Williams and David Tatel.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has intervened in the case, taking a
middle-ground position about the ruling by Robertson. It has asked
the appeals panel to uphold Robertson's ruling that Starr exceeded
his authority because he did not initially seek the permission of
Attorney General Janet Reno to get into the case.
</P>
<P>
   The department has maintained that Robertson erred on the
immunity question and that Starr's limited grant of immunity to
Hubbell for the production of business records did not prevent him
from being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a suggestion in the Justice Department's brief,
Starr sent a letter to the attorney general last week formally
asking for her approval to move forward against Hubbell on the tax
matter, according to lawyers who have seen the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Wednesday that Reno removed
herself from considering the request because Hubbell, as associate
attorney general, had been a close aide. The request is now being
considered by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.

 ARVADA, Colo.: tax incentives. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this month, and again in late 1978, that
vengeful Middle Eastern oil exporters squeezed their supplies to
the United States and raised prices worldwide. A nation that was
virtually self-sufficient into the 1950s had become a petroleum
captive. Gasoline prices soared, lines at the pump stretched beyond
frustration and the economy fell into repeated recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans turned down their thermostats and bought
fuel-efficient Hondas, Datsuns and Toyotas. At work, they replaced
millions of inefficient motors, lighting fixtures and generators.
Nixon called for a national effort on the scale of the making of
the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us set as our national goal,'' he said, ``with the
determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this
decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy
needs without depending on any foreign energy source.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, wearing a sweater in a televised speech to drive home
his point, termed energy conservation the equivalent of fighting a
war.
</P>
<P>
   But traumatic memories of oil shocks have long been soothed by
plentiful, low-cost supplies. At about $1 a gallon _ compared with
$1.10, adjusting for inflation, in 1973 _ fuel is as cheap as ever.
U.S. gasoline prices remain less than half those in Western Europe
and Japan, where energy is heavily taxed to discourage overuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that, in the
absence of efforts to curb growing energy use, carbon emissions
from burning fuel will rise 34 percent from 1990 to 2010, while the
president has pledged to lower them by 7 percent. The agency's
experts scoff at the prospects of meeting Clinton's goal unless
energy prices rise significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our actions rather than words, it's evident we
don't care,'' said Dwight French, a specialist on consumption
trends. ``Only the next crisis will again make conservation a
priority. End of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arvada, in the subdivisions carved into the sagebrush
hills of Denver's suburbs, the McCrackens' new home will have far
more efficient heating, air-conditioning and major appliances than
the homes of 25 years ago. Modern weatherstripping and vinyl-sealed
windows will help keep the Colorado cold out and the heat in. In
energy consumption per square foot, the home of the late 1990s is
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But not the overall champion. Since the early 1970s, the average
size of a new home has risen to 2,100 square feet from 1,600, even
as the average household has shrunk to three people from 3.6.
``It's almost like the trend to sport utility vehicles,'' said Donn
Eley, chief financial officer of Village Homes, the McCrackens'
builder. ``They can't build them big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Home builders are also bringing to tract homes the expansive
features once reserved for mansions. ``Wow factors,'' they are
called in the trade. In the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, the
confined quarters of yesteryear just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Larger homes with fewer people but more things to plug in have
pushed home energy consumption back to the levels of the 1970s.
Residential energy consumption per person fell by a tenth from 1973
to 1983 but has since risen about as much.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter federal standards for homes and major appliances promise
to save enough energy over the coming years to offset what goes to
heat and cool larger homes. But then come the computers,
videocassette recorders, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers
that have been using about 5 percent more energy a year since 1990.
Early in the next decade, the Energy Department predicts, such
appliances will consume even more energy than heating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these devices are always on, ready at the push of a
button. Razors and electric toothbrushes have chargers, fax
machines are poised to send and receive, televisions and
videocassette recorders merely go dormant, not off.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these items use more power than a refrigerator.
``They're called vampires,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, a senior
adviser for efficiency at the Energy Department. ``They suck
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Central air-conditioning, in less than 40 percent of new homes
in 1971, is now in more than 80 percent. Dishwashers have gone from
luxuries, found in 19 percent of households in 1970, toward
necessities, found in 57 percent as of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The standard ceiling height has risen to nine feet from eight,
meaning more space to heat and cool. ``Even though the efficiency
of larger homes has improved,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, research
director for the National Association of Home Builders, ``the total
volume, the use of glass, the fireplaces and the appliances lead to
higher energy consumption. They will not buy a home without these
energy-inefficient features.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coloradans who believe weekends were made for hiking and
cross-country skiing, the McCrackens, trim 31-year-olds, say they
would like to live greener. To save water and energy, they plan to
pay about $300 extra for a high-efficiency washer and dryer.
McCracken has even joined the declining 5 percent of Americans who
ride mass transit _ for him a bus _ to his job as a consultant and
programmer for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But their new house, like many today, is another story. Join the
McCrackens in the Wyndham Park subdivision as they open the door to
a 2,600-square-foot model home like the one they are buying nearby
for $270,000. A towering entryway and its clerestory windows tilt
their gazes upward. The two-story, 21-foot spaces continue on into
the living room and the family room, with nine-foot elevations
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about this is the high ceilings,'' Mrs. McCracken
volunteered. ``I know they are terribly inefficient. But it does
make it seem so spacious.''

 ARVADA, Colo.: so spacious.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her husband was nodding as Jack Zelkin, a senior marketing
executive with the builder, listed the features. McCracken was
already making plans to take advantage of the upgraded phone, cable
and data wiring, for internal video and computer networks, that
became standard a year ago, even in homes costing less than
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saving energy has become a dormant issue, said Zelkin, who was
once an energy-efficiency expert for the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a tree-hugging, granola-eating, environmental zealot,'' he
said. ``But if you give these buyers a choice between a Jacuzzi tub
or extra insulation, they'll take the Jacuzzi tub every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not only living in spacious new homes. They're
also living in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   From her home in Lakewood, another Denver suburb, Mrs. McCracken
has driven her minivan about 20 minutes to Golden to drop off her
daughter at day care. Then it is 10 minutes back to her office in
Lakewood, at Harveys Wagon Wheel Hotel/Casino. Or, a couple of
times a week, she drives 20 minutes to the casino itself in Central
City.
</P>
<P>
   After work, Mrs. McCracken reverses the pattern, often adding a
stop at the King Soopers grocery store, the Blockbuster video store
or the cleaner's.
</P>
<P>
   From her new house, it will be 15 minutes more each way, meaning
that she will spend up to two hours in the car every day.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions of T.C. McCrackens who have entered the work
force have become a prime factor pushing energy use for travel up
12 percent for each American since 1983, back to the previous peak
in 1978. In 1975, only 47 percent of American women with children
younger than 18 were working or looking for work. By 1997, it was
72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many households have almost enough cars to create their own
traffic jams. Nearly one in five households has three or more cars,
up from about one in 25 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters of both sexes also live farther from work. The average
commuting distance grew by more than a third from 1983 to 1995, to
11.6 miles, even as car-pooling and the use of mass transit
declined.
</P>
<P>
   While covering more miles, Americans are getting fewer miles per
gallon now that they are buying nearly equal numbers of cars and
light trucks. Back in 1975, light trucks accounted for only a fifth
of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are meanwhile becoming more powerful. Automakers that once
concentrated on building leaner, more efficient models have instead
been adding the muscle that customers crave. Average horsepower has
risen to 156 in 1996 from 99 in 1982 _ and the time needed to zoom
from zero to 60 has fallen to 10.7 seconds from 14.4.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president for operations at AAA Colorado, Vickie Stark's
job is to encourage travel. But even she decided she was spending
too much time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, a computer network manager, had followed her in
assignments from Washington to Florida to Cheyenne, Wyo., where
they bought a home north of town. When Ms. Stark got a job in
Denver in 1995, he refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   And so Ms. Stark began driving more than two hours each way, or
127 miles, not counting her monthly one-day round trips to each of
six offices elsewhere around the state.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after she began the long haul from Cheyenne, Ms.
Stark made a habit of calling her husband and two children on her
car phone just as she was passing the exit for Windsor, Colo., the
halfway point. ``If we lived here, I'd be home,'' she always said.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, they moved again _ to Windsor. As a family,
they did not save any driving, but they did redistribute it. Her
husband now has a 52-mile trip north, and Ms. Stark a 63-mile trip
south.
</P>
<P>
   All Ms. Stark has sacrificed by moving are bragging rights to
the longest trip to work. Her neighbors next door and just across
the street also work in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, 100-car trains more than a mile long arrive
brimming with coal at the Celanese Ltd. chemical plant near Pampa
in the Texas Panhandle. The trains dump their contents into chutes
that form a pile 10 stories high. Coal dust dances in the flatland
winds.
</P>
<P>
   The coal is burned to boil water, providing the heat for
producing chemicals like acetic acid, which is used in clothing
fibers and plastic parts. The plant also uses enough electricity to
power a city of more than 50,000. In one of the most energy-hungry
industries, Pampa makes chemicals that are twice as energy
intensive per pound as the Celanese average.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, which opened in 1952, initially treated energy as if
it were as cheap and plentiful as the air. Steam and heat were
simply vented.
</P>
<P>
   The oil embargoes of the 1970s brought a new outlook. Steam used
in one process was rerouted to other processes. As a result, Pampa
and other Celanese plants raised their energy efficiency 2 percent
to 3 percent a year through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, with lower energy prices reducing the payoffs,
they have improved at less than half those rates, if at all. ``The
emphasis is simply elsewhere these days,'' said Thomas Parker Jr.,
managing director for tax policy and energy at the Chemical
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Across all businesses, industrial and commercial energy use fell
18 percent from 1973 to 1983, then jumped 37 percent by 1997. The
growing corporate appetite for energy comes despite the economy's
shift from smokestack industries like steelmaking to software and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Managers in many industries say they achieved the easiest energy
savings long ago. ``We picked the low-hanging fruit first, in the
'70s and '80s,'' emphasized Edward Quick, the environmental manager
for Celanese. ``As we move into the 1990s, we're finding the
available technology much more costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Amory Lovins, whose Rocky Mountain Institute promotes energy
efficiency, will hear none of it. He rattles off a half-dozen
technologies like computerized controls that he says the chemical
plants have failed to adequately exploit. ``When the Celanese guys
say you're running out of low-hanging fruit, the only thing I can
say, based on the experience of people in this industry, is that
the fruit is bushing up around our ankles.''

ARVADA, Colo.: our ankles.''

<P>
   Riley Kothmann, who runs the Pampa plant, has some ready
answers. His tour includes a room where walls of dials and meters
have been succeeded by banks of computer screens and controls.
</P>
<P>
   But at times, it seems, fruit from higher branches drops on
plant supervisors' heads. Even without reaching for energy savings,
they find, the savings often land on them.
</P>
<P>
   Compelled by law to contain emissions, Pampa's technicians found
that those emissions could go back through a turbine to raise the
plant's electricity production by nearly 10 percent. Or there was
the time three or four years ago when managers began wrapping
insulation around the joints where pipes are bolted together.
``Pampa just had a tradition of not doing it,'' Kothmann said.
``It's so much easier to continue doing things the way you used
to.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the goals of the Kyoto treaty for reducing emissions,
Celanese executives say they would have to improve their energy
efficiency by 3 percent a year through 2010, or as rapidly as in
the '70s and '80s. All the technology they know of cannot meet that
goal unless they cut production, said R. David Damron, the
company's director for government affairs. If Washington insists,
he said, ``you're going to stifle growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Celanese is still hedging. In early June, a company energy
committee was assigned to find ways of meeting the goals, whatever
the costs. The next step probably will be to find ways of doing the
suggested projects at manageable costs. Kothmann, a member of the
committee, recalls that environmental controls expected to cost
$800 million a few years ago were delivered for less than $300
million. ``Our experience has shown that we can achieve much more
for much less than we anticipated it costing us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy use is rising in corporate offices as well as plants.
Like homes, they have far more efficient heating, lighting and
cooling, but also far more electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Electric utilities have cut their support for installing more
efficient equipment to $1.9 billion in 1996 from $2.7 billion in
1994. They say they cannot afford these programs in the competitive
new era of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and most of
Westchester County, N.Y., cut its efficiency program to $31 million
last year from $125 million in 1993 and has now eliminated it.
Customers had been rewarded for deeds like installing more
efficient appliances and compact fluorescent light bulbs instead of
standard incandescents.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, Con Ed, with state backing, plans to spend $25
million to $30 million a year on programs including low-cost loans
for companies to develop more efficient electrical products and
incentives to help them sell these products more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   ``For less of an incentive per light bulb, appliance or motor,
you can get a lot more in energy savings,'' contended Stephen
Pertusiello, the company's program manager for market
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York State Public
Service Commission from 1987 to 1995, said Con Ed's case was at
best uncertain. ``You are replacing a known and proven set of
programs with speculation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents going back to Richard Nixon have tried to arrest the
nation's growing energy use. In the face of the 1973 oil embargo,
he urged the nation to turn down its thermostats, form car pools
and more. He announced that December that the lights on the
national Christmas tree would be kept off. The next month, he
signed the Emergency Highway Conservation Act, setting a speed
limit of 55 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The first fuel-efficiency standards for cars took effect in
1975, requiring the average to double, to 27.5 miles a gallon, over
a decade. By 1977, Jimmy Carter was promoting the search for
renewable sources of energy like sunlight, wind, wood and wastes.
He called his conservation campaign ``the moral equivalent of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1978 and 1979, another round of production cuts by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, compounding
shortages caused by American price controls and regional
allocations, brought the gas lines back. More than half the
nation's gas stations were closed during the first summer weekend
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As gasoline climbed by 1981 to $2.05 a gallon in today's
dollars, the nation began its most successful peacetime
conservation effort. Americans used 43 percent less energy for
every dollar of gross domestic product in 1986 than at the peak in
1972. From 1987 through last year, energy use per dollar of output
declined by only an additional 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, OPEC was in disarray and energy prices had
declined. Reagan cut back conservation and renewable-energy
programs. The rural speed limit was raised to 65 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   This decade brought a reminder that foreign oilfields have their
risks. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 provoked a stock market
selloff and a run-up in energy costs that contributed to the
decade's only recession, the third in a row that came after oil
supplies were pinched.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, taking office in 1993, asked Congress to raise taxes on
all fuels, including coal, by the equivalent of a dime a gallon. He
got 4.3 cents on motor fuels only. In 1995, Congress repealed the
national speed limits, and most states set their own at 65, 70 or
even 75.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Clinton has sought to make energy efficiency
a renewed national priority. But to keep down the costs of reducing
emissions, the United States plans to achieve only about a quarter
of the required reductions itself. The trading of emissions rights
would allow America to pay other nations to achieve the rest.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the White House wants to promote advances in electric
cars, renewable energy and the like. ``My gut is, we will see the
introduction of these new technologies very quickly,'' said Ernest
Moniz, the under secretary of energy, whose responsibilities
include the efficiency programs. With much of the technology
already available, he said, ``We're not waiting for some magic
bullet.''

<P>
   Republicans in Congress have portrayed the Kyoto accord as a
dangerous effort to shape energy policy by raising false
environmental fears. It leaves out developing nations, they say,
and by requiring drastic energy savings, it threatens the United
States with job losses resulting from much higher costs than the
administration acknowledges. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who led the
Senate's delegation to Kyoto, says that for all the risks of
growing dependence on imported oil, ``The answer is not just to say
we're going to lower everybody's standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such opposition, Clinton has not yet sought
Senate ratification, saying that he, too, wants to include
developing nations. But Europe and Japan are clamoring for the
United States to take action, and the administration has promised
to submit the treaty next year.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation is now so unpopular that its advocates shun the
label. ``Use the term efficiency,'' said Lovins at his Rocky
Mountain Institute headquarters in Old Snowmass, Colo.
``Conservation to a third of Americans means doing less, worse or
without. It means privation, discomfort and curtailment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cause of energy conservation has a last, remote redoubt,
it is his stone-and-glass compound 7,100 feet high on the western
flanks of the Continental Divide. There, he shows off an indoor
tropical forest, luxuriant with pink and yellow bougainvillea and a
banana tree that has yielded 26 crops. Despite temperatures as low
as 47 degrees below zero, he has no heating bills and no furnace.
Instead, he has triple weatherstripping and heat-trapping windows
and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Technological efficiencies, or what Lovins calls negawatts, can
capture energy far more cheaply, in his view, than spending
billions to build more power plants or produce more oil from remote
or politically volatile regions.
</P>
<P>
   With energy prices so low, however, some in Washington say that
high demand is only a sign that free markets are working in
everyone's best interests. ``Those who have an energy fetish argue
that saving energy is more important than saving money or time,''
said Fred Smith, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute
there. Low energy prices allow more people to afford
air-conditioning and cars, he says. ``If we raise the price of
energy, we will push some people back onto the buses.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as open-heart surgery is far more traumatic than
regular exercise and a low-fat diet, other experts say that an
abrupt response to another oil shock or environmental crisis could
make the earlier discipline of gradual energy savings seem mild.
</P>
<P>
   For Joseph Romm, who until recently ran the Energy Department's
efficiency programs, it is only a question of when the nation will
return to conservation, not if. Contending that the world's oil
supplies will eventually tighten and temperatures rise, he said,
``Ten years or 15 years from now, people will be desperate to take
action.''

ANALYSIS: QUEST FOR A NEW AGENDA HAS BOTH PARTIES PARALYZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CONGRESS-SPEND, CONGRESS-CIA-BUDGET) 
(nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the 105th Congress cast its final legislative
vote Wednesday, it stood identified less with any signature bill
than with the paralysis of American politics at century's end.
</P>
<P>
   For it was a year in which much of the partisan energies went
into blocking initiatives, not passing them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stymied the Democrats' drive for regulation of
health maintenance organizations, overhaul of campaign finance laws
and anti-tobacco legislation. And President Clinton took such a
strong stand against tax cuts in the first year of a government
surplus that even Senate Republicans refused to embrace the
tax-cutting fervor of their more ideological brethren in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In part this represents the tradeoffs of a government divided
between a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled
Congress. But in many ways the stalemate runs far deeper.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War gone and the surplus changing deficit politics
that had defined the two parties for decades, Republicans and
Democrats alike have been left grappling for an agenda for the new
millennium. And it is a quest that fractures both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these books and articles that have been written
about the end of things,'' said Bill Curry, a former domestic
policy adviser to Clinton, ``the end of history, the end of
ideology, the end of the business cycle. We're not at the end of
ideology but we are at the end of the ideology of these two
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the spectrum, in remarkably similar
tones, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., one of the conservative
firebrands of the House, said, ``The leaders who took us into the
majority, you get the sense they're coming up with stale ideas and
are not focused on bringing the next agenda forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have been thrown off course not just by the
changing times but by the nation's antipathy to sweeping change in
a period of prosperity. Clinton tried and failed to carry out a
major overhaul of the nation's system of health care coverage early
in his first term, only to see the voters turn over control of
Congress to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Then Speaker Newt Gingrich and his fervent conservatives took
their turn and tried to use a government shutdown in 1995 to make
Clinton accede to the Republican call for sweeping tax cuts and a
scaling back of the Great Society programs. But one year later,
their standard bearer was unable to capture the presidency and
Gingrich's House majority fell to only 11 seats, one of the most
precarious for either party this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time at which big ideas failed,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director of The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
``Given those failures and given the fact that this is a time of
relative tranquillity, it's hard to get people going on big
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The response of the two parties has been a fallback to
look-alike agendas and a politics of small gestures that gives
neither a broad mandate. ``The ideal political place to be at the
end of this millennium is to have Republican policy and Democratic
language,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``That is the
perfect place for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton in 1996 embraced the Republican idea of a balanced
budget and then added grace notes on education and health care and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Going in to this election, the Republicans have not put forward
a new Contract With America but instead are mostly running on
welfare overhaul and a balanced budget pact with a tax cut, which
were the achievements of 1996 and 1997. Learning from Clinton's
strategy of co-opting Republican issues, they agreed in the final
spending bill of this session to $1.1 billion for new teachers in
order to neutralize the traditional Democratic advantage on the
education issue.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, sending his majority home to campaign with a final
balloon-filled rally, Gingrich also took credit for stopping
federal funding for needle-exchange programs for drug addicts and
in almost nostalgia tones, he said that Congress had included some
funding for Ronald Reagan's Cold War era dream of a ``Star Wars''
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But the final hours of the session put in sharp relief the
fractures in the Republican party that had haunted Congress all
year, causing the House and Senate to fail to pass a budget for the
first time since 1974 and costing Republicans the large $700
billion tax cut that House leaders had proposed in early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives took turns denouncing the Republican leadership in
the final hours of the session while Gingrich fired back at his
critics on the right, calling them a ``perfectionist caucus'' who
lacked maturity. And Wednesday, he said the Republican Congress had
failed to pass a major election-year tax cut ``in my judgment
because the Senate blinked.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues are already looming on the horizon for the next Congress,
chief among them ensuring the solvency of the Social Security
system for the Baby Boom generation. Gingrich and other House
Republicans are vowing to push earlier and harder for a large tax
cut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gingrich said Wednesday, ``you can be much bolder'' in the year
after an election. The Democrats want to try again to regulate
health maintenance organizations and overhaul campaign finance
laws. And the economic turmoil in Asia and Russia could yet cause
serious tremors in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that the current political stalemate
will change. Most strategists are now predicting that the November
election will only reinforce the status quo and produce no large
shift in the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more or less both content with national conditions
and disgusted with national politics,'' Kohut said. ``So there
ain't much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over whether to impeach President Clinton is likely
to distract Clinton and consume much of the energy in Congress. It
will also tie Clinton closely to the liberal Democrats who have
been his strongest defenders, keeping him from being free to side
with the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the likely polarization, Republicans may have to find
other ways to placate conservative activists if they do not
ultimately have the votes to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   In both parties the true battle for a new agenda is likely to
come in the next presidential race. ``The big serious political
agendas are presidential agendas,'' said William Kristol, editor of
the conservative Weekly Standard. ``Clinton's not going to have one
in 1999 and the Republican Congress isn't either. The interesting
action will be in both parties in 2000.''

NASDAQ UP SHARPLY, PACED BY MICROSOFT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology shares led the Nasdaq stock market sharply
higher Wednesday, while blue-chip companies saw a far more mild
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by Microsoft, which rose 6 3/16, to 106 7/16, the Nasdaq
composite index climbed 2.17 percent, or 35.56 points, to 1,674.75.
The Nasdaq index has surged 18 percent in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.38 points, to 8,519.23,
posting its sixth consecutive advance. More of the 30 stocks that
make up the Dow were down than up and the average, which spent much
of the day in negative territory, would have ended lower without
the contribution of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue rose 4 13/16 a share, to 142 11/16, after reporting a
10 percent increase in third-quarter profits late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.98 points, to
1,069.92.
</P>
<P>
   Several multibillion-dollar mergers announced recently _ the
latest being the Newell Co.'s $5.8 billion deal for Rubbermaid _
have helped improve the climate on Wall Street lately, as has the
re-emergence of credit for some borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see some thawing out,'' said Peter Canelo,
a domestic investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I
think we've turned the corner on the panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Canelo added that the options volatility index has registered
distress in 23 of the latest 34 sessions, but none in the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ackerman, chief strategist at Fahnestock, said that ``mood,
momentum and money-flow seem to be coming together'' in the
markets, particularly for Nasdaq stocks. In many cases, he said,
those still sell for ``a pittance'' relative to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that the traditional year-end selling of
battered stocks to establish losses for tax purposes seems to be
occurring early this year, with bargain hunters already moving in
to scoop up shares at their lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are also getting a lift from generally favorable
third-quarter corporate earnings, which have slightly surpassed
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some pretty good numbers coming in,'' said Mary
Farrell, senior strategist at Paine Webber. ``The important thing
is that the market continues in positive territory _ it's
holding.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices, which have been highly volatile for months
as many investors sought a safe haven from equities, were little
changed Wednesday though issues of two years or less sagged enough
to bump rates up by several basis points.
</P>
<P>
   Bond analysts said the market is anticipating further
interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which dominate the Nasdaq index, were once
again the standout performers among equities. Dell Computer rose
3|, to 56 15/16, Cisco Systems climbed 3{, to 57 5/8, and Intel
jumped 2 1/2, to 87 1/16. PeopleSoft, though, dropped 6, to 19 3/4,
following the company's projection of slower sales next year.
</P>
<P>
   Among blue chips, drug stocks were strong, with shares of Merck,
Eli Lilly, Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert, American Home Products
gaining more than 2 points each.
</P>
<P>
   But airline shares, prominently those in United Airlines, were
lower. UAL, the parent of United, fell 3 7/16, to 62 15/16.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New details of surprises hidden in the $500 billion
federal budget deal emerged Wednesday as the Senate passed the bill
and President Clinton signed it into law.
</P>
<P>
   These included $750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska,
$250,000 for a lettuce geneticist in Salinas, Calif., and $1.1
million for manure handling and disposal in Starkville, Miss. Bee
researchers in Baton Rouge, La., are to receive $300,000, and Maine
researchers get $220,000 to study low-bush blueberries. Eight
states will divide more than $5 million to research the uses of
wood.
</P>
<P>
   New York state is to receive $550,000 to restore the home of
Susan B. Anthony. Colorado Springs gets $800,000 to reconstruct the
Pikes Peak Summit House. And Glacier Bay National Park will open up
to commercial fishing.
</P>
<P>
   These elements are tucked into the 40-pound pork-laden spending
bill that Congress sent to the president Wednesday. The House
passed the omnibus package on Tuesday night, 333-95, and the Senate
passed it Wednesday, 65-29, closing out the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As in the House, the Republicans in the Senate were unhappy with
the final package. Of the 29 senators who opposed the bill, 20 were
Republicans. Supporting it were 33 Republicans and 32 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the angriest senators was John McCain, R-Ariz., who
compiled a 52-page list of ``objectionable items'' in the bill,
which was finally printed in Wednesday's Congressional Record.
McCain was especially incensed that in the $9 billion of emergency
spending for defense, the bill ignored the military's top priority
_ an increase in retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He also took strong issue with Speaker Newt Gingrich's
characterization Tuesday night of conservative opponents of the
bill as ``perfectionists'' who did not understand compromise. He
said that with its squandering of the surplus on parochial,
pork-barrel projects, the Republican-controlled Congress had
produced a budget that did not reflect the party's principles.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., asked: ``Where is the leadership?
Where is the agenda? What are we trying to accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents included Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., who said the bill reflected an ``ominously careless''
breakdown in procedure, and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who said on
Tuesday that he would hold his nose and vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made such a good speech last night that I convinced myself
to vote against it,'' Byrd said Wednesday. He called the final
package ``an elephantine monstrosity,'' adding, ``There's no living
person who knows everything that's in this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The final package pumps billions of new dollars into the
military and provides relief for the nation's farmers. But any bill
of this magnitude _ it encompasses eight of the 13 broad spending
categories of the federal government _ is likely to provide
something for everyone, and this bill does.
</P>
<P>
   No institution honors its own the way the Senate does. The bill
provides $1.2 million for the Mitch McConnell Conservation Fund, in
honor of the Republican senator from Kentucky, $12 million for the
Patrick Leahy War Victims Fund, in honor of the Democratic senator
from Vermont, and $1.5 million for the Claiborne Pell Institute for
International Relations, named for the former Democratic senator
from Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon, the former Democratic senator from Illinois, gets a
$1 million library at Southern Illinois University. The bill also
sets aside $6 million for the Robert Dole Institute of Public
Service and Policy at the University of Kansas, named for the
former majority leader and 1996 Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is larded with education programs and water and energy
projects for virtually every congressional district. It directs
millions of dollars for courthouse construction across the country,
including $153 million for a federal courthouse in Brooklyn, in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   And in allocations where no specific site is specified, one is
suggested, such as a $750,000 project monitoring abuse of the
elderly, a project that the bill ``encourages'' to be conducted in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Gingrich's home state, reaped millions of dollars for
special-interest projects in addition to the billions for new
military aircraft to be built by Lockheed Martin in Marietta, the
speaker's home town. The final package provides for $1 million for
peanut research in Georgia, $64,000 for urban pest research in
Georgia, and $100,000 for Vidalia onion research in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was also able to help the peanut growers in his state
by thwarting a Department of Transportation regulation that would
have created a ``peanut-free zone'' on domestic air flights. The
regulation would have barred the distribution of peanuts within
three rows of anyone who is allergic to peanuts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a reflection of the round-the-clock haggling and last-minute
reversals that have marked much of this bill, one item was suddenly
opened again even after the Senate sent the bill to the White
House. This was a provision that denied a tax exemption on the $1
million reward paid to David Kaczynski, who turned in his brother,
Theodore, in the Unabomber case.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, who lives near Schenectady, N.Y., has received
the reward. He has spent $250,000 of it on legal fees, which
included persuading the Justice Department not to seek the death
penalty for his brother. He wants to distribute the remaining
$750,000, which is in a bank account, to his brother's victims and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   When David Kaczynski learned he would owe about $350,000 in
taxes on the original reward, he contacted Moynihan, who has been
seeking the tax exemption since September. Moynihan said David
Kaczynski was trying to perform ``a selfless act of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief opponent of the exemption is Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Archer believes
that the exemption would set a bad precedent in opening the tax
code for a special provision without a public hearing, according to
Archer's press secretary, Sean Rushton.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, after the Senate approved the omnibus spending bill
Wednesday, it passed by voice vote a free-standing bill to give
Kaczynski the tax break. The Senate sent the proposal to the House,
but Rushton said the House, most of whose members have fled the
Capitol, would not take up the Senate bill, sothe issue was dead
for the year.

CLINTON LAWYERS ACCUSE PANEL OF UNFAIRNESS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's defense team, meeting for the
first time with lawyers for the House Judiciary Committee,
Wednesday accused the panel of designing an impeachment process
that is ``like attacking a man who is blindfolded and handcuffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stymied in their effort to limit the scope and length of the
impeachment inquiry, Clinton's lawyers harshly disputed claims by
the Judiciary Committee's Republican majority that the
investigation into the president's sex scandal is being run as
fairly and expeditiously as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not fair procedures,'' said Greg Craig, one of
Clinton's lawyers, immediately after the closed-door meeting on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's GOP staff returned the fire, as both sides scrambled
for the high ground in the final weeks before the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point the president's defenders have got to get away
from this partisan attack on process and fairness,'' said Paul
McNulty, the committee's communications chief. ``I think they
believe if they say `unfair' 5,000 times, eventually you just
believe it. ... We have gone out of our way to be fair. But the
strategy is clear: attack the process, attack the process, and that
way you never get to the facts. Well, let me tell you, sooner or
later you've got to get to the facts, and that's what the committee
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   With both sides sensitive to public concern that undue
partisanship could undermine the historic proceedings, lawyers from
each camp described their opening meeting as cordial and
professional. But they agreed on little else, from what charges
Clinton should face, to the standards for impeachment, to the pace
of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is weighing possible impeachment charges against
Clinton stemming from his sexual affair with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky. The independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, alleged in a report to Congress that ``substantial and
credible'' evidence existed that Clinton may have committed 11
impeachable offenses, including perjury, obstruction of justice,
and witness tampering in Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's chief investigator, David P. Schippers, has
recommended considering 15 possibly impeachable allegations against
Clinton. And Judiciary Chairman Henry J. Hyde, Republican of
Illinois, has suggested he may support consolidating the charges
into two or three major categories, such as perjury and obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without fair notice of what these charges are,'' Craig said,
``we will have no fair chance to represent our client, the
president of the United States, adequately.''
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment hearings tentatively scheduled to begin in
mid-November, aides to Hyde informed Clinton's lawyers they will be
granted the same rights to participate in the proceedings as
President Nixon's defense team received during the Watergate
inquiry in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Watergate guidelines, Clinton's legal team will be
permitted to participate in hearings and cross-examine witnesses.
But they would be prohibited from attending prehearing interviews
with prospective witnesses, a ban that Craig said Clinton's lawyers
will try to convince Hyde to lift.
</P>
<P>
   Craig attended the meeting with Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, and David E. Kendall, Clinton's private attorney.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to say afterward whether Clinton is willing to
testify before the committee, calling the issue ``premature.'' Nor
would they say whether the White House will fully cooperate with
the panel's subpoenas for witnesses and documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hypothetical,'' Craig said. ``We're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the standards for a presidential impeachment, Clinton's
lawyers criticized a Judiciary subcommittee for postponing a
hearing that had been scheduled for today on the issue. McNulty
said the hearing was postponed due to scheduling conflicts and a
new date could be set ``in the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House sent Hyde a letter Wednesday asking him to hold
the hearing on impeachment standards before the full committee by
the week of Nov. 9. ``You cannot investigate conduct without
standards,'' Craig said. ``That's like a game being played with the
rules being made by one side as the game goes along. You can't
investigate charges without telling who is charged what it is that
they're being charged with. It's like attacking a man who is
blindfolded and handcuffed. These are not fair procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the postponed hearing in accusing the committee of
failing to keep its pledge to move swiftly. Hyde has said he hopes
to complete the inquiry before New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority has mastered the `talk' of speed,'' Craig said,
``but it is not conducting the `walk' of speed.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty noted that only two weeks have passed since the House
approved a resolution to launch the inquiry. And he said Clinton
had plenty of time to resolve the matter since it became public
last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had eight months to tell the truth,'' McNulty
said. ``It's very important for the American people to remember
that the committee is moving as expeditiously as possible and that
requires cooperation from the White House to get done by our goal
of the end of the year.''

MICROSOFT KEEPS HEAT ON CHIEF ACCUSER AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Netscape Chief Executive James Barksdale has felt
the heat of Microsoft's wrath in the marketplace for years, and now
he is feeling it in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   During a tense second day of painstaking cross-examination, a
Microsoft lawyer attempted to take apart each complaint and
allegation made by Microsoft's arch competitor in the market for
Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, whose company's revenues and market share have
plummeted since Microsoft started giving away its own Internet
browser for free, stuck to his guns, insisting that Microsoft has
acted unfairly and illegally in its effort to defeat Netscape in
the so-called browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   But using Barksdale as a foil, Microsoft did manage to introduce
several pieces of evidence potentially damaging to the sweeping
antitrust case brought against Microsoft by the federal government,
20 states and the District of Columbia:
</P>
<P>
   _Netscape's co-founder, Jim Clark, said in a deposition that
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates told him in October 1994 that he
planned to offer the Microsoft browser for free. Microsoft said
that conversation undermines the notion that Microsoft decided to
make its browser free only in 1995 as a tactic to crush Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the Gates statement _ if it was really made
_ doesn't matter because it was made as a threat to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   _Unbeknown to his colleagues at Netscape, Clark sent a Microsoft
executive an e-mail in December 1994 asking Microsoft to consider
investing in Netscape. Microsoft said that e-mail negates the
government's claim that Microsoft introduced the notion of
investing in Netscape in 1995 as an enticement for Netscape to
agree to an illegal division of the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the 1994 proposal is irrelevant because it
was rejected the next day by Microsoft. Clark sent it at 3 a.m. on
one of his last days as chief executive when he was anxious to
recoup his personal $5 million investment in the company, Microsoft
said.
</P>
<P>
   _Tens of millions of copies of Netscape's browser are downloaded
from the Internet each year. Microsoft says that shows that
Microsoft has not foreclosed Netscape's access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale insisted that many copies are simply downloaded as
upgrades by current Netscape users, and that Microsoft's
integration of the browser into its operating system and
Microsoft's deals with America Online and various Internet service
providers have limited Netscape's access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of the trial _ Barksdale's second day on the stand
_ brought an escalation in the level of anger in the courtroom.
Barksdale and Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, could barely contain
their contempt for one another, sneering, snapping, interrupting
and raising their voices as they jousted.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony made it clear that Netscape and Microsoft flirted with
a collaborative relationship for about a year before all-out war
broke out between the companies. Barksdale testified that Microsoft
offered to buy Netscape in November 1994, but Netscape rejected the
offer. The next month Clark made his secret request for Microsoft
to invest in the company, but Microsoft rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, in an incident that is at the heart of the
government's case, Microsoft allegedly offered to invest in
Netscape if Netscape would abandon the market for Internet browsers
compatible with Windows 95. Barksdale said Microsoft executives
promised there would be a ``Bill effect'' from a Microsoft
investment in Netscape, in which the potential stock price of
Netscape when it went public would rise because investors would be
impressed by a Gates vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the proposals worked out, and since mid-1995 the
companies have been wrestling over the market for Internet
browsers. Microsoft made its browser free, and included it with the
operating system used by most consumers; in response, Netscape also
made its browser free. Microsoft's market share has risen steadily,
and the two companies each have about half the market now.
</P>
<P>
   Warden suggested that Microsoft's growing market share for
Internet browsers is attributable to the superior quality of the
product. He displayed 19 news articles favoring Internet Explorer,
including one that described the Microsoft product as ``a white-hot
(Netscape) Navigator killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale attributed the decline of Netscape's market share
to Microsoft's illegally anti-competitive actions _ forcing
computer makers to include Internet Explorer on every computer and
bullying other key industry players into promoting the Microsoft
product.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale testified that he had been told by Gil Amelio, the
former chief executive of Apple Computer, that Microsoft had
threatened to stop manufacturing a key software product for Apple
unless Apple agreed to promote Microsoft's browser at the expense
of Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale complained that ``Microsoft took away half my
distribution,'' but Warden sneeringly referred to Barksdale's
notion of ``your God-given right to 95 percent of the market.''
Attempting to show that competition is a part of corporate life,
Warden asked rhetorically, ``what was GM's market share before the
Japanese started selling automobiles?''
</P>
<P>
   Citing statements made by other Netscape executives to book
authors and in depositions, Warden repeatedly tried to get
Barksdale to say that Netscape had planned to give away its own
browser for free, even before Microsoft decided to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale, who owns 5 million shares of Netscape currently
valued at about $115 million, said ``you can go flat broke doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having difficulty showing a profit,'' he said of his
company's plight since it started offering its own browser free, in
response to Microsoft's action.

MIDEAST TALKS PUNCTUATED BY INCREASING TENSION AND BRINKSMANSHIP
</HEADLINE>
   (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(sw) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ For all the American efforts to envelop Middle
East talks in a rustic and secluded setting at the Wye Plantation,
the smoke signals issuing from behind the police barricades have
spelled a steady increase in tension, frustration and brinkmanship,
building up to the pillar of flame that erupted on Wednesday when
the Israelis angrily threatened to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a critical moment in terms of intensity and
importance,'' conceded James Rubin, the State Department spokesman,
in some of the strongest language to emerge from his studiously
bland briefings _ officially the only sanctioned source of
information here. Rubin's other morsel for the day was that the
Americans intended to present their version of a potential
settlement to both sides on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Rubin made the two-mile voyage to the community
college where reporters were keeping vigil, the Israelis had raised
the alarm. Briefing Israeli reporters in time to make evening
newscasts back home, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman,
Aviv Bushinsky, declared that the Israeli delegation intended to
pull out unless demands were met for the revision of the
Palestinian Charter and the extradition of Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The threats built through the day. The Israelis set a 10 p.m.
deadline for their departure from Wye Mills, and a midnight takeoff
from the airport. They demonstratively moved bags into vans when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright came over to their lodgings
for another hour of talk with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians kept pace with the Israelis. Yasser Arafat's
spokesman, Dr. Ahmed Tibi, was not far behind Bushinsky on the lawn
outside the community college. He described in soothing tones how
Arafat had sent over a bouquet for Netanyahu's 49th birthday on
Wednesday, and how the Palestinians welcomed the American proposal,
and how the Israeli threat was ``a political game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact of most negotiations, and certainly of all the
bitter Israeli-Palestinian talks since Netanyahu came to power,
that all is not as the participants would try to make it. What
emerged from the day's threats, ultimatums and statements was a
high-powered end-game in which feints, image and politics were at
least as important as substance.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants at the conference, the ``document''
that the Americans were to present to the conference on Wednesday
was in fact shown to both sides Tuesday evening, and the document
prompted the Israeli tantrum _ which, in turn, was probably a play
to pressure the Americans into twisting a few more concessions out
of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rubin made his next briefing at 6:20 p.m. _ over a
speakerphone, this time _ no American document had actually
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The reality behind the drama was that after long resisting and
dodging American persuasions, Netanyahu's back was against the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Americans had mounted some of the most formidable
pressure the Clinton administration has ever unleashed on any
front. President Clinton himself had spent 57 hours talking and
eating with the Israeli and Palestinian delegations _ in the heat
of a critical national campaign. Albright had spent the entire
``seven days and seven nights'' _ as Rubin intoned a few times _ at
Wye, and even the ailing icon of the Middle East, King Hussein of
Jordan, arose from his sickbed to plead for peace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, too, Netanyahu could not count on his supporters
among congressmen and American Jews to push Clinton off. Americans
were wrapped up in the campaign, and the Israelis and Palestinians
had come willingly to Wye, all professing total commitment to
making peace.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from the scope and intensity, the basic dance at Wye
was the same it had been for so many months _ Americans talking
alternatively to Palestinians and Israelis, back and forth, trying
to find that elusive formula that would enable both to claim
victory. By all accounts, the few direct encounters between Arafat
and Netanyahu were formalities.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the focus was on Netanyahu. Essentially, he was down
to three choices: to accept the American plan, and face the
inevitable rebellion from his constituents; to reject it, and face
the inevitable denunciation of political opponents and much of the
world, or to play for more time. The Americans and Palestinians
seemed equally determined to cut off the last option, with the
Americans demanding a response to their document, and the
Palestinians rejecting any partial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the Jewish settlers were preparing a nasty welcome if
Netanyahu did agree to a deal. Leaders of the settlers' council,
Aharon Domb and Pinhas Wallerstein, were on their way back from
Wye, raising the alarm that ``almost all of the Israeli demands to
the negotiations have collapsed and Israel is conceding on all
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the opposition Labor Party had pledged to support an
agreement, there was no guarantee that it would not join with the
right on the very next vote to force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   In all the drama, the least mystery was the outline of the plan.
As Rubin acknowledged, it was essentially the same package the
Americans have proposed for several months _ a staged Israeli
pull-out from 13 percent of the West Bank accompanied by a series
of concrete Palestinian actions against terrorists, all monitored
by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For the Israelis, the critical issue was also to ensure that
Arafat would not proclaim a state next May, as he has threatened to
do when the Oslo agreements run out. And for Netanyahu, a key
requirement was to demonstrate, if he did strike a deal, that the
19-month delay had resulted in the ``peace with security'' that he
had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Netanyahu's lieutenants repeated again and again that
Israel was giving something concrete, land, and thus expected
equally concrete security assurances in return.
</P>
<P>
   To round out their position, the Israelis demanded further
revisions of the Palestinian national charter and a reduction of
the Palestinian police forces. As in all past negotiations, the
Israelis also dangled before the Palestinians the prospect of
letting them open their airport in Gaza and traveling freely
between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat likewise issued demands intended to demonstrate to his
increasingly frustrated people that he was playing tough. He issued
new demands for the release of prisoners and resisted demands for
the reduction of his police force. The Palestinians also refused to
release the Israelis from their obligation under the Oslo
agreements to make yet a third withdrawal from the West Bank before
a final settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat's central strategy, as it has been for many months
now, has been to agree with most anything the Americans proffer,
essentially forcing the Israelis into the position of repeatedly
locking horns with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The steps were familiar. Only in the quiet, pretty setting of
the Chesapeake farmlands, it was finally evident that this dance,
at least, had come to an end.

GRENADE-THROWING SUSPECT, ISRAELI SECURITY REPORTEDLY CONFERRED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian suspect captured minutes after he
allegedly tossed two grenades into a crowded bus station reportedly
met three times with Israeli secret service officials during the
weeks in which he carried out other attacks against Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's leading newspaper, Ha'aretz, Wednesday quoted sources
from Israel's secret service, Shin Bet, and top Palestinian
security officials saying that Israeli agents had tried to recruit
the suspect, Salam Rajab Sarsour, in a meeting in August and two
meetings last month.
</P>
<P>
   The report added that Sarsour, 29, confessed to Israeli
authorities that he had also carried out other attacks in the
Hebron area, including the August murder of a rabbi from a Jewish
settlement and throwing grenades at Israeli soldiers earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean that while Israeli Shin Bet agents were meeting
with Sarsour, and even reportedly providing him with the money for
a mobile phone, he was planning and perhaps even carrying out the
wave of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed sources said they were unaware of his terrorist
activities until he was apprehended after Tuesday's attack, which
wounded 64 people, including Israeli civilians and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub
says Sarsour was a ``double agent'' who foiled the Israeli agents
who had recruited him while simultaneously being inducted into the
armed wing of the militant Islamist group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub maintained that these revelations prove the Israelis
could have stopped the attack. It is bitterly ironic, he added, in
light of the way Israel _ within minutes after the attack _ blamed
Palestinian officials for doing too little to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mideast peace summit in Maryland, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu seized on the Tuesday attack by immediately
limiting talks to Israeli security and using the attack as an
example of how the Palestinian Authority needs to step up its fight
against extremists from Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Israeli Government Press Office, Moshe
Fogel, refused to confirm or deny the Ha'aretz report.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinian negotiators in Maryland, the news reports
underscore their claim that no nation in the world can completely
stop terrorism. They point out that 20 Hamas activists have been
detained for questioning in their efforts to help the Israelis
prosecute the suspect in the attack. They maintain that the
Israelis are ratcheting up security demands as a way to derail a
process that has been deadlocked for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Fogel dismissed that claim, saying, ``We are not asking them to
do anything less than to help stop terrorism. We want them to do
what we would do. They have 35,000 people in their police force and
have every reason to be more effective in breaking the
infrastructure of terrorism.''

MICROSOFT SAYS NETSCAPE SOUGHT AN ARRANGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attempting to refute a central allegation in the
government's antitrust case, Microsoft Corp. on Wednesday produced
a secret e-mail message from the chairman of Netscape
Communications Corp. seeking Microsoft's cooperation, offering to
stay out of its way and suggesting that Microsoft invest in
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail, written on Dec. 29, 1994, was introduced to suggest
that it was Netscape, not Microsoft, that initiated some of the
elements of what the government portrays as an illegal offer by
Microsoft in June 1995 to divide with Netscape the market for
software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail message, written by James Clark, the chairman and
cofounder of Netscape, was submitted in court Wednesday by
Microsoft as part of its defense in the sweeping antitrust suit
filed by the Justice Department and 20 states. It was perhaps the
most surprising piece of evidence produced during a second day of
often combative cross-examination of the government's leading
witness, James Barksdale, the president and chief executive of
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning and afternoon sessions, John Warden,
Microsoft's lead lawyer, frequently tried to goad Barksdale to
concede key points in Microsoft's defense _ namely, that Netscape's
browser is widely distributed despite Microsoft's allegedly unfair
business practices, and that Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
only began gaining market share against Netscape's Navigator in the
fall of 1996, because Explorer had been significantly improved, not
because of predatory conduct on the part of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale made few concessions, repeatedly replying, ``No, I
don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail memo to Dan Rosen, a Microsoft executive, Clark
wrote ``We have never planned to compete with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clark wrote, ``We want to make this company a success,
but not at Microsoft's expense. We'd like to work with you. Working
together could be in your self-interest as well as ours. Depending
on the interest level, you might take an equity position in
Netscape, with the ability to expand the position later.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark concluded his e-mail appeal by noting, ``No one in my
organization knows about this message.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said he did not know about the e-mail until recently
and that the first time he saw it was in court Wednesday. He said
that Clark told him about his December 1994 proposal to Microsoft
this summer when Netscape executives were being deposed by
Microsoft's legal team in preparation for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he made an offer to them including some of this
and that it was rejected,'' Barksdale testified.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand Wednesday, Barksdale sought to portray the
December 1994 e-mail from Clark as a freelance overture that did
not represent corporate policy. ``He never discussed it with the
board, and he never discussed it with me,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clark's offer was quickly dismissed by Microsoft, the
government asserts that its introduction in court by Microsoft is
mainly an effort by the defense to try to ``change the facts and
change the subject,'' in the words of David Boies, special trial
counsel for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The December 1994 e-mail is not related, the government
contends, to the June 1995 meeting in which the Justice Department
says that Microsoft made its illegal offer. According to the
government, Microsoft offered to make an investment in Netscape and
give Netscape's software developers crucial technical information
about the Windows operating system if Netscape would agree not to
make a browser for Windows 95 operating system, which Microsoft
released two months later.
</P>
<P>
   The government says Netscape rejected Microsoft's collusion
pact, while Microsoft replies that the government is
misrepresenting what was a routine business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clark sent his e-mail during Netscape's precarious startup
phase, before the company had yet begun to garner a lot of sales
and with Clark watching his $5 million investment in the company
dwindle. In his testimony, Barksdale tried to dismiss the memo as a
sales ploy, perhaps made in desperation, as opposed to a genuine
business plan for Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Warden asked Barksdale of Clark, ``Do you regard him as a
truthful man?''
</P>
<P>
   After pausing, Barksdale replied, ``I regard him as a
salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to touch that,'' Warden responded.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also introduced a portion of Clark's pretrial
deposition to try to prove that as early as the fall of 1994
Netscape was aware of Microsoft's intention to bundle its browser
with its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   This is potentially significant because the government says that
Microsoft's principal reason for folding the browser into the
operating system was as an anticompetitive tactic to undermine
Netscape. In the fall of 1994, Microsoft asserts, Netscape had not
yet produced its first product.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Clark testified that he first heard Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, talk of bundling the browser and
the operating system at an industry conference in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was asked if he had a personal conversation with Gates
about this, and Clark said no, instead recalling it as a vaguely
threatening comment made to the conference audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he said was: I hope no one plans to make money on browsers
because they will be bundled into the operating system,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his cross-examination, Warden also tried to establish that
Netscape had long viewed all-but-free distribution of its browser
as part of its business plan. This assertion relates to the case
because Microsoft's decision to distribute its Internet Explorer
browser free is characterized in the government's suit as one of
several extraordinarily aggressive steps Microsoft took to try to
undercut Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   To make this point, Warden introduced as evidence portions of
the manuscript from a new book, ``Competing on Internet Time:
Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' by Michael
Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management, and David Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard business school.
</P>
<P>
   The book, based on extensive interviews with present and former
Netscape executives, quotes Marc Andreessen, a cofounder and
executive vice president, as describing browser marketing as ``free
but not free.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept refers to the notion that many individuals and
corporations downloaded browser software from Netscape's Web site
without paying for it. Still, free distribution is valuable because
it encourages companies to adopt Netscape's technology, and
Netscape bases its business on selling large software packages for
hub computers, or servers, that feed data to many personal
computers in a network.
</P>
<P>
   Warden raised the issue to suggest that Netscape's business
model did not vary much from what Microsoft did.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it, Barksdale replied, ``I have never heard
this term `free but not free.' I have not heard it, I don't espouse
that, and that was not our strategy.''

U.S., NATO KEEP PRESSURE ON RESISTANT MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and NATO worked Wednesday to keep
the military pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
as he continued to resist complying with international demands to
withdraw Serbian army and police forces from the province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A day after NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, met
with Milosevic and Yugoslav military leaders to demand more
withdrawals, there were no signs Wednesday that any of the forces
were in fact pulling back, NATO and administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy who brokered the agreement
last week that averted NATO strikes on Serbian-dominated forces in
Yugoslavia, said Wednesday that Milosevic was failing to comply.
And Holbrooke forcefully reiterated NATO's warning that it might
still resort to force if he has not complied by a new deadline of
Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation is not rectified in the next six days, it can
only lead to the most dramatic consequences,'' Holbrooke said at a
meeting in Paris of the contact group made up of the United States,
Russia and European powers that coordinate policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   While Milosevic has allowed diplomatic observers to return to
the province and relief aid to resume, he appears determined to
challenge NATO's resolve to carry out its threats. During his
meeting with Clark on Tuesday, he repeatedly tried to impose
conditions on his compliance, demanding that NATO lift the new
deadline for using force in exchange for more withdrawals, a NATO
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to take it down to the wire,'' the official said,
referring to next Tuesday's deadline for compliance.
</P>
<P>
   NATO faced increasing pressure Wednesday from Russia to drop its
threat of force now that Milosevic has agreed to accept a
cease-fire, allow refugees to return to their homes and permit
hundreds of international monitors on the ground and unarmed
reconnaissance jets in the sky to verify that the crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo does not resume.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters outside Brussels, Russian officials told
NATO Wednesday that Russia would not take part in the aerial
overflights until the alliance revoked the ``activation order''
that gives Clark the authority to use force once the new deadline
passes. At the United Nations, Russia was also resisting a new
Security Council resolution, proposed by Britain and France, that
would support last week's agreement and back it up with an
authorization to use force.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the start of the showdown with Milosevic, the United States
has said NATO did not need authorization from the United Nations to
use force to stop what amounted to an internal conflict within a
sovereign state. Other NATO members have disagreed, preferring to
have explicit authorization, which Russia, an ally of the Serbs in
Yugoslavia, has vowed to veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
will send monitors to Kosovo to verify compliance with the
agreement, is also awaiting a resolution before starting its work,
the organization's chairman, Foreign Minister Branislaw Geremek of
Poland, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is scrambling to draft plans for a ``rapid reaction'' force
that would be able to extract the OSCE monitors in the event of a
crisis. American and NATO officials said such a force is likely to
include helicopter-borne commando squadrons based in neighboring
Macedonia, but planning has just begun, meaning it could be weeks
before the monitors start their work in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has demanded that Milosevic withdraw 4,000 to 5,000 army
troops and 3,000 to 4,000 special police officers that poured into
the province when the conflict erupted last winter. That would
still leave about 12,000 soldiers and 6,000 police officers based
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After withdrawing one army and one police battalion over the
weekend, Milosevic's forces have in recent days responded to
renewed attacks by Kosovo's rebels by stepping up their presence. A
Pentagon official said Wednesday that aerial photographs had shown
an increase in armored units involved in clashes with the rebels,
who appear determined to undercut the agreement.

NETANYAHU THREATENS TO LEAVE PEACE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ A troubled peace summit neared a humiliating
collapse Wednesday night as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denounced Palestinian leaders, packed his bags and
threatened to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu gave an ultimatum to Yasser Arafat, saying the
Palestinian leader had to agree to extradite terrorists to Israel
and repeal a charter calling for the destruction of Israel. If that
didn't happen by late night, Netanyahu said, the Israelis would fly
home.
</P>
<P>
   The brinksmanship put extraordinary pressure on President
Clinton, who has spent 57 hours at the peace talks on Maryland's
Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they refused to side with Netanyahu but had
urged him to stay. ``It would be very unfortunate if one side
decided to leave when we are ready, willing and able to provide for
the security of their people,'' State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said last night. ``We're trying to work on the substance
(but) we don't expect anybody to stay here against their will.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the ultimatum and a late-night deadline
that Netanyahu's spokesman announced in public had been ``more
stark'' than Netanyahu's words to Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright during a private meeting the two held at sunset.
</P>
<P>
   While Israeli officials had rebuffed American pressure and
openly suggested cutting off the negotiations several times since
the talks started a week ago, US officials took this latest threat
seriously. Netanyahu even went as far as ordering most of his
delegation to pack their suitcases and send their baggage to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis came on the seventh day of what was supposed to be a
four-day summit. Netanyahu made the threat just before US officials
gave Israelis and Palestinians the draft of an extensive proposal
laying out steps for the next Israeli pullout from the West Bank.
In exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli troops over several
months, Palestinians would have to work with the CIA to identify
and turn over terrorists to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu had not seen the exact wording in the document,
US and Israeli officials said it contained no surprises. Indeed, it
was not much different from the accord suggested when Israelis and
Palestinians arrived in Washington to kick off the talks last
Thursday, Americans said.
</P>
<P>
   A news blackout imposed by the White House fell apart as
spokesmen for Netanyahu and Arafat left the seclusion of the Wye
River conference center to speak to reporters confined to a nearby
community college. Accusations ricocheted across a courtyard of the
college and the two spokesmen even got engaged in an impromptu
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis complained that Palestinians had agreed to several
demands, then backed out when the time came to discuss details.
Specifically, the Israelis said, Palestinians had agreed to hand
over 36 people who have been identified as terrorists and repeal
their national charter, which has nearly 30 separate sections that
seek the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Besides seeking extradition of terrorists, the Palestinians
refused to collect illegal arms and reduce the ranks of police by
several thousand, Israeli spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to release some prisoners, some that raped
young children,'' he continued. ``But I wonder what kind of entity
is the Palestinian Authority that it wants rapists and murders in
its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Ahmed Tibi, a doctor who serves as a close
adviser to Arafat, appeared before reporters to denounce the
Israelis. ``We understand that these new decisions are a pretext in
order to make these negotiations a failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with ominous signs. Unable to get the
concessions he wanted, Clinton stayed at the 1,000-acre Wye estate
until almost 1:30 am before taking the Marine One helicopter back
to the White House. At 2:15 am, Albright was on the phone with
Netanyahu, pressing for an agreement, when she remembered to wish
him a happy 49th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who has denounced Netanyahu for years, sent flowers for
the Israeli leader's birthday, but the two did not talk face to
face. After Netanyahu said he was considering leaving, Arafat
called him and appealed to keep the talks going and reach an
agreement, Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials, who had spoken for days of the ``constructive,''
``productive'' and ``workmanlike'' atmosphere, acknowledged that an
agreement was far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the intensity of today and the intensity of Wednesday,
it is not at all clear that the tough choices necessary to reach an
agreement can and will be made,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that the Israeli posturing could have been
just that _ tough talk designed to shake up the Palestinians and
Americans. Just as important, Americans familiar with the talks
said, Netanyahu has to play to a small group of hard-liners back
home who demand that he snub Clinton and hold on to the remaining
portions of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The most defiant Israeli statements were made in the early
afternoon, in Hebrew before television cameras _ just in time for
the evening news shows back in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the Palestinians not only unwilling to fulfill their
obligations, most of them old ones ... but they also went backwards
and there's a deterioration of the situation,'' Bushinsky, the
Israeli spokesman, said. ``We have very simple demands.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Albright, Netanyahu awaited concessions
from Arafat. ``If there is progress we'll stay; if there isn't
we'll leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Netanyahu was talking about leaving so suddently,
Tibi, the Palestinian spokesman, responded: ``I don't know. I'm a
gynocologist, not a psychologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's declaration followed a flurry of calls to Israeli
officials from American Jewish groups, sources said. Many
mainstream groups urged Netanyahu to keep talking, though several
said he should not give up land.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Cohen, vice chairman of the Center for Middle East
Peace and Economic Cooperation, said the pressure had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president's ... hours of involvement is not enough to
keep Netanyahu negotiating, then no American Jewish organization is
going to matter,'' he said. ``It's reached the level of an
international peace and security.''

<P>
   Good help is hard to find these days, snobs say, as if it were
news. The complaint has been circulating the globe since the race
first cooked up the division of labor. Like parent and child or
mate and mate, master and servant make up one of the handful of
stock pairs in the theater of human destinies.
</P>
<P>
   In the drama of all places and periods, their dance of dominance
and deference has been a constant.
</P>
<P>
   Two who observed its intricacies with the sharpest eyes were
Mozart and da Ponte, the creators of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' (1786),
which will be given a new production on Thursday evening at the
Metropolitan Opera; ``Don Giovanni'' (1787), and ``Cosi Fan Tutte''
(1790).
</P>
<P>
   For much of their lives, in their separate ways, Mozart and da
Ponte had themselves seen no choice but to chase the mixed
blessings of patronage. Class conflict was in any case a
preoccupation among lively minds of their age. No wonder their
masterpieces bristle with it. ``Viva la liberta!'' cries Don
Giovanni, striking a freethinker pose: ``Hurrah for freedom!'' A
stageful of characters chimes in, aristocrat and lackey alike,
sentiments ranging from pure hypocrisy to a euphoria of
self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   The most conventional of Mozart and da Ponte's treatments of the
master-servant paradigm is their last, ``Cosi Fan Tutte.'' When
first discovered, Despina is stirring hot chocolate for Fiordiligi
and Dorabella. Why should they get to drink it, she asks herself,
while she gets only to smell it? ``Is not my mouth like yours?''
she rages, and in a tiny act of rebellion, she hazards a sip.
``When Despina runs a show, it never fails,'' she crows later,
enlisted in a plot against the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, she manages her mistresses handily. But even as she
pulls strings, an old cynic is leading her by the nose. By
curtain-fall, her position is what it was at the start, if not
worse, since her treacheries have come to light.
</P>
<P>
   Is not my mouth like yours? A question of all but mythic force.
Leporello, the manservant in the second of the Mozart-da Ponte
operas, might phrase it more brutally, working as he does for a sex
fiend. ``Don Giovanni'' paints the ramifications of service in
bleaker, fuller detail.
</P>
<P>
   In the common view, the libertine hero embodies Eros rampant,
but he hungers for food and drink _ and for sheer manipulation _ as
much as for (other men's) women. On the latter score, the opera
catches him badly off form. At least four separate campaigns
increase the pedantic count of his 2,065 amours not at all.
Conversely, the second-act finale finds him tucking in with gusto
at what will prove his last supper.
</P>
<P>
   But without applause, where is the fun? And here is where
Leporello comes in. Don Giovanni's headiest pleasures range from
rage to murder. To protect his social position (not to mention the
freedom to keep up the chase), he must maintain a respectable
facade. So he employs a secret sharer. The contract is simple. Don
Giovanni gets sex; Leporello gets out his notebook. Don Giovanni
gets dinner; Leporello gets to watch. But then Don Giovanni gets
caught with his pants down, and Leporello gets thrashed, at which
point Leporello gets fed up, and Don Giovanni gets out his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, for kicks, man and master trade places, but
always on the boss' terms, confirming his place on top. Is there a
more wicked scene in all of opera than the second seduction of
Donna Elvira? Under her window, wrapped in his master's cloak,
Leporello quakes with smothered laughter while off in the shadows,
unseen by the lady, Don Giovanni models romantic poses and croons
sweet nothings.
</P>
<P>
   His game is to get rid of her. So as usual, Leporello feeds on
Don Giovanni's leavings. Rank and privilege trump any common
humanity, even between this pair of predators. Master and servant,
almost master and slave: Don Giovanni and Leporello are their
ghastly emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, this most resentful of Mozart and da Ponte's
double portraits comes after, not before, ``Le Nozze di Figaro,''
which superimposes on its account of class conflict a highly
sophisticated battle of the sexes. What results is their most
delicate and conciliatory representation of socio-political
realities.
</P>
<P>
   If in ``Don Giovanni,'' status is destiny, ``Le Nozze di
Figaro'' asserts that wiles, wit, determination, decency and love
can (with luck) tip the scales against arrogance and power.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Count Almaviva, the jealous philanderer, holds all
the cards. In fact, he holds very few. Figaro's bride, Susanna,
whom the count covets, cares not a pin for him or his money. The
highly available gardener's daughter Barbarina actually prefers to
dally with the fresh-faced page Cherubino. Almaviva's wife, who
bores him, might at any time stain his honor by taking a lover,
possibly that same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must I, while I sigh, see my servant happy?'' the count
storms, venting his fury at the weakness of his position. ``And
shall he possess a treasure that I desire in vain?'' Sabotage is
the privilege of the underling; and Figaro _ as the count surely
recalls from his courtship of the countess (the subject matter of
``Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' which in its first operatic version,
Giovanni Paisiello's, reached Vienna three years before ``Le Nozze
di Figaro'') _ is a cleverer man than he.
</P>
<P>
   Soliloquizing on her state, the countess, too, must face a
humiliating dependency: ``It has come to this,'' she cries in one
of her most poignant lines. ``I must seek help of my maid.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the follies of the day are sorted out in the moonlit
garden, Almaviva has been led a dance by all and sundry. ``If, dear
Sir Count, you'd like to go dancing, I'll play the tune on my
little guitar,'' Figaro vows in the opera's first aria. The
prediction (or threat) comes true, and Susanna's chastity is
preserved, with the connivance of the hardly disinterested
countess. But beneath the pines, where indiscretions flourish,
Figaro will do some dancing of his own to tunes played by the
ladies, as Susanna will to his.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only the countess emerges undeceived, entrancing and
entrapping her husband, who is susceptible only because he believes
her to be another woman.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, reading slowly, it is not impossible to follow the
ins and outs of this elaborate fandango. With the help of the Met's
splendid running titles, audiences at the new all-star ``Nozze di
Figaro,'' directed by Jonathan Miller, may succeed as well, though
the odds are against it.
</P>
<P>
   (One of the exceptional productions that did sort out the
entanglements for the viewer in real time was that of Peter
Sellars, which famously, or notoriously, transposed the action to
Trump Tower, Manhattan, circa 1990.) What will surely not be lost,
however, is the humane, murmured message of forgiveness, uttered by
the countess, in answer to the stammered eloquence of her husband's
entreaty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the focus has been on essentially literary matters,
rooted in the libretto. But words alone, thought alone, cannot
account for the transcendent reversal at the close of ``Figaro.''
For a moment of wondrous calm, all strife resolves in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The composer as well as his poet has things to say about class
relations as they are and as they might be. In fact, though, the
implication that social hierarchies are accidents of fortune rather
than reflections of native worth is woven into the musical fabric
of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' as well as ``Don Giovanni.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the matter of casting. By common agreement and with few
exceptions, a singer endowed with the highest notes takes
precedence over singers with notes less high, sopranos outranking
mezzo-sopranos, as tenors do baritones and basses. It only makes
sense; higher voices are in general easier to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart and his contemporaries did not distinguish between vocal
categories as neatly as subsequent periods did, or tried to. The
designation for all the women's parts in the da Ponte operas is
soprano. Yet the general principle applied, and in the main Mozart
respected the musical prerogatives of the prima donna.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensembles of ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' for instance,
Fiordiligi's lines lie above Dorabella's, which lie above
Despina's, position in the musical texture corresponding to status
in the household. Among male voices, Mozart recognized the division
between tenor and bass. So he could, if he liked, assign basses to
servants' parts for contrast with masters played by tenors.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart followed this common practice early on, in ``La Finta
Semplice'' and ``La Finta Giardiniera.'' In ``Die Entfuhrung aus
dem Serail'' (1782), he abandoned it in favor of a mistress and her
maid played by high sopranos and a man and his servant played by
tenors.
</P>
<P>
   In a subliminal sense, the closeness of range erases
distinctions of rank _ fittingly, since, as Christian captives in
Araby, they are quite literally in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the plots of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' and ``Don Giovanni,'' the
lines between master and servant are perfectly clear, yet Mozart
blurs them just as in the earlier opera. With one adjustment: the
male parts have been shifted to bass, gaining in lifelike macho
what they sacrifice in storybook romance. At key moments of the
action, the countess and Susanna, like Don Giovanni and Leporello,
exchange clothes and mimic each other's voices; the singers taking
the parts have been known to switch, too. The count and Figaro
never switch roles.
</P>
<P>
   There is little vocal reason for the singers playing them not
to, though temperamentally there might be a lot. Bryn Terfel, the
pre-eminent Figaro of the moment and one of the stars of the new
Met production, also has both Leporello and Don Giovanni under his
belt, though not the count.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of interest, where Figaro's and Leporello's music
parallels that of the count and Don Giovanni, the servants take the
lower line. From an analytical point of view, the bass forms the
foundation for the entire musical structure. A fanatical Marxist
might argue, therefore, that Mozart distributed the voices this way
to reflect social inequities, an absurdity, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, even in Mozart or Verdi, the voice in a
large-scale ensemble ceases to function as the vehicle of personal
expression and becomes, instead, an instrument within a symphonic
interlude.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that since Mozart's day and with his approval,
Susanna and the countess traded lines less according to who was the
nominal prima donna than for musical expediency, notably in the
second-act trio, which gives one of them the gratifying (or scary)
opportunity of winging up to some very prettily placed high Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The original Susanna, the low soprano Nancy Storace, who was the
toast of Vienna, was glad to take the lower part during the opera's
first, disappointing run. Three years later, da Ponte's mistress,
Adriana Ferrarese del Bene, assumed the role in a highly successful
Vienna revival. A showoff who exulted in her high notes, she
co-opted the lines once sung by the countess: this served the music
and no doubt tickled her vanity, too. She also got Mozart to write
her two new arias in place of the two he had written for Storace.
</P>
<P>
   (Cecilia Bartoli, the Susanna of the Met production, will stick
to Storace's lines in the ensembles, leaving the higher ones to the
countess of Renee Fleming. In selected performances, notably those
before the video cameras, she is expected to replace Storace's
arias with Ferrarese's less familiar alternatives.)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to say that with da Ponte's help Mozart served the
servants in their operas at least as well as the masters. In the
arias especially. By actual count, Don Giovanni and Leporello have
three apiece. But with the Catalog Aria, Leporello has a juicy star
turn that establishes him not just as a singer with a solo but as a
character in the round, aglow with Rabelaisian zest.
</P>
<P>
   Don Giovanni's big solo moment comes (and goes) in ``Fin ch' han
dal vino,'' a thunderclap of rapacious energy that fails to put him
before us in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Figaro has three arias, two hit tunes (one is quoted as such in
``Don Giovanni'') plus a racing monologue addressed straight to the
audience. The count has just one, musically tremendous but
emotionally flinty.
</P>
<P>
   The artist who can discover in it not only the tantrum of a
justly foiled despot but also the pathos of a scorned lover is the
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's generosity to Despina is admittedly less than to
Fiordiligi and Dorabella, who are granted great flights of bravura.
Still, Despina's tunes you can whistle and saucy street wisdom give
a performer of genius all the chance she needs to clean up. (Ask
Ms. Bartoli.)
</P>
<P>
   Between Susanna and the countess, the scales are in balance, not
only thanks to the pair of shining arias awarded to each.
Conspiring benevolently against the menfolk in their duettino
``Sull' aria,'' their voices intertwine in celestial amity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such concord across the gulf of rank exists only in
Mozart, and then only between these two women. Man and master, the
operas tell us, will never be brothers.
</P>

MARKET PLACE: CONOCO SHARE SALE IS BIGGEST EVER
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Institutional and small investors snapped up more
than 190 million shares of Conoco on Wednesday, raising $4.4
billion for its parent, DuPont, in the largest initial public
offering in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The offering was priced at $23 a share, toward the high end of
the range of $20 to $24 a share that had been anticipated by Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, the lead underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The demand was so strong that instead of selling 150 million
shares, or 25 percent of DuPont's stake, the underwriters were able
to sell 191.456 million shares, or 30 percent. Smaller investors
bought more than 80 percent of the shares sold.
</P>
<P>
   The results meant the sale far surpassed the previous record
public offering, by Lucent Technologies Inc., for $3.03 billion in
April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from its record size, what made the deal notable was
its timing. Initial public offerings have almost dried up since
global market turmoil ravaged stocks in August and September.
Earnings declines at many major companies have made investors
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Conoco, the nation's eighth-largest oil company,
the sale also coincided with weak crude oil prices, which have
battered the major oil companies. Some reported double-digit drops
in earnings Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it does not look like the most opportune time to
go to the stock market to sell an oil company. But that is not
necessarily so for companies like Conoco, which have long track
records of financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco offered investors a chance to buy into an established
company that expects to grow even though its earnings have declined
because of lower crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers good dividend income of 76 cents a share, for a
yield of 3.3 percent based on its $23-a-share price.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the firt major step in a strategy announced by
DuPont last spring to divest itself of Conoco and use the money to
expand into the fast-growing field of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of DuPont fell $2.1875, to $62, but the decline did not
necessarily reflect the Conoco sale. The company reported weaker
quarterly earnings Wednesday, partly due to declining demand abroad
and the effects of the strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   For Conoco, the offering represents the first step toward
independence from a parent that kept a tight rein on the company's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good move for both companies,'' said Jay Wilson, an
oil analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deal's huge size, it is expected to have little
effect on the languishing market for public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Only six initial offerings have been brought to market in
October and September, compared with 332 for the year. Those
companies that sold stock to the public have seen their shares
decline by an average of 22 percent. There were 628 public
offerings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will do nothing,'' said John Fitzgibbon, editor of IPO
Reporter, a newsletter. He said only established, financially
strong companies like Conoco, which can sell shares ahead of time
to institutional investors, can now make their debuts.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most recent stock offerings, used by fledgling start-up
companies to raise cash, Conoco has large amounts of cash already.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont bought Conoco in 1981 for $7.6 billion, in what was then
considered a huge acquisition. The chemical company was worried at
that time about oil prices soaring, and it wanted a reliable source
of crude oil _ a basic raw material for its huge chemical business.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices in recent years have been fairly stable, and
this year they have fallen, diminishing the need for DuPnt to keep
an in-house supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Under Charles Holliday Jr., president and chief executive of
DuPont, the company is shifting toward growing its life sciences
business through major acquisitions. It has spent more than $3
billion to buy Ralston Purina Co.'s Protein Technologies
International, a soya products company, and 20 percent of Pioneer
Hi-Bred International Inc., a seed corn company.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont plans to divest itself of the rest of Conoco in a
tax-free stock distribution to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and shareholders have reacted favorably to the strategy
and DuPont's stock has risen each time it spelled out more of how
it planned to dispose of Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds of the sale are expected to be used to make further
large acquisitions. That is a major shift for Dupont, since Conoco
contributed close to half of DuPont's $45.1 billion in revenue last
year.

 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Netscape Chief Executive James Barksdale has felt
the heat of Microsoft's wrath in the marketplace for years, and now
he is feeling it in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   During a tense second day of painstaking cross-examination, a
Microsoft lawyer attempted to take apart each complaint and
allegation made by Microsoft's arch competitor in the market for
Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, whose company's revenues and market share have
plummeted since Microsoft started giving away its own Internet
browser for free, stuck to his guns, insisting that Microsoft has
acted unfairly and illegally in its effort to defeat Netscape in
the so-called browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   But using Barksdale as a foil, Microsoft did manage to introduce
several pieces of evidence potentially damaging to the sweeping
antitrust case brought against Microsoft by the federal government,
20 states and the District of Columbia:
</P>
<P>
   _Netscape's co-founder, Jim Clark, said in a deposition that
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates told him in October 1994 that he
planned to offer the Microsoft browser for free. Microsoft said
that conversation undermines the notion that Microsoft decided to
make its browser free only in 1995 as a tactic to crush Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the Gates statement _ if it was really made
_ doesn't matter because it was made as a threat to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   _Unbeknown to his colleagues at Netscape, Clark sent a Microsoft
executive an e-mail in December 1994 asking Microsoft to consider
investing in Netscape. Microsoft said that e-mail negates the
government's claim that Microsoft introduced the notion of
investing in Netscape in 1995 as an enticement for Netscape to
agree to an illegal division of the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the 1994 proposal is irrelevant because it
was rejected the next day by Microsoft. Clark sent it at 3 a.m. on
one of his last days as chief executive when he was anxious to
recoup his personal $5 million investment in the company, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   _Tens of millions of copies of Netscape's browser are downloaded
from the Internet each year. Microsoft says that shows that
Microsoft has not foreclosed Netscape's access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale insisted that many copies are simply downloaded as
upgrades by current Netscape users, and that Microsoft's
integration of the browser into its operating system and
Microsoft's deals with America Online and various Internet service
providers have limited Netscape's access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of the trial _ Barksdale's second day on the stand
_ brought an escalation in the level of anger in the courtroom.
Barksdale and Microsoft's lawyer, John Warden, could barely contain
their contempt for one another, sneering, snapping, interrupting
and raising their voices as they jousted.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony made it clear that Netscape and Microsoft flirted with
a collaborative relationship for about a year before all-out war
broke out between the companies. Barksdale testified that Microsoft
offered to buy Netscape in November 1994, but Netscape rejected the
offer. The next month Clark made his secret request for Microsoft
to invest in the company, but Microsoft rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, in an incident that is at the heart of the
government's case, Microsoft allegedly offered to invest in
Netscape if Netscape would abandon the market for Internet browsers
compatible with Windows 95. Barksdale said Microsoft executives
promised there would be a ``Bill effect'' from a Microsoft
investment in Netscape, in which the potential stock price of
Netscape when it went public would rise because investors would be
impressed by a Gates vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the proposals worked out, and since mid-1995 the
companies have been wrestling over the market for Internet
browsers. Microsoft made its browser free, and included it with the
operating system used by most consumers; in response, Netscape also
made its browser free. Microsoft's market share has risen steadily,
and the two companies each have about half the market now.
</P>
<P>
   Warden suggested that Microsoft's growing market share for
Internet browsers is attributable to the superior quality of the
product. He displayed 19 news articles favoring Internet Explorer,
including one that described the Microsoft product as ``a white-hot
(Netscape) Navigator killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale attributed the decline of Netscape's market share
to Microsoft's illegally anti-competitive actions _ forcing
computer makers to include Internet Explorer on every computer and
bullying other key industry players into promoting the Microsoft
product.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale testified that he had been told by Gil Amelio, the
former chief executive of Apple Computer, that Microsoft had
threatened to stop manufacturing a key software product for Apple
unless Apple agreed to promote Microsoft's browser at the expense
of Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale complained that ``Microsoft took away half my
distribution,'' but Warden sneeringly referred to Barksdale's
notion of ``your God-given right to 95 percent of the market.''
Attempting to show that competition is a part of corporate life,
Warden asked rhetorically, ``what was GM's market share before the
Japanese started selling automobiles?''
</P>
<P>
   Citing statements made by other Netscape executives to book
authors and in depositions, Warden repeatedly tried to get
Barksdale to say that Netscape had planned to give away its own
browser for free, even before Microsoft decided to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale, who owns 5 million shares of Netscape currently
valued at about $115 million, said ``you can go flat broke doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having difficulty showing a profit,'' he said of his
company's plight since it started offering its own browser free, in
response to Microsoft's action.

   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The 9-millimeter semiautomatic looks like an
ordinary pistol, evil and menacing to gun haters, strangely
beautiful to gun fanciers. But this is no ordinary weapon; pull the
trigger and nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Only when a shooter puts on a special wristband, containing a
tiny radio transmitter, does a squeeze of the trigger make the
hammer snap down hard, making the gun every bit the lethal weapon
it appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   The pistol is a computerized ``smart gun,'' designed to fire
only for its owner. And its maker, Colt's Manufacturing Co., sees
it as the firearms industry's reply to one of the strongest
criticisms of gun control advocates _ that guns too often fall into
the wrong hands, those of children or criminals, usually with
horrible consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's hopes, naturally, that the new product will help it
survive what has become a long decline in the gun market. But in a
broader sense, company executives and other believers in the
smart-gun concept say they also hope that it will redefine the gun
debate in America, and narrow the bitter gulf between those who see
evil in guns and those who see good.
</P>
<P>
   A smart gun is still at least a year from coming to market, but
already, several states, including New Jersey and Maryland, are
considering legislation that would require such recognition
technology in guns sold there. And though the political battle is
only now warming up, unusual alliances are being struck.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun manufacturers, like Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., are openly
skeptical about smart guns, saying that the technology is not
reliable enough. And some ardent gun foes would rather abolish
handgun sales altogether. But at the same time, Colt's has found a
supporter in Handgun Control Inc., the chief gun-control lobby in
Washington, led by Sarah Brady, whose husband, James S. Brady, the
White House spokesman who was gravely wounded in the assassination
attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who oppose or question the usefulness of
developing smart guns are the extremists at both ends of the gun
control debate,'' said Naomi Paiss, the group's communications
director. ``Gun manufacturers who are not investing in smart gun
technology are obviously quite afraid that their wares will
instantly become the Ford Pintos of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side there are the extremists _ I don't think it
is unfair to describe them that way _ who oppose making safer guns
because they really believe that no gun should be sold or privately
owned in this country. They are both wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies are pursuing different smart-gun
technologies, including one that depends on recognizing a gun
owner's fingerprints, and another that recognizes the owner's hand
size. The Colt gun is the closest to production, however.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's built its smart gun prototype with the help of a $500,000
research grant from the National Institute of Justice, a federal
agency, but it spent millions more on the research, said Marc
Fontaine, Colt's chief operating officer. Colt's lineup of
semiautomatic handguns range in price from about $250 for a light,
.22-caliber target pistol to $813 for its new .45-caliber Combat
Commander. The recognition technology will add $300 to $400 to the
price of each gun, Fontaine said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. gun sales, and particularly handgun sales, have been
slipping steadily over the last two decades. American firearms
production has declined to 3.8 million in 1996 from 5 million in
1977 and handgun production to 1.5 million from 1.9 million in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   To the executives at Colt's, which has only recently emerged
from bankruptcy and expects this year to turn its first profit in
12 years, the smart gun promises to win new markets, particularly
among women, a small but growing segment of gun owners who may see
a smart gun as a solution to their fear of having their own weapon
used against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to want smart guns,'' said Buck
Hendrickson, a Colt's vice president. ``Then the little kids can't
shoot each other and nobody can take a police officer's gun away
from him and shoot him, and states like New Jersey and New York and
Maryland and Delaware and maybe even Virginia are going to have
legislatures saying, `The only kind of gun you can buy here is a
smart gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Sliwa, Colt's president, called the smart gun a
``major growth prospect'' for Colt's.
</P>
<P>
   But David M. Guthrie, director of equity research at the Memphis
investment firm of Morgan Keegan &AMP; Co. _ which has underwritten
stock offerings for Sturm, Ruger, the country's only publicly held
firearms manufacturer _ said the smart gun would only sell if the
law commanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that buy guns tend to be pretty conservative and they
don't like things that are far out,'' Guthrie said. ``You might
sell a smart gun to someone who wants a gun for self defense, but
unless there is some type of forced legislation that gives you no
choice, people are not going to gravitate to a product like this.''

</P>
<P>
   However far it is from production or widespread acceptance, the
new ``safe gun'' or ``personalized gun,'' as it is also known, is
still the biggest news in years to come out of the firearms
industry, which has been rooted here in the Connecticut River
Valley since Samuel Colt began making revolvers more than 160 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the smart gun is the first technological countermeasure
the gun industry has mounted to the wave of legal and marketplace
challenges that have confronted the industry in recent decades _
from laws against assault-style rifles to recent efforts by
anti-gun forces to use product liability lessons of the tobacco
wars against gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   But while Colt's officials are enthusiastic about the gun's
prospects, critics inside and outside the industry see it as a
waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's big rival a few miles to the north in
Springfield, Mass., suspended its smart gun program some time ago
to wait for the technology to advance. L.E. Shultz, president and
chief executive at Smith &AMP; Wesson, echoes the chief argument
against smart guns, that technology will do nothing to stop the
misuse of guns by their proper owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to shoot your wife, you will go out and get your
gun and shoot her,'' Shultz said. ``It's the aura of the smart gun
as the solution to that situation that I have a problem with,
because I don't think we will be able to develop in our lifetime or
even in our children's' lifetime a gun that can determine its
user's attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturm, Ruger, based in Southport, Conn., has also rejected the
current leading technology for the smart gun: the radio
transmitter, called a transponder, which, when brought close to the
gun, engages its firing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major failure that we see with any of these so-called
smart guns is the battery,'' said Stephen L. Sanetti, vice
president and general counsel at Ruger. ``Whether you are on a
target range or on a hunting trip you saved for for years, or, in
the worst-case scenario, defending your family, if the battery has
failed, your options are that either the gun doesn't work or the
safety doesn't work, and that makes the technology incompatible
with firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because one of the major components of the safety of a firearm
is its reliability under all conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   A safe gun would also continue to work if its transmitter
bracelet were stolen along with the weapon, as well as if, in a
struggle with an assailant, the gun were fired while still in or
touching the owner's hand. The Colt's smart gun's police
transponder will be programmable so that officers can fire one
another's guns.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's officials say that their smart-gun prototype still has to
undergo real-life testing _ dropping it in the mud and hard
surfaces, using it in the rain _ _ before it will be ready to go on
the market. The testing will be intended to satisfy police
officers, who are expected to be the first users of the guns; 13
percent of officers killed in the line of duty are shot with their
own weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The transponder used by Colt's has a range of only a few inches,
Colt's officials said, making a gun useless even if held within
feet of an officer by an assailant. Use by the police would go a
long way to reassuring civilian customers that the smart gun will
fire when it should, Colt's officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the unproven nature of the smart gun that causes the
lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association, the country's
largest gun owners' group, to resist any laws mandating their
adoption, said James Jay Baker, the NRA's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any harm in proceeding with the
development of a safer firearm,'' he said, ``but I think there is a
problem with adopting a technology that doesn't even exist yet.
Some of the anti-gun proponents in Congress are already talking
about mandating it for everybody, and it's not even on the market
yet, and the police haven't even accepted the technology yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., a federal
research center, issued its own 172-page review of smart gun
technology for use in police work in 1996 with a highly iffy
conclusion. After reviewing more than a dozen possible
technologies, from the radio frequency tag system Colt's has
developed to biometric devices that cause the gun to recognize,
say, the length of a particular police officer's finger, it found
that no approach scored higher than a B, in part because of
concerns about battery life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take a generation of smart gun systems to come and go
before a smart gun is not only common, but favored over a nonsmart
gun,'' the report, by D.R. Weiss, concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Weiss predicted that smart guns would
eventually be perfected and produced, but he cautioned that the
technology should be settled before laws mandating the guns are
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will see them eventually,'' he said, ``but we will
have to make sure that the job is done properly, because it would
be very detrimental if something were put out and widely
distributed and it didn't work. The mistake could cost smart guns
their reputation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside the gun industry, the smart gun has provoked conflicting
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, the former White House press secretary, went to Trenton,
N.J., in September to endorse New Jersey's proposed smart-gun
legislation, which is strongly opposed by the NRA and by the
state's influential gun-owners lobby, the Coalition of New Jersey
Sportsmen. (Although the New Jersey legislation is supported by
some members of both parties, it faces steep obstacles in getting
to the floors of the House and Senate.)
</P>
<P>
   But the more stringently anti-gun Violence Policy Center, which
favors phasing out private handgun ownership entirely, opposes
them. The center maintains that smart guns are unlikely to reduce
suicides, the largest single cause of death from guns, and that the
second-highest category, homicides, are most often committed among
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the center maintains, most gun owners have more than
one handgun, leaving plenty of ``dumb'' guns still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Center objects to any technology that is likely to
lead to increased handgun sales _ and additional sales are just
what Hendrickson at Colt's expects to get from smart guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say this thing hits next year and it works, and it
works well,'' Hendrickson said. ``You're going to see so much
legislation that says that only the smart gun can be sold that it's
going to put the other gun factories out of business.''

EDITORIAL: WALL STREET OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 22:
</P>
<P>
   After a season of worry that sent prices plunging and sparked
talk of world recession, many of the world's financial markets have
rallied amid optimism that the worst will be avoided. The
recoveries are a welcome sign of renewed investor confidence in the
ability of central banks and national governments to prevent a
severe downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, the Dow Jones industrial average is up almost
1,000 points since it bottomed at the end of August, with most of
the gain having come in the past week. The most economically
sensitive stocks _ the ones that would suffer the most in a
recession _ have been among the biggest gainers. In addition, bank
stocks that fell sharply when the world's financial problems seemed
most acute have recovered a significant part of their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, there have been strong rallies in Latin America,
Europe and Asia. To be sure, stock markets in developing countries
remain well down from their peaks, but the rallies do show that at
least some investors see a brighter outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for hope are not hard to spot. The Federal Reserve's
latest move to lower interest rates was a pleasant surprise, and
the plunge in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen has
provided relief for Asian countries whose own currencies were under
pressure. There is widespread hope that the International Monetary
Fund, recapitalized after the belated congressional approval of an
$18 billion contribution, will be able to keep Asian flu from
causing pneumonia in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still disquieting signs in financial markets.
While stock prices have risen in most countries, the threat of a
credit crunch for many borrowers has not abated. In this country,
companies with less-than-sterling credit are having trouble issuing
bonds. Overseas, many countries have to pay punishing interest
rates if they can borrow in international markets at all. Only when
those trends reverse will it be clear that investors are again
reasonably confident.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the news in Japan is mixed, at best. The
long-overdue plan to bail out the country's banks has adequate
funds but there is reason to doubt whether it will be applied
either rapidly or effectively. Moreover, the rising yen threatens
to damage Japan's exporters, one of the few strong areas of that
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Asian crisis began in the summer of 1997, there have
been a number of worldwide rallies amid optimism that the economic
problem would be contained. But after a time it became clear that
the problems were spreading. Markets now are likely to become a bit
less volatile while awaiting evidence whether the latest efforts to
boost world growth will be adequate to deal with the problem.

OPPOSING IMPEACHMENT LAWYERS OPEN FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Wednesday accused congressional
Republicans of rigging an unfair impeachment proceeding, and
Republicans fired back that Democrats were merely trying to exploit
a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual recriminations came as Republican and Democratic
lawyers squared off in an often contentious first meeting to begin
defining the contours of impeachment hearings. Republicans also
signaled their intentions to announce a witness list in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting on Capitol Hill, one of President Clinton's
lawyers accused the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee of
rebuffing Democratic efforts to wrap up the inquiry quickly by
leaving its scope open-ended and refusing to define what an
impeachable offense is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not yet convinced that this tribunal is operating by a
fair, even-handed, impartial set of rules,'' Gregory Craig, a
special White House counsel, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But a top Republican committee aide, Paul McNulty, marched to
the microphones to rebut Craig's accusations, and to underscore
that Republicans had adopted Watergate-style procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point the president's defenders have got to get away
from this partisan attack on process and fairness,'' McNulty said.
``That's the strategy: attack the process and make it look like
we're not working productively so the American people lose
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democrats acknowledge, that is their strategy, and so
far it has worked. Public opinion polls show that most Americans
believe that the Republican-led inquiry is sharply biased against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's tone, more combative before the cameras than in the
private meeting, lawyers for both sides said, aimed both to
establish bargaining markers for the White House as well as to help
the Democratic voter base get fired up two weeks before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats were willing Wednesday to let the White House
play the bad cop role.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional Democratic aide put it this way: ``We're just
laying back and letting the impression that this process is unfair
set in. We're also being careful not to overplay our hand. We need
to maintain good relations with Republicans in case there's an
opportunity to make a deal after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters Wednesday, Speaker Newt Gingrich
accused Democrats of playing a ``deliberate calculated political
game,'' adding, ``I think they were going to scream partisanship no
matter what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Many House members have said that the verbal attacks will soften
after the elections when the need for both parties to rally their
partisans is over. Democrats have voiced concern that their
complaints could wear thin with the public if they are seen as
trying to prolong the impeachment proceedings as a political
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting Wednesday marked the first effort by
committee staff members and White House lawyers to set the ground
rules and procedures since the House approved the formal inquiry
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Committee lawyers met with Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, and Craig. No
lawmakers attended. Much was discussed, but little was agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's witness list is sure to be contentious.
Republican aides are examining who might be subpoenaed and who
might be granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want to call the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, and Monica Lewinsky. Some Republicans want to summon Bruce
Lindsey, deputy White House counsel and one of Clinton's closest
aides. Committee staff say a list could be announced in the next
two weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides defended the committee's procedures, saying
Clinton's lawyers have the same rights and procedures that the
Democrats afforded Richard M. Nixon's attorneys in the 1974
Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers will be able to question witnesses in
hearings, but it is not clear whether they would be allowed to even
sit in on depositions. That decision may be up to Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the panel's chairman, whom White House lawyers will try to
meet with in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained Wednesday that the inquiry's scope was
open-ended. David Schippers, the committee's chief investigative
counsel has expanded Starr's original 11 possible impeachment
counts to 15. But Hyde has now narrowed those to three basic
categories: lying under oath, witness tampering and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Hyde has said the inquiry will likely focus on
the Lewinsky scandal, he is not ruling out other information that
could lead to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought Wednesday to have impeachable offenses defined,
but were rebuffed. A Judiciary Committee panel postponed a hearing
this week on that topic, probably until early next month. But
Democrats say the standards for impeachable offenses should be set
before the inquiry proceeds.

LARGE PENALTY LIKELY AGAINST DIESEL-ENGINE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to
impose its biggest civil penalty ever in a likely settlement with
manufacturers of heavy-duty diesel-truck engines for violating
clean-air standards, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several days, lawyers for the EPA and the Justice
Department have been wrapping up a deal with several engine makers
that would force the companies to pay large fines and speed up the
introduction of cleaner engines.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers are also expected to take other steps to
offset the excess emissions produced by as many as a million trucks
with engines that the government says were designed to evade
pollution standards of the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   One manufacturer, Cummins Engine Co., said Wednesday that the
negotiations ``appear to be concluding'' and government officials
said they expected a settlement as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working to conclude discussions as soon as possible so
that we can reach an agreement that protects public health and the
environment,'' said Loretta Ucelli, the EPA spokeswoman. She said
it would be inappropriate to discuss the details until the deal was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the settlement could cost the companies close to $1
billion dollars before taxes and significantly reduce future
pollution from diesel trucks, a major source of smog and acid rain,
especially in the Northeast and California, where officials have
been closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and government officials say diesel engines
were passed over in emission standards until the 1990s because they
caused much less smog than did cars and smokestack industries. But
since car emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide began to be
regulated in 1970, diesel engines have increasingly emerged as a
greater problem.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been briefed on the settlement said it did not
require that the trucks be immediately recalled and modified.
Instead, the EPA wants to use some of the money from the settlement
to pay for changes to the engines when they wear out and have to be
rebuilt, typically after several years or a few hundred thousand
miles of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials decided that truck owners would be unlikely to
comply with a recall, since fixing the pollution problem would cut
fuel efficiency and significantly increase the costs of driving the
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   As many as a million trucks are involved, some of them giving
off as much as twice the allowable amount of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   They were built in the last 10 years by several companies,
including Cummins, Detroit Diesel Corp., Mack Trucks, Navistar
International Transportation Co., Caterpillar, Renault and Volvo.
It is not known which companies will be covered by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The government believes that the companies used computerized
controls built into the diesel engines to ensure that the engines
run as cleanly as possible in the laboratory during emissions tests
required by the federal law. But when the trucks are actually
cruising on the highways, the controls are programmed to adjust how
the engines operate, saving fuel but letting pollution rise.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the computer controls alter the timing of fuel
injection in the engine after monitoring the engine's operating
speed over a period of time, effectively deactivating the main
control that limits emissions, the agency has claimed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, pollution experts say, these trucks are giving off
as much smog-forming chemicals as about 50 million automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers have disputed the assertion that they evaded
the pollution laws, saying that the engine tests designed by the
EPA simulate urban driving patterns and that the engine designs do
indeed control pollution during stop-and-go driving on congested
roads.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its third-quarter earnings Wednesday, Cummins said
that ``resolution of this matter could have a material effect on
Cummins financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil penalties are not tax deductible, but some of the steps
the companies would have to take, like introducing clean engines
sooner than planned, will be a normal cost of doing business and
will lessen the companies' tax liabilities, cushioning the
financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   The companies would also spend some of the settlement money to
provide vehicles with clean-burning engines that they produce
themselves for demonstration projects, like urban mass-transit
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has been under negotiation and in litigation
since early this year, is being watched by state officials and
environmental advocates. Truck operators and members of Congress
have also been putting pressure on the agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some state officials, including New York and New Jersey
authorities, were involved in the talks, and environmental
advocates have filed a related lawsuit in California.
</P>
<P>
   The American Trucking Association wrote President Clinton on
Tuesday to protest the impending deal, saying it would ``require
significant changes in new engines and trucks in overly short and
unreasonable time periods.''
</P>
<P>
   But Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer representing the Sierra Club and the
Environmental Law Foundation, said the groups would challenge the
deal in court because the agency was not demanding an instant
recall of the trucks. ``Every year of delay is more cancer and more
illness,'' Meyerhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the final details were hammered out, with some
manufacturers still holding out, the outlines of the deal were
described by several people involved.
</P>
<P>
   They said the civil penalty alone, expected to be about $100
million, would make the settlement as big as any ever reached by
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less would be absurd,'' said Jason Grumet, executive
director of Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a
regional organization of pollution-control authorities. ``This is
far and away the biggest violation of air-quality standards under
the Clean Air Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has estimated that hundreds of thousands of trucks may
emit up to twice the permitted level of nitrogen oxides, chemicals
that contribute to smog and to acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, heavy-duty truck engines account for about
one-third of all emissions of nitrogen oxides. Rough calculations
by state officials indicate that the faulty trucks may be emitting
a million tons of nitrogen oxides a year. And the trucks that are
already on the road are likely to remain in use for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists objected to the lack of a recall. Others
said they would wait to see how much of the pollution would be
eliminated, and on what timetable, before making comments on any
settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What little I know of the human heart and the human mind I
learned long ago from television. Programming back then was
black-and-white, as seemed the world it purported to represent.
These were the early '60s, before there was much educational
television per se, and grade-school squirts like me were left to
sort things out for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials of that era were particularly helpful in this
regard, rendering the best and worst of our mutual experience in
schematic diagrams that even children could understand. Hence my
ardent lifetime conviction that the brain is shaped like a tiny
anvil.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden headache pain was then characterized as an equally teensy
hammer, banging away inside a tortured silhouette skull, lightning
bolts radiating from the sickly cranium until soothed by the
advertiser's brand of fast-acting analgesic. The convolute
architecture of our very intellect, I thought, was no more
complicated than a cave painting.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious workings of the modern heart were animated, too,
except that Joe Torso bore a throbbing cartoon valentine in his
mighty breast. Aglow with the fires of unutterable longing,
perhaps? Nope. Too much stress, too much pastrami. Fast, fast, fast
heartburn relief was only an antacid tablet away.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the actual mechanisms of mind and body are far more
complicated than we were led then to believe. Evidence of which is
to be found on this fall's newly revamped ``Oprah'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 13th national season, the show has, like its host,
undergone yet another makeover. A psychospiritual Reformation
really, in which any attempt to entertain has been abandoned in
favor of a search for Truth, Wellness and Reduced-Fat Snacks That
Still Satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Gamely (if immodestly) titled ``Change Your Life TV,'' the show
is now solely devoted to the mind-numbing cliches of personal
improvement. It is a self-help anthology, presented with the
missionary zeal of someone who's already got hers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is about nothing so much as Ms. Winfrey herself, and her
televised pilgrimage toward a more rewarding state of Oprahness.
Given our nation's endless search for the short cut to our better
selves, it is the shrewdest programming move she could have made.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Oprah's quest for human betterment is
insincere, but rather that she has once again anticipated the next
pang of her audience's appetite. Oprah was, remember, among the
first to book the sort of pathological sideshows that daytime is so
roundly criticized for today.
</P>
<P>
   She was also among the first to abandon them. Her regular
appearances in the financial monthlies as one of the highest
paid/most powerful people in entertainment is based on more than
her performance as television's most beloved ubiquitous empath. She
is a shrewd businesswoman too.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, like many gurus and circuit riders before her, Oprah has
found a way to shamelessly market the history of her own misery and
confusion as a form of worship.
</P>
<P>
   She is helped in this enterprise by a stable of experts, each
appearing in rotation to explain for us the metaphysics of joy and
sorrow and 401-K plans. First among equals is John Gray, author of
``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' Gray, a PhD, has been
appearing on consecutive Wednesdays to help us feel better about
ourselves by, well, feeling better about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   To this end the stage is dressed with a number of large blocks
on which are written the emotional states that alternately imprison
us or set us free. One can only break through to selfhood by
exchanging a red ``anxiety'' block for a yellow ``fear'' block,
which leads inexorably to a green ``love'' block. None of which is
any easier to follow than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise the advice of Suze Ormon, the show's money maven, who
ladles out chicken soup for the portfolio; murky investment tips
laced with the sort of generic uplift found in fortune cookies.
Fear and loathing, it seems, also turn away money.
</P>
<P>
   There are other experts as well this season, but they, too, are
largely superfluous, because the instructor for this course in
miracles is Oprah herself. No longer content to mediate a
discussion between the audience and a guest, Oprah cuts out the
middleman and dispenses advice like a vending machine (the experts
all have a tough time getting a word in edgewise).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire show has become completely self-referential.
Witness this year's theme song, sung by Ms. Winfrey. A vague sort
of Up With People nod to an old Negro spiritual, it sounds as
though Oprah's voice was run through more filters than the Newark
water supply. There is a video that accompanies the song.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening show, viewers not only saw the video itself
(which now serves as the show's opening title sequence) but were
treated to a ``making of'' video of the video and a taped package
that chronicled Ms. Winfrey's desultory singing lessons. All
starring guess who?
</P>
<P>
   But this is trifling. Oprah's a good sport about poking fun at
her own voice, and major celebrities often indulge their fantasies
to sing or dance or do comedy.
</P>
<P>
   What's worrisome about the '99-model Oprah is this: like
Lonesome Rhodes in ``A Face in the Crowd,'' she's begun to take
herself seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Self-reference is one thing; self-reverence is another.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The show has more in common these days with an Al-Anon meeting
or a weekend franchise seminar at the airport Hilton than it does
with any recognizable form of television talk show. Rather it is an
hourlong interpretation of the Gospel According to Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Shot through with the usual platitudes of New Age unmeaning,
there is talk of ``empowerment'' and ``gratitude'' and ``getting to
a better place.'' Homage is paid and prayers are offered to the
``greater spirit.'' Mantras are chanted in service of healing or
better relationships or making more money. Parables are told and
conversions witnessed and the liturgy of ritualized victimization
is pronounced, i.e. ``The only answer to the question `Were you
sexually abused as a child?' is yes or I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Even celebrity interviews are now conducted mainly in
rehabilitative terms. Roseanne's appearance on Oprah's first show
was a three-hankie knee-slapper dealing with all the personal
challenges one confronts on the way to the top. (They're much worse
than those faced on the way to the middle, we're assured.)
</P>
<P>
   A lonely, if lucrative, place, the top, and the necessity of
rigorous self-examination, a better haircut and a competent plastic
surgeon cannot be overstated in its attainment. Luck was not spoken
of. Levels of enlightenment were cataloged and clips rolled and the
truth of things rooted out. Left unexpressed, oddly, was the fact
that Roseanne's show is produced and distributed by the same
company behind Oprah's, an omission that took the nickel-bright
shine off some of the truth telling.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fluffing a colleague's new show, selling more tickets to
her movie or co-opting the literary gravitas of yet another
soon-to-be-best-selling author, Oprah's shows conclude with a
segment called Remembering Your Spirit. These generally find Ms.
Winfrey in a state of soft-focus suburban satori; all rub-a-dub in
a really big tub surrounded by candles and affirmation literature,
or trailing a finger through the cool, still waters of a pond on
her farm.
</P>
<P>
   We are encouraged to relax like Oprah, to be good to ourselves
like Oprah, to ``journal our gratitude'' like Oprah. Photographed
through what looks like a field hospital battle dressing, these
moments seem to argue that our highest philosophical achievements
as a species lie somewhere between the flocked greeting card and
the closing remarks at a high school sports banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the current pop-psych organ-grinders on the
best-seller list, Oprah's solipsistic approach to self-betterment
borrows liberally from the world's great religions, and from every
philosopher who lies between the age of Anaxagoras and the age of
Anna Nicole Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The synthesis of all this is a cryptoreligion of self, a
systematized fixation on personal entitlement. Conveniently ignored
is the fact that Oprah's self-examination is the product of her
success, not vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, this kind of navel-gazing seems to result in a
myopic national selfishness wherein we trade our commonly agreed
upon moral imperatives for the short-term comforts of our now
incontestable individual emotions. (I feel, therefore I am.)
</P>
<P>
   We want to feel good about ourselves, or at least better,
sometimes at the cost of our best collective interests. We've
enslaved ourselves to sensitivity. Paradoxically we find the
country mired in the Clinton-Starr mudhole because we sought a
president who promised, Oprah-like, to feel our pain, and little
else. We wanted a touchy-feely presidency, and that's exactly what
we got.
</P>
<P>
   Is Oprah then the cause of the current global decline into
ethical relativism? Hardly, but she's not the cure for it either.
We shouldn't mistake the ersatz deification of celebrity for
enlightenment. She is, remember, a talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   A savvy one, certainly, who's manifested more public
incarnations than Vishnu and Madonna combined. Therein lies the
secret of her great success. Like Elmer Gantry, she was and is and
will be what we want her to be: a sly avatar of the holy
possibilities of personal re-invention.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I'll take the hammer, the anvil and the unutterable longings
of the cartoon heart.
</P>

TALIBAN AIDE CASTS DOUBT ON GIVING UP BIN LADEN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A senior official of the Taliban, the militant
Muslim group that controls Afghanistan, says that his government
has no intention of extraditing Osama bin Laden, the man the United
States has accused of planning the bombings of American embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Abdelhakim Mujahid, the Taliban ambassador to
Pakistan, said in an interview here on Tuesday that the Taliban
continued to allow the Saudi-born millionaire to live in the
country. He said, however, that the Taliban was willing to
entertain any charges that Washington presented against bin Laden
``if they are backed by credible proof'' of complicity in any
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Mujahid left no room for extraditing bin Laden. He
said if evidence was submitted, the Taliban would examine its
``veracity'' and then convene a committee of Muslim religious
authorities to evaluate what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osama bin Laden has lived in Afghanistan for more than 15
years, where he is considered a hero for his fight against the
Soviets,'' Mujahid said. ``It would be very difficult for us to
make a case to our people and our public opinion for pushing him
outside now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid, here to argue the case for admitting the Taliban as the
legitimate representatives of Afghanistan to the United Nations, is
the Taliban's candidate for the position. Under present U.N. rules,
Afghanistan is represented by envoys appointed by the previous
government, which has largely collapsed. On Tuesday, the
credentials committee of the General Assembly recommended that a
decision be deferred, leaving the current envoys in place.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said the Taliban was not under any pressure from the two
countries that recognize them, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, to
deliver bin Laden to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the most cordial relations with Saudi Arabia and very
good relations with Pakistan,'' he said. ``As far as bin Laden is
concerned, it must be remembered that these two countries and the
United States supported him for a long time when he played a major
role in fighting the Soviets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden also has a history of backing militant Islamic actions
and has made an open declaration of his intention to make Americans
a target of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said bin Laden was forbidden to engage in activities
against other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot contact foreigners for that purpose,'' he said. ``He
cannot use publications or other means of information to launch any
actions, and he cannot send hostile messages about other countries
or governments.'' He could not, for instance, promote violence in
Egypt, which has accused bin Laden of supporting Muslim
fundamentalist organizations waging a campaign of terrorism against
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid strongly hinted that relations between the Taliban and
the United States were not as bad as the American press suggests.
``The American attitude is positive,'' he said. ``We are talking.
On Osama bin Laden we have told the United States: If there is
evidence bring it.''

 BofA's Coulter May Have Never Seen It Coming  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
David Coulter may have been the last one to see the barreling
freight train that just ran him over.
<P>
   Until nearly the end, the San Francisco executive who said
Tuesday he will quit the No. 2 job at the new BankAmerica Corp.,
clung to the delusion that he would run the bank within a few
years, people close to him said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a view that virtually no one else in the banking
industry shared.
</P>
<P>
   When NationsBank Corp. agreed to buy the old BofA six months
ago, bank watchers predicted that NationsBank's take-no-prisoners
chief executive Hugh McColl would do what he had done in dozens of
previous takeovers: make short work of the institution's top
managers.
</P>
<P>
   McColl's declaration that it was his ``present intention'' that
Coulter succeed him was widely seen as hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the old BofA's recent huge losses in trading and
investing _ especially its $372 million write-off of its loan to
New York investment firm D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co. _ handed McColl the blunt
instrument he needed to rid himself of Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that problems surfaced at Shaw became very
convenient,'' said Dick Bove, a St. Petersburg, Fla., analyst with
Raymond James &AMP; Associates. ``It allowed the NationsBank people to
do what they wanted to do anyway _ consolidate control of
management in the hands of NationsBank people.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Coulter out of the way, there's little to stop
NationsBank from obliterating the old BofA, an institution integral
to San Francisco since its founding by A.P. Giannini in 1904 as a
bank catering to Italian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank has devoured 37 banks and financial services
companies in the 1990s, establishing itself as the second-largest
bank in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, McColl, 63, an ex-Marine with a tough-guy
reputation, has made himself arguably the most powerful banker in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   McColl's modus operandi is to pour on the charm while he's
negotiating a deal and dump his target's top managers after a
transaction is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Dave Coulter is something we've seen before
at other companies NationsBank has acquired,'' said Thomas Brown,
an analyst with Tiger Management, a New York investment
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Take Barnett Banks Inc., the big Florida bank that NationsBank
bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   When NationsBank announced its purchase of the Jacksonville,
Fla., bank, it said Barnett President Allen Lastinger would be its
top executive in the Sunshine State. Less than a month after the
transaction was completed last January, Lastinger stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``NationsBank has a very fixed idea about how they want to do
business,'' Lastinger said in an interview. ``It's a fact that not
many senior officers of Barnett remained.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite NationsBank's record, Coulter, 51, seems to have taken
seriously the claim that his transaction was a ``merger of equals''
and that he was McColl's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings after the merger was announced, Coulter said he
ceded control to NationsBank because BofA wasn't large enough to
remain competitive as banks with nationwide operations begin to
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the merger announcement, evidence began to
accumulate that NationsBank was seizing control, awarding, for
example, plumb jobs to its own people. Several months ago, when top
consumer-banking jobs went disproportionately to executives of the
North Carolina bank, Coulter called McColl in a fruitless protest,
bank insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, meanwhile, was still telling confidantes that all he
needed to do was ``behave'' himself until McColl retired.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's chief put out word that he was shopping for a house in
Charlotte. And after BofA disclosed that he had a golden parachute
agreement giving him some $50 million to $100 million if he left
following the merger, he sent a voice mail message to bank
employees that he intended to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, who started out as a financial analyst, is cerebral and
personable with little patience for political infighting,
colleagues said. He was no match for McColl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the smartest guys I ever met, but he has no street
smarts,'' said one executive who worked for him recently.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who have talked with Coulter, it became
apparent by the end of September that NationsBank was setting him
up to take the fall for Shaw and other losses.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank channeled all financial information through
Charlotte and put a gag on the BofA people who had managed trading
and investments, bank insiders said. Then after losses were
announced, McColl immediately sent an emissary to demand Coulter's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said that even though Coulter realized NationsBank
was blaming him for losses, he still was stunned when McColl moved
swiftly to force him out. Still, with a severance package worth
tens of millions of dollars on the line, he quickly agreed to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the day his resignation was made public, Coulter sent
another voice mail message to employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that the merger has affected the lives of many of you
in personal and profound ways,'' Coulter said. ``I feel responsible
for that.''

 Feinstein No. 2 on List of `Least Net-Friendly'
Congressional  Members  By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The first national ranking of the Internet's political friends and
foes is in, and Yahoo Internet Life magazine has rated Senator
Dianne Feinstein No.2 on its list of ``least Net-friendly''
congressional members.
<P>
   Feinstein's support of government export controls on
data-scrambling technology, which are deeply opposed in Silicon
Valley, makes her ``one of the most anti-Net people in Congress,''
according to one high-tech lobbyist quoted in the magazine's
November issue.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said her pro-law-enforcement stance on encrypted
software is designed to protect national security interests without
compromising the competitiveness of high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Internet to flourish,'' Feinstein said in an
interview. ``It's just there are some places where the public
welfare demands attention, be it protecting kids from online
pornography or banning people from learning to make bombs on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's choice of 10 best and five worst cyberpoliticians
_ based on voting records over the past few years _ paints an
eclectic mix of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans on
each side.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Feinstein and Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana
Republican who has led the fight against online pornography, top
the ``least Net-friendly'' list.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and two of his
ideological foes, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senator
Conrad Burns, R-Mont., are on the ``Net-friendly'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who has presided over three Senate
Judiciary hearings excoriating Microsoft, was the only politician
to make both lists. Although he earned points as a techie, he was
dinged for holding what some have called a high-tech kangaroo
court. Many suggest that Hatch merely was representing the
interests of Microsoft rival Novell, which is based in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lens is clearly one of Net interest, regardless of
political affiliation or ideology,'' said Barry Golson,
editor-in-chief of Yahoo Internet Life in New York. ``We decided to
do this because of the staggering number of Internet-related bills
and because it is an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, one of the few politicians to oppose the Communications
Decency Act that barred online pornography in 1996, was singled out
as the most ardent defender of civil liberties on the Internet. The
CDA was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court last year
but has been revived in a weaker form as part of a $500 billion
spending package that is expected to be signed into law by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersavvy is coming along in Congress,'' Leahy said in a
statement. ``The days when some here regarded the PC in their
offices as a television that doesn't get CNN are passing away.''
</P>
<P>
   Close on Leahy's heels was Representative Christopher Cox,
R-Newport Beach,  &LR; Calif.,  &LR; author of the Internet Tax Freedom Act,
which places a three-year moratorium on new state and local taxes
on the Internet. The bill also is part of the pending omnibus
appropriations package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to be on the Net-friendly list. I believe that
encryption is the key privacy issue in the information age,'' said
Representative Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who also made the top-10 list.
``Financial transactions, personal information, medical records and
tax returns must all be protected from criminals, spies, hackers
and snoopy government bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, those deemed enemies of the Internet downplayed the
rankings.

 Microsoft Unleashes a Barrage of Snippets Against Sun Micro  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Call it the war of the snippets. That's how Microsoft Corp. has
characterized the Justice Department's antitrust case. At every
turn, Microsoft's PR machine has dismissed the government for
taking remarks out of context and calling that evidence of bully
tactics. Prosecution, maybe persecution, by snippet.
<P>
   Well, that didn't prevent Microsoft from launching its own
snippet offense yesterday. The direct target of Microsoft's
quotations barrage was Sun Microsystems, which has filed a breach
of contract suit against Microsoft for allegedly ``polluting''
Sun's Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's civil action bears on the government's antitrust case,
currently under way in a federal court in Washington, D.C. In the
next few days, the government will ask Sun Vice President James
Gosling, who created Java, to testify about Microsoft's alleged
attempts to stop Java from becoming a universal programming
language to rival Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes Gosling's testimony will show that
Microsoft has unfairly muscled not just Netscape, but Sun.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft was trying to kill two birds with one snippet
yesterday when it e-mailed reporters some juicy quotes from
previously sealed court documents in its contract dispute with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was smarter than us when we did the contract,'' said
one snippet attributed to David Spenhoff, a Java marketing officer.
``What I find most annoying is that no one at Sun saw this coming.
I don't think our folks who negotiated and agreed to these terms
understood at the time what they meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the remark bolsters his
company's case _ that it hasn't broken any contracts or
``polluted'' Java. It just negotiated a deal that gave it the
leeway to make a version of Java customized to Windows. And if that
confounds Sun's plans to use Java to undermine Windows, there's
nothing unfair about it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the snippet issue, Cullinan said: ``We are not proponents
of trial by snippet. We are just using some points that support our
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft excerpted Spenhoff's comment from a mass of documents
unsealed yesterday by San Jose federal Judge Ronald Whyte, who is
presiding over the Sun-Microsoft dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Sun chose not to highlight excerpts from the court papers it
faxed to reporters. ``Our lawyers really don't think it's ethical
to go through a legal document looking for a few points,'' said Sun
spokeswoman Lisa Poulson.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when I said ``pretty please,'' she helped me find
a few quotes in the 48 pages of legalese that supported Sun's
contention: Microsoft feared a single version of Java, running on
all sorts of computers, would undermine the predominance of
Windows. And, knowing this, Microsoft sought to fragment Java.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's chief executive Bill Gates' September 1996
remark: ``This scares the hell out of me.'' And a subsequent e-mail
from a Microsoft manager telling Gates how Microsoft will ``wrest
control of Java away from Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's an e-mail from an unidentified Microsoft vice
president suggesting that the company ``be explicitly different _
just to be different ... to pollute Java.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But I didn't see the smoking snippet that suggested Microsoft
knowingly violated its contract. There is a hint of the strong arm
in one excerpt from a contract in which Microsoft seems to require
that two independent software developers _ Aimtech and Fujitsu _
distribute only the Microsoft version of Java and not competing
flavors of the language.
</P>
<P>
   It's anyone's guess how yesterday's snippets will flow together
with all the excerpts previously released by the government and its
allies in their battle with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems disingenuous for Microsoft to base its PR defense
on demeaning snippets when it knows full well that the news is
nothing more than a snippet here and a snippet there, fairly
balanced if we do our jobs well. Does Microsoft propose we ignore
the most important antitrust trial of the century unless we can
report each and every word?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. That's why Microsoft helped predigest the
relatively minor Sun documents released yesterday _ lest the media
overlook the words most favorable to Microsoft's case.
</P>
<P>
   So thanks for the help, yesterday, Microsoft. But puh-leese.
Stop beating a dead snippet to death!

MEGAMALL VISIONARIES FOCUS ON MESA, ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The developer behind the two largest and most flamboyant malls
in the world is making a move into Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Triple Five Corp., a huge Canadian conglomerate that built the
Mall of America in Minnesota and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada,
this week got city approval for a $200 million urban village in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which would be equal in square footage and cost to
the Arizona Mills Mall in Tempe and a major coup for Mesa, would
include an open-air mix of high-end boutiques, chic restaurants,
outdoor cafes and galleries topped by offices and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also eyeing sites in Gilbert and Peoria for
projects, and plans to set up a satellite office in the Phoenix
area to look at other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really like Phoenix and see lots of possibilities here,''
an exuberant Stacy Rush, executive vice president for Triple Five,
said from the company's North American headquarters in Las Vegas.
``We've been looking at the area for some time now but hadn't come
across the right opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa project, called Village Square at Dana Ranch, will sit
on 66 acres on the northwest corner of Val Vista and Baseline
roads. It is based on a concept Triple Five launched in Las Vegas
and hopes to take into markets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a community-building urban setting where
people can live, work and recreate, all within walking distance of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen this urban village concept pop up in other cities
around the country, and the synergy of retail, homes and jobs has
been very successful,'' Mesa City Councilman Dennis Kavanagh said.
``It's quite a coup for Mesa to have the first project like this in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The design will include an upscale, open-air feel, with wide,
palm-tree-lined streets, European fountains, flowers, trees,
brooks, and walking paths that encourage people to get out of their
cars and walk around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like it in the Valley (the greater Phoenix
area),'' said Rush, who has spent 13 years with Triple Five while
living in Phoenix. The closest comparison, he said, is that there
might be some of the same feel as the Biltmore Fashion Park, the
Borgata in Scottsdale, or areas like California's Santa Barbara and
Old Town Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   After months of discussions, Village Square at Dana Ranch won
approval from the City Council and nearby neighbors, whose vocal
opposition has killed past projects proposed for the site.
</P>
<P>
   Rush said Triple Five now must line up financing and sign
tenants, but he is confident both will happen and construction will
begin within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of went about this the opposite way that most
developers do,'' he said. ``We have tenants who are very
interested, but we didn't want to proceed with anything until we
got the blessing and input of the city and neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Triple Five, based in Edmonton, Alberta, is a privately held
company run by four brothers who grew up in Iran. It has divisions
involved in banking, technology, mining, and hotel, home, apartment
and urban entertainment developments.
</P>
<P>
   But it is perhaps most famous for its two megamalls, which boast
more visitors than Disneyland, Walt Disney World and Euro Disney
combined with their mix of tourism, retail and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ghermezian brothers' grandiose visions have been scoffed at
when proposed and have seen many struggles, but family members are
widely considered visionaries in combining entertainment and retail
on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   The $700 million West Edmonton mall, for instance, is 5 million
square feet, more than twice the size of the Arizona Mills mall. It
has 800 stores, a live dolphin show, several roller coasters, an
enormous water park, an ice rink, a replica of Christopher
Columbus' ship Santa Maria, aquariums and a submarine voyage
through what is billed as the world's largest indoor lake.
</P>
<P>
   At the size of 90 football fields, it is the largest mall in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The $650 million Mall of America, which opened in 1992, is the
largest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa officials are giddy about the Village Square project, which
many see as a major boost to Mesa's image, sales tax coffers and
nearby property values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same type of development we're trying to stimulate in
our downtown,'' said Kavanagh, also a Mesa lawyer. ``When you bring
clients in to town and take them out to dinner, it's usually not in
Mesa. You go to places like Mill Avenue, downtown Scottsdale, the
Arizona Center. This can become one of those places.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush said Triple Five is looking at sites like Mesa, Gilbert and
Peoria because they are rapidly growing areas that are drastically
underserved. That means the company's projects can have a bigger
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went to somewhere like downtown Scottsdale, we'd be a
spit in the ocean,'' Rush said. ``In Mesa, we can be a whale in a
pond.'' &QL;

A GLORIOUS ADVENTURE, MADE IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(Eds: See related article LICHTENSTEIN-BAM) 
(af) 
Harvey Lichtenstein, who has announced his retirement as of June
30, is president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music. 
 By HARVEY LICHTENSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORk _ I had no master plan when I came to the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in 1967, nor any objective other than to make BAM
a successful operation. It was far from that then.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, I was inexperienced in programming and running
a theater. On the other, I was prepared to allow myself to be a
sponge, to be available to the dance, music, theater and opera that
was being generated at the time. And then there was Brooklyn. Was
it a cross to bear, as almost everyone said it was?
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the BAM Opera House has 2,100 seats, not exactly an
``off-Broadway'' theater. And the BAM Music Hall, later
rechristened the Carey Playhouse and now reconstructed as the Bam
Rose Cinemas, was a 1,000-seat theater. In addition, there was a
400-seat lecture hall, which is now a studio used mostly for
lectures and rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   To fill out the picture, what is now the Cafe was chopped up
into classrooms and rented out as a private prep school, and the
sixth-floor attic was a rented-out judo school. BAM needed the
income.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be possible to make all of this into an active
performing arts center and, as everyone said, in Brooklyn, no less?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever life is, it is most definitely a work in progress. How
did I know that my past life as a dancer, my exposure to Martha
Graham, Merce Cunningham, George Balanchine, Jerry Robbins and many
others, like Sophie Maslow, Pearl Lang, Jose Limon, Doris Humphrey,
Katie Litz and Sybil Shearer, would prepare me for BAM? That Black
Mountain and Bennington; Jack Tworkov, the abstract expressionist
painter and a cousin by marriage, and other abstract expressionists
in the late 1940s and 50s would prepare me for BAM? That my
father's love of music (he was an amateur fiddler) would prepare me
for BAM? And that my interest in English literature in college,
particularly the contemporary poetry of T.S. Eliot and Robert
Lowell, would prepare me for BAM?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever preparation I had, it was my first five years on my
return to Brooklyn, having been born and bred there, that shaped
and sharpened my view of BAM's place in the New York performing
arts scene and led eventually to the Next Wave Festival and the BAM
opera and theater activity that now defines the Brooklyn Academy of
Music. Those first five years also provided a comprehensive
education in the intricacies of running a performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   My first full season (1967-68) began with a bang and a rousing
cheer. The season opened with Sarah Caldwell's touring opera
company from Boston doing Berg's ``Lulu,'' Verdi's ``Falstaff'' and
Puccini's ``Tosca'' on a Friday and Saturday, with ``Falstaff'' the
Saturday matinee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a carefully agreed-upon schedule to set up and prepare
the stage, Sarah would not stop. She was indefatigable and
determined. I was a novice, the BAM crew was exhausted, and the
costs were mounting. Finally we turned out the stage lights during
the prep (this was on Thursday evening) and Sarah promptly bedded
down at the rear of the stage. We began again early the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lulu'' was a deserved success, but by Saturday the changeover
from ``Falstaff'' to ``Tosca'' caused the evening curtain to be
held for well over an hour. When Marie Collier as Tosca finally
leaped from the parapet, sometime after midnight, it was cause for
a rousing cheer from the audience, as much for having finally
finished the performance as for the performance itself.
Nevertheless, it was clear that Sarah's work was right for BAM, and
that ``Lulu'' was right for BAM.
</P>
<P>
   When in the spring of 1968 we presented a Merce Cunningham
season of eight performances in the Opera House, I was astonished
by the impact on me of the Cunningham work in such a concentrated
dose. I could only compare it to my first seeing Graham in the late
1940s and Balanchine in the mid-60s, when I worked for the New York
City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned by the daring and speed of the Cunningham dancers,
the unexpected twists and turns, the beauty of the formal
arrangements that suddenly appeared and just as suddenly dissolved.
It was a season of work that prepared me for so much more to come,
and it included such artists as John Cage, Jasper Johns, La Monte
Young, David Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Gordon Mumma,
Frank Stella and David Behrman.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in the fall of 1968, came the Living Theater, back
after five years of exile in Europe, in four plays about as
different as they could be: ``Frankenstein,'' Euripides'
``Antigone,'' ``Mysteries and Smaller Pieces'' and the infamous
``Paradise Now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tumultuous time, rebellious and chaotic, and the
productions were provocations as much as artistic statements. But
Julian Beck and Judith Malina were artists, and their use of the
stage, most particularly in ``Frankenstein,'' was masterly. I will
never forget the pipe grid that filled the stage space, with cells
on various levels. It was a precursor to the extraordinary
spaceship set in ``Einstein on the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A great lady, Ninon Tallon Karlweiss, who was a mentor to me
during this time, tipped me off to Jerzy Grotowski and the Polish
Laboratory Theater. Grotowski's book, ``Towards a Poor Theater,''
with an introduction by Peter Brook, had been published in 1968,
and the word was out. Grotowski was at the opposite end of the
spectrum from the Becks, employing extensive training exercises and
an extremely disciplined approach to theater.
</P>
<P>
   His first concern was the theater space: it had to be intimate,
since the audience capacities for the three productions we would
present ranged from about 40 to 100. It also had to have the right
feel, and at Grotowski's suggestion we concentrated on looking at
churches.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at several in Brooklyn, we finally settled on the
Washington Square Methodist Church in Manhattan. This was a ``peace
church'' in 1969 during the Vietnam War, and the basement was being
used to counsel draft-eligible young men.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limitations on audience size prescribed by
Grotowski, we tried to maximize the audience number. But Grotowski
was adamant. At the opening night of ``The Constant Prince,'' the
first of three productions, Grotowski would not allow the
performance to start until I left the church, since there were no
seats left.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true of the theater producer Oliver Rea, who was
giving the opening night party at his loft. The running times of
the productions were around 60 minutes, and since there were no
intermissions, Grotowski barred latecomers by bolting the large
wooden entrance doors. It was hard for the latecomers, some of whom
banged furiously at the doors, and it was hard on me and the BAM
staff, feeling the wrath of the disappointed public.

GET READY FOR TALE THAT'S YET TO BE TOLD  
 2008 SEASON COMES DOWN TO BATTLE AT PIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVONDALE, Ariz. - (Nov. 16, 2008)
</P>
<P>
   Everyone always hoped it would come down to the final race and,
perhaps, the final lap of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sport's former stars, retired drivers such as Dale
Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace and Bill Elliott, clamored for a duel in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly, the legendary Richard Petty also was telling friends
he wouldn't mind a front-row seat on pit road if it ever came down
to one race to decide the NASCAR Winston Cup championship between
the sport's two greatest drivers.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of anticipation for nearly 10 years now,
ever since Jeff Gordon began collecting checkered flags faster than
you can say, ``A.J. Foyt,'' and Dale Earnhardt Jr. began proving he
was so much more than a chip off the old man's block.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Earnhardt Jr. What a pair. What a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, racetrack promoters and some members of the media
attempted to prod a similar adversarial relationship between Gordon
and Jeff Burton, who was agreeaable to such a proposition.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't work. Couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon-Burton lacked something. Panache, maybe. Or pizazz.
Something.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon vs. Earnhardt Jr.? Oh, man, now you're talking
something to sink your teeth into.
</P>
<P>
   With Gordon, you get the constant champion. Never a hair out of
place. Hollywood handsome. Beautiful wife. Transplanted California
golden boy.
</P>
<P>
   With Earnhardt Jr., well, you get a nice kid with the Earnhardt
name.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to anyone Earnhardt Jr., was about as ``yes
sir, no sir'' polite a young man as there was in the entire great
state of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Just the mere thought of an Earnhardt challenging Gordon brought
goose bumps the size of a used car lot up and down your spine.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Earnhardt and Gordon never did develop a serious
rivalry, mostly because Earnhardt, now 57, was nearing the end of a
mostly blessed career at about the same time Gordon was beginning
to blow the doors off the competition.
</P>
<P>
   So the stock-car world waited.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the year 2000, the younger Earnhardt was shown the
green light to NASCAR's highest plateau.
</P>
<P>
   It took a season or two before the Gordon-Earnhardt Jr. rivalry
began to mushroom. But when it did, oh, my, what fever it created,
more than Petty vs. Allison or Waltrip vs. Yarborough ever could
hope to spark.
</P>
<P>
   It's not to say Gordon, now 37, and Earnhardt, now 34, are the
sport's only stars. No way.
</P>
<P>
   Not with highly talented hot shots such as Buckshot Jones,
Elliott Sadler, Matt Kenseth, Boston Reed, an Indiana product, and
Adam Petty, the fourth generation Petty to reach the NASCAR summit,
pounding the asphalt week after week.
</P>
<P>
   But no two drivers produce the kind of 200 mph blurry magic as
Gordon and Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident at the season opening Daytona 500, when the
younger Earnhardt sped past a shocked Gordon with only three laps
remaining and went on to grab a second trophy from the sport's
grandest race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying nothing would happen that last lap,'' Earnhardt
Jr. said. ``I remember how my Daddy lost the Daytona 500 one year
when he ran over something and cut a tire. Stuff like that always
seemed to happen in that race. That's why I was so worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that checkered flag, I let out a real whoop.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of season for Earnhardt and Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   One week it's Earnhardt. The next week it's Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth. Ebb and flow.
</P>
<P>
   On one particularly fine April Sunday afternoon at Texas Motor
Speedway, which had finally received its coveted second race date
seven years ago, Gordon absolutely blistered the field.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. was swept up in someone's mess early on and limped
home with a crushed right-side quarterpanel and a deflated spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him, I had Jeff,'' Earnhardt Jr. droned afterwards. ``I
really had a great race car. Then, someone's oil line broke and
there I went.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Gordon went, no one could follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, people probably won't believe this, but I really
enjoy these battles with Dale,'' Gordon said. ``They're more like
wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Wars. Patton style. Ask no quarter, give no quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It's been like that all season, a season for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Gordon entered Sunday's final race of the season
with 11 wins, the same as Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Each had the same amount of points in the driver's standings.
</P>
<P>
   And all that remained was the race at Phoenix International
Raceway, which three years earlier had become NASCAR's pick as the
final race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon always said he wished the title would come to the final
race of the year. He had been criticized for soft-pedaling it over
the final few weeks of the season in prior years, and he admitted
he did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been a mistake, but there was a lead in the
standings to protect,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Now there was no lead. Only Gordon and Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The green flag.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who was starting from the pole position, led early and
often. He lost the lead once to an aging Mark Martin, an unsung
star if ever there was one, but by Lap 149 of the 312-lap race, he
again had his rainbow-colored machine up front at the point.
</P>
<P>
   On Lap 260, Gordon survived a near disastrous crash involving
lapped traffic. But as has been his reputation, he somehow steered
cleared of the smoky catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he looked in the mirror, and guess who he saw?
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh. Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Each driver pitted under caution on Lap 262 and each driver
emerged 1-2, Gordon in front.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was getting his wish, a last race tango with his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt Jr. also had secretly pined for such a final race
confrontation. Except Earnhardt took it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted Gordon, and he wanted him on the final corner of the
final lap in the final race.
</P>
<P>
   And he got what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Lap 311. Gordon crossed the start-finish line a half-car length
ahead of Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   They banged fenders diving into Turn 1. By the exit of Turn 2,
they nearly were even.
</P>
<P>
   As they reached the dogleg section of the 1-mile oval along the
back-straightaway, you couldn't have fit a paper clip between the
two roaring machines.
</P>
<P>
   Turn 3: Even.
</P>
<P>
   Turn 4: Even.
</P>
<P>
   The final 100 feet would decide the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras flashed, and fans stood and screamed as the two cars
came flying through the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Earnhardt Jr., stood at the winner's podium hoisting a
trophy high above his head, he cast a glance toward Gordon, who
stood a few feet away.
</P>
<P>
   They eyed each other, then smiled.
</P>
<P>
   And back in their respective motorhomes, 9-year-old Jeff Gordon
II and 6-year-old Dale Earnhardt II were watching television. &QL;

 NEW YORK: disappointed public.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But there was no denying the brilliance of the work and the
amazing virtuosity of the actors, particularly the extraordinarily
toned Richard Cieslak. Grotowski achieved such an intense union of
actor and audience that it obliterated all the seeming
arbitrariness of the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   To my experiences of the Living Theater and Grotowski were soon
added Robert Wilson and Peter Brook. Wilson had done a piece called
``The King of Spain'' with a company of essentially
nonprofessionals at the Anderson Theater on Second Avenue. This
production (mostly the same) was done at BAM that same year,
renamed ``The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud.'' (It reappeared
again at BAM in 1973 as part of the 12-hour ``Life and Times of
Joseph Stalin.'') Here was a slow-moving, imagistic theater,
nonlinear, disconnected, meditative, surrealistic, achingly
beautiful, seemingly going nowhere and yet of a piece. It was as
singular a vision of theater as that of Grotowski and the Becks.
</P>
<P>
   And then, perhaps the piece de resistance of my early BAM
education, there was Peter Brook's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' at
BAM in 1971. Brook is more of a mainstream artist than Grotowski.
Wilson and the Becks. His work has been filtered through the Royal
Shakespeare Company, the West End and Broadway, Covent Garden and
the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   But he is also an adventurer and an explorer, and he has always
been driven to push beyond the conventional, to explore different
ways of doing theater and of approaching an audience, using
non-Western forms and imagery, different milieus and settings and
more intimate and concentrated stagings of opera. His ``Dream'' was
a coming together of Peter Brook, the consummate theater director,
and Peter Brook, the insatiable explorer, in a joyous burst of
creative inspiration. At the end, ``Give me your hands if we be
friends, and Robin will restore amends'' released tears of pure
joy.
</P>
<P>
   What we had in those first five seasons was the basis for what
BAM has become. First and foremost was a focus on contemporary
work, which could mean an up-and-coming artist like Twyla Tharp or
an innovative staging like ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' What was
important was that the stage work have an inherent energy that
communicated to an audience. It is true that audiences often want
to be comforted by what they know, but since there was plenty of
``what they know'' in Manhattan theaters, concert halls and opera
houses, it became BAM's mission to present new work and adventurous
and/or experimental productions and to explore repertory they did
not know.
</P>
<P>
   It is not ideology that drives BAM but rather an openness to
artists and to challenging work that create anticipation and
excitement. We are also committed internationalists, and have
presented a mixture of American and international work, which again
was pioneered during those early years. Even the more recent term
``multicultural'' would have applied to BAM then.
</P>
<P>
   And where is Brooklyn in all of this? I remember that
unforgettable statement from someone across the East River, ``I'll
wait until it gets to London.'' When I first went to BAM, Morton
Baum, my boss at the City Center of Music and Drama, which then
incorporated the New York City Ballet and New York City Opera, said
that according to the culture barons of Manhattan, the Brooklyn
Academy of Music was simply not viable, an impossible venue.
</P>
<P>
   He was, of course, both right and wrong. It was a risky
business, and we often landed in the soup. For all the excitement,
audiences and money were hard to come by, and we were always
pinched and often depressed by the size of audiences that were
painfully small given the powerful work on stage. Recognition came
first; audiences only later.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of BAM was that it is in Brooklyn. Brooklyn
allowed a free-wheeling operation. It conferred an outsider status
on BAM, and we took advantage of it. Innovative work was a way to
put BAM on the map, and the work itself was exhilarating. We could
give Merce Cunningham his first major New York season in a large
theater; we could present The Living Theater, Grotowski, Twyla
Tharp, Steve Reich, Eliot Feld and Alvin Ailey and Afro-Asian
Festivals with the Royal Khmer Ballet of Cambodia and the Ritual
Acrobats of Persia. We could house the Chelsea Theater Center for
10 extraordinary years. We were learning as we went along, and it
was glorious. It still is.

MOCEANU SAYS PARENTS SQUANDERED HER MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising serious questions about the protection of young athletes
who make large sums of money, 17-year-old Dominique Moceanu has
filed suit seeking independence from her parents and alleging that
they squandered her earnings from a career as a gold-medal-winning
Olympic gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, who is a high school senior in Houston, has asked a
Texas District Court to declare her an adult so that she can handle
her own affairs and determine what has happened to the
approximately $1 million she has made from a professional career
that began at age 10 and bloomed into gold-medal success as the
American women won the gymnastics team competition at the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and advisers of the teen-ager said in interviews that
her father, Dumitru Moceanu, controlled and pressured his daughter,
appeared to be living his life through her and had no apparent
outside source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is diametrically opposed to what her parents think is good
for them and her,'' said Roy Moore, Moceanu's Houston-based lawyer.
``As much money as she's made since age 10, to have little or
nothing doesn't seem right to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father and his lawyer, Katherine Scardino, said Wednesday
that he had acted with his daughter's approval and best interests
in financial matters, including the opening of a $2 million gym in
north Harris County, Texas, using money borrowed from a bank and
from a trust fund set up in Dominique Moceanu's name.
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said at a news conference in Houston that he
provided his daughter with expensive cars and a huge room of her
own at home and did not dictate her life to her.
</P>
<P>
   He said his daughter became influenced this year by a new coach
from Romania named Luminita Miscenco _ Dumitru and his wife,
Camelia, are Romanian natives _ and said the coach badgered the
family for money, a house and a car.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu has also established a friendship with an
unidentified 32-year-old man, said Scardino, the lawyer who
represents Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu. Scardino suggested that the
root of the lawsuit was money being sought by Dominique's
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in these allegations, it's not her,'' Dumitru
Moceanu said of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that appeared in Wednesday's Houston Chronicle,
which first reported the story, Dominique Moceanu said that she
``never had a childhood,'' that she lived in fear because her
parents often screamed at her and that her father had hit her ``a
couple of times.'' Dominique told the newspaper that she sometimes
thought of her parents, ``Can't you be my mom and dad instead of me
being your business?''
</P>
<P>
   Dumitru Moceanu said Wednesday that he did not remember if he
hit his daughter, but added, ``We never fight together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu left her parents' home on Sunday, filed suit
on Monday and secured a temporary restraining order that requires
her parents to stay away from her, pending a hearing on Nov. 11 on
her request to be declared an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Dominique Moceanu said that she had become concerned
about her financial situation more than a year ago and had left
home for a time to train in the Dallas suburb of Plano with the
former Olympian Kurt Thomas, only to be forcibly returned home by
her father.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Feig, a San Francisco-based agent who represented Moceanu
during and after the 1996 Summer Olympics, said he dropped her as a
client last year because he was ``concerned about what was
happening with her money and where it was being invested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there did not appear to be any other income coming
into the family,'' Feig said. Referring to Dumitru Moceanu, Feig
said: ``He felt he could build an empire off of her and go into
management. It was silly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Feig said, he tried to send a check
directly to Dominique in Plano, but her father drove up from
Houston and ``threw her in the car along with the check.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu ``generally was not a happy camper,'' Feig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jaycie Phelps, a 1996 Olympic teammate of Moceanu's, said that
Moceanu mentioned a couple of times that ``she knew she had a lot
of money coming in and she never saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Colarossi, president of the U.S. gymnastics federation, said
the organization had no program to educate gymnasts on protecting
their finances because the money comes largely from outside
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burg, an agent who represents athletes such as the Olympic
figure-skating champion Tara Lipinski, said that financial
protection was ``the biggest fear I have for every kid athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Moceanu told The Houston Chronicle that she loved her
parents and hoped that they could eventually be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if she tried to get anything out of her
parents except control of her life,'' said Moore, her lawyer. &QL;

YOUNG NASCAR RACED IN ARIZONA  
 1-MILE CIRCUIT AT FAIRGROUNDS HAD 1ST RACE HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He was testing an Indy car on the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Teague, a truly wonderful driver, was at Daytona
International Speedway on Feb. 11, 1959 and something happened.
Something awful.
</P>
<P>
   There was a crash. Then, there was the stirring news.
</P>
<P>
   Teague, only 36, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the best,'' recalled Cotton Owens, a former
NASCAR driver and team owner.
</P>
<P>
   He truly was.
</P>
<P>
   Teague not only twice drove well enough to qualify for the famed
Indianapolis 500, where he finished seventh in 1957 and 18th in
1953, he had the distinct versatility to also race stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   And Teague did that very well.
</P>
<P>
   Although Teague competed in only 23 NASCAR Grand National races
from 1949-52 _ Teague actually finished runner-up to Robert ``Red''
Byron in the first race sanctioned by NASCAR, which was a modified
event held on the beach-road course Feb. 15, 1948 at Daytona Beach,
Fla. _ he was a frequent visitor to victory lane. He won seven
races, five in the 1951 season alone in only 15 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Teague, however, in an apparent dispute with NASCAR founder Bill
France Sr., left the series in 1953 and began racing stock cars in
the American Automobile Association and U.S. Auto Club circuits.
</P>
<P>
   But before Teague waved bye-bye, he became one of its earliest
top drivers, capturing NASCAR's first ever race west of the
Mississippi River on April 8, 1951, the prestigious event at
defunct Carrell Speedway, a half-mile dirt track located in
Gardena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Teague won only the west's second NASCAR race,
this time on a 1-mile dirt track located near 19th Avenue and
McDowell Road in Phoenix, the first of five NASCAR races to be held
in Phoenix (four) and Tucson (one) between 1951-60.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-car circuit didn't return until 1988, when the first
of 10 such races to date have been held at Phoenix International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   But it all began at the Arizona State Fairgrounds, which was
Arizona's first NASCAR Grand National (now called NASCAR Winston
Cup) venture and also was the site of NASCAR's sixth race of the
'51 season and 33rd in the history of the sanctioning body.
</P>
<P>
   Teague made the grueling trip from his home in Daytona Beach,
Fla., and according to one account of the 150-mile race, took the
lead in a 1951 Fabulous Hudson Hornet on Lap 81 from Fonty Flock
and led the remainder of the 150-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty drivers started the race and only 17 finished, according
to ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' recap of the race in the following
morning's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, 2 hours, 21 minutes and 16 seconds later, a
crowd of 12,000 watched Teague cross the finish line almost a
quarter-mile ahead of runner-up Erick Erickson of Hawthorne, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Teague pocketed $1,100.
</P>
<P>
   The Flock brothers, Tim of Atlanta and Fonty of Hopeville, Ga.,
finished third and fourth, followed by Dick Meyer of Porterville,
Calif., and Danny Weinberg of Bell, Calif. &QL; 
Different accounts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty Years of Stock Car Racing,'' a book chronicling every
NASCAR race, and ``The Republic'' and defunct ``Phoenix Gazette''
agree on the race's top six finishers. But throughout the remainder
of the finishing, including some details of the actual race itself,
there are discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Both newspapers list Ed Camrud of Phoenix as finishing seventh,
but the reference book compiled by author Greg Fielden, an author
of several racing histories, lists Walt Sprague of Wellsville,
N.Y., as finishing seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stock Car Racing Encyclopedia,'' which lists every driver
to make at least one NASCAR start, shows Camrud with one career
start in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, who died six months later in a accident at Monroe
County Fairgrounds in Rochester, N.Y., is credited with seven
starts in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Camrud, 71, who raced micro-midgets at Canyon Raceway until his
mid-60s, suffers from Alzheimer's disease and is living in a
Scottsdale nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't married to Ed back in the 1950s,'' said Camrud's
wife, Nancy, who lives in Prescott. ``But he told me he raced in
NASCAR once. He said he raced against Lee Petty and was thrilled to
meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty, whose son, Richard, holds the record for most career
NASCAR wins (200) and is tied with Dale Earnhardt for most driving
titles (seven), indeed drove in the race and finished a paltry 26th
in a Lee Petty Special 1950 Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Fielden's book shows Bill Holland of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
Leland Colvin of Darlington, S.C., Bill Stammer of Pasadena,
Calif., and Fred Steinbroner of Inglewood finishing eighth through
11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' and ``Gazette'' list of eighth through 11th
finishers shows Holland, George Seeger of Los Angeles, Bill Skimmer
of Long Beach and Steinbroner. But that's as far back as the
newspapers show the finishing order.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Forty Years of'' ``Stock Car Racing,'' Seeger
finished 24th. And according to ``The Stock'' ``Car Racing
Encyclopedia,'' there is no Bill Skimmer. But there is a Bill
Stammer.
</P>
<P>
   As for what occurred during the race, Fielden's account depicts
Fonty Flock leading the first 14 laps from a pole position start.
</P>
<P>
   Flock, however, was passed by Teague on Lap 15, who led until
hooking bumpers with Al King of Prescott on Lap 72. According to
``The Republic,'' King's 1949 Ford went through a wooden railing
and flipped onto its hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that crash because it happened right in front of
me,'' said 12th-place finisher Lloyd Dane, a Missouri driver now
living in Concord, N.C. ``That was an old horse racing track and
all they had was wooden rails. One of those splintered rails went
right through windshield and came out the back of the trunk lid. I
didn't think he could still be alive. It was a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no mention of King suffering any injuries,
Teague was so discombobulated, he stopped his car on the racetrack,
climbed out and checked on the driver's condition.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Teague was scurrying to get back inside his
machine. And nine laps later, he caught Fonty Flock and roared on
to victory, posting an average winning speed of 60.153 mph.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Republic's'' account, however, ``The Flock brothers
started off as though they were to make it a runaway. Tim dogged
Fonty by a narrow margin for 54 miles when Fonty took a recess with
a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the Georgians were a good three-quarters of a
mile ahead of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the newspaper recounted Tim Flock taking a commanding
lead, but the driver suffered a flat tire on Lap 92 and was forced
into the pits to make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Flock's misfortune put Teague into the lead, but Erickson
soon challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they battled, each suffering punctured tires.
Teague, however, managed to surge past Erickson on Lap 127 and
built a substantial lead over the final 23 laps.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know exactly which race version is correct,
however, because many of the drivers are now deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson died nearly two decades ago and Fonty Flock died in
1972. Tim Flock died earlier this year of cancer and Meyer was
killed in a 1953 highway crash en route from a race in Detroit to
be with his pregnant wife. &QL; 
There were more &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along with Camrud and King, there were four other Arizonans in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Englishman Dudley Froy, a former flagman at Tucson Speedway,
finished 13th; Bill Flatcher of Phoenix was 15th; Ernie Dietzman of
Phoenix finished 17th; and Frank Oviedo of Phoenix was 18th. King
finished 20th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley was a real entertainer,'' said Phoenix resident Rick
Trimmer, who knew Froy. I was a little kid at the time and he used
to do funny things with his face. Somehow, he'd tuck his ears
inside his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time he stuck a needle through his tongue. It
would freak us all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Oviedo is listed Oviado in the stock-car encyclopedia, but Turf
Paradise horse trainer Phil Oviedo, Frank Oviedo's nephew,
confirmed his uncle competed in the 1951 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew him as Pancho,'' Phil Oviedo said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Auckley, 76, now retired and living in Payson, might
have made it seven Arizonans in the race, but he crashed in a
V8-powered Studebaker during qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming down to take the green flag and the steering
wheel broke,'' Auckley said. ``I did about four end over end flips.
I was mad because I thought I had a hot car that could run with the
Oldsmobiles and Hudsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had a hot engine it, but some guy who fancied himself to be
a race car driver borrowed it the day before the race and was
hot-rodding it around a vacant subdivision. He broke the steering
wheel and I wasn't aware of it when I tried to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rathmann, who switched first names with his brother, Jim,
when they were teenagers, had no trouble qualifying in a 1950 Ford.
But he had a worse time in the race, finishing 28th, two positions
behind Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember too much about that race, but I remember
another time when I knocked the (expletive) out of myself driving a
roadster on that track for A.J. Watson,'' said Rathmann, 74, who
lives in Melbourne, Fla. ``I busted my leg up pretty good. Had a
compound fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That track was real dusty and it had all those wooden guard
rails.'' &QL; 
Switched names &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rathmann, whose real first name is Jim, switched names so
no one would question his brother's age when they were racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gave him my driver's license,'' Dick said. ``I still
call him Jim, but I myself sign everything James.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Thomas of Sanford, N.C., had one of his poorer finishes
that 1951 season, sputtering home 22nd in a Sanford Motors 1950
Plymouth. Thomas, however, wound up winning seen races and won the
NASCAR championship by 146.20 points over runner-up Fonty Flock.
Thomas, selected one of ``NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers'' also won
the 1953 crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hurt racing in (1957) and they didn't know if I was
going to live for several weeks,'' said Thomas, 75. ``I was
paralyzed on my right side for about a year. I didn't race for
about five years. I came back (for one race), but I didn't think I
could do it. So I quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I hadn't got hurt, there's no telling what I could have
(accomplished).'' &QL; 
Never be disputed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What Teague accomplished that memorable April day 47 years ago,
however, will never be disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Marshall was he looked like the most unlikely
race car driver you'd ever seen,'' said friend Hershel McGriff of
Green Valley. McGriff, who at age 71 still competes in NASCAR
Winston West races, first met Teague in 1950 at a Mexican road
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little pot belly, skinny legs and skinny arms,''
McGriff said. ``He looked like the guy watching from the
grandstands. I remember we had a boat together in Florida and I
tried to teach him how to water ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was only a 10 horsepower motor on it and I couldn't
get the boat to go fast enough and Marshall would end up sinking in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good racer, though. And a real family man. He was
very technical with the car. He could build things from scratch. I
remember he wanted to build me a modified to run on the sand at
Daytona because he thought my driving style would fit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we never got around to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague, however, did get around to making a cross-country trip
to Phoenix in 1951, making certain when he left, he was not
forgotten. &QL;

BUILDING MON STER TOOK 50 YEARS  
 GROWING BY THE SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   PHOENIX - NASCAR has been down this road before. Fifty years
now, right?
</P>
<P>
   But in its infancy, when it still was nothing more than
someone's imagination, who would have dared fathom such a monstrous
metamorphosis? Who in the name of Richard Petty could harbor such
dreams of growth and appeal?
</P>
<P>
   Who? Who? Who?
</P>
<P>
   ``Big'' Bill France, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the country needed a national stock-car racing
organization, France on Dec. 14, 1947, gathered a group of friends
in a Daytona Beach, Fla., hotel lounge. When the men emerged
sometime later, they unwrapped a Christmas gift for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing was born and
race fans forever are eternally grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't ever think it would come to this because he
was too busy looking at the trees to see the forest,'' said NASCAR
President Bill France Jr., who replaced his father as head of the
sanctioning body in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   France Sr. may have been looking at trees, but he came strapped
with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may not have been an unwritten rule in the
beginning, NASCAR prides itself in its attempt to make parity a
series byword.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it hasn't always succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Richard Petty was seemingly unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was Dale Earnhardt, who in 1994, tied Petty with a
seventh driving championship.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget someone named Jeff Gordon, who may one day
surpass both Petty and Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NASCAR mostly has remained a competitive series over the
past five decades, which, in turn, also has made it the most
opulent.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the sport inundated with highly-skilled rumrunners,
whose daring exploits hauling moonshine around mountain curves made
them ideal stock-car racers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers now command huge annual salaries, some in the
seven-figure range, and corporate sponsors are likely to write $5
million-$7 million checks just to have their logos plastered on the
car hoods and driving suits of such megastars as Gordon, Earnhardt,
Mark Martin and Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Cha-ching, cha-ching.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, according to The Sponsors Report, television
broadcasts of Winston Cup events generated more than $1 billion in
exposure for the sport's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always considered ourselves a fan friendly sport,'' NASCAR
spokesman Tim Sullivan said. ``And we consider our drivers to be
the most accessible as any athlete out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as long as we stay within the boundaries, keep sight of our
goals and don't overextend ourselves too greatly, we can continue
that double digit growth every year.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's growth is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR-licensed merchandise sales in 1990 were $80 million. It
reached $800 million last year and is expected to be $1 billion by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance also has skyrocketed, up 65 percent to 6.1 million
encompassing 32 races last season.
</P>
<P>
   Network and cable television ratings? Zoom, boom, to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   While NBA network television ratings have risen 8.9 percent
since 1993, Winston Cup races have increased 20.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On cable television, NASCAR's events are up 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hello. Anyone listening?
</P>
<P>
   ``We love our association with NASCAR,'' said David Hall,
president of The Nashville Network, whose company televises nine
Winston Cup races each season.
</P>
<P>
   NBC for the first time next year also will televise a Winston
Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR is the fastest-growing sport in America, and our
affiliates have continued to express deep-seated interest in airing
NASCAR races,'' said Ken Schanzer, president of NBC Sports. ``When
we made our decision not to be involved in football, we looked in
earnest at other properties. And NASCAR was first on our list.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of NBC, NASCAR now has six broadcast outlets,
including ABC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Never one to remain rigid or mum in regards to marketing its
product, NASCAR is constantly scoping different avenues in an
effort to spur continued future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like everybody else,'' France Jr. said. ``We need to be
concerned with growth. We've got some things were working on, but
we're not at liberty to talk about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR already has gotten into children's television with a
syndicated program shown on the Fox network on Saturday mornings.
Driver Kyle Petty is NASCAR's representative.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also is keenly aware of the importance of cyberspace,
where it is working on developing an interactive NASCAR Racing
League via the internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you can buy a NASCAR computer game and set your car
up the way you want,'' France Jr. said. ``But you're racing against
a canned program, against a machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is have two people in different parts of
the country be able to call up a given number, plug their computers
in and race against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's reasoning for catering to the younger set makes
terrific economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we can't get to kids until most of them get their
driver's license,'' France Jr. said. ``The stick and ball sports
have a leg up on us in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we can get this computer idea going, we can get kids to
go racing when they're 7 years old. We can build fans a lot
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, these same kids may be our future sports editors.
Of course, we're talking 20-25 years down the road, but look what
it could do for us as we go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   As prepared as NASCAR might seem as it proceeds forward, not
everyone is pleased with what's occurring during the present.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports Inc. President Bruton Smith, whose company
owns several racetracks, including beautiful facilities such as
Charlotte Motor Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway, believes the
sport is hurting itself by having Gordon and Martin dominate week
after week.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Dura Lube/Kmart 500 on Sunday at Phoenix
International Raceway, Gordon has won 11 races, finished runner-up
six times and rung up an astounding 24 top-five finishes in 30
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has seven wins, five runner-up finishes and 19 top-fives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange every week to see the same thing,'' Smith
said. ``It's either car 24 (Gordon) or car 6 (Martin). You can kind
of bet on that the last 100 miles of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the fans tired of that? I think they are. I think they'd
like to see somebody else out there beating and banging at the
front. I think it's getting a little monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the (grandstands) at Las Vegas (Motor
Speedway) and it took me about 100 miles into the race to figure
out something was wrong here. I saw someone pass someone in the
fourth turn, but they were 30 feet apart. Thirty feet apart? Who
gives a hoot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans want to see some rubbing. They want some competition.
That's what we built racing on, leaning on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Both France and Charlotte Motor Speedway President Humpy Wheeler
believe the NASCAR schedule needs to start leaning toward taking
the series to new markets such as Chicago, Denver and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're a sport in small markets and is in transition to
moving to major markets, which is the complete reverse of the NBA,
which started in big markets and is moving to small markets, our
weakness is we haven't been regarded as a top-10 market sport,
particularly with the advertisers in New York and Chicago,''
Wheeler said. ``So the thrust needs to obviously be in trying to
get this sport in more major markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty of the situation is that we're in about our
fourth or fifth year of a major growth spurt and a sport has to go
10 to 12 years in a strong growth curve to really become well fixed
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure we keep this growth going and to me you
assure this growth by TV ratings, attendance increases, and as much
as anything, increased media intensity. And to get that media
intensity, you need to go to the major markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Wheeler have a major market in the Dallas-Forth Worth
area, site of the $130 million Texas racetrack Smith built two
years ago. The problem for them, which also becomes a problem for
single-race venues such as California Speedway and Phoenix
International Raceway, is with so many cities clamoring for Winston
Cup dates, it appears unlikely NASCAR soon will reward those
promoters with a second race.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, PIR, Texas and California could receive coveted
second race dates if NASCAR were to start slicing second races from
some of its Winston Cup racetracks in the Southeast, where several
facilities lay within about a 100-mile radius of each other. It's
either that or stretch an already seemingly maxed out schedule that
will encompass 34 race weekends in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about Chicago and Denver, and (International
Speedway Corp., which owns PIR and several other racetracks) is
looking at a facility in Kansas City,'' France Jr. said. ``The
Northwest would be nice if it didn't rain so much. We probably have
room for a couple more races, but we don't want to put too much
food on the table that you're going to choke. We have to be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   And being careful means carefully choosing new venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for whatever reason we had to make out our 2000 schedule
today, (PIR, Texas and the California racetracks) wouldn't be on
it,'' France said recently. ``But who knows what will happen when
we have to make out the schedule next year. I'm not going to
speculate at what changes might happen. But as of today, that's our
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that's NASCAR's only problem, what a nice predicament to
be in, don't you think? &QL;

SPRAGUE, HORNADAY TUSSLE ON RACE TRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Neither Hollywood nor Don King could script a better
ending.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is Jack Sprague. In the opposite corner is Ron
Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprague might as well be Muhammad Ali. And Hornaday might as
well be Joe Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   When last seen six months ago at Phoenix International Raceway,
Sprague and Hornaday were engaged in postrace mental fisticuffs,
each one accusing the other of intentional low blows during a
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race.
</P>
<P>
   There was no declared winner off the racetrack. But on it,
Hornaday delivered several knockout punches that Sprague insists
relegated him to a runner-up finish and put Hornaday in victory
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knocked me out of the way (with his truck),'' Sprague said.
``Ron's a fierce competitor and I feel I am, too. We both want to
win this championship. And when you have two guys wanting the same
thing, you're going to have some kind of troubles along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we won't have any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   With only two remaining races this season, including Saturday's
GM Goodwrench Service Plus/AC Delco 300 at PIR, Sprague is clinging
to a teeny-weeny 28-point lead over Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   And should Sprague manage to fend off Hornaday, it would be a
second straight Truck Series crown.
</P>
<P>
   Should Hornaday overtake Sprague, however, he would add a second
title to the one he won in 1996, when Sprague finished runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been back and forth pretty much all year long,'' Sprague
said. ``I couldn't even predict which way it's going to go. But I'm
pretty sure it's going to come down to the last race (next month at
Las Vegas Motor Speedway).''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Hornaday, just as long as there's no more
on-track skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we left Phoenix (in April), we ran into a few more
problems where we wrecked each other,'' Hornaday said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those wrecks occured three months later at Indianapolis
Raceway Park, a crash that sent Hornaday into the fence and Sprague
into victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   While Hornaday's truck was undergoing repairs on pit road, he
angrily confronted Dennis Connor, Sprague's chief mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after reaching the winner's circle, Sprague was peppered
with boos from much of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Phoenix, I thought it was just good close racing,''
Hornaday said. ``I guess whoever comes out on top always thinks
that way. But it takes two to tango and he (Sprague) was just as
much at fault as I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is one of us drives for (Rick) Hendrick and one
drives for (Dale) Earnhardt. That's two good teams that race real
close to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say Jack's a good friend of mine, but on the
racetrack, I think he's one of the fiercest competitors out there.
If I start rubbing him hard, he's going to rub me hard. I guess
it's just two hard-headed drivers wanting to win the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, Sprague agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we all even (in bumping incidents)? I don't know if we
were ever even or uneven,'' Sprague said. ``He's got his viewpoints
on things and I do, too. Sometimes, they're not always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is it's not the Jack Sprague series or the Ron
Hornaday series. It's the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. We're both
doing everything we can to win this thing. That's about all there
is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sprague is correct and there are no on-track pinball antics
involving the two drivers and their trucks, Sprague's past record
at PIR makes him a viable candidate to replace Hornaday in the
winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague has nabbed three pole positions and three wins in seven
starts at PIR. Sprague hasn't finished worse than third over the
past five races. &QL;

SW TOUR'S PORTENGA BACK IN HIS ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Steve Portenga will know better the next time he tries
conquering the NASCAR world.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, after winning the NASCAR Southwest Tour
championship over runner-up Bryan Germone, Portenga packed his bags
and went NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Bad move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bit big time,'' said Portenga, who lives in Oakdale,
Calif. ``Looking back, I should have waited another year or two
before I tried moving up in class. We weren't as prepared as I
thought we were. I thought we could take the same small budget we
had in the Southwest Tour series and apply it to the trucks. But
you can't. There's a lot of cubic bucks wars out there. We couldn't
compete on that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we went from the top team in a series to where we were low
on the totem pole. It humbled us pretty good. It shows who you are
and who you're not going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Portenga wasn't going to be was a top Truck Series
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Portenga weathered the fallout for two years, then returned last
season to familiar Southwest Tour territory, where he won three
races in 19 starts and finished fifth in the driver's standings.
</P>
<P>
   And now with two remaining races _ Friday's Checker Auto Parts
300k at Phoenix International Raceway and a Nov. 7 race at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway _ Portenga also is back in another familiar
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Portenga is back atop the driver's standings. Portenga, 28,
holds a 37-point lead over M.K. Kanke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things work out the way I hope they work out, we want to go
to Phoenix and Las Vegas with a nice cushion,'' said Portenga,
whose best career finish at PIR is seventh, which he recorded last
February at the Copper World Classic. ``I really don't want to go
to those races having to win to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see a lot of drivers at those racetracks that
we don't normally see at our races and it means a lot of tough
competition. I hope we can approach those races with a mindset of
just having to finish well in order to win the title.''
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if Portenga adds a second Southwest Tour trophy
to his resume? Will there be another leap of faith up the NASCAR
ladder?
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson,'' said Portenga, who has two wins and 10
top-10 finishes in 13 starts this season. ``We're definitely going
to try and do the Truck Series and some (NASCAR) Winston West races
next year, but only on a part-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to try and go full-time again in trucks some time
down the road, but we won't do it until we're ready. It's going to
be a slow transition. I'll do the Southwest Tour series again next
year for sure, then we'll think about doing trucks full-time (in
the year 2000).
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is we'll know this time when it's time to make
the move.'' &QL;

   WYE MILLS, Md. _ As Middle East peace talks dragged late into
the night of the seventh day on Wednesday, the Israeli side
threatened to walk out and go home, demanding changes in a draft
agreement on security approved by both the Palestinians and the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven days, the Americans, Israelis and
Palestinians have been working to produce a final, agreed text of
some 20 pages that lays out the phased exchange of 13 percent of
West Bank land over 12 weeks in return for specific Palestinian
actions to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting late on Wednesday afternoon with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to go over an American document spelling
out the terms of an agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel issued a a statement saying that there ``can be no
agreement'' unless ``substantial progess'' was made on two issues _
a commitment by the Palestine National Council to publicly change
its charter and renounce its call for the destruction of the state
of Israel and a deal to extradite Palestinians wanted for allegedly
attacking Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said that the Palestine national charter has been
stripped of its clauses demanding the destruction of Israel, but
Israelis complain the amended charter has never been published.
Arafat has offered to have an amended charter approved by the
smaller Palestine Executive Council of the National Council, but
the Israelis insist that the whole National Council meet for a
public vote within three months.
</P>
<P>
   On extradition _ which the Israelis call ``transfer'' in order
not to prematurely recognize the Palestinian Authority as a legal
state _ Netanyahu wants some 36 individuals handed over to Israel
for trial. Israel charges them with involvement in attacks against
Israelis, and at least some of them serve in the Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans believe they have worked out a satisfactory
compromise. Under this plan, the CIA, which sits on a security
committee with Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs, will vet
the Israeli cases and decide which Palestinians should be jailed
and tried, but in Palestinian courts. The Israelis apparently find
this compromise unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also say they want firm Palestinian commitments to
reduce the number of Palestinian police to numbers laid out in the
Oslo accords and to confiscate unregistered, illegal weapons. The
Americans believe those issues are also essentially settled.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement is also supposed to include the immediate
resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final peace settlement
_ which is supposed to be complete by May 4, 1999, when the Oslo
process that governs the relations between Israel and the
Palestinians runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Even while Albright and Netanyahu were meeting late on Wednesday
afternoon, Israeli officials were busily and visibly bringing
packed suitcases out on to the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said the Israeli drama was crude and
that Albright was ``bemused'' by the display. But it was a dramatic
example of the brinksmanship American officials expected during the
end game of these tortuous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My betting is that will turn out to be a childish ploy,'' the
official said. ``I wouldn't think their private posture is quite as
stark as their public posture.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials made it clear that in their view the
Palestinians had done enough to keep these talks going, and that
the Americans would put the onus for any failure on the Israelis.

ROBBINS KNEW WAY AROUND TRACK  
 COUNTRY STAR MORE THAN HELD OWN BEHIND WHEEL

<P>
   PHOENIX - Marty Robbins could belt out a teary ballad about as
well as Picasso could paint.
</P>
<P>
   The late country-western singer, who died Dec. 8, 1982 at age 57
after suffering a heart attack six days earlier at his Nashville,
Tenn., home, often would return home after a long day of rehearsing
and still have enough voice left in him to deliver a private
concert to his wife, Marizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my fondest recollections of Marty,'' Marizona
said. ``He'd come into the bedroom with his guitar and start
singing until I got drowsy. He sang beautiful songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins sang beautifully and drove a stock car almost as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although country music and NASCAR have been an intertwining act
throughout most of the stock-car circuit's 50-year history, no one
bridged the gap more than Marty Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   While such country music stars as Patsy Cline, Tex Ritter and
Brenda Lee often entertained before NASCAR events in the late
1950s, much like current entertainers such as Martina McBride,
Lorrie Morgan, Alabama, and Brooks and Dunn do today, it was
Robbins who did both.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, born Martin David Robinson on Sept. 26, 1925 in
Glendale, not only was talented enough to reach the top of the
country and pop music charts 18 times during a 30-year singing
career, he had the ability to qualify for 35 NASCAR Winston Cup
races between 1966 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robbins never reached victory lane, he was no pushover
on the racetrack. Robbins had a career-high fifth-place finish in
1974 at Michigan Speedway, finished seventh at Darlington (S.C.)
Raceway in 1971 and eighth at defunct Ontario (Calif.) Speedway in
1972. Robbins finished with six top-10 finishes and $49,701 in
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of Marty Robbins as a country western
singer,'' said Buddy Baker, selected by a panel of experts one of
NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers. ``I thought of him as a driver. I'm
telling you, he had talent. If he had gone into (full-time) racing
and not sang, he would have been one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Robbins became a fairly decent driver in a limited
career and generally is regarded as Arizona's greatest contribution
to the NASCAR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, however, apparently never began displaying strong
interests in singing or racing until serving a four-year stint in
the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to play the guitar and he taught himself to play it
when he was in the service,'' said 49-year-old son Ronny Robbins, a
Nashville music publisher. ``He learned how to sing Hawaiian songs
and somebody asked him to fill in one night on the guitar. He wound
up getting the guy's job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robbins was honorably discharged from the service, he
returned to Glendale and worked as a ditch digger and tombstone
carver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he used to drive an ice truck, but he was only
about 130 pounds and decided early on that he didn't like that,''
Ronny said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins soon met Marizona, who also attended Glendale High
School, and they were married two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty would sneak off at night and go sing at night clubs, but
he had to change his name so his mother wouldn't find about it,''
said Marizona, 68, who lives in Brentwood, Tenn. ``I remember he
was Jack Robinson for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Robbins began attending auto races in the
Valley and the late Jimmy Bryan became one of his heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember going to Manzanita Speedway and seeing Hank
Arnold race,'' Ronny said. ``Dad used to take me to the (Arizona
State Fairgrounds) and I think that's where we saw (Bryan).''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins moved his family to Nashville in 1953 and it wasn't long
before he became a fixture at Nashville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started racing micro-midgets in 1959, then got into stock
cars,'' Ronny said. ``Preacher Hamilton, who was Bobby Hamilton's
grandfather, built his first stock car. It was a 1934 Ford Coupe
and he called it the `Devil Woman' car.''
</P>
<P>
   But a desire to seek greater challenges soon led Robbins to the
Winston Cup circuit, then still known as NASCAR Grand National.
Legendary Bobby Allison built one of Robbins' first competitive
stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty wanted to get a better car pretty badly,'' Allison said.
``I was building cars at the time, so he offered me a late-model
sportsman car, a trailer, a pick-up truck, a Black Angus bull and a
Lincoln Continental with a lizard skin roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounded like a pretty even trade to me, so we put the
deal together.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins drove the No. 42 Dodge in the National 500 at Charlotte
(N.C.) Motor Speedway in 1968, starting 32nd and finishing 12th in
a 45-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins never made more than five starts in any one season and,
thus, never posed a serious threat to the championship. But when
Robbins did make appearances, they often were memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was one of the finest men you ever wanted to be with,''
said Winston Cup car owner Junie Donlavey. ``I remember one time we
were at College Station, Texas, for a race and we were staying at a
Holiday Inn. That evening we wandered down to the pool and Marty
gave us a private concert that was out of this world. He must have
sang until 2 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   One infamous on-track incident occurred in 1972 at Talladega
(Ala.) Superspeedway. As the story goes, Robbins rigged the
carburetor so that he could race much faster than he had qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just playing around,'' said Cotton Owens, a former
Robbins mechanic. ``Marty really loved racing, but he always felt
guilty about taking money from somebody who was trying to make a
living at racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have finished fourth at that Michigan race, but he
let a guy pass him on the last lap. That's the kind of guy he
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronny Robbins said his father's reasoning for tinkering with the
carburetor was an effort to challenge the great Richard Petty,
NASCAR's all-time leader in wins with 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to be able to get up next to Richard and wave
to him,'' Ronny said. ``After the race, he told the NASCAR people
what he had done. He was just having some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Robbins' races were fun and games. Ronny Robbins
remembers three hard crashes involving his father in successive
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was running sixth at Talladega one year in the (1970s) and
Ramo Stott blew an engine,'' Ronny said. ``Daddy hit his oil and
got sideways. (James) Hylton T-boned him and rung daddy's bell
pretty good. He retired for about a year after that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Marizona, whose name is derived from Maricopa and Arizona, said
her late husband retired several times during his driving career.
</P>
<P>
   ``And every time he'd talk himself back into racing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because racing relaxed him so much,'' Ronny said.
``I think if he had done it for a living, it might not have been as
much fun for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' final race occurred a month before he died, at Atlanta
Motor Speedway, where he qualified 33rd and finished 36th after
falling victim to a blown engine on Lap 89 of the 328-lap race.
Robbins, who had surrendered his familiar No. 42 three years
earlier to Kyle Petty, drove a car formerly owned by the famed
Junior Johnson, ``Sports'' ``Illustrated's'' pick as the greatest
driver in NASCAR history.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a driver, he was better than 80 or 90 percent of the guys
out there,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one knew the Atlanta race would be his final
NASCAR appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty called me about 5 o'clock that night and he said called
just to see how he was doing,'' Owens recalled. ``Undoubtedly, he
had some kind of feeling something wasn't right because he was on
his way to the hospital six hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins had undergone what Marizona said was the country's first
triple bypass heart surgery in 1970. Robbins suffered another heart
attack on New Year's Day in 1981 and a final one nearly two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we took him to the hospital, he had a quadruple bypass
surgery,'' Marizona said. ``But he never regained consciousness and
died six days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty's first love was always music. But I think if he hadn't
been a great musician, he would have loved to have taken racing
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is he never wanted to take any chances out there
because he didn't want to be responsible for somebody getting hurt.
He tried to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins was careful all right. He also was good. &QL;

TNN WORKS RACING TO HILT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an ear-piercing, teeth-rattling and
so-noisy-that-you-can't-hear-what-the-guy-next-to-you-is-saying
song. One person's loony tunes is another's symphony.
</P>
<P>
   For David Hall, the president of The Nashville Network,
beautiful music comes from more places than the stage of the Grand
Ole Opry or a midtown honky-tonk. He led the movement to bring the
network to the forefront of auto racing coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly knew back in 1990 when we made the decision to go
into NASCAR racing that there was a direct correlation between
country music fans and racing fans,`` Hall said. ``The rest is
history.''
</P>
<P>
   TNN will broadcast Sunday's Dura Lube-Kmart 500 from Phoenix
International Raceway. It will have a half-hour show prior to the
race, which begins at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The network has televised racing since its debut it 1983, and
the response was overwhelming from the outset, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the American Cavalcade of Sports, which was racing and
some wacky types of racing,'' Hall said. ``It did well for us
through the years. And then as our access and resources got bigger
and bigger, we took the big leap in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response, ratings and advertisers have been positive since
Day One. Motorsports has been a positive part of TNN over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 49, began as an engineer, but it didn't take him long to
bolt to the top.
</P>
<P>
   His bullish attitude, as reflected in the way he handled the
transition into more sports coverage by TNN, has proved to be one
of his strongest allies.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990, Hall was the senior vice president and general
manager at TNN, and he knew that a full-fledged move onto the auto
racing scene would prove nothing but beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading the charge. I was the man with the sword going
after it,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Network, which negotiates rights deals with
individual tracks, televises about 100 racing events a year,
including nine NASCAR races.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether TNN should be thought of as one of the
leaders in televised racing, he took it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be recognized as the leader in motorsports,'' Hall
said. ``I think we've been a big part of the success of auto
racing. We brought a new audience and commitment to motorsports
that nobody else had at that time, or has today.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR and Busch racing are our big events. We don't have
football, baseball or soccer. We put a lot of effort and energy
into auto racing. That's the top of the sports heap for us. I see
nothing ahead that will reduce our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   TNN still retains its strong roots to music and entertainment,
and Monday through Friday programming usually revolves around that.
But Hall is not one to be content with today's success.
</P>
<P>
   One of the staple TV sports of another era is returning. TNN
will begin televising the roller derby on Jan. 15. Hall looks at
the new venture with the same enthusiasm that he tackled the auto
racing challenge, calling it ``the sport of the next millenium.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who has won numerous industry, environmental and public
service awards, has an engineering degree from Vanderbilt. He was
the chief engineer of the Opryland Theme Park and oversaw
construction of the new Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   He became president of TNN, the eighth-largest cable network in
America, in September 1997. He also serves as president of the
Country Music Network. &QL;

LEGIONS OF WINGS, LITTLE UPLIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(af) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let go, give in, and take the journey.'' That slogan, a fatuous
a new-age variation of the '60s ``turn on, tune in, drop out,'' is
the motto of Eddie Murphy's character, a bald-headed prophet who
goes simply by the initial G. in the movie ``Holy Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken, ever-smiling G. (is it short for God, Gabriel,
Gump, Godawful?) appears one day on a Miami freeway to help two
harried executives from the Good Buy Shopping Network fix a flat
tire.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say abracadabra, G. has ascended as the star and
savior of the financially ailing network. Instead of hawking the
products in front of him, G. delivers anti-materialistic
stop-and-smell-the-roses raps that magically sell all the junk the
network has piled up in its warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Man'' is the latest and arguably the shoddiest recent
Hollywood movie to exploit mass culture's rampant ``Touched by an
Angel'' syndrome, in which a heavenly figure intervenes in earthly
matters to provide a comforting glimpse of spiritual enlightenment
and sometimes also to solve characters' romantic problems.
Especially when that enlightenment involves true love, things on
the screen can get awfully sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, ``City of Angels,'' the slick
picture-postcard remake of Wim Wenders' surreal fantasy ``Wings of
Desire,'' presented Nicolas Cage as an angel who falls so in love
with Meg Ryan, playing a nice lady doctor, that he forfeits eternal
life to taste the pleasures of sex, surf and California cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the two stars have no chemistry or that Cage's
demeanor is closer to that of a serial killer than a suitor. The
movie insists that they are made for each other, and if heavens
have declared it, it must be so.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra are dampening
the screen with their tear-drenched afterlife reunion in ``What
Dreams May Come,'' a bombastic, trippy swatch of love-beyond-death
kitsch in which Williams, a kindly pediatrician who dies in a car
accident, travels from heaven to hell to rescue his wife who
committed suicide. There's no particular chemistry here either to
support the film's insistence that these two are soul mates in the
most cosmic sense.
</P>
<P>
   Coming right up is ``Meet Joe Black,'' a lavish, similarly
secularized three-hour remake of the 1934 Frederic March movie
``Death Takes a Holiday.'' In a film that almost feels like a
sequel to ``City of Angels,'' Death (Brad Pitt) decides to take a
break from his grim duties to assume human form and pal around with
a media mogul named Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins).
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Bill's playing earthly tour guide, Death
promises to extend his life at least beyond his 65th birthday bash.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say shazam, Pitt's earthly embodiment, who goes
by the name Joe Black, has fallen in love with Susan (Claire
Forlani), the younger of the mogul's two daughters, who also
happens to be a nice lady doctor. Like Cage's angel, Pitt's
character ecstatically savors food (he's hooked on peanut butter)
and sex for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the story is devoted to corporate skulduggery that
this extremely somber movie feels more like a millennial elegy to
big business than a supernatural love story.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget the recently released ``Still Breathing,'' in
which Brendan Fraser is a hunky San Antonio street performer who
melts the hardened heart of Joanna Going's Los Angeles fine arts
consultant. How do we know they're made for each other? Fraser's
latter-day hippie, like all the men in his family, has romantic
second sight. Long before he meets the woman fate intended for him,
he has seen her face in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   On the kiddie front, there is ``Simon Birch,'' John Irving's
novel ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' reduced to a saccharine parable
of an adorable disabled child who anticipates a heroic deed that
will define his reason for being. That event will also cost him his
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the year's phoniest movie death scene, Simon slips away from
this world, sweetly murmuring, ``Gotta go now.'' For the holidays,
there's ``Jack Frost,'' whose title character (Michael Keaton) is a
musician who dies in a car accident but returns to earth as a
snowman built by his young son.
</P>
<P>
   What's disturbing about these films isn't their stories. Who
doesn't enjoy a good supernatural yarn with a misty-eyed twist?
It's their grandiose air of sanctity that cloys. They are bloated
reflections of a narcissistic age obsessed with eternal youth. If
love is decreed by magic, you don't have to work at it. All you
have to do is gaze into your partner's eyes and ``know.'' If
spiritual insight arrives from on high, you don't have to waste
precious time in prayer, meditation and study.
</P>
<P>
   If you're determined to invest occult fantasies with a deeper
spiritual meaning, what better symbol is there than an angel, a
manifestation of divinity that isn't readily attached to a
particular dogma? Most of these movies come with overbearing
quasi-symphonic soundtracks that press emotional buttons that their
sappy screenplays and misty-eyed performances can't reach.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are at the millennium. Our material abundance has
fueled our lust for more and better and faster gratification.
Instant ecstasy. And what often passes for faith is a bloodthirsty
fundamentalism. So why not retreat to fairyland where Peter Pan,
the fairy godmother or Santa are custom designing million-to-one
shot miracles just for you?

<P>
   Cashing in on strong passenger traffic, low fuel prices, and a
strike at Northwest Airlines, three of the country's largest
airlines reported record third-quarter earnings Wednesday, while a
fourth _ Trans World Airlines _ posted a surprising loss.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly strong results seemed to ignore recent investor
worries that a weakening economy would result in a decline in air
travel. But executives at several of the carriers also expressed
concerns about the future and said they were considering scaling
back their planned growth next year, when the number of new airline
seats is expected to rise faster than economic growth for the first
time since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is singing the blues at the domestic carriers,'' said
Kevin Murphy, who follows the airline industry at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter in New York, ``but everybody is cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at American Airlines and US Airways, the second- and
sixth-largest carriers in the country, easily surpassed the
expectations of Wall Street, while earnings at United Airlines, the
nation's largest, were slightly weaker than expected because of its
large exposure in Asia. The three carriers' figures were in line
with strong results reported in the last week by Delta Air Lines
and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of the country's major airlines, the only
disappointments have been at Northwest, which suffered a
worse-than-expected loss from the pilots' strike last month, and
TWA, which has been struggling to regain its equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Most airline stocks declined Wednesday. United's parent company,
UAL, was down $3.4375 to $62.9375; AMR, parent of American, closed
at $57.875, down 6.25 cents; US Airways fell $1 to $54.8125; and
TWA was down 87.5 cents, closing at $4.5625.
</P>
<P>
   AMR said its net income grew 34 percent in the quarter to $433
million, or $2.49 a diluted share, compared with $323 million, or
$1.78 a share, in the similar period last year. Wall Street had
expected $2.32 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenue grew 7.2 percent, to $5 billion, compared
with $4.7 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, said the quarter
was the best in the company's history, and the sixth consecutive
record. He added that the Northwest strike and another at Air
Canada increased AMR revenue by $50 million in the quarter, $16
million of which was offset by the cancellation of about 1,000
American flights as the result of Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   From July to September, AMR bought back $500 million worth of
its stock, and the company's board recently authorized another $500
million buyback.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways reported net income for the quarter of $142 million,
or $1.51 a diluted share, compared with $187 million, or $1.82 a
share last year. But on an operating basis, its earnings grew 20
percent to $140 million, or $1.49 a share, from $117 million, or
$1.14 a share. Analysts polled by First Call had estimated $1.43 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $2.2 billion from $2.12 billion last
year as the carrier said its planes were filled to record levels in
each of the quarter's three months.

<P>
   UAL said earnings rose 3.4 percent to $516 million, or $3.71 a
diluted share, compared with $499 million, or $3.75 a share in the
period last year. Revenue rose 3 percent, to $4.78 billion, from
$4.64 billion. Analysts had expected $4.07 a share.
</P>
<P>
   United said it gained $75 million in revenue from the strike at
Northwest, more than any other airline. But the gains were largely
offset by weak sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which provides
nearly 20 percent of its total revenue. The carrier was
particularly hard hit by a rise in the value of the Japanese yen
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer certain of profitability for the Pacific for
the full year,'' James Goodwin, UAL's president and chief operating
officer, told reporters. But he hastened to add that barring any
major changes in the industry or the economy, United was on track
to surpass last year's record earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that companies are cutting travel budgets,
American, United and US Airways said that advance bookings are
strong.
</P>
<P>
   After many years of growing more slowly than the industry as a
whole, American is planning to take delivery of 49 new Boeing jets
next year, increasing its total number of seats by 6 percent. But
Arpey said the company was studying whether to reduce that growth
rate by one-third by retiring some of its older DC-10 and 727 jets
earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at United and US Airways also said they were
considering lowering their growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has more serious problems. The airline, the country's eighth
largest, had an operating loss in the quarter of $923,000, or 11
cents a share, compared with a profit of $13.3 million, or 17
cents, last year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by
First Call was 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue fell 5 percent, to $863.2 million, from $908.4 million
as TWA's efforts to attract lucrative business passengers failed to
make up for an overall passenger decline.
</P>
<P>
   The airline announced a fare sale on Tuesday to win back
budget-minded leisure passengers, and Wednesday it announced the
purchase of five Boeing jets. But the poor quarter was a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If TWA can't make profit in a quarter when traffic is strong,
fuel is cheap and they got 14 cents a share from the strike at
Northwest,'' said Brian Harris, the airline analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney, ``we wonder when they can make a profit.''

<P>
   Rubbermaid Inc., despite its well-known brand name and product
lines, is finally calling it quits as an independent company. On
Wednesday it announced that it would merge with Newell Co. in a
stock swap valued at about $5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company, which will be called Newell Rubbermaid, will
probably have sales of about $6 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   For Newell, the merger means instant access to the instant
consumer cachet attached to the Rubbermaid name. And it also means
entree for its products, which include brands such as Levolor
blinds, Mirro and Wearever cookware and Anchor Hocking glassware,
into some new sales channels, such as supermarkets or Amway
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubbermaid and Newell are a terrific strategic fit,'' said
John McDonough, Newell's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For Rubbermaid, it will mean one final chance to translate some
of its brand equity into profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubbermaid has excellent product-development skills but has
had trouble bringing that to the bottom line,'' said Eric Bosshard,
an analyst with Midwest Research-Maxus Group.
</P>
<P>
   It is an inauspicious ending for a 78-year-old company that,
until early this decade, was growing at 15 percent a year. It got a
particularly strong boost in 1980 when it hired its first
non-home-grown chief executive, Stanley Gault, a marketing whiz who
had cut his teeth at General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Gault sold extraneous businesses like auto accessories and
turned the remaining businesses into veritable new-product machines
that by 1991 were introducing new products or line extensions at
the rate of one a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the company remained a high-cost producer. And when mass
merchandisers like Wal-Mart began pressuring it to lower its
wholesale prices, its margins eroded quickly. When resin prices
soared in 1995, it simply could not absorb all the excess cost. It
had to raise its own prices, leaving the field wide open for
competitors like Sterilite and Tucker Housewares.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a tax-free exchange of shares, Newell will swap 0.7883
share for every Rubbermaid share, valuing each Rubbermaid share at
$34.09, almost a 50 percent premium over Tuesday's price.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders clearly believe Rubbermaid is getting the best of
the deal. After the merger was announced, investors bid
Rubbermaid's shares up by $6.125, to $32. But they registered a
resounding note of disappointment in Newell, driving its shares
down by $5.8125, to $43.25.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that Newell's stockholders simply fear
that Rubbermaid is too large a mouthful for Newell, which has grown
primarily through buying up tiny companies, to swallow and digest.
But others say they fear Newell is biting into poisoned fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Rubbermaid has taken charges for
reorganization that have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars.
The price of resin, its main raw material, has plummeted. And yet
its earnings have been flat at best, and its stock price has come
nowhere near its 1991 high of $38.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most grossly mismanaged companies in the
industry,'' said Andrew Shore, an analyst with Paine Webber. ``Its
service to retailers is horrendous; it does not know how to respond
to competition, and the jury's still out on whether even Newell can
turn it around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wolfgang Schmitt, Rubbermaid's chief executive, readily concedes
that the company's shareholders have had a right to be
disappointed. But he notes that the company has tried mightily to
get back a taste of its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, it modernized its plants, made
friends with formerly antagonistic unions, courted disaffected
retailers, cut prices and came out with a slew of new products.
</P>
<P>
   But very little of the reorganization filtered down to the
product line or up into the stock price. One reason, Schmitt said,
is that Rubbermaid's suppliers and main retail customers have been
consolidating.
</P>
<P>
   This means that Rubbermaid is caught between the proverbial rock
and hard place _ it is increasingly buying its materials and
components from megacompanies that can keep their prices high, yet
it is selling its products to megastores that can force it to keep
its prices low.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Schmitt concedes that Newell might be better primed
to operate in that kind of environment. ``We're known for
innovation, but Newell is known for execution,'' he said. ``They
are good at servicing customers with on-time shipments and with
keeping costs down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Newell will be calling the management shots. The merged
board will include nine people from the current Newell board and
six from Rubbermaid's board. Newell's chairman, William Sovey, will
be the chairman of the new company and McDonough will be chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schmitt will stay on as a vice chairman of the new
company, his main job is to help integrate the two companies.
Because Rubbermaid will undoubtedly be ``Newellized'' _ a term used
by Newell and Wall Street for the company's habit of quickly
bringing acquired companies up to speed on its customer service and
production methods _ Schmitt's input may in fact be minimal. And
what he will do a year or so down the road remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is unlikely to result in many job cuts. Although both
companies make consumer products, there is little overlap of
product lines and thus little production redundancy. There will be
some cuts at headquarters, but the numbers are already pretty low _
the combined headquarters staff amounts to only about 120 people.
And some may not want to move.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Newell is based in Freeport, Ill., and Rubbermaid is in
Wooster, Ohio; Schmitt said the merged company would be moved to a
new site.

REFUGEE FROM AN AFFLUENT WASTELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Oct. 25) 
(af) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parents of the Upper West Side, beware. ``This Is Our
Youth'' is back.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't see the play's original production in 1996,
here is a synopsis: three young slackers, blessed with money,
education and vocabulary, spend 24 hours lounging in a bleak West
Side apartment, trafficking in cocaine, casual sex and enough
confused philosophical banter to shame any college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the playwright, Kenneth Lonergan, almost every
bit of it is true. ``It's essentially the life lived by my friends
and me on the Upper West Side in the 1980s,'' Lonergan said
recently. ``I remember sitting in those rooms, stoned out of our
minds, with our parents' money behind us and kind of levitating our
way through life.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark comedy was popular with young theatergoers in its first
incarnation, an audience that its producers are hoping to attract
with an eight-week run of the latest production, now in previews at
Second Stage and opening on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost two years since the play, directed then as
now by Mark Brokaw, received very favorable reviews for a brief
production by the New Group at the Intar Theater on Theater Row.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called it ``an
eloquently inarticulate take on the slacker generation'' that
``deserves a longer life''; John Simon, in New York magazine, said
the play and production ``come together in a perfect, gemlike
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   But though the movie rights were quickly sold, the rest was
misery. The Broadway producers Barry and Fran Weissler bought the
theatrical rights but could not find a larger available theater.
Plans for a run in the spring of 1997 were delayed to the fall, and
then to the spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The play's plight became the target of jokes. ``If they'd had to
wait any longer for a theater,'' said Variety, ``they'd have had to
change the title to `This Is Our Middle Age.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The delay cost the cast one original member, Josh Hamilton, who
dropped out because of a scheduling conflict. He played the cynical
22-year-old in whose apartment the action takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did occur that at some point the actors would get too old
for this,'' Lonergan said wryly. Now that ``This Is Our Youth'' is
onstage again, the Weisslers are hoping to transfer it commercially
after the run at the nonprofit Second Stage.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the author seems hesitant to celebrate. ``I'm
really thrilled,'' Lonergan said, in typical deadpan, peering from
heavy-framed glasses. ``I don't wear my heart on my sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his characters, Lonergan, at 36, still seems awkward
talking about himself. He tends to speak in something between a
mumble and a sigh and is quick to make fun of anything he says that
might sound profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Our Youth'' is set in 1982, in the early years of the
Reagan administration, a time when Lonergan was two years out of
high school and ``taking a break'' from college. ``I remember that
period as incredibly dangerous and perilous,'' he said. ``The
left-wing team had suffered a defeat and the Zeitgeist was going in
the other direction and there was this generation of well-educated,
caring kids going around saying, `What's the point?' I found that
incredibly depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused: ``I feel I should have an enormous pipe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the play is Warren Straub (played by Mark
Ruffalo), a hyper 20-year-old dropout who has just stolen $15,000
from his divorced father after a squabble. He takes shelter in the
apartment of Dennis Ziegler (Mark Rosenthal), a former ``dark cult
god of high school'' just beginning to size up his personal
limitations, and is visited there by Jessica Goldman (Missy Yager),
a 20-year-old would-be fashion designer already jaded by romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of rich kids that are ashamed of being
rich, the kind with a liberal, basket-weaving upbringing and Native
American artifacts on the shelves,'' Lonergan said. ``They are much
more developed than people think, and also half-developed at the
same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elliott, the artistic director of the New Group, decided
to put on the play, he said, because ``I thought the voice was
fresh and accurate, and I thought it would appeal to a younger
group of people.'' Elliott, who was 34 when he presented ``This Is
Our Youth,'' added: ``Many young people today are disaffected. They
have been bombarded by the media, by television, by computers, so
they're not bothered by anything anymore. They're numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan's characters also struck a chord with Carole Rothman,
the artistic director of Second Stage, when Brokaw, a resident
director at the theater, brought her the script last spring. ``This
is a play about kids that have a safety net and what happens when
it frays,'' said Ms. Rothman, who has two children and lives on the
Upper West Side. ``For anybody who has children, it couldn't be
closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither could the theater, which is on Broadway near 76th
Street. Lonergan has taken the cast on a tour through the
neighborhood, pointing out where the events that inspired him took
place.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Greenwich Village now, with his girlfriend, the
actress J. Smith-Cameron, whom he met while he was staging a
one-act there. ``She was slumming,'' Lonergan said with a grin. But
he still hangs out at times with his high school crowd in the area
that inspired the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was tossing away some golden years,'' he said. ``But
I hope I've taken a sympathetic view of it, because I'm in there,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan was born in the Bronx, the younger of two boys, shortly
before his family moved to Central Park West. His father, a doctor,
and mother, a psychiatrist, divorced when he was 5. ``It was the
best thing that ever happened,'' he said. ``They've both remarried
and are happy. I'm very lucky. I'm the product of both a broken and
a stable home.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, he entered the Walden School, a private high school on
Central Park West that subsequently merged with another
institution. Known as an innovator in progressive education, it was
home to a wide variety of talented, if eccentric, students.
</P>
<P>
   There, Lonergan said, all of the experiences that made their way
into the play occurred. ``The only thing I made up was stealing
that much money,'' he said. ``I never took more than $20.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1980, he spent a year at Wesleyan University
before realizing _ like Warren in the play _ that he did not want
to be in college. Unlike his character, however, Lonergan found a
calling: the theater. He landed a job working as a doorman for the
Shubert Organization (``I smoked a lot of pot'') and began taking
playwriting classes with Herbert Berghof at the HB Studio in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that his predilection for damaged people began. ``I
wrote a lot of plays with mentally ill characters,'' he said.
``Just that idea of difficult people hurting themselves and you.
I've always found that intensely interesting, as well as the idea
of taking care of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his early plays was ``The Rennings Children,'' about a
mentally ill brother and the sister who tries to obtain his release
from an asylum. While the plot may have been fabricated _ Lonergan
says he doesn't know anyone ``really crazy'' _ the play
foreshadowed the emotional terrain of ``This Is Our Youth,'' where
parents are reduced to offstage voices with limited influence.
</P>
<P>
   The award he won for ``The Rennings Children,'' in the first
Young Playwrights Festival in 1982, along with his parents'
encouragement, persuaded Lonergan to go back to school, this time
to the New York University drama writing program.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1985, he staged several one-act plays with
the Naked Angels troupe. That work drew the attention of agents and
ultimately led to the screenwriting that has supported him for
eight years. A film of his first script, for a comedy entitled
``Analyze This,'' will probably be released next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is also writing a script for a forthcoming ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' movie (``They do not sit around the apartment and
smoke pot'') and the screenplay for ``This Is Our Youth,'' which he
also plans to direct.
</P>
<P>
   He had finished the stage script in 1995. ``It was one of the
few plays I wanted to do after reading the first act,'' said
Brokaw, the director. ``They're people I hadn't seen onstage
before.''

<P>
   Three of the country's largest airlines reported record
third-quarter earnings from strong passenger traffic, the low cost
of fuel and a strike at Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at American Airlines and US Airways surpassed the
expectations of Wall Street analysts, while earnings at United
Airlines were slightly weaker than expected. Trans World Airlines,
however, posted a surprising loss.
</P>
<P>
   THREE OIL COMPANIES REPORT LOSSES
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texaco, the third-largest oil company, fell $2.75, or
4.48 percent, to $58.625, after it announced that earnings dropped
58 percent. Exxon, the nation's biggest oil company, said its
profits declined 23 percent, and Amoco, the fifth-largest, reported
its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, a reflection of the slump in
oil prices that began a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   WALL STREET CONTINUES ITS RALLY
</P>
<P>
   A strong earnings report from Microsoft fueled a rally on the
Nasdaq stock market, which climbed 2.17 percent, or 35.56 points,
to 1,674.75. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 13.38
points, to 8,519.23, and the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index rose 5.98 points, to 1,069.92.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL GRAPPLES WITH CASH SQUEEZE
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis in Sao Paulo, the industrial nerve center of
Brazil, has caused companies to consider paying workers the
mandated extra month's pay in products, not cash.

<P>
   JUDGE TO RULE NOV. 4 IN AMP SUIT
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge said he would settle the main legal dispute in
Allied Signal's $9.7 billion takeover bid for AMP Inc. on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICANS FORGET THE OIL EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after an oil embargo proved that fuel supplies
were neither reliable nor endlessly cheap, the United States has
relinquished most gains made in conserving energy. Americans have
returned to consuming nearly as much energy as ever.
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL SURPRISES IN FEDERAL BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   New details of surprises hidden in the $500 billion federal
budget deal emerged as the Senate passed the bill and President
Clinton signed it into law. These included $750,000 for grasshopper
research in Alaska, $250,000 for a lettuce geneticist in Salinas,
Calif., and $1.1 million for manure handling and disposal in
Starkville, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   CITIGROUP DISAPPOINTED WITH PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Weill, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup,
admitted that he was disappointed with the 65 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings. The decline was attributed to trading
losses in global markets that offset strength in the financial
services giant's domestic consumer businesses. Citigroup was
created by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers, completed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   POLLUTION PENALTY EXPECTED
</P>
<P>

profits at Eli Lilly in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION FELL 2.5 PERCENT

 WYE MILLS, Md.: the Israelis.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Netanyahu called the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations and asked them for support and ``political
cover'' with American Jews and the Clinton White House if he had to
leave, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Any rupture of the talks would cause a serious dispute between
Washington and Jerusalem just a few weeks before President Clinton
faces mid-term elections in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In public, State Department spokesman James Rubin urged
Netanyahu and his delegation not to leave, saying that it would be
``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a sufficient basis on which to proceed,''
Rubin said, including on security issues, ``to bring peace and
security to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us feel we are at a crucial period and we want
to advance the cause of peace, and we can't do it alone,'' Rubin
said, all but blaming Netanyahu for causing this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One knowledgable official said that ``the Americans believe that
in each of the key elements that constitute a systemic approach to
fighting terrorism, the Palestinians have provided serious and
effective responses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans ``have the bulk of what is needed on the security
front,'' the official added. ``They are asking whether the Israelis
want an agreement or an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli threat had been brewing all day, as it became clear
that Netanyahu still had difficulties with a security package,
worked out over weeks between Palestinians and the Americans. But
what was not clear, even to American officials, was whether the
Israeli difficulties were the two issues _ the charter and
extradition _ stated over and over again by Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi always has his eye on his domestic constituency and the
state of his coalition,'' one official said. ``He's either trying
to prove he's getting the best deal possible, or he's decided that
the deal on offer will break his government apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for their part, were following their usual
strategy of siding with the Americans whenever possible. Ahmad
Tibi, a senior adviser to Arafat, said that the Palestinian leader
had telephoned Netanyahu to urge him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are satisfied with the Palestinian working
plan,'' Tibi said. ``We are very sorry that we are hearing that the
Israelis are once again raising new demands. But after we heard
that the American administration is satisfied with the Palestinian
working plan, after the long discussions over weeks, any new demand
will not be accepted, and we believe these new demands are a
pretext to bring the negotiations to failure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Israeli ambassador to the United
Nations, Dore Gold, said the Palestinian ``work plan'' on security
``simply isn't detailed enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without security the peace process won't work,'' Gold said.
``We did our end of the bargain. We came through with a territorial
package for redeployment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gold and Israeli officials said that Netanyahu, having made
such a major political issue out of a public charter change by the
Palestinians and getting justice for Israelis killed by terrorism,
needed firm assurances on these two points.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, was unusually blunt on
Wednesday afternoon. ``It's simple and sad,'' he said, ``because we
came here to reach an agreement, and we applaud the effort of the
Americans. But we find that the Palestinians are not willing to
fulfill their obligations, old and new, and there is a
deterioration in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He went through the Israeli difficulties, then said: ``There are
36 terrorists, and we have all kinds of versions of the arrest of
these people. But we see unwillingness of the Palestinians to go
along with these matters. We are ready to release some prisoners
they want, including some who raped children. But what kind of
entity is the Palestinian Authority that wants rapists and
murderers on their territory?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, American officials described their work on the
text, which is a revision of the long-standing American proposal
for this interim accord, as ``a grand bargain'' designed to get
over the last difficult obstacles of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The text,'' Rubin said on Wednesday, ``is designed to get the
peace process back on track. Despite the intensity of the work, it
is not at all clear that the tough choices needed to reach peace
can or will be made. It's an open question.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after another late night of negotiating with Netanyahu
and Arafat, decided he would wait for a briefing from Albright
before returning here. But the call for him to return never came on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already devoted nearly 57 hours of his time to the
search for a settlement here. Jordan's King Hussein also did not
come to the talks on Wednesday morning, which was spent in
telephone calls, with no formal meetings.

<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It is a congressional race that is so tightly
competitive that it has lured to the Ohio Valley a cavalcade of
prominent politicians from throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stumping on behalf of the Democratic candidate have been Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, former Gov. Ann Richards of
Texas and Rep. Maxine Waters of California, head of the
Congressional Black Caucus. Campaigning with the Republican
candidate have been former senator and presidential candidate Bob
Dole, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma and Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   What has attracted these politicians is a high-energy campaign
in which Steve Chabot, a conservative Republican incumbent, is
facing a formidable challenge by Roxanne Qualls, a moderate
Democrat and popular mayor of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Ohio's 1st Congressional District, with its mix of
Cincinnati neighborhoods, suburbs and manufacturing industries, is
one of a handful in which Democrats believe they have a chance to
unseat a Republican. As the divergent political ideologies of their
out-of-town supporters suggest, it is also a race whose candidates
offer starkly different political views.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats enlisted Ms. Qualls, 45, largely on the strength of
her showing in Cincinnati's council elections, in which the highest
vote-getter is named mayor. She became mayor in 1993 and was
re-elected last year with 12 percent more votes than the
second-place finisher.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot, also 45, is a former Cincinnati councilman who was sent
to Washington in the 1994 election that swept a wave of new
Republicans into Congress. By defeating Rep. David Mann, Chabot
ended nearly 18 years of Democratic dominance in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot opposes abortion and favors vouchers to allow public
school students to attend private schools. His opposition to the
federal budget agreement is passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, both sides are making a wrong decision,'' Chabot
told about 70 voters at a forum recently in Springfield Township,
in suburban Cincinnati. ``I believe you have to have tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabot grew up on Cincinnati's quiet, middle-class west side. In
the city's Westwood section, a highly Catholic area where residents
use ``parish'' and ``neighborhood'' interchangeably, Chabot lives a
few doors down from his mother's home and a few blocks from the
Roman Catholic church where he married his high school sweetheart
25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot portrays his opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal. ``She
has opposed property tax cuts for the city of Cincinnati,'' he
said. ``And she has opposed getting rid of a whole layer of
bureaucracy at City Hall. And she favored the transportation bill
in Congress, which was a pork-filled product if there ever was
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Qualls is single and lives a few blocks off Martin Luther
King Drive, one of a few white residents in the city's
predominantly black, working-class Avondale section. The former
owner of a home remodeling company, she entered politics after
working as executive director of Cincinnati Citizens Action, an
environmental and consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Qualls supports the right of women to have abortions,
strenuously opposes school vouchers as ``skimming promising
students out of public schools without dealing with the problems of
the public schools,'' and praises the federal budget agreement as
``the kind of bipartisan compromise that comes with governing.''
</P>
<P>
   She tells voters that Chabot is so rigidly conservative that he
often votes against programs that would benefit the district. ``He
stands there talking about the value of education, but he has a
record of voting against Head Start, and voting against college
loans,'' Ms. Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been little polling since a survey
commissioned by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
early this year showed the race to be a dead heat, several local
political experts say the race remains extremely tight.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati, where Ms. Qualls has received large margins in
council races, accounts for about half the congressional district's
population. And Ms. Qualls is likely to win most of the black vote,
which makes up about 30 percent of the district. But the district
is part of Ohio's conservative heartland, where Chabot is likely to
hold more sway.
</P>
<P>
   Chabot has not won by huge margins. Two years ago, he was
re-elected by a margin of 11 percent in a race with a far less
well-known opponent. In that campaign, labor unions spent heavily
on television advertisements against him.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the unions are running television advertisements
attacking Chabot for opposing using the entire budget surplus to
shore up Social Security. And they are also backing efforts to get
voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates contend that turnout will be critical.

OPPOSING IMPEACHMENT LAWYERS OPEN FIRE

 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House on Wednesday accused congressional
Republicans of rigging an unfair impeachment proceeding, and
Republicans fired back that Democrats were merely trying to exploit
a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual recriminations came as Republican and Democratic
lawyers squared off in an often contentious first meeting to begin
defining the contours of impeachment hearings. Republicans also
signaled their intentions to announce a witness list in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting on Capitol Hill, one of President Clinton's
lawyers accused the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee of
rebuffing Democratic efforts to wrap up the inquiry quickly by
leaving its scope open-ended and refusing to define what an
impeachable offense is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not yet convinced that this tribunal is operating by a
fair, even-handed, impartial set of rules,'' Gregory Craig, a
special White House counsel, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But a top Republican committee aide, Paul McNulty, marched to
the microphones to rebut Craig's accusations, and to underscore
that Republicans had adopted Watergate-style procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point the president's defenders have got to get away
from this partisan attack on process and fairness,'' McNulty said.
``That's the strategy: attack the process and make it look like
we're not working productively so the American people lose
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democrats acknowledge, that is their strategy, and so
far it has worked. Public opinion polls show that most Americans
believe that the Republican-led inquiry is sharply biased against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's tone, more combative before the cameras than in the
private meeting, lawyers for both sides said, aimed both to
establish bargaining markers for the White House as well as to help
the Democratic voter base get fired up two weeks before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats were willing Wednesday to let the White House
play the bad cop role.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional Democratic aide put it this way: ``We're just
laying back and letting the impression that this process is unfair
set in. We're also being careful not to overplay our hand. We need
to maintain good relations with Republicans in case there's an
opportunity to make a deal after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters Wednesday, Speaker Newt Gingrich
accused Democrats of playing a ``deliberate calculated political
game,'' adding, ``I think they were going to scream partisanship no
matter what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Many House members have said that the verbal attacks will soften
after the elections when the need for both parties to rally their
partisans is over. Democrats have voiced concern that their
complaints could wear thin with the public if they are seen as
trying to prolong the impeachment proceedings as a political
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting Wednesday marked the first effort by
committee staff members and White House lawyers to set the ground
rules and procedures since the House approved the formal inquiry
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Committee lawyers met with Charles Ruff, the White House
counsel, David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, and Craig. No
lawmakers attended. Much was discussed, but little was agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's witness list is sure to be contentious.
Republican aides are examining who might be subpoenaed and who
might be granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want to call the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, and Monica Lewinsky. Some Republicans want to summon Bruce
Lindsey, deputy White House counsel and one of Clinton's closest
aides. Committee staff say a list could be announced in the next
two weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides defended the committee's procedures, saying
Clinton's lawyers have the same rights and procedures that the
Democrats afforded Richard M. Nixon's attorneys in the 1974
Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers will be able to question witnesses in
hearings, but it is not clear whether they would be allowed to even
sit in on depositions. That decision may be up to Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the panel's chairman, whom White House lawyers will try to
meet with in the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained Wednesday that the inquiry's scope was
open-ended. David Schippers, the committee's chief investigative
counsel has expanded Starr's original 11 possible impeachment
counts to 15. But Hyde has now narrowed those to three basic
categories: lying under oath, witness tampering and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Hyde has said the inquiry will likely focus on
the Lewinsky scandal, he is not ruling out other information that
could lead to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought Wednesday to have impeachable offenses defined,
but were rebuffed. A Judiciary Committee panel postponed a hearing
this week on that topic, probably until early next month. But
Democrats say the standards for impeachable offenses should be set
before the inquiry proceeds.

<P>
   VICTORIA, Texas _ While city and county officials planned
emergency measures early Wednesday morning, Janie Robles, 48, ran a
garden hose through a pair of muddy cowboy boots fished out of her
flooded home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, by the time I got dressed and washed up it was already
out to here,'' said Robles, pointing a dripping boot toward her
porch. ``I had to get out with no shoes on and get in my car as
fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many in her west Victoria neighborhood, Robles refused to
believe the water flowing over the banks of the Guadalupe River
Tuesday would reach her home. Robles and her neighbors barely
escaped with little more than a change of clothing before
floodwaters inundated their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday they returned to salvage whatever was spared by
the worst flood in Victoria in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 850 homes were evacuated beginning Sunday from
historic townsite neighborhoods and in the outlying county where
the Guadalupe skirts the western edge of Victoria, about 125
southwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Though water had receded by as much as two feet Wednesday
morning, most homes remained as much as 10 feet under water. The
Guadalupe Basin River Authority estimated that the river crested at
33.84 feet at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. City survey crews reported the
river reached 34.26 feet later in the afternoon, eclipsing the
record 31.3 foot level by three feet.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Mayor Gary Middleton said officials will not know the
extent of the flood's toll for two or three days, but estimated the
damage will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Victoria
County was among 20 counties listed by Gov. George W. Bush for
federal disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   City officials lifted a 7 p.m. citywide curfew, but imposed a
24-hour curfew in the flooded area and within 500 feet of it,
banning residents from returning to their flooded homes until
damage can be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of residents like Robles managed to retrieve some
of their belongings before the new curfew was put into effect at 11
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need people going back into their homes that don't
need to go,'' Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria County Judge Helen Walker said rescue efforts continued
throughout Wednesday for the 25 to 30 people still believed to be
in homes in the flooded area. She said those residents were asked
to drape white sheets over their roofs if they needed help getting
out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the river is expected to recede slowly, she said those
residents who chose to wait out the flood may have ``bought
themselves into their homes for five to seven days.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the river was not expected to rise unless significant
amounts of rain fell in the area or upriver. Until then, she said
city and county officials will continue rescue operations if
needed. She said damage assessment will start once water levels
drop to a safe level for crews to examine the flooded area.
</P>
<P>
   She said the main concern is keeping health and public safety
problems from occurring as residents become anxious to return to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost anybody, yet,'' she said. ``We don't want to
lose anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hewlett, 51, was more fortunate than some, even though his
home received more than a foot of water, ruining furniture and a
new carpet he had recently installed. Hewlett's home was just at
the edge of the flood area in one of Victoria's historic
neighborhoods north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Water had receded from his home, and he spent most of the day
Wednesday removing items left untouched by the water. He also had
not expected the water to rise as far as it had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our lawn chairs out here (in the front lawn) and sat
out here drinking coffee and watched the water as it came up and up
and up,'' he said. ``It was coming real quick that was the scary
thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett and his wife left their home early Tuesday and spent the
night with friends. Though he estimated his personal loss at about
$15,000, Hewlett took the situation in stride Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to get ourselves together and get on with
things,'' he said. ``We'll just tighten up the belt and have a
leaner Christmas this year.'' &QL;

   LICHTENSTEIN-BAM (New York) _ Before I start examining their
edges and undersides, let me lay my cards on the table. Harvey
Lichtenstein _ who turns 70 next spring and who recently announced
his retirement after 31 years as head of the Brooklyn Academy of
Music _ has been the most innovative and influential performing
arts administrator New York has known. This is not a game, so
there's no point in ticking off the not-so-long list of his recent
competitors, icons like Joe Papp, Ellen Stewart and Morton Baum.
But Papp, for one, is better known to the general public than
Lichtenstein. So it's worth trying to explain why Lichtenstein has
been so important not just to the cultural life of New York, but to
the country and the world. By John Rockwell. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   AMERICA'S-MOVIES-IMAGE (Undated) _ Nearly 160 years ago, Alexis
De Tocqueville observed that Americans lacked an appreciation for
what he called the ``pleasures of mind.'' Instead, he wrote, they
``prefer books which may be easily procured, quickly read, and
which require no learned researches to be understood. They ask for
beauties self-proffered and easily enjoyed.'' Those words remain, a
pretty good description of the impulses that drive American popular
culture, what one might call a constant quest for ever greater
sensationalism. But the characteristics Tocqueville ascribed to our
books, poetry and theater are now no longer confined to amusements;
they have leached into almost every aspect of American life. Any
putative Tocqueville looking at America today would see a whole
Republic of Entertainment in which strong and rapid emotions,
startling passages and rousing truths pervade journalism, politics,
education, religion, art and even crime. Ours seems to be a world
molded in the image of the movies and intended for our viewing
pleasure. By Neal Gabler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HEAVENLY-FILMS (Undated) _ What's disturbing about the latest
heavenly help type films isn't their stories. Who doesn't enjoy a
good supernatural yarn with a misty-eyed twist? It's their
grandiose air of sanctity that cloys. They are bloated reflections
of a narcissistic age obsessed with eternal youth. If love is
decreed by magic, you don't have to work at it. All you have to do
is gaze into your partner's eyes and ``know.'' If spiritual insight
arrives from on high, you don't have to waste precious time in
prayer, meditation and study. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   NIKOLAIS-LOUIS-DANCE (New York) _ For Murray Louis, landmark
events are not only the most obviously important occurences. The
Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance Company will celebrate a 50th
anniversary, for instance, in a weeklong season that opens on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Louis and Alwin Nikolais, who died in
1993, taught at the Henry Street Settlement House and performed in
its theater from 1948 until 1970. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET-THEATER (Undated) _ In its early days,
publicists for American Ballet Theater frequently called it ``a
museum of the dance.'' That remains a good phrase to describe the
company, provided one realizes that great museums can encourage new
art as well as preserve old. Ever since its debut in 1940, Ballet
Theater has done both. It has staged the classics, often in
elaborate productions. It has commissioned major world premieres.
Kevin McKenzie, the troupe's current artistic director, is
continuing these policies. the current season will give New Yorkers
their first look at John Neumeier's ``Spring and Fall,'' a work to
Dvorak from the repertory of Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, and new
creations by Twyla Tharp, Nacho Duato and John Selya, one of Ballet
Theater's own dancers. By Jack Anderson. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews Tracy Letts'
violent, satiric and often dangerously funny family comedy,
``Killer Joe,'' at the SoHo Playhouse Off Broadway in New York.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OLD-SETTLER-THEATER (Undated) _ It is 1943 in Harlem, with Ella
Fitzgerald crooning, newly arrived Southerners gawking and
housekeepers calling to Jesus in storefront churches and
lindy-hopping until dawn at the Savoy Ballroom. The playwright John
Henry Redwood recreates those heady days in ``The Old Settler,'' a
bittersweet comedy in previews Off Broadway at Primary Stages,
where it opens on Wednesday. It is the story of Elizabeth Borny, a
lonely, middle-aged domestic who rents a room in her apartment to a
naive young Southerner and falls in love with him, despite the
disapproval of her sister, Quilly, who knows better. By Rachel L.
Swarns. (Moved). Photo.

   LICHTENSTEIN-BAM-MEMOIRS (Undated) _ Harvey Lichtenstein, who is
retiring on June 30, recalls his tenure at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music as its director. By Harvey Lichtenstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OUR-YOUTH-THEATER (New York) _ According to the playwright,
Kenneth Lonergan, almost every bit of ``This Is Our Youth'' is
true. ``It's essentially the life lived by my friends and me on the
Upper West Side in the 1980s,'' Lonergan said recently. ``I
remember sitting in those rooms, stoned out of our minds, with our
parents' money behind us and kind of levitating our way through
life.'' The dark comedy was popular with young theatergoers in its
first incarnation in 1996, an audience that its producers are
hoping to attract with an eight-week run of the latest production,
now in previews at Second Stage and opening on Nov. 3. By Jesse
McKinley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ST.-LUKE-ORCHESTRA (New York) _ The Orchestra of St. Luke's was
born as an outgrowth of the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, whose 21
players still form its core. A chamber style of performance is
first nature. In addition to its own concerts, it works for hire in
a variety of settings. Even the name has become a red herring,
since the many locations in which the organization performs rarely
include the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, in Greenwich Village,
where it gave its first chamber concerts, in 1974. This season the
organization is trying to address the world's befuddlement and
bring its image into sharper focus through the odd expedient of
attaching itself to another name: Haydn. The chamber ensemble plays
the composer's Symphonies Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (``Morning,'' ``Noon''
and ``Night''), conductorless, Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art and on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall. By
James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MOZART-OPERAS (Undated) _ Good help is hard to find these days,
snobs say, as if it were news. The complaint has been circulating
the globe since the race first cooked up the division of labor.
Like parent and child or mate and mate, master and servant make up
one of the handful of stock pairs in the theater of human
destinies. In the drama of all places and periods, their dance of
dominance and deference has been a constant. Two who observed its
intricacies with the sharpest eyes were Mozart and da Ponte, the
creators of ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' (1786), which will be given a
new production on Thursday evening at the Metropolitan Opera; ``Don
Giovanni'' (1787), and ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' (1790). By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BARTOK-STRAVINSKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ I never could share his
lifelong gusto for his native folklore,'' said Igor Stravinsky of
Bela Bartok in 1959. And what is more, ``I couldn't help regretting
it in the great musician.'' Stravinsky was seeking distance from a
composer with whom, he felt, he was too often compared. On
Wednesday and Friday evenings, the Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff,
the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival
Orchestra bring their countryman and the latter's unwilling Russian
counterpart back together at Carnegie Hall, setting Bartok's three
piano concertos in what the performers evidently consider their
proper Stravinskian context. It's about time. By Richard Taruskin.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   TRIP-HOP-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Massive Attack came on the
British dance-music scene in 1991 with its debut album, ``Blue
Lines,'' the group's bass-heavy beats and brooding spirit of
introspection became the onic blueprint for trip-hop. A
studio-concocted blend of hip-hop, ambient techno and reggae that
set the tone for fellow Bristol artists like Portishead and Tricky,
trip-hop seemed ideally suited to our globally aware, culturally
fragmented times. By Guy Garcia. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   GIBBONS-ART (London) _ There could hardly be a more English
artist-craftsman than Grinling Gibbons. Master Carver to the Crown,
he invented a decorative style that dominated interiors in England
during the late 17th century. His name is imbedded in the
consciousness of the nation. Windsor Castle, Hampton Court Palace,
the grand country houses like Badminton, Burghley and Petworth and,
of course, St. Paul's Cathedral all abound with his baroque
cascades of fruit, flowers and foliage. By June Ducas. (Moved).

<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL-LIBRARIES-ARCH (Undated) _ Some weeks ago an
article appeared in this newspaper in which various people were
asked to comment on how presidential libraries should deal with
embarrassing episodes in an administration's record. As I recall,
no one suggested that the embarrassing episode should be the major
focus of such institutions. But maybe that's the way to go. By
Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH-SHOW-TV (Undated) _ Apparently the actual mechanisms of
mind and body are far more complicated than we were led then to
believe. Evidence of which is to be found on this fall's newly
revamped ``Oprah'' show. Now in its 13th national season, the show
has, like its host, undergone yet another makeover. A
psychospiritual Reformation really, in which any attempt to
entertain has been abandoned in favor of a search for Truth,
Wellness and Reduced-Fat Snacks That Still Satisfy. By Jeff
MacGregor. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   PLASTICS-ANTIQUES (Katonah, N.Y.) _ Remember the so-called
throwaway plastic culture of the '60s? Well, no one threw it away,
and 30 years later, pristine artifacts from that period are already
turning up in exhibitions. The 160 objects on view in ``Pop Goes
the Plastic: The Visual and Cultural Esthetic of a New Technology
1960-1975'' at the Katonah Museum of Art document the revolution in
industrial design fostered by the coming of age of plastics. By
Paula Deitz. (Moved).

ECONOMIC SCENE: TIMID JAPANESE BANK BAILOUT JUST MIGHT DO THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The law that the Japanese Parliament recently passed to rescue
broken-down banks commits several blunders. It does not require
insolvent banks to close. It does not require banks to disclose
losses. It does not require wobbly banks that accept taxpayer money
to lend to creditworthy borrowers _ the primary purpose of a
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious prediction is that Japan will remain credit-starved,
dragging down other economies in Asia and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But the prediction may be wrong. The law takes the important
step of injecting public money into failing banks. Despite its
flaws, the measure might pry open clogged credit lines and channel
money to companies in need of a fresh start. As Adam Posen of the
Institute for International Economics, author of a new book on the
Japanese economy, says, ``The bill will succeed despite itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's banks are buried in bad loans and confront an economy
that has slipped into recession. Thus they are loath to lend even
to reliable customers. But if banks do not lend, companies cannot
invest, and the economy cannot grow.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has been worsened by an accounting system that allows
banks to mask losses. Fanciful financial reports have scared away
investors and creditors. Worse, the phantom bookkeeping pretends
that borrowers can repay impossibly large loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs its banks to wipe bad loans from their books so
borrowers can start afresh. To that end, the law creates three pots
of public money totaling about $500 billion, more than 10 percent
of Japan's annual output. The United States' savings and loan
bailout in the 1980s cost about 2 percent or 3 percent of output.
</P>
<P>
   The first pot, about $150 billion, will pay off depositors at
banks that close. Their assets will be transferred to a government
agency for resale to private investors, much the way Resolution
Trust Corp. worked in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The second pot, also around $150 billion, will be used to
nationalize insolvent banks that the government decides to keep
open. The government will run these banks until private owners take
over, mirroring the way the Roosevelt administration handled the
1930s banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The third, most controversial pot has no U.S. parallel. It will
pump about $200 billion into private banks that the government
deems shaky but solvent. In return, the government will get stock.
The idea is that the taxpayer money will build up the banks'
capital so they can resume lending.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Tarullo, formerly President Clinton's top adviser on
international economic policy, is not convinced the plan will work.
``There is no clear mechanism for moving the $500 billion out the
door of government and into banks,'' he says. ``Banks have to ask
for assistance. But by asking for assistance, the bank managers
identify themselves as incompetent, invoke intrusive government
monitoring and put their jobs in jeopardy. That is hardly an
incentive to play along.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics ask why the government should bail out supposedly
solvent banks. Besides, nothing in the law forces banks that take
public money to write down loans to feasible levels. Tarullo points
out that the ruling party has a history of letting banks serving
agriculture and construction _ its core supporters _ do as they
want.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is vague, critics point out, relying on
bureaucrats to fill in the blanks. That might have worked well when
the finance and other ministries were all-powerful. But now they
are largely discredited, and the ability of the bureaucrats to
discipline private markets is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is that insolvent banks, operating under the cover of
a bogus accounting system and a compliant government, will limp
along, draining resources from productive parts of the economy.
Tarullo paints a picture of continued drift.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, Posen says, Japan's recent past is not prologue. Yes,
the parliament should have forced banks that take public money to
write down old loans and use the cash to issue new loans. But, he
says, there are good reasons to believe all this will happen
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the discipline of international capital markets,
which have largely shut off Japan's banks, will force banks to take
the government bailout. On Wednesday, three major Japanese banks
were reported to be preparing applications.
</P>
<P>
   Posen also predicts that these banks will be forced by public
pressure and new political forces to pass along cash to worthy
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that the law was not written according to Japanese
custom by bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry but was drafted, at
the request of cabinet officials, by a younger generation of
Parliament leaders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have been clamoring for the Japanese to clean up
their bank mess _ no matter how. The bailout passed by the
Parliament will waste lots of taxpayer money. It will not dispense
justice. It will not by itself turn the Japanese economy around _
fiscal measures will also be needed.
</P>
<P>
   But by throwing serious money into locked credit lines, the law
does take an essential step toward ending Japan's immediate crisis.
For now, that might be all the world needs.

AGENTS SEE A SECOND LEAGUE AS POSSIBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
 LEAGUE-NYT   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fed up with unfruitful negotiations with owners and fearing a
work stoppage that could last into 1999, agents for National
Basketball Association players are looking into creating their own
league.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion came during a meeting of the agents advisory
council in Las Vegas Wednesday, where more than 20 player agents
and 11 NBA players gathered for nearly four hours. Billy Hunter,
the union's executive director, also announced that it planned to
organize exhibition games until the lockout is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union president, will lead a meeting Thursday
that will be open to all players at Caesar's Palace. From
superstars like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Karl Malone to
the journeymen Marty Conlon and Muggsy Bogues, about 200 players
are expected to attend as the union tries to show a united front
during the lockout by the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents predicted Wednesday that there would be a dispute
among the players over whether the players should decertify the
union and risk a prolonged court battle with the NBA. Although
decertification came up in the meeting, neither the players nor the
owners gave it much credence at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall tenor was that everybody's on the same page,''
said Keith Glass, the New Jersey-based agent. ``We're behind the
union. If there was a clear sentiment, it's that no one wants to
accept the deal the owners are offering and we'll stick together
until we get what we think is a fair deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came two days after the union lost a ruling on its
guaranteed contracts before John Feerick, the arbitrator who
determined that the owners need not pay any players during the
lockout. The decision affects 226 players with guaranteed
contracts, which together total nearly $800 million in value.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ruling, the agents discussed alternative sources
of income for players who may struggle financially. Aside from a
$25 million licensing fee from the league, the union reports only
$10 million in assets. Hence, the idea behind the exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to announce to the players that we're going to be in a
position to provide financial support to those ballplayers who need
it,'' Hunter said. ``We intend to, with the assistance of many of
the agents, put on games. So as long as the lockout continues, we
intend to put on some games to help raise funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had explored the possibility over the summer, but ran
into many obstacles, including scheduling and player commitment.
Tim Duncan and David Robinson and other NBA players are supposed to
take part in the first unofficial exhibition game Friday in
Houston, with proceeds going to players who need help financially.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the games would be played in NBA cities
or elsewhere, or who would participate. The league has approved
players' earning a living outside the NBA until the lockout is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they're doing so entirely at their own risk,'' said
Jeff Mishkin, the league's chief legal counsel. ``If they injured
themselves and were not able to play basketball, they're at risk of
having their contracts terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   But one league official doubted that the union could stage
exhibition games at all. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, asserted that the players had tried repeatedly to
establish a schedule of exhibition games but had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The union and the agents, however, are looking at an even more
ambitious idea, the formation of a new league. A four- or
five-person committee has scheduled a meeting for this morning to
discuss economic alternatives for the players, said Marc Fleisher,
an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the very early stages,'' he said, ``but we're ready to
start talking to potential owners, broadcasters, investors, anybody
out there that might make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of an alternative to the NBA for this season is
remote, but several player agents did not discount the potential
for next season. The idea was contingent on the league canceling
the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, there was serious discussion about the
possibility that the whole season could be lost,'' said Steve
Kauffman, an agent. ``I don't think many of us believed that
before. But with the way the owners have been behaving, it's now
something we have to discuss and prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   According to two agents, David Falk, the agent for Jordan and
several other superstars, said he would approach Jordan to see
whether he would be interested in such a venture as a new league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Michael is involved, I'd bet it would work,'' one agent
said.

KANELL IN GOOD SPIRITS FOLLOWING SURGERY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Danny Kanell jogged gingerly along the
sideline of the practice field Wednesday morning, but after 50
yards, he stopped and put his left hand to the right side of his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore,'' the Giants' quarterback said with a
smile. ``But I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was in good spirits hours after getting the news from
team doctors that the lump removed from his chest Monday was
benign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pulled out a pretty good sized slab of something,'' said
Kanell, who added that he would practice next week and play against
the Washington Redskins on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said: ``It took about 30 minutes to take it out. I was
awake, lying there talking to the doctor about his kids and
football while he was in there sawing away. He was using some kind
of laser. He kept tugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said the lump of tissue removed was larger than he had
expected it to be. He said he believed it was going to be about the
size of a grape.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, using his fingers to demonstrate, Kanell formed a
mass about the size of a playing card.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's like an iceberg: you only feel the tip, but
there's more underneath,'' Kanell said. ``It's not that uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said he was never very worried that the mass, which he
first noticed in training camp this summer, was going to pose a
serious health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to wait until after the season was over,'' he said.
``Everything they told me indicated they were pretty sure it wasn't
something to be too concerned about. But the doctors said they
wanted to be sure and that it would be better to get it out. But if
we didn't have a bye week, and I might have had to miss a game, I
probably wouldn't have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the team announced Monday that the lump was on Kanell's
left side, Kanell said it was just under his right nipple. The
right-handed Kanell said, however, that the lump never affected his
throwing this season.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he did not think that the impending surgery ever
weighed on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that worried,'' he said. ``I think other people
around me were more worried than I was. I did have to go through
ultrasound and a mammogram. I have a new appreciation for women who
have to go through that. It is the kind of thing that opens your
eyes to what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell kept the surgery a secret from most of his teammates,
many of whom learned about it from news reports Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have been coming up to me saying: `You're OK, right?'''
Kanell said. ``I've been telling everyone that I'm fine all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Corey Widmer said, ``It's very scary because
you're basically a yes or no answer away from changing your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel said the three practices Kanell would miss this
week would not have much effect on his preparation for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have limited his throwing and practice this
week even if he didn't have anything done,'' Fassel said. ``It's a
good week to rest and freshen up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought waiting for the surgery influenced
Kanell performance on the field, Fassel said, ``I can't discount
that _ that it was on his mind a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a jocular Kanell seemed well on his way to putting
the event behind him. ``I may still be sore, but I'm getting my
rest,'' he said. ``After the operation, I took the painkillers the
doctor gave me and I slept the whole day. That was relaxing.''

DEBERG PUTS DOWN CLIPBOARD FOR HUDDLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y _ When Steve DeBerg's voice came over the
conference call, before a question was even asked the 44-year-old
quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons quipped: ``I hope you guys got
the announcement that I retired this morning. This is not part of
my deal. Mop-up duty was fine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only a joke, but it would be no more unlikely than the
fact that DeBerg could find himself starting at Giants Stadium
against the Jets on Sunday. But more than five years after he
played his last game _ which included two seasons on the sideline
at Giants Stadium as an assistant coach for the Giants under his
current head coach, Dan Reeves, and closer to Social Security
benefits than he is to the day he was drafted into the National
Football League _ DeBerg could find himself in a starting role. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler, the Falcons' starting quarterback, bruised his
left shoulder last week as Atlanta improved its record to 5-1.
Reeves said that Chandler is doubtful for Sunday's game, and the
job then falls to DeBerg. And while DeBerg's physical skills may
have diminished over the years, he is one of the few players who
truly is a coach on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never lose the mind,'' said the Jets' Bryan Cox, who
played with DeBerg in Miami. ``If you lose something physically,
you still have that. He knows how to break down a defense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But exactly what DeBerg can do on the field is questionable.
When he left the game at 39, he had thrown for 273 yards and 2
touchdowns in his final game. He worked out on his own last year,
and this summer sent letters out to a number of teams indicating
that he was interested in playing again. One of the letters was
sent to Reeves, but when addressing the envelope the letter fell
out and Reeves received an empty envelope. Reeves called to ask
about it, and as DeBerg explained, he was unaware that Reeves was
in an emergency situation, with Mark Rypien, his recently signed
backup, putting his career on hold to tend to a family matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After three games of holding the clipboard, DeBerg saw his first
regular-season action in the Falcons' fourth game and completed 1
of 2 passes. He played the final nine minutes against the Giants
the next week, but did not throw a pass. Then last week, when
Chandler was hurt in the second quarter, DeBerg took over, and
after a slow start that included being tackled for a safety, he
finished 7 of 10 for 60 yards with one touchdown and no
interceptions in a 31-23 victory over the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly sure,'' DeBerg said Wednesday when he was
asked where his physical talent level was now. ``But I know my
knowledge level is as high as maybe anybody that's ever played the
game. It still remains to be seen where the physical performance
level is. I haven't been sore at all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Jets who know DeBerg, though, do not doubt his skills. Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde took DeBerg's job in Tampa Bay as a
rookie in 1987 and then played with him again in 1992. The two
remain close, living near each other in Tampa, Fla. Besides
spending a lot of time together on the golf course, the two worked
out in Testaverde's yard this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good friend of mine,'' Testaverde said. ``I'm happy
that he's doing what he enjoys doing. We work out in the off season
a little bit. I know he's in good shape. I don't care how old he
is. I know he can handle it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could imagine playing in the National Football
League when he is 44, Testaverde, who turns 35 next month, said,
``I'm just glad I'm playing at this age.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byers, who played in the Miami Dolphins backfield during
DeBerg's last professional game in 1993, said, ``It shows something
about his resolve and his knowledge of the game. There's no sense
wasting time trying to fool him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox added: ``I'll tell you what, he studies defenses as well as
anybody I know. The guy would be in meetings before the coaches.
The guy brings fun to the game. He comes out to practice in shoes
from 1968, with a helmet with no face mask. He understands the game
very well. I don't know what his arm strength is, but I know at
that time he was a very capable quarterback.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said that he feels ready if the opportunity comes. ``I
did coach and I realized what I did was a lot more fun as a player
than a coach,'' DeBerg said. ``I coached with a majority of these
guys on this staff. I tease them that I do a lot less, get paid a
lot more, and get to go home when their day is just half over. It
makes me appreciate the experience lot more.'' &QL;

ISRAELIS THREATEN TO LEAVE PEACE TALKS THURSDAY AS U.S. RUSHES TO
SALVAGE SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israelis threatened to walk away from peace talks
Thursday as the United States rushed to craft ideas for salvaging
the summit and the Palestinians suggested a negotiating ploy was
afoot.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh day of negotiations at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland fell into turmoil as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
demanded that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat meet
Israel's security demands before proceeding further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli government has packed its bags, including the
prime minister. Take off is scheduled for 10 p.m.,'' said a
statement issued by Netanyahu. ``The prime minister says: `If there
is substantial progress, we will stay. If not, we will go,' '' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis' threatened to leave several times Wednesday but
then decided to stay another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without implementation of Palestinian obligations, without a
solution to the issues of extradition of terrorists and amendment
of the (Palestine National) Charter by the Palestinian National
Council, there will not be an agreement,'' the statement said.
Israelis want the charter amended to exclude language calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, attempting to save the talks, began
preparing a draft of the peace proposals that it had offered
individually to the Israeli and Palestinian delegations in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and expect during the course of the day to be able to
provide a text of what we think will help the two sides reach the
agreements necessary to put the peace process back on track,'' said
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, there had been no meetings between the delegations.
President Clinton, who has shuttled between the White House and the
Wye River conference center for five days, remained in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shuttled between the
delegations in an attempt to keep the talks alive.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton would fly to the rural retreat only if it
appeared his influence could be of use between the two parties.
Clinton already has vested more than 50 hours into securing an
agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be very clear, it is not at all clear that the tough
choices necessary to reach an agreement can or will be made,''
Rubin said. ``That is an open question, and there are significant,
significant gaps remaining.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has attempted to impose a news blackout to
reduce the posturing between the two sides but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort by President Clinton is enormous and I think
continuous intervention of the American administration is crucial.
We are all waiting for the reaction of Mr. Netanyahu to the
American proposal. We said yes to the American initiatives and we
are hearing that Mr. Netanyahu not only saying no but is willing to
leave the Wye Plantation,'' said Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat,
during a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in these sessions is whether Israel will withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank and cede control to the
Palestinian Authority in exchange for security guarantees to combat
the terrorist attacks on Israel by Palestinian militant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has gone that extra mile to make this process work. We
were told 13 percent is what you have to redeploy from in the West
Bank. That is a concrete concession by the state of Israel. We said
it would be difficult for our security but in the end we came
through and the prime minister took that risk for peace,'' said
Dore Gold, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In coming to the Wye Plantation, it was our hope that the
Palestinians would also take an equal risk for peace and come up
with a detailed security plan that would make this redeployment
safe for the security of Israel. We're still waiting to get that
kind of a detailed plan,'' Gold said during a CNN interview.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN also quoted an anonymous U.S. official as saying the
Palestinians had responded ``in all areas seriously and effectively
and in all relevant avenues on security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted a senior Israeli official as saying
the delegation's preparations for departure were not a threat. ``We
are considering it and we've made all the preparations,'' the
official told AP.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Tibi told Agency France Press that Israel was resorting
to blackmail and attempting to force the Palestinians to accept
only a partial accord that would limit land transfers.
</P>
<P>
   He also told AFP that Arafat called Netanyahu to wish him a
happy 49th birthday and sent him flowers. He said Arafat told
Netanyahu he hoped they could reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, Tibi said if Israel left the peace process, ``it would
be a dangerous step, very unjustified. I don't know what the
implication in the area would be but I am appealing to Mr.
Netanyahu to remain here, to continue discussions and to sign the
treaty as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to provide all the assistance, the creativity
and the persuasive powers that we can but we can't make decisions
for them. We are not holding people here against their will,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported the Israelis also were blaming the
administration for the faltering talks. ``The Americans have
retreated from previous understandings with the Israelis and the
Palestinians are not willing to give clear answers about their
commitments on different issues,'' an unnamed Israeli official told
Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is attempting to mediate an interim agreement
that will allow Israel and the Palestinian Authority to move toward
so-called final status talks. Those negotiations involve even more
sensitive issues such as a Palestinian state and the status of
Jerusalem. &QL;

 ARVADA, Colo.: tax incentives. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this month, and again in late 1978, that
vengeful Middle Eastern oil exporters squeezed their supplies to
the United States and raised prices worldwide. A nation that was
virtually self-sufficient into the 1950s had become a petroleum
captive. Gasoline prices soared, lines at the pump stretched beyond
frustration and the economy fell into repeated recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans turned down their thermostats and bought
fuel-efficient Hondas, Datsuns and Toyotas. At work, they replaced
millions of inefficient motors, lighting fixtures and generators.
Nixon called for a national effort on the scale of the making of
the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us set as our national goal,'' he said, ``with the
determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this
decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy
needs without depending on any foreign energy source.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, wearing a sweater in a televised speech to drive home
his point, termed energy conservation the equivalent of fighting a
war.
</P>
<P>
   But traumatic memories of oil shocks have long been soothed by
plentiful, low-cost supplies. At about $1 a gallon _ compared with
$1.10, adjusting for inflation, in 1973 _ fuel is as cheap as ever.
U.S. gasoline prices remain less than half those in Western Europe
and Japan, where energy is heavily taxed to discourage overuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that, in the
absence of efforts to curb growing energy use, carbon emissions
from burning fuel will rise 34 percent from 1990 to 2010, while the
president has pledged to lower them by 7 percent. The agency's
experts scoff at the prospects of meeting Clinton's goal unless
energy prices rise significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our actions rather than words, it's evident we
don't care,'' said Dwight French, a specialist on consumption
trends. ``Only the next crisis will again make conservation a
priority. End of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arvada, in the subdivisions carved into the sagebrush
hills of Denver's suburbs, the McCrackens' new home will have far
more efficient heating, air-conditioning and major appliances than
the homes of 25 years ago. Modern weatherstripping and vinyl-sealed
windows will help keep the Colorado cold out and the heat in. In
energy consumption per square foot, the home of the late 1990s is
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But not the overall champion. Since the early 1970s, the average
size of a new home has risen to 2,100 square feet from 1,600, even
as the average household has shrunk to three people from 3.6.
``It's almost like the trend to sport utility vehicles,'' said Donn
Eley, chief financial officer of Village Homes, the McCrackens'
builder. ``They can't build them big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Home builders are also bringing to tract homes the expansive
features once reserved for mansions. ``Wow factors,'' they are
called in the trade. In the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, the
confined quarters of yesteryear just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Larger homes with fewer people but more things to plug in have
pushed home energy consumption back to the levels of the 1970s.
Residential energy consumption per person fell by a tenth from 1973
to 1983 but has since risen about as much.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter federal standards for homes and major appliances promise
to save enough energy over the coming years to offset what goes to
heat and cool larger homes. But then come the computers,
videocassette recorders, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers
that have been using about 5 percent more energy a year since 1990.
Early in the next decade, the Energy Department predicts, such
appliances will consume even more energy than heating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these devices are always on, ready at the push of a
button. Razors and electric toothbrushes have chargers, fax
machines are poised to send and receive, televisions and
videocassette recorders merely go dormant, not off.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these items use more power than a refrigerator.
``They're called vampires,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, a senior
adviser for efficiency at the Energy Department. ``They suck
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Central air-conditioning, in less than 40 percent of new homes
in 1971, is now in more than 80 percent. Dishwashers have gone from
luxuries, found in 19 percent of households in 1970, toward
necessities, found in 57 percent as of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The standard ceiling height has risen to nine feet from eight,
meaning more space to heat and cool. ``Even though the efficiency
of larger homes has improved,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, research
director for the National Association of Home Builders, ``the total
volume, the use of glass, the fireplaces and the appliances lead to
higher energy consumption. They will not buy a home without these
energy-inefficient features.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coloradans who believe weekends were made for hiking and
cross-country skiing, the McCrackens, trim 31-year-olds, say they
would like to live greener. To save water and energy, they plan to
pay about $300 extra for a high-efficiency washer and dryer.
McCracken has even joined the declining 5 percent of Americans who
ride mass transit _ for him a bus _ to his job as a consultant and
programmer for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But their new house, like many today, is another story. Join the
McCrackens in the Wyndham Park subdivision as they open the door to
a 2,600-square-foot model home like the one they are buying nearby
for $270,000. A towering entryway and its clerestory windows tilt
their gazes upward. The two-story, 21-foot spaces continue on into
the living room and the family room, with nine-foot elevations
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about this is the high ceilings,'' Mrs. McCracken
volunteered. ``I know they are terribly inefficient. But it does
make it seem so spacious.''

ASIA CRISIS MAY BE WORSE NEWS FOR BOEING THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. is expected to wrap up in a couple of
weeks a new review of the impact of the Asian economic situation.
It is expected to be bleaker than the company has previously
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Once the review is completed, Boeing executives will take
another couple of weeks to study the results before deciding the
impact on production rates as Asian airlines continue to cancel or
delay orders and deliveries, said one person familiar with the
on-going review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more negative than what we have previously
put out,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect Boeing's flagship 747 jumbo jet, which
is built in Everett, Wash., to continue to take the brunt of the
Asian fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Asian customers account for about half of Boeing's 747 backlog.
The 420-seat jumbo jet, the largest commercial aircraft in
production, becomes harder to sell elsewhere if Asian airlines
don't want them.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing previously announced that it will trim production of the
747 from 5 per month to 3.5 early next year. Given the worsening
situation in Asia, those rates could fall even further, perhaps as
low as 2.5 per month, by the end of next year, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, after its last review of the situation in
Asia, Boeing estimated that the economic crisis would result in
about 150 fewer airplanes being delivered by all manufacturers over
the next three years. That translated to about 90 planes for
Boeing, given its 60 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   The company will announce its third quarter results Thursday,
and Chairman Phil Condit is almost certain to be asked about Asia
during conference calls with reporters and industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking out there right now, the production outlook for the
747 in 1999 appears okay,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen
MacKenzie firm. ``But what we don't know is what kinds of
cancelations or deferrals we will see. Naturally, Boeing will be
talking to those customers ....
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look to the year 2000 it gets pretty gray,'' he
added. ``That's so far ahead that even though right now it does not
appear Boeing has a lot of orders for the 747 for delivery in 2000,
it's really too soon to even talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it expects to deliver 550 airplanes this year
and 620 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But some planes intended for Asian airlines this year are being
sent to the desert for storage because those customers can't get
financing to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, the end of the third quarter, Boeing had 36
undelivered planes in desert storage, which was up from 20 in
storage at the end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Boeing needs to deliver most of those planes if it
hopes to meet its 550-plane forecast for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Asian crisis, Boeing's overall production rates
are expected to fall after next year. That's because 1999 is
considered the peak of the current boom cycle that has seen
airlines order planes in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether rates will be lower. It's how much
lower,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Boeing deliveries will fall to about 550 planes in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing will be hard pressed to deliver 620 planes next year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be difficult to achieve, given the world economic
environment. The question is, how much might deliveries decline.''
And with them, production rates.

 ARVADA, Colo.: tax incentives. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this month, and again in late 1978, that
vengeful Middle Eastern oil exporters squeezed their supplies to
the United States and raised prices worldwide. A nation that was
virtually self-sufficient into the 1950s had become a petroleum
captive. Gasoline prices soared, lines at the pump stretched beyond
frustration and the economy fell into repeated recessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans turned down their thermostats and bought
fuel-efficient Hondas, Datsuns and Toyotas. At work, they replaced
millions of inefficient motors, lighting fixtures and generators.
Nixon called for a national effort on the scale of the making of
the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us set as our national goal,'' he said, ``with the
determination of the Manhattan Project, that by the end of this
decade we will have developed the potential to meet our own energy
needs without depending on any foreign energy source.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, wearing a sweater in a televised speech to drive home
his point, termed energy conservation the equivalent of fighting a
war.
</P>
<P>
   But traumatic memories of oil shocks have long been soothed by
plentiful, low-cost supplies. At about $1 a gallon _ compared with
$1.10, adjusting for inflation, in 1973 _ fuel is as cheap as ever.
U.S. gasoline prices remain less than half those in Western Europe
and Japan, where energy is heavily taxed to discourage overuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration predicts that, in the
absence of efforts to curb growing energy use, carbon emissions
from burning fuel will rise 34 percent from 1990 to 2010, while the
president has pledged to lower them by 7 percent. The agency's
experts scoff at the prospects of meeting Clinton's goal unless
energy prices rise significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our actions rather than words, it's evident we
don't care,'' said Dwight French, a specialist on consumption
trends. ``Only the next crisis will again make conservation a
priority. End of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Arvada, in the subdivisions carved into the sagebrush
hills of Denver's suburbs, the McCrackens' new home will have far
more efficient heating, air-conditioning and major appliances than
the homes of 25 years ago. Modern weatherstripping and vinyl-sealed
windows will help keep the Colorado cold out and the heat in. In
energy consumption per square foot, the home of the late 1990s is
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   But not the overall champion. Since the early 1970s, the average
size of a new home has risen to 2,100 square feet from 1,600, even
as the average household has shrunk to three people from 3.6.
``It's almost like the trend to sport utility vehicles,'' said Donn
Eley, chief financial officer of Village Homes, the McCrackens'
builder. ``They can't build them big enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Home builders are also bringing to tract homes the expansive
features once reserved for mansions. ``Wow factors,'' they are
called in the trade. In the $150,000-to-$300,000 range, the
confined quarters of yesteryear just won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Larger homes with fewer people but more things to plug in have
pushed home energy consumption back to the levels of the 1970s.
Residential energy consumption per person fell by a tenth from 1973
to 1983 but has since risen about as much.
</P>
<P>
   Tighter federal standards for homes and major appliances promise
to save enough energy over the coming years to offset what goes to
heat and cool larger homes. But then come the computers,
videocassette recorders, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers
that have been using about 5 percent more energy a year since 1990.
Early in the next decade, the Energy Department predicts, such
appliances will consume even more energy than heating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these devices are always on, ready at the push of a
button. Razors and electric toothbrushes have chargers, fax
machines are poised to send and receive, televisions and
videocassette recorders merely go dormant, not off.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these items use more power than a refrigerator.
``They're called vampires,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, a senior
adviser for efficiency at the Energy Department. ``They suck
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Central air-conditioning, in less than 40 percent of new homes
in 1971, is now in more than 80 percent. Dishwashers have gone from
luxuries, found in 19 percent of households in 1970, toward
necessities, found in 57 percent as of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The standard ceiling height has risen to nine feet from eight,
meaning more space to heat and cool. ``Even though the efficiency
of larger homes has improved,'' said Gopal Ahluwalia, research
director for the National Association of Home Builders, ``the total
volume, the use of glass, the fireplaces and the appliances lead to
higher energy consumption. They will not buy a home without these
energy-inefficient features.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coloradans who believe weekends were made for hiking and
cross-country skiing, the McCrackens, trim 31-year-olds, say they
would like to live greener. To save water and energy, they plan to
pay about $300 extra for a high-efficiency washer and dryer.
McCracken has even joined the declining 5 percent of Americans who
ride mass transit _ for him a bus _ to his job as a consultant and
programmer for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But their new house, like many today, is another story. Join the
McCrackens in the Wyndham Park subdivision as they open the door to
a 2,600-square-foot model home like the one they are buying nearby
for $270,000. A towering entryway and its clerestory windows tilt
their gazes upward. The two-story, 21-foot spaces continue on into
the living room and the family room, with nine-foot elevations
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about this is the high ceilings,'' Mrs. McCracken
volunteered. ``I know they are terribly inefficient. But it does
make it seem so spacious.''
</P>

O'MEARA SEEKING NEXT TITLE STONE'S THROW FROM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ When you are playing as well as Mark
O'Meara, jet lag is not a problem. Fresh off his victory over Tiger
Woods at the world match play championship in England on Sunday,
O'Meara has returned home, ready to tee it up again at the National
Car Rental Golf Classic, which begins Thursday at the Walt Disney
World Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament is being held about 20 minutes from O'Meara's
house, which makes it convenient. It has a strong field that
includes the defending champion David Duval, Woods, Vijay Singh,
Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson. It is the final full-field event
of the regular PGA Tour season, with players near the 125th
position on the money list fighting to keep their playing
privileges for next year.
</P>
<P>
   By winning both the Masters and the British Open this year,
O'Meara has already clinched player of the year honors in the eyes
of many. However, O'Meara isn't so sure. Duval has won four times,
he leads the Tour's money list, and if Duval were to win this week
or next week's Tour Championship, he would gain increased support
among his peers, who vote for the award.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, regardless of what happens during the next two weeks,
O'Meara has nothing to prove. He has delivered under pressure, and
at age 41, O'Meara has played his best golf at an age when many
golfers begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   So while O'Meara would love to win player of the year, or the
money title, he will approach the next two weeks the way he has
approached the entire year. He will try to play well enough in the
early rounds to give himself a chance. Then if O'Meara is in
contention on Sunday afternoon, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal at the beginning of the year was to play well, try to
win some tournaments, finish hopefully in the top 10 of the money
list,'' said O'Meara, who has earned more than $1.68 million on
tour this season. ``Because of my performance in major
championships and because of majors having a lot of notoriety,
media throughout the world watching, that in itself has created
more notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, there have been years I actually hit the ball
better than I did this year. If you look at the statistical
information, I'm not the best in driving accuracy, I'm not the best
in driving distance. My stats are somewhat mediocre, but my scoring
average on Sunday is No. 1. And when I've had chances to win, I've
usually gotten the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was another example, when O'Meara rallied from an early
deficit to defeat Woods, 1-up, in a 36-hole match play classic.
O'Meara and Woods are neighbors and close friends, but that
relationship is forgotten during competition. From the moment
O'Meara stepped to the first tee, he could sense the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we teed off Sunday morning, he wasn't really in a chatty
mood,'' O'Meara said of Woods. ``He wanted to drill me, let's face
it. I was four down after five holes. I'm thinking, `I hope I don't
get absolutely whacked here.'''
</P>
<P>
   A few holes later, Woods engaged in some gamesmanship with
O'Meara by refusing to concede an 18-inch putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when I walked up, he was just going to say, `Oh,
that's good,''' O Meara said. ``He didn't. I said: `You kidding me?
This is good, right? You give me this all the time at home.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK, fine, I understand how we stand now. I thought we
were friends, but obviously you don't think I can handle a little
1-foot putt straight in.' So I made it, and I said to him, `That's
it, from now on, I'm not giving you anything, either.'''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was still 3-up after 18 holes, but O'Meara showed his
resolve by coming back to win, making birdies on the final two
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerve-racking,'' O'Meara said. ``I hit bad shots. He
hit bad shots. He made the big mistake, the three-putt on No. 16,
and fortunately I was able to close with two birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if O'Meara and Woods will have another
back-nine battle this weekend. But O'Meara would love to cap his
most satisfying year with another victory.

 CLINTON VETOES PAYING U.N. DUES OVER ANTI-ABORTION PROVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After arguing for months that the United States has
to pay its back dues at the United Nations to keep its credibility
as a superpower, President Clinton vetoed a bill Wednesday that
would have paid those dues, declaring that an unrelated
anti-abortion measure left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the president did sign separate legislation that will enable
the United States to pay just enough for it to keep, for now, its
right to vote in the General Assembly, even as the long-running
debate over the back dues continues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's rejection of the bill to pay nearly $1 billion in
arrears was a virtual certainty, because it included an amendment
sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., that would have barred
federal spending for international family-planning organizations
that lobby foreign governments to change their abortion policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it clear many times that I will veto such
provisions,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``Congress sent me the bill
to fund our arrears to the United Nations knowing full well I would
do so. So today I did. I regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate spending bill that Clinton signed to let the United
States keep its vote in the 185-member General Assembly for the
time being provides about a quarter-billion dollars for the United
Nations. Previously, Congress appropriated, and the United Nations
received, $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But with the veto of the far larger payment the United States, a
founding member of the United Nations, continues to owe the
organization $1 billion in the face of harsh criticism from other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great nations keep their word,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said last week in a speech here. Continued delinquency by the
United States, Annan added, could only undermine the nation's
prestige and its credibility in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still the back dues go unpaid, not because U.S. politicians and
diplomats are insensitive to criticism but because payment of the
arrears has been linked to a hot-button issue in domestic U.S.
politics _ abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no issue embodies such a blend of personal conviction
(or ambivalence) and political calculation. Over the many months
that the U.N. issue has dragged on, Democrats and Republicans have
seen more political advantage in sticking to their respective
positions than in resolving the dues problem.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who heads the Foreign
Relations Committee, has been a longtime critic of the United
Nations (and the State Department, despite an apparent rapport with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright) and has seemed in no hurry
whatever to see that the United States pays up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The divisiveness of the U.N. issue, especially as it has been
intertwined with abortion restrictions, was illustrated in April,
when the Senate approved legislation to pay the arrears. The vote,
51-49, was largely along party lines, with most Republicans'
backing the bill and most Democrats' opposing it. The House had
earlier approved the bill in a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a bipartisan group that is pushing for full payment of
the dues was outraged. ``The failure of the Congress and the
administration to agree on funding the United Nations is
irresponsible and a national embarrassment,'' said David Birenbaum,
chairman of the Emergency Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes former President Jimmy Carter and former
secretaries of state James Baker III and George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his veto, Clinton said, ``The Congress persisted
in tying our United Nations dues to unrelated and controversial
social provisions, which endanger the health of women and deny them
even basic information about family planning, even though studies
show that countries where women have access to strong family
planning actually have fewer abortions.''

DOW JONES' PRESIDENT WILL RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dow Jones &AMP; Co. announced Wednesday that its
president and chief operating officer, Kenneth L. Burenga, will
retire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes seven months after the company jettisoned
its troubled financial services unit, selling it to Bridge
Information Systems Inc. for $510 million, a loss of $1 billion.
Burenga had been closely identified with the futile and costly
efforts to keep that business afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Burenga's retirement comes as the company's board approved a new
three-year financial plan and a new management structure that, for
the moment, eliminates Burenga's jobs of president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, top management will be the responsibility of a group of
executives, consisting of the company's chief financial officer,
Jerry Bailey, its general counsel, Peter G. Skinner, and a group of
executives who run the company's three business divisions. Bailey
and Skinner were both named executive vice presidents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company also authorized a stock buyback of up to $500
million Wednesday. That brings to $800 million the amount the
company has authorized for stock buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   The management reorganization leaves the company with no clear
successor to its current chief executive, chairman Peter R. Kann.
</P>
<P>
   The executive watched most closely by financial analysts is
Bailey, whose cost trimming since he joined the company this spring
has caught Wall Street's attention. ``Jerry Bailey's had an impact
on the company and will continue to have an impact on the
company,'' said Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Wasserstein
Perella.
</P>
<P>
   Steven N. Barlow, who follows the company for Credit Suisse
First Boston, said Bailey has put ``some structure into the
budgeting and planning cycles, not only on the quarter to quarter
basis but looking out several years into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of Dow Jones shares rose 31.25 cents Wednesday to
$44.0625. The stock price peaked at $57.1875 in July, the same week
the stock market peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Burenga said the management change ``streamlines the
organization, flattens it out. The three major groups will report
directly to the chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups he referred to are the print publishing division,
which includes the flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, as
well as the financial weekly Barron's; the electronic publishing
division, which includes the Interactive edition of The Wall Street
Journal, Dow Jones Interactive _ an online news retrieval and
financial information service _ and Dow Jones news wires; and the
community newspaper division, which publishes 19 daily newspapers
and 17 weeklies in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is credited with pushing for cutbacks in the community
newspaper division and other cost controls that improved its profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Burenga's departure was greeted with relief by one
of the company's most outspoken shareholders, William C. Cox III,
who is a member of the extended family that controls, through a
complex series of trusts, the vast majority of the company's
supervoting shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board of directors, which includes such nonfamily
members as Frank N. Newman, chief executive of Bankers Trust Corp.,
and Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express, met
Wednesday and approved the executive shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who has long called for the ouster of Kann and Burenga,
said in an interview that he believed the departure of Burenga was
``a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It would be my hope that the other shoe is going to
drop'' and Kann, too, would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Burenga, who is 54, began work at Dow Jones 32 years ago in the
circulation department of The Wall Street Journal. He said that he
will be joining his son in a small firm investing in short-line
railroads in New Jersey.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cox is one of only two family members who have spoken out
against the company's current management and it is unclear whether
any other members of the extended family share his views.
</P>
<P>
   Burenga said he orchestrated his own departure. After presenting
the board of directors with the three-year financial plan, Burenga
said in an interview, ``I gave some thought to what is the best way
to organize the company with the focus narrowed on our core
competencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I concluded _ and ultimately the chairman agreed and the board
agreed _ that there's just not a need for a president and chief
operating officer at this point or going forward.'' But Cox scoffed
at Burenga's explanation, saying, ``Do I believe that? Absolutely
not.'' To continue without a president, he said, ``would be a
radical departure from the way Dow Jones has conducted its business
for the past 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems with Dow Jones Markets, the service once known as
Telerate, were the defining event in Burenga's last years at the
company. In the years immediately after the financial services
division was purchased, piecemeal, ``it was really a contributor,''
he said. But the rise of Bloomberg's financial service and enhanced
competition from Reuters, coupled with Telerate's increasingly
outdated technology, backed Telerate into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Burenga supported a plan to sink $685 million
into the now-renamed Dow Jones Markets, seeking to revamp the
technology and make the service competitive again. According to
Richard Tofel, a company spokesman, only $160 million of that had
been invested before the company reversed course and decided on the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any regrets about those decisions, Burenga said,
``I don't think you can roll back the clock _ decisions management
made and the board made five years ago, three years ago, were right
at the time. You can't always control market conditions.''

GROUP SAYS VAIL FIRES WERE IN BEHALF OF LYNX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif., Ore., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Earth Liberation Front, a shadowy group that has
taken responsibility for a series of arson fires in the Northwest,
declared in an e-mail communique Wednesday that the fires atop Vail
mountain on Monday were carried out ``on behalf of the lynx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting profits ahead of Colorado's wildlife will not be
tolerated,'' read the brief statement, which was sent
electronically to several Colorado news organizations. ``We will be
back if this greedy corporation continues to trespass into wild and
unroaded areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven fires caused about $12 million worth of damage to
buildings and chair lifts along a 11,200-foot-high ridge that
overlooks a National Forest area where the Vail ski area started
clearing trees on Friday as part of a controversial expansion.
Earlier this year, environmentalists, back country skiers and many
residents of Eagle County had spoken out at public meetings to
block Vail's plan to expand into an area seen as potential habitat
for the reintroduction of the lynx in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Vail, which plans to open for skiing on Nov. 6, is the nation's
busiest ski area, selling 1.6 million lift tickets last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation's skiers, the communique warned: ``For
your safety and convenience, we strongly advise skiers to choose
other destinations until Vail cancels its inexcusable plans for
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening in Vail, the Eagle County sheriff's office
said after receiving the two-paragraph statement by fax:
``Currently investigators are reviewing the origin and the content
for credibility and will continue its investigation using this
communique as a source for information.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vail Resorts spokesman did not return telephone calls for
comment. Although the fires here appear to be in response to a
local dispute, security was tightened this week at other ski areas
around Colorado, the nation's most popular skiing state.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Clausen, a Northern California researcher who studies
terrorist acts claimed by environmental extremists, said Wednesday
that the Earth Liberation Front has taken credit for most of the
arson fires linked to environmental protests.
</P>
<P>
   He said the language in Wednesday's communique ``is almost
identical to other letters the ELF has sent to other victims of
arson fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Clausen said, the Earth Liberation
Front has taken credit for five arsons against federal government
buildings in Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a decline in small acts of sabotage, against
timber and mining, and an escalation of large acts of terrorism,''
Clausen said from his office in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that an article criticizing Vail's expansion plans
appeared in the May-June issue of Earth First Journal, Clausen
said: ``It's a real pattern. Many times articles come out in the
Journal. Then, there is sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, headlined ``Super Vail ... Super Ugly!'' charged
that Vail wanted to ``bring the resort lifestyle into some of the
last, best old-growth habitat for lynx in the southern Rockies.''
But the author, Ben Doon, did not advocate violence. Citing legal
efforts to stop the expansion, Doon urged readers to contact
Ancient Forest Rescue, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   In interview in Vail on Tuesday, Jeff Berman, the local
representative of Ancient Forest Rescue, appeared depressed by the
fires, describing them as a setback in his battle for public
opinion. He asked: ``Does this help us? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Theresa Kintz, editor of the Earth First Journal,
said after reading the communique: ``It is entirely possible that
it was an ELF action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't have a problem with hitting people like
Vail Inc. in their pockets,'' said Ms. Kintz, who dedicates a page
of news, headlined ``Earth Night,'' to sabotage actions claimed by
the Earth Liberation Front. ``I don't have a problem with seeing
their facilities burn down. It's a war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkey wrenching and eco-sabotage are strategies that some
people feel are justified in some circumstances,'' she continued,
using Earth First! jargon for sabotaging machinery. Noting that
arson was a new step, she added: ``Classic eco-sabotage would be
monkey wrenching bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its November 1990 edition, the Earth First Journal published
a photograph of a bulldozer apparently sabotaged by militants
opposed to a ski area expansion near Pagosa Springs, Colo., the
only other recent case of environmental terrorism against a
Colorado ski area.

SCHUMER FIRES COUNTERATTACK AT D'AMATO ON HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Invoking relatives he had lost in the Holocaust, Rep.
Charles Schumer on Wednesday assailed Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for
gathering Holocaust survivors to attack Schumer's record on Jewish
issues. He also berated D'Amato for disparaging him with a Yiddish
vulgarism at a meeting with Jewish leaders earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest indication of the attention that both candidates
are paying to Jewish voters, Schumer chastised his opponent both
for staging the news conference at a Holocaust memorial Sunday
morning, and then for insulting him with the Yiddishism. His
vehement response comes at a time when D'Amato's attacks on
Schumer's congressional attendance record have largely dominated
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost family in the Holocaust, and my wife lost family in the
Holocaust,'' Schumer said in grim tones, fairly leaping at the
question after it was raised at the end of a news conference about
gun control. Aides said Schumer's great-grandmother and seven of
her nine children were killed by Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Al D'Amato used a cheap slur against me, and then,
when asked, lied about it,'' the congressman, a Brooklyn Democrat,
continued. ``Al D'Amato and I are meeting in debate Saturday. I
challenge you, Al D'Amato, to say to my face that I am not
committed to victims of the Holocaust. I challenge you at the
debate Saturday to use that cheap slur.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato at first said he did not recall using the vulgarism,
which was first reported in the latest issue of Jewish Week, dated
Oct. 23. ``I have absolutely no knowledge of ever having made that
statement,'' D'Amato said. ``I have no knowledge of it. Certainly
never in a public domain.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of participants at the private meeting on Tuesday,
including former Mayor Ed Koch, who is D'Amato's most prominent
Jewish supporter, confirmed that the senator had in fact called
Schumer ``a putzhead.'' At the same meeting, they said, D'Amato
referred to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, as ``Jerry
Waddler,'' a presumed reference to Nadler's substantial weight.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, D'Amato sent a letter to Schumer in which he
implicitly admitted using the Yiddishism _ but remained on the
attack, asserting that it was Schumer who was trying to ``inject
religious differences'' into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Making no mention of his earlier denials, D'Amato wrote: ``The
Yiddish word I used to describe you at a private meeting means
`fool.' Again, you are trying to twist that into a religious slur.
And again, I stand by my remark 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Joys of Yiddish,'' by Leo Rosten (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1968), the word ``putz'' is defined as ``vulgar slang for
`penis,''' which is used as ``a term of contempt for a fool'' or
``a jerk.'' Rosten adds a cautionary note: ``Putz is not to be used
lightly or when women or children are around.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's exchange was another example of Schumer using
against D'Amato a weapon that the senator had employed against one
of his own opponents. The congressman's injured tone recalled the
way D'Amato reacted six years ago, almost to the day, after his
Democratic challenger, Robert Abrams, called D'Amato a ``fascist.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato presented himself as a sympathetic figure under attack,
and forced Abrams, then the state attorney general, to defend
himself against allegations of anti-Italian bias.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's impolitic description of two of New York City's
best-known Democratic members of Congress was not entirely out of
character for the senator, who once used a fake Japanese accent to
mock Lance Ito, the Japanese-American judge in the O.J. Simpson
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato, a disciplined politician, normally keeps a tight
rein on his public utterances in the middle of a campaign. And some
of his advisers expressed concern Wednesday night that his remarks,
coupled with criticism over D'Amato's Holocaust news conference,
could pose a problem for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   There clearly was an element of calculation in Schumer's attack.
Although he and Nadler had accused D'Amato of politicizing the
Holocaust after the Sunday news conference at the Holocaust
Memorial Wall across from the United Nations, Schumer did not
mention his lost relatives until Wednesday.

MASSACHUSETTS: DEMOCRAT IS GAINING IN RACE  
 WASHINGTON STATE: MONEY AND MESSAGE  
 ALASKA: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IS ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats don't always win in Massachusetts. But mostly they do.
So with less than two weeks to go to Election Day, can the
Democratic candidate for governor, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, overtake his Republican opponent, Acting Gov. Paul
Cellucci?
</P>
<P>
   He is closing in.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Harshbarger was down 10 points or so in the polls.
But now, according to the latest Boston Herald poll, he has cut
that deficit in half.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger has been hammering Cellucci hard recently, asserting
in campaign advertising that the acting governor has yet to
adequately explain how he could be some $700,000 in personal debt.
Independent voters in particular appear to have responded favorably
to the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger still has a steep hill to climb. His voter base
is shaky, with many Democrats lukewarm about his candidacy because
they remember that he once politically challenged a Kennedy, and on
another occasion aggressively investigated possible wrongdoing by
some party members.
</P>
<P>
   Equally difficult for Harshbarger, he must overcome the built-in
advantage that Cellucci has as an incumbent running in economic
good times. That advantage is enhanced considerably by the fact
that the acting governor is a liberal Republican, and thus not all
that ideologically different from Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Money and Message in Washington State
</P>
<P>
   Going into this year's Washington state race for a U.S. Senate
seat, many state and national Republican leaders insisted that
their candidate, Rep. Linda Smith of Vancouver, had a real shot at
unseating the Democratic incumbent, Patty Murray. But would they
put their money where their mouth is?
</P>
<P>
   Not wholeheartedly, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith has good conservative credentials _ strong enough,
political analysts say, to guarantee her a hefty Republican vote.
She also has a strong populist streak, which analysts believe will
stand her well with independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Smith is having trouble getting her message out.
</P>
<P>
   Her outspoken support for campaign-finance reform has come back
to haunt her. Because she refuses to take many types of campaign
contributions, she is running low on money and is unable to match
her opponent's big television advertising campaign. The latest
polls have Ms. Smith trailing by nearly 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals for money to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee,
run by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an outspoken opponent of
campaign-finance reform, have mostly been ignored. The committee
could legally give Ms. Smith up to $540,000 but has sent only
$17,500, without explaining why.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Washington state party officials last week sent word
to the national party and to McConnell that if they were not going
to help the Smith campaign, they should stop all money
solicitations in the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ms. Smith announced that she had just been sent
$100,000 by the Republican National Committee, a gift that she
gladly accepted. The national committee can accept gifts from
sources that Ms. Smith will not accept gifts from. How, then, could
she accept such money?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said it was not an issue for her, because she did not
know who gave the money to the committee, and thus there could be
no quid pro quo on her part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate hypocrisy,'' Sen. Murray shot back.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Candidate Is Adrift in Alaska
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska governor's race has taken another topsy-turvy turn,
one that very well might doom whatever slim chance the Republican
nominee, John Lindauer, had.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Republican leaders in the state questioned whether
the party should continue to support Lindauer, given that there
were so many confusing and unanswered questions about the source of
his $2 million in campaign funds. He insisted that everything was
aboveboard, and the party leaders backed off.
</P>
<P>
   But questions continued to arise, with a least one Alaskan
filing suit in an effort to get a more detailed answer _ or, in the
absence of one, to have Lindauer thrown off the ballot. Was there
or wasn't there a secret financial source, something not permitted
under Alaska law?
</P>
<P>
   Lindauer, a retired newspaper publisher, insisted initially that
he was spending his own money. Then he said it was his wealthy
wife's money. Then he said he was broke. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Republican leaders announced that the party was
withdrawing its support of Lindauer because of all the confusion
and contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   The party chairman, Tom McKay, said Lindauer would, of course,
remain on the ballot, pending any court action on the citizen's
suit. But he added that the party would ``rally around in a big
way'' should a prominent Alaska Republican step forward to start a
write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we're having fun doing,'' McKay said.
``But it's necessary to preserve the Republican Party as a viable
institution in Alaska politics.''
</P>
<P>
   If past results in Alaskan elections for governor are any
indication, there is not much viability to preserve. The last time
a Republican won the office was 20 years ago, and political
analysts say this year's Democratic incumbent, Tony Knowles, a
moderate, has few re-election concerns, particularly in light of
Tuesday's decision by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Lindauer, a conservative, vowed to push on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lie about the source of my income,'' he said. ``The
party lied that I lied.''

ITALY'S NEW PREMIER CASTS A WIDE NET FOR CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for rewriting throughout. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A former Communist became Italy's prime minister
Wednesday, the first ever to do so, and he quickly appointed an
eclectic Cabinet that is not solidly to the left.
</P>
<P>
   If Parliament approves the Cabinet of the new premier, Massimo
D'Alema, he will be the only former Communist to head a major
Western European government.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema, 49, chose a cabinet that has something for
everyone: Communists, conservatives, and six women. That is twice
the number who served under the departing prime minister, Romano
Prodi, whose center-left government collapsed two weeks ago, when
it lost a parliamentary election by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Among other compromises, D'Alema was forced to give such key
ministries as Defense and Communications to supporters of Francesco
Cossiga, a former Christian Democrat who now leads a small
center-right party.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 17 parties in Parliament. Seven are
represented in the new government, eight if you include Prodi's
Olive Tree coalition.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's effort to forge across-the-board allegiances to secure
a majority signals a classic Italian paradox: A government whose
stated goal is the introduction of a two-party system is itself a
mirror of the patchwork quilt of small, constantly mutating parties
that is the source of Italy's chronic political instability.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who tried and failed to pass reforms in Parliament this
year, has already pledged to make electoral reform a top priority.
Many Italians wonder how he will manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it hard to believe that so heterogeneous a coalition
will be prepared to reform the electoral system,'' said Sergio
Romano, a former diplomat and political expert. ``Too many people
behind this government, like Cossiga, thrive on the very system of
proportionality that the reform is supposed to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Cossiga, 70, is distrusted by left and right
in Italy, but having survived the collapse of the old political
system dominated by the Christian Democrats, of which he was a
leader, he created the Union of Democrats for the Republic six
months ago and is now a power broker.
</P>
<P>
   Cossiga navigates from one political side to another. While he
was president of Italy in 1991, D'Alema's party sought to have him
impeached. Cossiga's new bond with D'Alema has infuriated his
former allies in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall see how men who only yesterday insulted and attacked
each other can stay clasped together in a grab for power,'' said
Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon and former conservative prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, Italians are waiting to see how the Communists
and Cossiga's forces will clash at Cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Some government priorities _ like passing a 1999 budget that
allows Italy to meet the requirements for joining a single European
currency in January _ seem widely shared and well within reach.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema reappointed the two top economic ministers, who are
credited with helping Prodi trim Italy's bloated economy and
qualify for membership in the euro last spring: Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi will stay on as treasury and budget minister, and Vincenzo
Visco will continue as finance minister. Italy's respected foreign
minister, Lamberto Dini, was also reappointed.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has already said he will present to Parliament the same
budget that caused Prodi's government to collapse. Fausto
Bertinotti, general secretary of the Marxist Communist Refounding
Party, withdrew his support from Prodi over budget disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But that move quickly split Communist Refounding. A more
moderate faction led by Armando Cossutta, unwilling to be blamed
for sabotaging the first center-left government in 50 years, split
off, forming yet another small leftist party, the Italian
Communists' Party.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Cossutta vowed that he could never join forces with
Cossiga. He relented, and his party was rewarded with the
ministries of justice and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are new faces, like Giovanna Melandri, 36, a member of
D'Alema's Democratic Party of the Left, who was named Minister of
Culture and Sports, and Enrico Letta, 32, a member of the Popular
Party, who will take over European Affairs and is the youngest
member of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema also brought back Giuliano Amato, 60, a former prime
minister and one of the few Socialist leaders who escaped unscathed
from the scandals that toppled former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi,
who is now living in exile in Tunisia. Amato was awarded a newly
revived post, minister of institutional reform, which includes
drafting new electoral laws.

 &HT;    Lawmakers seek punishment for Castro
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Many Cuban-Americans say they want Fidel Castro to
suffer the same fate that befell former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet, who is in British custody in connection with the deaths
of several Spaniards during his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Pinochet's arrest Friday on a Spanish warrant,
eight members of the House of Representatives have sent a letter to
President Clinton asking him to bring Castro to justice for the
deaths of four Cuban-American aviators two years ago. In addition,
the Cuban American National Foundation, the largest anti-Castro
lobbying group in the United States, said Wednesday it is putting
together a team of American and international lawyers to try to
have the Cuban dictator arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that Pinochet is responsible for applies to Fidel
Castro,'' said Ninoska Perez, a spokeswoman for the Miami-based
lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish judge has ordered Pinochet extradited from London,
where he underwent back surgery, to face trial on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism. The Spanish National Court is
expected to rule on the case soon.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who assumed power in 1973 during a U.S.-backed coup
that toppled democratically elected Socialist President Salvador
Allende, cannot be prosecuted in Chile for the deaths and torture
of nearly 3,000 people because he has immunity as a
senator-for-life. He relinquished power to a civilian regime in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cuban exiles see a parallel to Castro, who has ruled the
island nation since 1959. Castro's foes say he should be held
responsible for the downing of two Brothers to the Rescue airplanes
in international airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without minimizing the immensity of Castro's crimes
perpetrated throughout the last 40 years,'' the eight lawmakers
said in their letter to Clinton, ``the killing of Americans in the
Florida Straits on Feb. 24, 1996, clearly provides the basis for
immediate legal action by the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers urged U.S. authorities to examine the Pinochet
case and to take similar steps against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the lawmakers' attempt to nab Castro is
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not underestimate the importance of such a move,''
said Robert Pastor, who served on President Carter's National
Security Council and is a visiting professor at Harvard. ``What
they're saying is, `If it applies to one, it can apply to the
other.' No tyrant can feel he can travel with immunity anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' attempt, he said, is ``symbolic but not
insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, dated Monday, was signed by Republican Reps. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida; Dana Rohrabacher
and William Thomas of California; Michael Forbes, Gerald Solomon
and Peter King of New York; and Democratic Rep. Robert Menendez of
New Jersey.

 &HT;    Andres County awaiting TNRCC vote on radioactive waste site
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If a state commission shoots down a plan to
build a radioactive waste disposal facility near Sierra Blanca,
Andrews County, an oil-patch West Texas community on the New Mexico
border, has laid out the welcome mat for the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is scheduled
to cast a long-awaited vote this morning on whether to grant the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority a license to
operate a site near Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   As critics from both sides of the border attack the Sierra
Blanca site, Lloyd Eisenrich, president of the Andrews Industrial
Foundation, continues to sell his county's amenities: low rainfall,
an existing private site with permits to dispose of dangerous
waste, a deep water table below hundreds of feet of clay, and
perhaps most importantly, a population that has made its living
from the oil fields and isn't alarmed by the idea of radioactive
waste nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews County made an unsuccessful pitch for the site in the
late 1980s, and ``We've just been kind of sitting in the wings for
10 years,'' said Eisenrich.
</P>
<P>
   The business that Eisenrich would like to see run Texas' site is
Waste Control Specialists, which in 1997 opened a 1,300-acre
facility straddling the Texas-New Mexico border. Located 30 miles
west of Andrews, the county seat, the site disposes of hazardous
and toxic waste in a lined landfill and already stores some types
of radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Hance, chairman of the company's board, said the facility
opened in 1997 and has submitted a 5,000-page application to the
U.S. Department of Energy for a license to accept federal waste.
</P>
<P>
   Hance, a well-connected former state and federal lawmaker who
has contributed at least $15,000 to Gov. George W. Bush this
election cycle, said the company could move quickly to accommodate
a disposal site because it already has done exhaustive enviromental
impact studies.
</P>
<P>
   Even if regulators refused a license for the Sierra Blanca site
and favored Andrews, lawmakers _ which originally mandated that the
state run a facility in Hudspeth County _ would still have to enact
new legislation to move the site and allow it to be run by a
private company.
</P>
<P>
   Hance said his company is willing to discuss deeding land to the
state and letting the state run the site. ``All that could be
worked out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state would also have to settle questions about the site's
proximity to an important aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Diamond, spokeswoman for the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority, said they excluded Andrews County as a
potential site a decade ago because the county is within the
recharge area for the Ogallala Aquifer _ which extends from the
Dakotas to northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have never considered that area, not for a moment,''
Diamond said. ``The map that we used (from the Texas Department of
Water Resources) back then clearly shows the recharge area for a
major aquifer over the entire Andrews County area.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Tom Rainwater, an associate professor of civil
engineering at Texas Tech University who was hired as a consultant
by the Andrews Industrial Foundation, said core samples drilled by
Waste Control Specialists shows that the state maps were wrong.
``The reality is that part of Andrews County doesn't really connect
at all to the Ogallala Aquifer.''

 &HT;    Decision due on Sierra Blanca
 &HT;    By Ralph Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The worst possible decision the state's top
environmental regulators could make regarding the proposed nuclear
waste site in Sierra Blanca is no decision.
</P>
<P>
   The three members of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission no doubt feel as if they are under a microscope today as
they decide whether to allow a permit for the waste site. And they
unquestionably are under a microscope with state, national and
international lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The waste site, to be located near the U.S.-Mexico border in
Hudspeth County, has sparked debate that is both scientific and
emotional. Gov. George W. Bush, who inherited the situation from
predecessor Ann Richards, says that if the site is safe for a
nuclear disposal facility, it should be built. If it's not safe, it
shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Local, state and congressional officials of the Mexican
government also express opposition, while members of the Zedillo
administration are either neutral or cautiously support the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Domestically, experts argue both sides of the safety issue while
industry officials argue for its need.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition on this page to using Hudspeth County land to
dump nuclear waste has been consistent and we reiterate that
opposition today.
</P>
<P>
   After all the rhetoric, the dueling analyses and the political
considerations are weighed, however, the three members of the
commission today bear the responsibility of reaching a decision. To
postpone would make an already bad situation worse for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   The decision won't be the final word on the matter. Too much
time, money and emotion have been invested in the site for either
side to let go. Hudspeth County Attorney Tom Chellis has threatened
to sue to keep the site out of the county. There is no reason not
to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, proponents of the site can't be expected to just go
away quietly if the decision goes against them.
</P>
<P>
   A decision today would set events in motion that would
ultimately lead to resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hudspeth County residents have lived in this political limbo
long enough. Although it will be years before the matter is
ultimately resolved, at least an end will be brought to the initial
skirmishing. And the people of Hudspeth County will be in a
position to decide whether they want to live there any more.
</P>
<P>
   A decision today would be most welcome in another way. A
decision should spark the incoming Legislature to take a look at
the process, and we urge that the incoming administration and
legislative leadership work with the U.S. Congress to streamline
the selection process and make it as understandable as possible to
the communities that are asked to host the site.
</P>
<P>
   The decision today will not please everyone. Most decisions
don't. But deciding will at least let the various parties involved
know what they need to do next.

 &HT;    UT observing National Days of Action on Wednesday
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Despite wanting him to shut up and go away,
supporters of restoring affirmative action at the University of
Texas said Wednesday their efforts are less focused this year
without a Lino Graglia to mobilize the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Graglia, a UT law professor and longtime foe of affirmative
action, galvanized the campus last fall when he said blacks and
Mexican Americans were not competitive with whites in selective
schools like UT because their cultures did not look on failure in
disgrace. The remarks captured national attention and sparked a
series of protests at UT that culminated in a huge rally led by
two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no Lino Graglia to sort of spark the passion, but that
doesn't mean it's not there,'' said Bob Jensen, who teaches
journalism and who helped organize two panel discussions Wednesday
to put a spotlight back on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The events continue today with a West Mall protest rally and
news conference by the Anti-Racist Organizing Committee. The
activities are in conjunction with National Days of Action at other
schools where affirmative action has been attacked. Walkouts were
planned at the University of California at Berkeley, where minority
enrollments have dropped significantly because of an affirmative
action ban, and at the University of Michigan, which is being sued
by the Center for Individual Rights for admissions policies the
center called discriminatory against whites.
</P>
<P>
   The center succeeded with a similar suit against UT. The case,
known as Hopwood, effectively dismantled affirmative action
programs at Texas colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think students are concerned, but there's a feeling right
now that there's nothing to focus on,'' said Peter Haney, a
graduate student in anthropology. ``Obviously, we have a
legislative session coming up, and I'm sure that's something we can
mobilize on.''
</P>
<P>
   UT is appealing the Hopwood ruling, but arguments to the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals probably won't be scheduled until
next spring or summer. And if the case goes to the U.S. Supreme
Court, it could be 2000 or 2001 before the issue of racial
considerations in higher education is resolved, said Betty Owens,
an attorney with Vinson &AMP; Elkins, which is representing UT in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Owens appeared at one of two panel discussions Wednesday
afternoon that each drew about 75 students and explored racism,
access to higher education and the fate of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty and students said that while they wished more of
UT's 49,000 students had attended, they did not detect a lack of
interest in the topic. Nor does Graglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hot topic,'' said Graglia, noting that he has made
five speeches around the country in the last few weeks. Affirmative
action has ``been on the defensive for a few years, and all that
has done is make it hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Graglia said that even though only eight blacks and 29 Mexican
Americans were admitted to the first-year law school of 465 at UT
this year, it was better for everyone to know they got in without
the help of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-affirmative action panelists disagreed. Because minorities
have less wealth and because society is not colorblind, affirmative
action has meant access to premier universities and subsequent
access to power, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me what this whole debate is about . . .is a
fairly blatant attempt to maintain white privilege,'' said Robin
Kilson, who teaches history at UT.
</P>
<P>
   Her history department colleague Neil Foley agreed it was time
to shift the discussion about affirmative action to the privileges
whites enjoy. ``When we get into victimization (of minorities) ...
it's a no-win situtation,'' he said.

NEGATIVE NEWSLETTER SPURS MINIMED STOCK SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An unfortunately timed, critical newsletter can
cost a profitable company dearly, as MiniMed Inc. learned Wednesday
when its stock price plunged 16 percent even as it reported strong
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The insulin pump maker reported that net income climbed a steep
71 percent to nearly $3.2 million, or 23 cents per diluted share,
compared with $1.9 million, or 14 cents per diluted share, from the
comparable year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 39 percent to $34.9 million from last year's $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Far from lapping up more shares, however, investors unloaded
their stock en masse, pushing the price down $9.50 to close
Wednesday at $58.625. They apparently were spooked by a newsletter
from the Rockville, Md.-based Center for Financial Research and
Analysis Inc. that questioned the Sylmar, Calif.-based firm's
accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   It said MiniMed's July 31 sale of its costly,
still-in-development implantable insulin pump technology to Medical
Research Group LLC, which was founded by MiniMed Chairman Alfred
Mann, would provide an ``artificial boost'' to the company's bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Related-party activities should generally be viewed with
skepticism because they often fail to constitute arm's-length
transactions,'' the newsletter said. ``In this particular case,
CFRA believes that (MiniMed's) decision to sell the assets of its
implantable pump business to MRG will provide (MiniMed) with an
artificial boost to reported earnings by removing certain expenses
from (MiniMed's) income statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFRA stated that the company misclassified $1.5 million
payments under a research and development contract with American
Medical Instruments Inc. as a reduction in operating expenses
rather than revenue, wrongly based those payments on a
discretionary milestone stipulated in the contract rather than on
actual receipt of payment, and said those payments constitute a
one-time boost rather than a recurring revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter also noted an eroding gross margin, cash-flow
deficits and an increase in receivables relative to sales as other
causes for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Its evaluation was based on second-quarter financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Nalbone, a medical devices analyst for Volpe Brown
Whelan in San Francisco, called Monday's newsletter a ``spurious
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with Medical Research was the sensible approach
to take and is standard practice for medical products companies,
Nalbone said. In addition, the $1.5 million quarterly milestone
payments are likely to recur through the end of 1999 and are a
legitimate item to book each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was reiterating his ``buy'' recommendation for
MiniMed stock, adding that the depreciated price creates a prime
opportunity for investors to pick up a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very solid company; it's clearly the technological
leader in the diabetes care area,'' Nalbone said. ``We just hate to
see people focused on incorrect issues. This is a really solid
company, and their growth prospects are intact.''
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed President and Chief Operating Officer Terrance Gregg
said investment bankers and analysts are calling ``to tell them
what a great buy (our stock) is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a company, we're not going to respond to (the
criticisms),'' Gregg said.

 &HT;    Chandler still sore, likely will miss Jets game
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler did not
practice Wednesday and will have to make a strong improvement to
have any chance of playing Sunday against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler jogged and threw passes of 12-to-15 yards to trainer
Ron Medlin, but his left arm, held tightly against his side,
obviously was bothering him. He's listed as questionable on the
injury report, which translates to a 50-50 situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chris does not practice (today), I would say he'll be
doubtful,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``He didn't make as much
progress from yesterday to today as we hoped. He's had trouble
sleeping. And when you don't sleep, a lot of times that's where
healing takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the decision would be Chandler's and could be made
as late as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, 33, left Sunday's game against the Saints with a
strained left, non-throwing shoulder and with bruised tissue around
the ribs beneath the left shoulder blade after being sacked by New
Orleans linebacker Mark Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can move it around a little bit, but it's very sore,''
Chandler said after practice Wednesday. ``If I can go, I can. If I
can't, I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Medlin said Chandler has no broken bones, torn tendons, muscles
or cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't feel as good today as he has the last two
days,'' Medlin said. ``It's really right under the shoulder blade.
His motion is getting better, but sometimes when he moves it, it's
very sore. The rhomboids, trapezoids and all those muscles come
together in the shoulder, and with a compression blow they get
stretched. We're not discouraged; we're cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler can't play, backup Steve DeBerg, 44, will make his
first start since Dec. 13, 1993. He will be trying to lead the team
to its first 6-1 start in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 season, Chandler missed two complete games and parts
of four others, with two concussions, a bruised sternum and a
sprained ankle. Atlanta lost all six.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said the offense under DeBerg would be more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of Steve's strengths are in the play-action area; we'll
probably do more play action,'' Reeves said. ``To say we're going
to be exactly the same would be ridiculous. If Chris doesn't play
... the running game will be that much more important.

 &HT;    Couch, Carter take different paths to stardom
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three years ago, Quincy Carter and Tim Couch were
considered the nation's top high school quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was a Parade All-American at Southwest DeKalb High,
leading the Panthers to the Class AAAA state title as a senior in
1995. Only Couch, who shattered national passing records for career
completions, yardage and touchdowns at Leslie County High in tiny
Hyden, Ky., was rated higher.
</P>
<P>
   The pair exchanged telephone calls during their senior seasons,
then met in person in the summer at Disney World at an All-America
team gathering. They hit it off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really got to know Tim in those two days,'' Carter said.
``We were both quarterbacks and had both signed with schools that
weren't doing so well at the time. There were some obvious
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll meet again Saturday, when No. 11 Georgia faces improved
Kentucky in Lexington in a SEC East showdown. The Wildcats enter
the game 5-2 and are ranked second nationally in passing with
Couch, a Heisman Trophy candidate. And the Bulldogs, 5-1 overall,
haven't missed a beat under Carter, perhaps the nation's top
freshman quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a matchup of the two best quarterbacks in the
country,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``I haven't seen (UCLA's
Cade) McNown play much, so I don't know about the rest of them. But
(Carter) is having a great year, and Couch is too.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players enter the game ranked among the nation's leading
passers _ Couch is 12th nationally in passing efficiency; Carter is
14th. But they took strikingly different paths in getting there.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a 6-foot-3, 220-pounder, never enrolled at Georgia Tech
after signing a letter of intent with the Yellow Jackets in
February 1996. Instead, he signed a minor league baseball contract
with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised because he was so good coming out of
high school,'' Couch said. ``I thought he'd follow his aspirations
in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch shocked the college football world as well, choosing to
play for Kentucky, which did not have a winning record the previous
six seasons under former coach Bill Curry. Couch turned down
several established programs, including Florida, Notre Dame and
Tennessee, to remain loyal to the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, his marriage with the conservative Curry turned
sour. Curry refused to promote the freshman over returning starter
Billy Jack Haskins in 1996 and later had the strong-armed Couch
running the option in a 65-0 loss to top-ranked Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Couch's life changed as a sophomore, however, when Curry was
fired and Kentucky hired pass-happy coach Hal Mumme, formerly of
Valdosta State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a dream come true to be in an offense that's
geared toward me,'' Couch said. ``I never had any idea that it
would be this much fun. I'm having the greatest time of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than two seasons under Mumme, Couch has rewritten the
Kentucky and SEC record books. He has thrown for at least 300 yards
and one touchdown in every game this season, and leads the nation
in pass completions. Last week, Couch completed 37 of 50 attempts
for 391 yards and three touchdowns in the Wildcats' 39-36 upset of
LSU, earning him SEC player of the week honors for the first time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to take Tim for granted,'' Mumme said, ``and I think
it's something our conference is doing a little bit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is taking nothing for granted after a lonely two-year
layoff from football. When he decided to return to the sport,
Carter called several friends for advice. He contacted former
Georgia coach Ray Goff. ``He told me to go to North Carolina,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   And Carter called Couch, who already had become established as
one of the nation's best in only a few starts a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just asked me what I thought about him playing college
football,'' Couch said. ``I told him that I thought he'd be great
for college football and that he'd be very successful. Obviously,
he's got a great career ahead of him.''

 &HT;    Reeves warns against distractions
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves met with the team
Wednesday morning and told players not to be bothered by the report
that receiver Tony Martin is under federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves acknowledged that the news that Martin is suspected
of laundering drug profits for longtime friend and convicted
narcotics trafficker Rickey Brownlee would be a distraction to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. I talked to our football team,'' Reeves said. ``And when
you should be talking about (Sunday's game against) the Jets, you
got to talk about something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he reminded players, ``You're not guilty by being
investigated.'' Several Falcons said the situation would not cause
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 33, had no comment. But defensive end Chuck Smith turned
his apparent frustrations toward more than 15 journalists and four
or five TV cameras on hand, about three times the usual number of
media representatives. Smith raised his voice and chastised
reporters. He said later, ``I have no problem with the story; it
has to be reported. But it's vulture journalism when all these
people show up who aren't usually here. Where were they when
(Martin) was tearing everybody up (playing football)?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who leads the team with 27 receptions and 492 receiving
yards, practiced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A distraction is anything that you allow to take your focus
off what you're doing,'' fullback Bob Christian said. ``To me, it's
not a distraction. I saw Tony this morning, and he looked like
business as usual. We're there for Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Devin Bush agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of your own, and you want to support him because
that's what a team is all about,'' Bush said. ``They're just
allegations; they're not true. It might be more of a distraction
for him, but how can we let that happen? We're not little kids.
We're professionals. We've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and his lawyers have assured me that they have nothing to
worry about,'' Reeves said. ``Hopefully, that's what comes out of
it.''

 &HT;    Banged-up Falcons prepare for more of the same Sunday
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons practiced in helmets, shoulder
pads, and shorts Wednesday eschewing the usual full dress because
they're so banged up after last Sunday's 31-23 win over the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   That was by far the most physical game of the season, and this
Sunday's road game against the Jets (3-3) promises to be more of
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler did not practice (see story, page 1),
DT Travis Hall also sat out with a sprained ankle, and, most
importantly, bruised tendon above his knee, and DE Chuck Smith
rested a strained thigh muscle.
</P>
<P>
   All three are questionable (50-50) for Sunday, but count on
Smith playing. Chandler and Hall are another story, although Hall's
chances appear better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it funny on the turf (at the Georgia Dome),'' said Hall,
who is fourth on the team with 39 tackles, has two sacks, 19
quarterback pressures, two tackles for losses, four batted passes,
one fumble forced, two recovered, and two PATs blocked. ``If the
game was today, I couldn't play, but we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's absence would be huge. He's the team's biggest defender
at 6-feet-5, and 300 pounds, and one of the top tackles in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't go, Esera Tuaolo (6-2, 281) would probably start,
and first-year DT Shawn Swayda (6-5, 290) would probably dress for
the second time. Also, starting left DE Lester Archambeau would
play some at DT, and reserve DE John Burrough would play a little
more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient one
</P>
<P>
   If Chandler can't play, backup Steve DeBerg, 44, would become
the oldest player in NFL history to start a game. The record is
held by Seattle QB Warren Moon, who will turn 42 next month. Former
Oakland QB/K George Blanda at 47 was the oldest to play in the NFL,
but his last start came when he was 41 years, two months old.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg's last start was Dec. 13, 1993, when he completed 27 of
44 passes for 344 yards and a TD for Miami in a 21-20 loss to
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He was 2-2 as a starter for the Dolphins, including a 16-14 win
at eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas. That was the Thanksgiving
day game on a snow-covered field. Cowboys DT Leon Lett gave the
Dolphins another shot at victory when he mistakenly touched a
rolling ball after a blocked field goal. Miami recovered to get
another field-goal try.
</P>
<P>
   If DeBerg and second-year man Tony Graziani were hurt against
the Jets, and Chandler couldn't take over, it's not clear how
Atlanta would react. Punter Dan Stryzinski has in years past been
emergency QB, but Reeves didn't verify that would happen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd probably just go to the shotgun, and snap it to (RB)
Jamal (Anderson),'' he said. ``We'll come up with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the rest of the Falcons' injury report: Out _
LB Henri Crockett (wrist); questionable _ CB Ronnie Bradford
(abdomen/back muscle); probable _ CB Randy Fuller (hamstring), DT
Shane Dronett (knee), LB Craig Sauer (knee). Jets: Out _ TE Fred
Baxter (knee); questionable _ LB Chad Cascadden (hamstring), S
Chris Hayes (leg).
</P>
<P>
   The last word
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated's soon-to-be-released list of its 10 dirtiest
players includes Falcon C/G Dave Widell _ again. SI says Widell
will hit a defender late, or away from the ball. Seattle G Brian
Habib said of Widell, ``At the end of a play, he'll come up behind
a guy and give him a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Widell, who hasn't dressed the last four games, was Habib's
teammate in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian only says that because he's on the other side of the
country,'' Widell said, laughing. ``He's probably out there having
a good time, working on the '65 GTO he spent $5,000 to buy and
another $25,000 to get running.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   In winning 11 of 14 games, the Falcons last Sunday for the first
time beat a team with a winning record, although the Saints are now
3-3. The combined record of the teams Atlanta has beaten this
season: 7-25. ... The Falcons are tied with Green Bay for second in
the NFL against the run, allowing an average of 85.3 yards per
game. They trail San Diego (72.0). ... The Jets are 3-0 in games
started by quarterback Vinny Testaverde (AFC player of the week
after completing 22-of-32 passes for 294 yards and three TDs in
Monday's 24-14 win at New England). ... Jets RB Curtis Martin has
rushed for more than 100 yards in each New York victory. ... No
running back has had 100 yards against the Falcons in 14 games,
second-longest streak in the NFL (Jacksonville, 18). ... Jets coach
Bill Parcells said Wednesday of Chandler's status: ``He'll play.''
... Atlanta has scored a defensive TD in three straight games for
the first time since 1981. ... CB Ray Buchanan was not fined for
his roughing-the-passer penalty against the Saints. S Devin Bush's
appeal of his fine for a late hit in the Oct. 4 game against
Carolina has not been heard.

 &HT;    Offensive line's unsteadiness vs. blitz still Falcons' Achilles'
heel
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are 5-1, and there are a few very
good reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the NFL in average time of possession (33:06), they're
second with a plus-eight turnover ratio, and they've scored on 15
of 16 red zone possessions, the only exception being a kneel-down
in the waning seconds of Sunday's 31-23 win over New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive live remains a concern.
</P>
<P>
   The same unit chiefly responsible for paving the way for running
back Jamal Anderson to lead the NFC in rushing with 644 yards has
allowed 25 sacks _ more than all but five teams, two that have
played one more game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons say a lot of the problem comes down to a lack of
familiarity with each other, and a resulting lack of trust.
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Bob Whitfield is in his seventh NFL year, and right
guard Gene Williams is in his eighth. But left guard Calvin Collins
is a second-year player who was at center last year. Tobeck was at
left guard, and right tackle Ephraim Salaam is a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are blitzing the Falcons like mad because they see that
Atlanta is having problems picking them up.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, the Saints came up with one Atlanta had not seen,
and quarterback Chris Chandler might not play Sunday against the
Jets (3-3) because of it. When New Orleans linebacker Mark Fields
slammed him to the turf on a sack, injuries to the quarterback's
shoulder forced him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy was asking me last week, `Don't you just block the guy
that's over you? But that's not always the case,'' said center
Robbie Tobeck. ``Sometimes teams overload one side, and you have to
slide over.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Saints) criss-crossed all three linebackers, and I should
have kept sliding out (and trusted someone else to pick up the
first blitzer), but instead I picked up the first guy, who wasn't
my man. I should have gone for the second (Fields). The coaches
want us to stay with assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Bob Christian, a key in blitz pickup, said, ``when you
have three guys trying to switch (assignments), they're going to
get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Saints, the Jets run a vast variety of blitzes,
although they have just 11 sacks, tied for next-to-last in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, meanwhile, is running like never before. The line is
blocking better in the run game than in two years, Christian is
picking off stragglers, and Anderson is running quicker to the
hole, and hard as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest improvement seems to be communication,'' said
Anderson. ``When a play doesn't work, we're talking immediately
about what we can we do to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rhythm you get into. You just hit (the hole) and
believe in it. I have a lot of confidence in the guys ... and that
Bobby's going to take care of whoever is (unblocked).

 &HT;    Flood waters rage through Victoria
 &HT;    By Chuck Lindell and Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With the Guadalupe River spreading into a flood
six miles wide in spots, emergency crews in Victoria used
helicopters, airboats and a small armada of rowboats to rescue
stranded residents Wednesday, navigating by the tops of street
signs through the record-high water.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was less intense but no less worrisome in Wharton,
where the Colorado River had already flooded 300 homes by Wednesday
afternoon _ and the flood isn't expected to crest until this
evening.
</P>
<P>
   While coastal cities scrambled to cope, upstream counties began
totaling the damage from weekend storms that killed 22 and left
five still missing. The preliminary estimate: $400 million, a
figure that will rise as the floodwaters ebb.
</P>
<P>
   The damage prompted President Clinton to declare 20 South and
Central Texas counties disaster areas, offering federal aid to
supplement local recovery efforts. Additional counties may be added
as damage surveys continue, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster decree was the fourth in Texas since May, a state
record. Two were presidential decrees for Tropical Storms Charley
and Frances, and one was an emergency decree for the summer drought
and wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an incredible year, and it's not over yet,'' said
Jack Colley, assistant state emergency coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the sun is expected to return today, pushing
through the persistent clouds and lifting temperatures into the low
70s. That will be welcome news to the thousands of flood victims
who picked through soggy, mud-caked possessions Wednesday with
temperatures in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The nights will be on the chilly side, dipping into the 40s
tonight and Friday night. The next chance of rain appears to be
Sunday or Monday _ ``but it doesn't look like heavy rain,'' said
Bob Rose, meteorologist for the Lower Colorado River Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime in Caldwell County, the search continued for Devin
McCoy, the 6-year-old swept into Brushy Creek near Uhland on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Devin's mother had tried to cross the creek when her Suburban
was carried downstream. She and another child survived. On Tuesday,
divers found the Suburban in 27 feet of water and recovered the
body of Heather Cottle, 11, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   A search dog was taken along a small lake downstream of where
the Suburban was found. A game warden and a Caldwell County
sheriff's deputy also searched the lake by boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much going to be the routine,'' said Caldwell
County Sheriff Mike Bading. ``We'll go out every day to check. I
assume that in the days to come we will fly the area also.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officers from Bexar and Atascosa counties resumed
searching today for a family of four missing since Saturday.
Richard Hartman, his mother, daughter-in-law and 2-year-old
granddaughter had attended a wedding in eastern Bexar County but
did not return to their suburban San Antonio home.
</P>
<P>
   In hard-hit Victoria 120 miles south of Austin, an overnight
curfew was in effect as emergency workers estimated that one-third
of the city remained underwater. Electricity was slowly being
restored as water receded from the power plant, but gas service
remained out at more than 500 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's water rescues included parents with a 5-month-old
baby and two workers at the Texas Zoo who had to be removed through
a hole in a zoo building roof. The fate of the animals was not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the folks were neck-deep in water by the time help
reached them,'' said one dispatch to the State Emergency Management
Center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, the rescues were mostly over and the
floodwaters had begun to recede. Three shelters remained open and
two National Guard helicopters were ferrying supplies into flooded
areas.
</P>
<P>
   South of Victoria, a DuPont chemical plant near Bloomington was
the scene of ``a made-for-movie drama,'' Colley said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 6:30 a.m., workers began scrambling to move several
chemical-filled barges from a canal before rising water prevented
them from floating under the Texas 35bridge. Left unattended,
officials said, the huge barges could have become battering rams in
the swirling waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got them out _ just in time,'' Colley said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical plant was quickly shut down, as were three others
father downstream, Colley said. State environmental officials
remained to watch for leaks or other problems, but none were
reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wharton, 120 miles southeast of Austin, more than 60,000
sandbags and 15 military trucks were deployed by midday. Evacuation
sites were moved 12 miles away to El Campo after officials realized
that potential shelters would be flooded. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was
instituted in evacuated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to inundate probably 40 percent of the city of
Wharton,'' said Wharton County Judge Lawrence E. Naiser. ``It's
just coming up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the flooding will be six to 12 inches deep in homes,
Naiser said. The LCRA predicts the crest could persist through the
weekend in the flatlands around Wharton, the last city expected to
flood before the Colorado River empties its floodwater into the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's federal disaster declaration will provide grants for
temporary housing, home and business repairs and other expenses.
The counties listed were Bastrop, Bexar, Burleson, Caldwell,
Calhoun, Colorado, Comal, DeWitt, Fayette, Goliad, Gonzales,
Guadalupe, Hays, Jackson, Karnes, Refugio, Travis, Victoria,
Wharton and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   With disaster relief offices already open in Houston and Del Rio
to aid victims of earlier storms, state officials said they plan to
open a new disaster field office in San Antonio _ where they will
probably consolidate operations from the other two offices. From
the San Antonio office, federal and state agencies will operate
recovery centers in the hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms reopened Wednesday in Comal County, one of the
hardest-hit areas of Central Texas, with counselors available for
students and teachers. School officials were anxious to help
students regain a sense of normalcy, said Don Clark, school
district spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nurses. It's a warm building. We have warm food _ some
of these kids haven't had a decent meal for days,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuero, where the Guadalupe River crested Tuesday 30 feet
above flood stage, hundreds of homes and two-thirds of the town
remained underwater Wednesday. At least 1,600 people were in area
shelters and power was out in many locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the (homes) that were flooded pretty much lost
everything they owned,'' said Nancy O'Neal, an emergency center
volunteer. ``Everybody is anxious to see what the damage is.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 33 shelters remained open Wednesday night, housing
2,200 people, American Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental clean-up crews were picking up spilled limestone
and lime products where three Longhorn Railway cars derailed
Tuesday evening in a tributary of Boggy Creek in far East Austin.
Floods washed out some railroad pilings on a bridge, causing the
derailment on the Austin-Northwestern Railroad line, said Don
Cheatham, owner of Longhorn Railway.
</P>
<P>
   If uncontained, the spill's high alkaline content could
contribute to a major fish kill. Capital Metro, which owns the
railroad line, has hired an environmental company to contain the
spill.
</P>
<P>
   In San Marcos, which received 22 1/2 inches of rain since
Saturday, flood victims were told to register for assistance in
person at the San Marcos Activity Center, 501 E. Hopkins. Cleanup
kits with shovels, sponges and water vacuums are also available. At
least 70 homes received at least a foot of water, while 706 homes
had 2 or more inches, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bastrop County raised its damage estimates to 160 homes
destroyed and 240 damaged. Preliminary damage is estimated at $3.5
million, said County Judge Peggy Walicek.
</P>

 &HT;    Spector held back by party label
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ November's ballot lists eight candidates for the
Texas Supreme Court, but the Rose Spector-Harriet O'Neill race may
tell the story of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from their campaign contributors, both enjoy wide
respect as judges from lawyers pushing and pulling over how much _
and how _ lawsuits should be restricted in Texas. But regardless of
her qualifications or experience or respect, Spector's party label
alone _ Democrat _ may end her judicial career.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas _ one of only a handful of states that select Supreme
Court justices by partisan election _ the emerging Republican era
forecasts a singular political mindset for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texas voters don't know much about judicial races, and they
respond to that uncertainty by voting Republican on statewide
judicial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If voters hit an unfamiliar name, they'll lean Republican,''
says political science professor Anthony Champagne of the
University of Texas at Dallas, who studies Texas judicial politics.
``Even though they may call themselves independent voters, they
have voted Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Spector's upset of an incumbent six years
ago, then a San Antonio trial judge backed by personal-injury and
consumer lawyers, every race but one for the court this decade has
ended in a Republican victory. Republicans hold a 7-2 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Raul Gonzalez's retirement at the end of the year would
leave Spector the only Democrat among judges who, ironically,
grapple with legal questions based on complex judicial philosophies
that usually defy partisan considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some friends of mine told me the 'D' behind my name is sort of
like putting a target on it,'' Spector says about her ballot
listing. ``But I'm cautiously optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not flush with campaign money _ O'Neill has a 2-to-1
fund-raising advantage _ Spector drives herself across Texas for
campaign appearances in her 1994 Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, 40, says the race frames philosophical differences
between her and Spector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I would define the differences in our judicial
philosophy that I am a judicial conservative,'' O'Neill says.
</P>
<P>
   That means strictly interpreting state statutes according to the
Legislature's intentions and resisting by court-made common law the
creation of new possibilities for lawsuits. Spector's philosophy
shows inconsistency, she says.
</P>
<P>
   She offers no examples. In constrained judicial campaigning,
candidates don't detail why they fault an opponent's record. That
might venture into telling voters how they would decide a case _
and that's unethical.
</P>
<P>
   So O'Neill and Spector campaign by meeting with lawyers,
newspapers editors, anyone they can. They tout their experience and
call themselves judicial conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall,'' Champagne says, ``how many candidates in
recent years have identified themselves as 'judicial conservatives
with proven records.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But this year, with the exception of Spector, the Democrats
running for the court contend the court has been anything but
conservative. They say judicial conservatism means ensuring
consistency in the law by deciding cases according to legal
precedent. These Democrats _ state district Judge Mike Westergren
of Corpus Christi; Austin civil lawyer David Van Os, a onetime
labor union attorney; and Killeen lawyer Jerry Scarbrough , a
former gas station owner who attended Baylor Law School while he
served as Bell County justice of the peace _ argue that the court
has instead changed personal injury and consumer protection law in
ways that benefit business and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully funny to me that they come down 8-to-1 or
9-to-nothing time and again and usually on the side of the
defendant,'' says Scarbrough, who is challenging Justice Deborah
Hankinson, the latest of Gov. George W. Bush's three appointments
to the court. ``Law that comes out of a one-sided court is not very
good law and can't stand the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   To see the debate over judicial philosophy and judicial politics
in real terms, consider last year's Supreme Court decision in
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Havner. The court overturned a
jury's $3.7 million verdict for a girl born without fingers on one
hand and left her with nothing. Her lawyers had contended a
morning-sickness drug her mother took during pregnancy caused the
birth defect.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Priscilla Owen held for the unanimous court _ Spector
included _ that Texas' method for evaluating a scientific expert's
testimony needed to be changed. Then the court decided on its own
that scientific evidence in the Havner case could not support the
birth-defect claim.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's attorney, Robert Hilliard of Corpus Christi, said
justice and fairness should have allowed him to retry the case
according to the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept under our system that they are free as political
judges to change the law,'' Hilliard says. What angered him, he
says, is ``that they changed (the law) and didn't allow me to meet
the new burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge who presided over the Havner case, Westergren,
criticizes the court for being too ready to ignore juries in too
many cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court has had a total disregard for jury verdicts,''
Westergren says. ``I want restoration of a true balance without an
agenda, either plaintiffs' or defendants'.''
</P>
<P>
   Westergren, who ran once before for the Supreme Court,
emphasizes that the Havner case had no bearing on his decision to
run against Justice Craig Enoch this year. For his part, Enoch says
the Havner opinion's reasoning speaks for itself. His philosophy as
a judge _ judicial conservatism and restraint _ has not changed
since his election to the court in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond each of the Supreme Court races this year are money
questions adding a new dimension to these traditionally staid
campaigns: How much to spend to get name recognition? How much in
contributions comes from lawyers and litigants with cases before
the court?
</P>
<P>
   How much will an impending ``60 Minutes'' report on these how
much questions affect the election?
</P>
<P>
   Of the Democrats, Spector has raised the most money _ close to
$500,000, maybe enough for a small broadcast ad campaign _ but even
she trails far behind O'Neill's $840,000. Westergren, Scarbrough
and Van Os count their money in the thousands of dollars, not
hundreds of thousands or millions.
</P>
<P>
   Van Os has collected just over $100,000 through the latest
reporting period. Scarbrough listed less than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have enough to do anything to get out a statewide
campaign,'' says Champagne, counting Spector among them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Van Os' and Westergren's money has come in relatively
small amounts, the larger amounts from smaller law firms or perhaps
labor committees.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, their opponents _ Justices Greg Abbott and Enoch _
both listed contributions through Sept. 24 totaling more than $1
million, much of it from large defense-oriented law firms or
political committees representing corporate, medical and insurance
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same contributors gave to Hankinson, Spector and
O'Neill, although in smaller amounts. Spector and O'Neill also got
several larger contributions from personal-injury and consumer
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Special-interest money is no stranger to Supreme Court
campaigns. But this year's differs from the past by sometimes loud
barking from two so-called watchdog organizations tied up outside
the court. One _ Court Watch, a spinoff of a consumer-activist
group _ contends from counting winners instead of analyzing
opinions that the court favors business defendants instead of
consumers. The other _ Texans for Public Justice _ tracks the
business, legal and political interests behind the court's campaign
contributions and raises conflict-of-interest questions because of
millions given from lawyers and even litigants with cases on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne, for one, doubts the noise will have any bearing on
the outcomes. Even the anxiously awaited follow-up ``60 Minutes''
report on the court's campaign contributions should have no effect,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing investigation in 1987, the CBS news program found
contributors actively lobbying justices for decisions from what was
then a decidedly pro-plaintiff court. One fearful scenario has ``60
Minutes'' broadcasting its newest story days before the election,
sending the court's Republican justices searching for work just as
Democrats did after the first report 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne dismisses the ``60 Minutes'' report and its doomsday
prospect for incumbent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's grossly overestimated,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But few, if any, of this year's court candidates applaud the
high-stakes campaigning or the time spent raising the money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill wonders why the Legislature won't adopt nonpartisan
election for judges, or set a judicial election date apart from the
cram-it-all-in general election for all statewide offices, or
eliminate straight-ticket voting for judges.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Spector says she's often asked, why take campaign
contributions at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer, unfortunately, is I want to be re-elected.''

 &HT;    Slow fade: Ex-champ Barkley to fight at Roxy
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He won a world middleweight championship 10 years ago
over Thomas Hearns and has headlined shows in Las Vegas, Atlantic
City and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 38, several years and 65 pounds past his prime, Iran
Barkley has arrived where many former marquee boxers seem headed:
Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, having ballooned to a heavyweight in hopes of some day
landing a title shot _ or at least a significant pay day _
headlines tonight's card at the Roxy. Two months ago, Tyrell Biggs
was the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who will fight an obscurity named Caseny(cq) Truesdale,
knows he is a long way from neon and might never make it back. In
recent months, he has fought in North Carolina, Missouri, Illinois,
North Dakota, Virginia, Iowa and Oklahoma. He estimates that 225
pounds hang on his 6-foot-1 frame and admits he was as high as 236
for a recent win over Marcello Aravena. When Barkley knocked out
Hearns in 1988, he weighed 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm barnstorming,'' Barkley said with a chuckle. ``I have to
be realistic about this. I've got to fight often and stay active
and take whatever comes my way. I'm not getting offers from (major
promoters). If my situation calls for me to fight in Iowa or the
Roxy, I'll be there. I don't mean to say anything detrimental about
those places, but it's not Caesars Palace.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley makes no secret as to why he still is fighting: ``Money.
People can say what they want, but no athlete fights for any reason
other than money.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Every day puts me one day closer to retirement.'' But
first, he would like to get a shot at Herbie Hide, who owns the
lesser WBO belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can win that,'' Barkley said, ``then come back here to
Atlanta and knock on that guy's door _ you know, the one who has
two other belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Evander Holyfield to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield update
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides of negotiations for the Holyfield-Lennox
Lewis fight continue to say that even though there are unresolved
issues, none can be classified as deal-breakers and that the
contracts for the title unification bout should be completed by
early next week. ``There's nothing unusual about this; it's a
complex deal,'' said Milt Chwasky, one of Lewis' attorneys.
Promoter Don King has four different sets of contracts _ with
Holyfield, Lewis, Time Warner and Lewis' promoters, whom King is
buying out for this fight. All issues revolve around money, such as
liability if pay-per-view flops and King's desire to have options
on Lewis if he wins. Lewis promoter Dino Duva says the contract
that King sent him is not the same one that had been agreed to
verbally. There's been in no hurry to complete the agreement during
the World Series, particularly with the Yankees playing. Coverage
in New York newspapers can be key to a promotion's success.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in South Africa, meanwhile, have expressed interest in
hosting the Holyfield-Lewis fight, but commercial demands dictate
the bout likely will be held in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line
</P>
<P>
   Although the Holyfield-Vaughn Bean fight at the Georgia Dome
drew an announced crowd of 41,357 for a ticket value of $3.539
million, the Dome box office recorded sales of 29,286, for a gate
of $2.419 million. King's office confirmed that of the remaining
12,071 tickets, with a value of $1.12 million, King and Holyfield
bought 9,000 to distribute to Atlanta-area youth groups. The rest
were assorted complimentary seats, advertising tradeouts and the
like. The Georgia general treasury took in $203,392 _ $159,000 in
sales tax and $44,392 generated by the Georgia Boxing Commission's
2 percent take of the live gate, pretax. The Georgia Dome received
a flat fee rent of $125,000. ... Roy Jones Jr. has resumed his
pursuit of Holyfield. The problem is that only one guy thinks it
would be a great fight. ... The IBF is arranging a boxoff among
four top-10 contenders _ Frans Botha vs. John Ruiz and Hasim Rahman
vs. David Tua, then winner vs. winner _ to determine an eventual
mandatory challenge to the IBF champion, currently Holyfield. ...
Former Tyson co-manager John Horne is suing new Tyson adviser
Shelly Finkel, seeking 10 percent of the fighter's next five
purses.

 &HT;    Clemson to clash with Duke
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON at Duke, Saturday, 1:30 p.m
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since coming under fire several weeks ago,
head coach Tommy West defended himself this week. Saturday's 48-0
loss at Florida State was the worst at Clemson for West, whose
30-25 record makes him third in winning percentage among active ACC
coaches. ``I kind of take offense that there's not been anything
accomplished in the overall program.'' ... TB Travis Zachery, who
got in one play in the second half at FSU after suffering an arm
injury, is questionable. ... LB O.J. Childress and DB DoMarco Fox
also might not play, after both sustained sprained knees. ...
Clemson, which had just 119 yards total offense against FSU,
couldn't put any points on the board even late in the game after
recovering a fumble on the Seminoles' 11 yard-line.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. Clemson, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fred Goldsmith has decided to start backup quarterback
Bobby Campbell instead of Spencer Romine in Saturday's game.
Campbell has completed 36-of 62 passes for 369 yards and two TDs in
his last two games. ``We've got to find a way to get some points,''
Goldsmith said. ``Bobby Campbell has always had a strong arm, but
he's had a history of throwing the ball to the wrong-colored
jersey.''... Sims Lenhardt's field goal against N.C. State last
week tied him with Doug Peterson for first on Duke's career list
with 37. ... Running back B.J. Hill leads all ACC freshmen, and is
sixth overall in the ACC, in rushing with 411 yards. ... Richmond
Flowers is third in the ACC in receiving (42-615) and is fifth in
the ACC in all-purpose yardage (130.0)
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE at Georgia Tech, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden had nothing but praise for the Georgia Tech
offensive unit that his team will face Saturday. ``I'm amazed at
how good Tech is, and that comes with another year of experience,''
he said. ``We're going to really face it again this week.''... Even
though tailback Travis Minor will be able to play, the Seminoles
will start Jeff Chaney against the Jackets. ... FSU has committed
only five turnovers in the last five games after opening the season
with nine in the first two games. ... The Noles have passed for
more than 200 yards in 10 consecutive games and 22 of the last 24.
Wideout Peter Warrick is seventh on FSU's all-time receiving
yardage list with 2,124 yards. ...Place-kicker Sebastian Janikowski
leads the nation in field goals per game (2.29).
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND vs. Georgia Tech, Oct. 31
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins threw away a chance to tie the game with 5:38
remaining Saturday when true freshman QB Randall Jones tossed an
interception into Wake Forest's triple coverage. The Deacons took a
20-10 win, spoiling the Terps' homecoming. ... Despite his miscues
_ which also included a bad option pitch recovered by Wake _ Jones
remains Maryland's starter. The offense is producing yards _ it
outgained Wake 334 yards to 293 _ but its relative inexperience has
been telling. ... FS Tony Jackson (sprained knee) may be ready for
the Georgia Tech game. ... The homecoming crowd at Byrd Stadium was
just 23,419, not even twice the attendance the night before at Cole
Field House where a Midnight Madness record of 12,317 watched the
start of basketball practice.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at Wake Forest, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carl Torbush suspended starting quarterback Oscar
Davenport for Saturday's game for breaking team rules and will
start freshman Ronald Curry against the Deacons. Curry has been
favoring a shoulder injury he received against Clemson on Oct. 3.
``He wasn't full speed early last week, but he is now,'' Torbush
said. ``We've challenged our offense. We don't want to put him
(Curry) in the situation that he feels he is our whole offense. We
need the rest of our offense to help him out.'' ... Defensive end
Ebenezer Ekuban has had four tackles for losses in each of the last
two games. After recording only six sacks through the first three
games, UNC has 11 in the past two games and opponents have
converted only four of their last 28 third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE at Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Long snapper Grant Dorn has been replaced by freshman Brian
Jamison, but head coach Mike O'Cain did not indicate that it was a
permanent move. Dorn, who snapped a ball over the head of punter
Jesse Wade, leading to a Georgia Tech TD, did the same thing
against Duke last week. The Wolfpack hung on for a 27-24 victory.
... After playing five of its first six games at home, State hits
the road for three of its last five. O'Cain's teams are just 10-16
playing away from home and have lost four in a row. ... The worst
of those losses was a 62-14 decision to Virginia in 1996 when QB
Jamie Barnette made his first career start. ... N.C. State's
defense has dropped to 8th in the ACC in yards per game (366.5) and
points (26.5) and is last against the run (198.7).
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA vs. N.C. State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly one of the most underrated players in the ACC is
tailback Thomas Jones, who became only the third player in ACC
history to post back-to-back 200-yard rushing games. He ran for 203
yards against San Jose State and 207 versus Georgia Tech...
Saturday, it'll be Jones against N.C. State's Tory Holt. Jones
leads the ACC and is 15th nationally in rushing (123.8). ``Rushing
for 100 yards is hard to come by these days, and 200 yards is
exceptional,'' UVA coach George Welsh said. ... Welsh says there's
much more to N. C. State than Holt. ``(Quarterback Jamie) Barnette
is the key,'' he said. ``He's very much like Joe Hamilton at Tech,
with some option and some drop-back passing. We've always had
trouble stopping N.C. State.''
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST vs. N. Carolina, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   With its linebacker corps sitting on the sidelines with
injuries, Wake Forest must figure out a way to stop North Carolina
QB Ronald Curry. ``We have to patch our team together once again,''
coach Jim Caldwell said. ``We just have to improve our pass rush,
particularly getting to the quarterback. ... With eight catches for
112 yards and two TDs against Maryland last week, senior wideout
Desmond Clark became the ACC's all-time leading receiver with 200
career receptions. Clark also is sixth on the ACC career
receiving-yardage list with 2,530 yards, has caught three or more
passes in 30 straight games and is tied for sixth in ACC history
with 10 100-yard receiving games. ... Senior QB Brian Kuklick has
passed for 200 yards or more in 14 of his last 17 games.

A QUIET DAY IN N.Y. GOVERNOR'S RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With less than two weeks until the election, Gov. George Pataki
and his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, both kept their
campaigning low-key Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's sole campaign event was an appearance on the ``Rambling
With Gambling'' morning radio show on WOR-AM in Manhattan, where he
touted the achievements of his first four years in office, but said
he needed four more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything still needs fixing here,'' Pataki said, adding that
the day you're satisfied ``is the day you should hand the job over
to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed his support for keeping the Yankees in the
Bronx, saying that the state could pay for a Metro-North station at
Yankee Stadium as well as highway improvements. But he said he had
not had ``head-to-head discussions'' with George M. Steinbrenner
III, the team's principal owner, in at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone had a slightly busier day, consisting of two stops at
senior centers in Yonkers and an evening speech to a Brooklyn
Democratic club. He spent the morning making fund-raising calls,
and the afternoon in meetings with newspaper editorial boards.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coyne Park Senior Citizens Center in Yonkers, Vallone
greeted a few tables of elderly, but energetic, poker players, and
then spoke briefly to the group of 40. He called for more nutrition
centers _ senior centers that provide lunch _ in the state, and
reiterated his call for a state-run health care plan, which he said
would greatly reduce if not eliminate the role of for-profit
insurance companies in favor of universal coverage by the state.
</P>
<P>
   That issue seemed to resonate with the elderly at the center,
who disparaged health maintenance organizations. ``I like the idea
of his medical plan, that they're not going to take away
benefits,'' said Adeline Balzo, 72, of Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone conceded on Wednesday that a gubernatorial debate with
Pataki seemed increasingly unlikely. Vallone has repeatedly said
that he will debate the governor under any conditions; Pataki, in
turn, has said that the campaigns are negotiating about debates.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone scoffed at that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says negotiation is going on,'' Vallone said. ``I think
it's negotiation between himself and his own staff. There's nothing
to negotiate. Just pick the time and place and we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate
for governor, held a news conference on Wednesday outside Buffalo
Bills Stadium, where he attacked the state's financial package for
the stadium, saying it would not guarantee the Bills' presence in
Buffalo beyond a year.

 &HT;    FSU's strength is defense
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you think of Florida State, you think Bobby
Bowden, high-octane offense, trick plays and all that jazz. Over
the past 11 years, no high-profile program has lit up the
scoreboard as much.
</P>
<P>
   But in his private moments, Bowden will tell you the real reason
Florida State has finished in the top four 11 seasons in a row has
nothing to do with offense. Florida State's unprecedented string of
10 or more wins every season over that span began not long after
Bowden hired Mickey Andrews as defensive coordinator. It is not a
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '80s, Bowden learned what Florida's Steve Spurrier
would learn in the '90s. All that sizzle on offense is fun and
might sell a bunch of tickets, but you're not going to win a
championship _ any championship _ without a nationally ranked
defense.
</P>
<P>
   In steps, Andrews, who played for Bear Bryant at Alabama,
learned his trade at a number of stops, including North Alabama,
Clemson, Florida and the Arizona Wranglers of the USFL. Andrews was
getting his taste of professional football when Bowden persuaded
him to come to Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best at what he does,'' Bowden said. ``All I do is
just get out of the way and let him coach. I don't stick my nose
into the defensive huddle much any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden also promised Andrews that he would get his fair share of
the great athletes that came to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we've been successful is we've had great players
here,'' Andrews said. ``You can scheme all day long and put them in
the right place to make the play. But they don't have the ability,
you're going to get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews' standing in college football was ratified two years
ago. The Frank Broyles Award goes to the best assistant coach in
the nation. The first one went to Mickey Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   It was Andrews' defense that kept Florida State together when
the offense was bent on self-destruction earlier this season. And
with Georgia Tech averaging 39.8 points, defense again will be the
key for the Seminoles in Saturday's game. The Seminoles, despite
some injuries at linebacker, lead the nation in total defense
(214.1 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking
</P>
<P>
   Orange Bowl site still uncertain
</P>
<P>
   _ Discussions continue between the Bowl Championship Series and
the Orange Bowl over the site of this year's game, set for Jan. 2.
It was originally scheduled for Pro Player Stadium, located north
of Miami, but the NFL playoffs pose a potential conflict. The bowl
series is hoping for an agreement that the NFL will not schedule a
game at Pro Player on that date, if the Dolphins make the playoffs.
If the NFL will not give that assurance, the game could be moved
back to the old Orange Bowl, which could cause some problems. SEC
Commissioner Roy Kramer, the coordinator of the Bowl Championship
Series, hopes to have some kind of resolution by Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last time Auburn was 1-5 (1952), the Tigers went on to
finish with a 2-8 record in coach Shug Jordan's second season. A
guy named Vince Dooley was the quarterback. The next year Auburn
was 7-3-1 and went to the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think Notre Dame is looking forward to the next four weeks?
The next four games for the Irish are against Army, Baylor, Boston
College and Navy. Notre Dame's record against those four schools is
104-19-5. Then, it's struggling LSU and underachieving Southern
California to finish out the season. If you're an Irish fan, it
would be smart to book a hotel room in Pasadena right now.
</P>
<P>
   _ This time of year there are a lot of hot coaching rumors, but
here's my favorite: Lou Holtz to Oklahoma to replace John Blake.
The Sooners have fallen on hard times and are averaging about
20,000 empty seats per home game. The athletic department is
drowning in a sea of debt. Holtz is just crazy enough _ and that's
meant as a compliment _ to think he could turn that place around.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Franklin honored by Ole Miss
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN's Ron Franklin will team with Mike Gottfried and Adrian
Karsten to broadcast Saturday night's game between Georgia Tech and
Florida State at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Franklin will not arrive in
Atlanta until Saturday morning because Friday night he will be
inducted into the Ole Miss Hall of Fame. Congratulations to one of
the really good guys in the business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the wife of Temple coach Bobby Wallace benefited
fromSaturday's stunning 28-24 upset of Virginia Tech. She received
three dozen roses from entertainer Bill Cosby, Temple's most famous
alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   _ The SEC is in the process of completing a deal to place one of
its teams in the Independence Bowl. The deal is expected to be for
three years and would pit the SEC against a team from the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   _ This from Ohio State's Rob Murphy, who takes the term
``offensive'' lineman literally: ``I'm a dirty player. That's the
attitude you have to have. You do what you have to do to survive.
Sometimes it's breaking those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers
</P>
<P>
   375 _ The number of career games coached by Florida State's
Bobby Bowden, second only to Penn State's Joe Paterno (384) among
active coaches. Bowden's won 287 of them.
</P>
<P>
   .723 _ Passing percentage of Central Florida quarterback Daunte
Culpepper, which leads Division I.
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Number of turnovers committed by Florida State in its last
five games, after turning the ball over nine times in the first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   42.8 _ Average number of points scored by Georgia Tech in its
five-game winning streak.

 &HT;    Alabama takes on Tennessee Saturday

   ALABAMA at Tennessee, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has practiced with loud speakers blaring to simulate
crowd noise in an effort to prepare quarterback Andrew Zow for
Saturday night's game at Tennessee. ...Coach Mike DuBose said the
Crimson Tide's best hope against the No. 3 Volunteers is to control
the ball and keep Tennessee's offense off the field. ``If we have
to play 80-plus snaps defensively it's going to be a long afternoon
for us,'' he said. ...Coaches are looking at several players to
replace free safety Kevin Sigler, who is out for the season after
tearing a knee ligament against East Carolina. Sigler underwent
surgery on Monday to repair a torn lateral collateral ligament in
his right knee. Sophomore Tony Dixon will move from strong safety
to free safety and Marcus Spencer will play strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS at Auburn, Oct. 31
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks, who moved to 6-0 after a comeback 41-28 win at
South Carolina, are ranked No. 12 this week by USA Today/ESPN and
15th by the AP and are one of the last eight undefeated teams in
Division I-A. ...Coach Houston Nutt became the first Arkansas coach
to go 6-0 in his first season. His boss and mentor, Frank Broyles,
started out 0-6. ...Arkansas' touted run defense gave up a
season-high 131 yards rushing and 28 points to South Carolina,
which led 21-10 at the half only to surrender 24 unanswered points
in the third quarter. ...After hearing ESPN's Lee Corso predict a
South Carolina upset, DB Zac Painter couldn't wait to issue a
post-game retort: ``Make sure you write this,'' he told the
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. ``Lee Corso's no rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN vs. La. Tech, Saturday, 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1-5 record, the defense is second in the SEC, allowing
just 266.5 yards a game. ...Auburn has held five of six opponents
under 200 yards passing. That's important with Louisiana Tech (4-4)
up next. The Bulldogs lead the nation in total offense (593.63 ypg)
and passing offense (434.4 ppg) and, are eighth in scoring offense
(40.1 ppg). Quarterback Tim Rattay has thrown for 3,303 yards and
30 touchdowns. ...Placekicker Robert Bironas has made all six of
his field goal attempts. Three of the kicks have been from 40 yards
or more. ...Wide receiver Karsten Bailey has caught at least one
pass in 23 consecutive games. ...Auburn has won 20 of 21
non-conference regular-season games dating to 1991. The only loss
was to Virginia this season.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA vs. Georgia, Oct. 31
</P>
<P>
   The Gators desperately needed this week off. Florida had a total
of 17 players out with injuries or suspensions for the Auburn game.
...Five of Florida's seven opponents have been held to less than 10
points, the lone exceptions being Tennessee (20) and Kentucky (35).
...Quarterback Chris Stephens, son of line coach Jimmy Ray
Stephens, has given a verbal commitment to Florida. Stephens is
considered the top quarterback prospect in Florida. They also have
a commitment from quarterback Rex Grossman of Bloomington, Ind.
...Free safety Teako Brown needs one interception to move into tie
for first place on the school's career list. Brown, who has 14
career picks, has an interception in four of the five games he has
played.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY vs. Georgia, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The unconventional atmosphere at Kentucky has given Jeff Zurcher
a seemingly unlikely chance to shine. The starting free safety, who
joined the lineup when Willie Gary suffered a season-ending knee
injury against Florida, notched a career-high 12 tackles at LSU on
Saturday, all unassisted, and sacked Herb Tylerin the second half.
He had 11 stops against Arkansas. Zurcher, once a Rhodes Scholar
candidate who already has earned a degree in English, transferred
in 1996 after playing on an NAIA Division II national basketball
championship team at Bethel College (Ind.). ...The win didn't help
the Wildcats crack the rankings, but they are receiving votes in
both polls. ... The Wildcats are last nationally (112th), averaging
2.4 yards a punt return.
</P>
<P>
   LSU vs. Miss. State, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive losses to Georgia, Florida and Kentucky, LSU
is glad to be playing a running team Mississippi State. ``It should
help us get together and maybe calm the defense down,'' defensive
end Jarvis Green said. ``It will be like starting over, to be
honest.'' LSU gave up an average of 347 yards passing in those
loses. ...LSU's game next week at Mississippi will not be
ontelevision. It will start at 2 p.m., and be shown on Tigervision,
LSU's closed-circuit broadcast. ...LSU's offensive line remains
banged up, not good news against blitz-happy Mississippi State.
Center Todd McClure has missed practice this week recovering from a
staph infection on his right shin. McClure did not play against
Kentucky. . . . Linebacker Jamal Hill has a groin injury but is
expected to play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI vs. Ark. State, Saturday, 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tommy Tuberville used the off week to do a serious
evaluation of his team. Overall, he gave the Rebels a C-plus for
their 4-2 record. Tuberville remains disappointed that his team let
the game against Alabama slip away. The Rebels lost to the Crimson
Tide 20-17 in overtime on Oct. 10. ``It was a game that we were in
position to win and didn't, so I marked us down for that,'' he
said. ``Our offense has gotten better each week, but defensively, I
think we've slipped.'' ...Opposing defenses have really been
concentrating on tight end Rufus French (17 catches, 213 yards). As
a result receivers Grant Heard (26, 352) and Grant Peterson (25,
337) are getting more opportunities. ... French, linebacker Armegis
Spearman and center Matt Luke returned to practice.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE at LSU, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs can do something that's never been done in the
school's history Saturday _ if they win at LSU, they go 4-0 in the
SEC. But given last year's collapse after a 7-2 start _ they
finished 7-4 and did not go to a bowl _ State isn't putting a lot
of stock in such superlatives. ...Still, they need a victory
Saturday to remain in the race in the SEC West. ``I hope we get in
that position in our last two games,'' coach Jackie Sherrill said.
...The Bulldogs have won four of their last six road games ...The
pass defense, giving up an average of 82.1 yards a game, is second
in Division I-A, trailing only Ohio State (77.6). ...Inconsistent
QB Wayne Madkin bounced back with a 194-yard, three-TD performance
against East Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA at Vanderbilt, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Brad Scott concedes that his team (1-6) needs any kind of
win it can get, after six consecutive losses. That why he's trying
to keep the Gamecocks focused, even though Vanderbilt is 0-6.
``We're two teams that need a win, no question about that,'' Scott
said. ``Our team is in a position now that we need to win a game,
no matter who it is against.'' After facing the Commodores, the
Gamecocks end the season with three difficult games _ the annual
``Orange Crush'' _ at home against Tennessee, at Florida and at
Clemson. ...Scott has asked his team to ignore speculation about
his job security. Many of those media reports insist that Scott
will be given another year. ...Kickoff for the Oct. 31 South
Carolina-Tennessee game has been moved to 12:30 p.m. It will be
televised by Jefferson-Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE vs. Alabama, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Back up TE Antron Peebles had surgery on his right wrist and is
out for the season. Peebles thinks that he hurt the wrist in the
opener against Syracuse and tried to play through the pain.
...Tackle Jarvis Reado continues to improve from a broken right
foot. Coach Phillip Fulmer said Reado remains questionable but
might be available for Saturday's game with Alabama. ...LB Al
Wilson will have no contact in practice the rest of the season, as
he continues to heal from a shoulder injury suffered against
Houston on Sept. 26. ...With Tennessee No. 3 in the AP poll, Fulmer
was asked on a recent call-in show if he would run up the score in
order to impress the pollsters. ``I'm not going to run it up and
get it into the 70s,'' he said, ``but we're conscientious of what
we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT vs. S. Carolina, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores have their two best chances to avoid their first
winless season starting against South Carolina, which is 1-6 and
0-5. However, they are 0-7 against the Gamecocks. Vandy then hosts
Duke the next weekend. ...For the third time this season, Vandy
will go to a new QB. Redshirt freshman Greg Zolman, who played well
in relief at Georgia, will start over Dave Wallace. Zolman was
13-for-21 and 162 yards and threw for a touchdown, prompting coach
Woody Widenhofer to say he ``played better than I thought he
would.'' ...Vandy had 380 yards against Georgia, but the defense,
young and riddled with injuries, is giving up 30.2 points a game.
The Commodores have been outscored 135-19 in SEC games.

 &HT;    Crankbaits drawing fish with fall in the air
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As leaves change color and the seagulls return to the
lake for the winter, striper fever is beginning to set in, with
top-water crankbaits getting plenty of action early and late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Long A Bombers and other topwater lures such as Zara Spooks,
poppers and chuggers cast toward shore and retrieved slowly are
attracting more attention from stripers, which are chasing shad
toward the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Guide Don Roberson and client Dendy Harmon hooked into several
Monday on Lake Lanier. ``He had a backache before we started,''
Roberson said of Harmon. ``The stripers made it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Working island points and reefs in the main lake on the lower
end has been successful. Typically, the stripers have been rather
small, most coming under 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament trail
</P>
<P>
   It took Kenyon Hill 111 chances to win his first Bass Anglers
Sportsmen Society tournament. The Norman, Okla., pro caught four
days of five-fish limits for 61 pounds, 5 ounces of bass to win the
Kmart BASS Masters Top 150 tournament last weekend on the Louisiana
Delta. Hill won $100,000 and a berth to next summer's BASS Masters
Classic. Jay Yelas of Tyler, Texas, was second with a 52-14 total.
Buford's Mickey Bruce was Georgia's top finisher. Bruce finished
23rd in the pro division with 15 fish weighing 30 pounds, 4 ounces;
only the top 10 anglers from the first three days qualified for the
fourth. Bruce's son, John, finished 17th in the amateur division
with an 18-1 total, including the big fish on Day 1, a 5-pounder.
... Kim Carver of Milledgeville, who won last year's Red Man
All-American, won a Red Man regional last weekend on Kerr Lake,
N.C., boating a two-day total of 35 pounds, 6 ounces to top the
113-angler field. ... Gary Meyer of Woodstock and Windell Lightsey
of Marietta teamed to win the H.D. Marine/Scottish Rite Charity
bass tournament last weekend on Lake Lanier.

<P>
   Wildlife tag sales
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the popular wildlife-conservation license plate have
exceeded 621,000, earning more than $8.7 million for non-game
wildlife conservation in Georgia, according to state Wildlife
Resources Division figures. The tag costs $15 and all but $2.59
goes directly to WRD.

 &HT;    Panoz drivers to battle for Pro Sports Car title
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite heavy rains at Homestead, the Panoz GT1 was in
third place in the FIA GT Championship Series 500-kilometer race
when Eric Bernard collided with a tire barrier, losing the car's
hood, only 10 laps from the end of the 141-lap race. After a pit
stop to replace the hood, the Panoz car got back into the race in
sixth place. David Brabham was co-driver.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta drove their Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM
to victory, followed by the factory Porsche driven by Jorg Muller
and Uwe Alzen. Yannick Dalmas, who was involved in the spectacular
crash at Road Atlanta last week, finished third in the other
factory Porsche, co-driven by Allan McNish.
</P>
<P>
   The season finale for the Visteon Panoz Racing Team is
Saturday-Sunday at Laguna Seca. On Saturday, one of the Panoz
drivers _ David Brabham, Andy Wallace or Bernard _ will clinch the
Professional Sports Car Racing Driver's Championship title. On
Sunday, Brabham and Bernard will compete in the final round of the
FIA-GT championship.
</P>

   Motorcycle racer dies
</P>
<P>
   A motorcycle racer was killed Friday at Road Atlanta during a
practice session for the weekend's WERA meet. Rodney Priest, 28, of
Charlottesville, W. Va., lost control of his Suzuki ZSR 750 and
fell. Coming out of Turn 5 and leading the pack at the time, he was
struck by several other bikes and died at the scene, according to
Capt. Ken Grogan of the Hall County Sheriff's Dept.

   F1
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Ecclestone has authorized a Formula 1 race in Zhuhai,
China, on March 21. Ecclestone takes the television money and lets
race promoters make what they can on tickets. Meanwhile, Atlanta's
car owners still are waiting for word of a possible F1 race here.

   IRL
</P>
<P>
   Pep Boys Indy Racing League standout Jeff Ward plans to make his
NASCAR Winston Cup debut at the Dura-Lube/Kmart 500 Sunday at
Phoenix International Raceway, where he won his first Pep Boys IRL
pole in March. Ward will drive a car owned by Bill Strauser of
Walla Walla, Wash. Ward won the pole for the Dura-Lube 200 Pep Boys
IRL race in March at 172.753, a track record. ``The stock cars and
IRL cars are totally different, and I'm going to have to use my
natural instincts to make the right adjustment for the stock car.''

   NHRA
</P>
<P>
   On a bone-chilling night at Heartland Park Topeka, Warren
Johnson of Duluth toasted his fourth career NHRA Winston Pro Stock
championship with a cup of hot coffee. With a wind-chill factor in
the 20s, it was not a night for champagne. Johnson's chassis
wizardry paid off in Topeka as he made four-straight 6-second
passes on the stone-cold track surface. ``If I keep getting
reaction times like that, it could ruin my reputation,'' Johnson
laughed. ``I never claimed to be a driver.''

 &HT;    Wendell Scott enters NASCAR's Hall
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The late Wendell Scott made history as the first
African-American to win a NASCAR race on Dec. 1, 1963, at Speedway
Park in Jacksonville, Fla. Scott took another checkered flag on
Wednesday, when he was selected for induction into the
International Motorsports Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He joins Louise Smith of Greenville, S.C., the first female
inductee, who won 38 NASCAR Late Model Stock races against the top
male drivers in the 1940s and '50s; Gordon Johncock, two-time
Indianapolis 500 champ; and Alan Prost, four-time Formula One champ
with 51 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who died of cancer in 1990, is the only African-American
to win a Winston Cup race and a pole. The victory originally was
awarded to Buck Baker, but it was changed after Scott correctly
pointed out a scoring error.
</P>
<P>
   It took hours for race officials to unscramble the scoring
mistake that had him third behind Baker and apparent runner-up Jack
Smith. After starting 15th in his own underfinanced Chevrolet,
Scott had come to the front and clearly passed Baker and Smith
several times. He ran two extra laps to make sure he was the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, who raced against Scott, said he'll never forget
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember him because he didn't have the best
stuff, but he nearly ran us to death on junk,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Brooks, a long-time friend of Scott, remembered when the
two were turned away at the gate in Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to be that way, let 'em,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott raced for most of the 1960s and into the '70s, finally
retiring after suffering injuries in a crash at Talladega in 1973.
He was sixth in season-ending points in 1966, then 10th, ninth and
ninth in his last three years.
</P>
<P>
   His life was the basis of the film ``Greased Lightening,'' which
starred Richard Pryor.

 &HT;    Wins will make Georgia coach top Dog in SEC
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia swimming coach Jack Bauerle is so close to
a milestone that many people _ including himself _ thought was well
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But if his men's and women's teams beat North Carolina today,
Bauerle will become the winningest swim coach in SEC history.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's men, ranked sixth in preseason polls, and the women,
ranked second, are expected to take care of business today. North
Carolina's men are ranked 22nd and the women 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Bauerle, last season's NCAA women's coach of the year, said that
catching Tennessee's Ray Bussard was not on his mind until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, I wasn't even thinking about it,''
Bauerle said. ``But we have won a lot of meets in that time. I
wasn't even aware of (the record) until last year. But what it
really means is a tribute to the athletes who have been here
through those years. It's a tribute to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 20 years at Tennessee, from 1968-88, Bussard compiled a
252-20 record. Bauerle, who began as coach of the women's team in
1979 and became overall head coach in '83, has a record of
251-69-1. The only coach close to Bauerle who coached men and women
is Randy Resse, who had a 219-29 record at Florida from 1976-90.
</P>
<P>
   The record seems secondary to what he really wants: a national
title. And it could be that his women might give him one, despite
the team ahead of them _ defending national champion and
traditional power Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia will host the NCAA Women's Championships in March, but
the Lady Bulldogs will get an early look at Sanford when the Lady
Cardinal comes to town for a meet Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that our men are ranked a little higher than we
should be, although we have some good young swimmers,'' he said.
``But our women, well, we are going to work hard, and I can tell
you we will not be satisfied with second place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia women are led by All-American and multi-record
holder Kristy Kowal, who Bauerle said is ``just getting stronger
and faster.'' Kowal, who swims several events, is one of the NCAA's
premier breaststrokers.
</P>
<P>
   Bauerle said he also has some ``exciting freshmen'' swimmers,
including Stefanie Williams, freestyle and backstroker from
Bloomsburg, Pa., and Ashley Roby, a breaststroker from Lithonia.
Among the men, Yoav Gath, a backstroker from Israel, and Nicholas
Kintz, a freestyler from France, are the top swimmers.

 EDWARD FLANNERY, 86, WHO WROTE ON ANTI-SEMITISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward Flannery, a Roman Catholic priest and outspoken
opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Monday at Miriam Hospital in
Providence, R.I. He was 86 and lived in a village near Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery, a veteran Catholic journalist, won acclaim and a
National Catholic Book Award for his book ``The Anguish of the
Jews: Twenty-three Centuries of Anti-Semitism'' (1965, Paulist
Press).
</P>
<P>
   In it he wrote: ``This book received its first impetus from a
personal experience. One evening several years ago, I walked in New
York City in the company of a young Jewish couple,'' within sight
of ``the huge illuminated cross the Grand Central Building displays
at Christmas. The young lady declared: `That cross makes me
shudder. It is like an evil presence.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her comment made him think, he recalled. ``It soon became clear
that her fearful reaction was the fruit of a knowledge which she,
but not I, had _ a knowledge of the immense suffering undergone by
her people at the hands of Christians for many centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   So he wrote the book, which Monsignor John Oesterreicher of
Seton Hall University's Institute of Judeo-Christian Studies called
``to the best of my knowledge, the first history of anti-Semitism
written by a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1967 interview, Flannery said: ``The anti-Semite, not the
Jew, is the real Christ-killer. He thinks he's religious, but
that's a self-delusion. Actually he finds religion so heavy a
burden, he develops `Christophobia.' He's hostile to the faith and
has an unconscious hatred of Christ, who is for him, Christ the
repressor. He uses anti-Semitism as a safety valve for this
hostility and is really trying to strike out at Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In that year, Flannery began nine years as the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops' first director of Catholic-Jewish
relations. Concurrently, he was a professor at Seton Hall's
Institute of Judeo-Christian Studies for some years.
</P>
<P>
   After he died, Cardinal William Keeler, archbishop of Baltimore
and the Bishops' Conference's episcopal moderator for
Catholic-Jewish relations, said: ``He was an early and effective
pioneer in encouraging Catholics in the United States on how best
to implement Nostra Aetate, the Second Vatican Council's charter
for fostering positive Catholic-Jewish relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director of
the American Jewish Committee, called Flannery ``a major force in
the development of constructive Catholic-Jewish relations during
the past 30 years.'' Flannery also served as consultant to the
Vatican Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations and president of
the National Christian Leadership Conference for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Providence to John Flannery, a police officer,
and the former Elizabeth Mulvey. He studied at St. Charles College
in Catonsville, St. Sulpice Seminary near Paris, and Catholic
University in Washington. He was ordained in 1937 and was in the
diocese of Providence for most of the next three decades, in
pastoral and chaplain's posts and on the staff of the diocesan
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he returned to the diocese, which covers all of Rhode
Island, and was concerned with the continuing education of the
diocesan clergy and with Catholic-Jewish relations until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are a sister, Catherine Walsh of Warwick, R.I.; two
nephews, John Flannery of Rochester, N.Y., and Richard Walsh of
Warwick; and three nieces, Mary Ciunci of Warwick, Elizabeth
Whistler of Newport, R.I., and Mary Flannery, of Florida.

COMMENTARY: TOLL'S 25 CENTS, SIR; NO CHARGE FOR DOG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ Imagine yourself as a toll taker on the Garden
State Parkway. An elderly couple pulls up to the booth at Raritan
and asks directions to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   You tell them to take the Garden State to the New Jersey
Turnpike interchange, follow it to Interstate 95 and go south, all
the way. They are confused and strain to hear. You say it again,
more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the next driver leans on his horn. He is fuming when
he reaches the booth, veins bulging in his neck. How dare the toll
taker keep him waiting!
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turant, an area manager for the New Jersey Highway
Authority, stood at a lectern before six new toll takers,
suggesting what to do next. Address the customer as ``sir.''
Apologize for the delay. Explain the need to help a lost driver.
</P>
<P>
   Then Turant asked the students to consider how much time to give
to the elderly couple during rush hour, balancing friendliness and
efficiency. ``Everything in this job is judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was one of many that the new toll takers
considered in a daylong orientation session at a maintenance yard
in Monmouth County. How to respond to a sexual proposition. What to
say when a threatening dog leans from a car window. How to handle a
driver who refuses to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the Highway Authority trained its new toll
takers individually at their assigned station on the 173-mile
roadway. The class is an effort to instill in the toll takers the
idea that they are the ``ambassadors'' for the authority, the only
employee most drivers ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Turant said drivers are crankier than ever these days, what with
heavier traffic, longer rush hours and hectic lives. The best way
to de-escalate conflict, he told the students, is to combine a
sense of humor with a thick skin.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers at Wednesday's class join about 350 full-time toll
takers working at 30 plazas from the New York border to the tip of
Cape May. On an average day, toll takers collect $500,000, mostly
from 25- or 35-cent tolls. A single toll taker sees about 2,500
drivers during an eight-hour shift, with each transaction lasting
between three and 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After the classroom instruction, the new employees will spend
one day observing a veteran toll taker, another day sharing duties
with the experienced worker and a third day taking tolls under
supervision. By the middle of next week, they will be in booths
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The job has a starting wage of $10 an hour and good benefits.
Applicants must be high school graduates and must pass a drug test
and a criminal check. They are taught technical and personal
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Toll takers must be able to identify vehicles by sight. They
must make change using the fewest coins and bills possible. They
must balance their cash drawers at the end of the shift. They must
know how to extinguish a car fire, deal with a driver having chest
pains, and call police during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   They must be presentable. There is no smoking or eating in the
booth. Radios are allowed, if the volume is low. Gum chewing must
be discreet. Uniforms are to be pressed and shoes polished daily.
Tardiness is not tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The students here included two part-time toll takers just
awarded full-time status; one highway-maintenance worker
transferred to the toll booth; a retired appliance salesman; a
former cook who had lost his job, and a carpet installer changing
careers after back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Most were bemused by the elementary instructions about
punctuality, manners and grooming. ``I was taught that by my
father,'' said Peter Laccitielle, 51, the former carpet installer.
``If I didn't do it, I got a crack in the head. But today it's a
different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Miller, the director of tolls, said employees were not as
polished today as in the past, perhaps because of less rigorous
public education and the end of compulsory military service. ``We
have seen over the years that we can't take anything for granted,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of the day was flexibility, rolling with the punches.
That included the teacher, who drew laughs when he told of the
mishaps in making the training video.
</P>
<P>
   In one section, a toll taker is frightened by a barking dog,
without leash or muzzle, that seems to be about to spring through
an open car window. But in take after take, the dog remained
silent, refusing to sound threatening. Undaunted, Turant crouched
on the floor of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was me in the back seat barking,'' he said.

SLOCUM KNOWS THE SCORE AFTER 25 YEARS OF COACHING AT A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If R.C. Slocum ever had a personalized bumper sticker, it could
read like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a native Aggie, but I became one as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has stayed one seemingly forever, or, in the opinion of
some Texas A&AMP;M former students, too long.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard road to travel, that Texas Highway 6.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you would think an unhappy Aggies football fan had to
be nonexistent, Slocum was talking yesterday about his recent mail
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I heard from more than several about how they didn't like
our fourth-quarter defensive strategy,'' Slocum said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the week after the upset of No. 2 Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, there is no place tougher in Texas, or maybe
the nation, to coach football than in College Station. Aggies are
considered, well, crazy when it comes to football and football
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum can testify to that more than anyone who ever tried to
coach in Aggieland. An Orange product with a degree from McNeese
State, Slocum has spent 25 years on the A&AMP;M staff, longer than any
football coach in school history.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, he has been head coach, third only to Dana X.
Bible (11 seasons) and Homer Rice (14 seasons). But those two names
involve ancient history. No head coach in more than 50 years has
survived as long as Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greatest fans and greatest place in the world,'' he said. ``By
and large, the people are good. They've got a life and they've got
jobs, and their entire existence doesn't revolve around a football
game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are disappointed when we lose, and they celebrate when we
win. But the right perspective is there. Then there are a few
others, and those are the ones you hear from, and no matter what,
they aren't going to be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has been Slocum's strangest season, the critics were
louder than ever until two weeks ago. There was the loss to
then-No. 2 ranked Florida State in the opener, followed by a
struggling offense in wins against so-called lightweights, followed
by a quarterback change, followed by ...
</P>
<P>
   The shocking win against Nebraska. Then last week, the Aggies
showed no victory hangover in disposing of a Baylor team on the
road. Until A&AMP;M, Baylor had played everyone extremely tough.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought that the Aggies would be ranked No. 8 in
the land by late October? Who would have thought the contest at
Kyle Field on Saturday against No. 25 Texas Tech would mean another
big-game atmosphere for College Station?
</P>
<P>
   ``For 99.9 percent of Aggies, the mood changed dramatically
around here after the Nebraska game,'' Slocum said. ``We had won
the game _ the so-called big one _ that many said we couldn't. I
always thought that criticism was way overblown, but it was there,
no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum is fond of reminding about this being the winningest
decade in A&AMP;M history. ``To achieve that, you have to have won some
big games along the way,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   And he also tacks on the zinger that makes the dog bark in
College Station. ``At no time has the NCAA ever felt better about
this football program _ just ask the NCAA,'' Slocum said. ``This is
a university where the entire foundation is supposed to be built
upon honor and upon integrity. And then to have football scandals _
that should not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was the Jackie Sherrill era. And Slocum was an
assistant on Sherrill's staff, leading some of us to believe more
dirty tricks were coming with his promotion in 1989. But Slocum has
taken the program in exactly the opposite direction. Meaning up.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, there was a scandal under Slocum. The
infamous case of Warren Gilbert, the Dallas booster, in the
mid-1990s. ``It gave us another bad name and it hurt recruiting for
several years, but in the end, it was the best thing that ever
happened,'' Slocum said. ``The NCAA came out and said the school
president is trying to do it the right way and the coach is trying
to do it the right way _ that we had gotten the message. But that
others obviously hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called it ``a clear line being drawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``Some of our fans still thought the old way was
the right way. But what that case did was tell one and all that if
you did it the old way, you wouldn't be involved with us any
longer. The whole process did hurt, but it was also very
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   For Slocum, this particular season has been the same. The
``99.9'' now love him in Aggieland. And will continue to do so as
long he beats Tech on Saturday.

NHRA TOP FUEL POINTS LEADERS OFFER TOP-NOTCH RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only 11 points separate National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel
championship contenders Cory McClenathan and Gary Scelzi, who after
19 events are giving professional drag racing something sorely
missing from the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rivalry worth getting worked up about. And it will make
the 13th annual Revell Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis
the hottest ticket in motorsports this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With his final-round victory against Kenny Bernstein in the
rain-delayed Parts America Nationals at Topeka, Kan., early Sunday
morning, McClenathan reclaimed first place over Scelzi by those 11
points. Scelzi began final eliminations with a 44-point advantage,
but his second-round loss against McClenathan helped rearrange the
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could begin to change with the first four-second
qualifying blast down the Motorplex's all-concrete quarter-mile
tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the points standings show that I have the lead, I look
at it as if it were a tie,'' said McClenathan, driver of the
McDonald's Dragster owned by former NFL coach Joe Gibbs. ``When
you're talking 11 points, that's only one round and we have 12
rounds \Rover three remaining events\S to go. This is great for the
fans but nerve-wracking for the drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unlikely collapse by either Cory Mac or Scelzi this
weekend, the Top Fuel chase will leave Ennis, head south to Houston
Raceway Park in Baytown next weekend and continue to the Winston
Finals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway on Nov. 12-15.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon how they qualify this weekend, it is conceivable
that Scelzi and the Team Winston Dragster could wind up staging in
the lane opposite McClenathan during Sunday evening's final, live
on The Nashville Network.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that within a recent seven-day stretch, McClenathan and
Scelzi faced each other in the second round at national events,
with each recording a victory. Scelzi beat McClenathan at Memphis
Motorsports Park on Oct. 11, and Cory Mac returned the favor at
Heartland Park on Sunday. Heads-up, McClenathan has a 4-2 advantage
against Scelzi this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a rivalry,'' said McClenathan, the Top Fuel
points runner-up in 1992, 1995 and 1997. ``Jimmy Spencer told me
one time that when those \RWinston Cup\S guys are rubbing fenders,
there's a lot of love there. This is male bonding at its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gary and I could do that \Rrub fenders\S, we'd be doing it.
But it keeps you on your toes knowing that Winston car is going to
be there. That keeps you competitive. Keeps you alive. This is life
at its best for me. To be in the middle of this deal is an
incredible feeling. You don't see guys on a pedestal because this
is a humbling sport.''
</P>
<P>
   That notion has been hammered home this season for Scelzi, who
won the Top Fuel title last year in a storybook rookie campaign of
driving for team owner and tuner Alan Johnson. Scelzi, who replaced
the late Blaine Johnson in his brother's hot rod, dramatically
clinched the 1997 title at the season-ending race at Pomona. This
year, Scelzi did not make a final-round appearance until the
series' ninth event at the new Route 66 Raceway in Joliet, Ill., in
late May. But he since has won four races, including three
consecutive from mid-August to mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan has kept in the hunt by matching the class
record-tying six victories he racked up during 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Cory was on our tail all the way,'' said Scelzi, a
38-year-old resident of Fresno, Calif. ``The competition got
tougher from half-season on. This year, although there hasn't been
that many different winners, there has been a lot of stellar
performances in Top Fuel. There are a lot of good teams out there.
But the ones I consider the best, it brings out the best in me. I
want to race Joe Amato, Cory, Kenny _ I want to race those guys. I
might be throwing up in my helmet before the round, but if you beat
them you've accomplished something.''
</P>
<P>
   Linked as they have been for the past two seasons, McClenathan
and Scelzi have developed a healthy mutual respect for one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I don't have to put in the equation is Cory jacking
around,'' Scelzi said. ``Most of the guys racing this deal, we
don't play \Rmind\S games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to where every round counts. Cory is a good `leaver'
\Roff the starting line\S and one of the best drivers out there, if
not the best driver out there. But it's crunch time now. You've got
to be on your game without forcing a mistake on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   McClenathan, a 35-year-old resident of Anaheim, Calif., insisted
that even with all that is on the line, he plans to thoroughly
enjoy this weekend at the Plex. Recall that he is the two-time
defending race champion. And that during the finals last October,
McClenathan became the first driver to crack the 320 mph barrier at
321.77 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up wishing that I could be in a position like this. And
now that I'm here, I can't stand it. It's killing me,'' said
McClenathan, who has three races to register a Top Fuel record
seventh victory in a single season. ``Gary and I love this sport
and will do anything to keep on doing it. I'd even love to hate the
kid, but he's too cute.''
THE BUZZ
NHRA
</P>
<P>
   Wet weather has prompted a second change in plans for events
associated with the 13th annual Revell Nationals at the Texas
Motorplex in Ennis. Yesterday's sixth annual Dallas Motorsports
Expo was canceled by the threat of rain. And this afternoon's
scheduled debut of the NHRA's Pro Stock Truck class has been
rescheduled for tomorrow. The latest change was prompted by water
saturation in the unpaved areas of the Motorplex pits, sections
where Sportsman racers generally park their rigs and race cars.
Elon Werner, the track's director of media services, said the Ennis
area has received approximately eight inches of rain since the
weekend. ``Every year we add more asphalt to the pits, and that's
more land the water is running off of,'' Werner said. ``The fringe
areas are wet and rather than get a bunch of Sportsman racers mad
and hinder their competitive edge, we decided to treat everyone
equal.'' For professional drivers in Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock
and Pro Stock Truck, that has meant a temporary move to the parking
lot of the former supercollider office center on Highway 77, just
north of Waxahachie. Werner said that lot is about a 15-minute
drive from the track. ...
</P>
<P>
   All the pro classes and Competition Eliminator are parked at
that satellite site through tonight. That will open up the paved
Motorplex pits to competitors in Federal Mogul Dragster, Federal
Mogul Funny Car, Super Comp, Super Gas, Super Stock and Stock.
Sportsman racers are scheduled to begin qualifications at noon,
with Federal Mogul Dragster and Federal Mogul Funny Car to run
their first rounds at 7 p.m. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Stock Trucks, originally scheduled to qualify at 3 p.m.
and 6:15 p.m. today, will run tomorrow at 10 a.m., 2 p.m and 6 p.m.
in anticipation of Saturday's final. Early tomorrow morning, all
the pro classes and Competition Eliminator drivers will move into
the Motorplex paved pits. On Saturday morning, all remaining
Sportsman competitors will relocate from the remote lot to the
Motorplex. ...
</P>
<P>
   Advance ticket sales for this weekend are up 20 percent, Werner
said. That, in addition to wet parking lots, has prompted the
addition of two remote lots for spectators this weekend. Remote
parking will be available in Waxahachie today at the intersection
of Highway 287 and Highway 77 at Tractor Supply Co., Kroger and the
HEB Grocery lots. Beginning tomorrow and continuing through Sunday,
Waxahachie remote parking will be at the Waxahachie High School
football stadium. Remote parking in Ennis will be available
tomorrow through Sunday at the Ennis Junior High School football
stadium on Belknap Street. ``We used this system in 1994 and
received a number of compliments,'' Motorplex owner Billy Meyer
said. Remote parking will be free, and the track will provide
continuous shuttle service from 8 a.m. until two hours after
completion of each day's racing.
FAST LAPS
He keeps going and going
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan Terry Labonte will make his 600th consecutive
NASCAR Winston Cup start at Phoenix International Raceway this
weekend. Texas Terry will do so in a specially designed ``Iron
Man2'' edition of the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte broke seven-time NASCAR champion Richard Petty's record
of 513 consecutive races started in the spring of 1996. And Labonte
keeps on going and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with my two championships, breaking Richard Petty's
record and then adding to it as much as I have are the highlights
of my career,'' Labonte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a big weekend for him,'' said Bobby Labonte,
Terry's younger brother. ``It kind of goes back to he's the
`Iceman.' He doesn't get in situations where he gets himself into
trouble.''
Daytona sees the light
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's historic first nighttime edition of the Pepsi 400 at
the Daytona International Speedway has been declared a resounding
success by officials of International Speedway Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million system installed by Musco Lighting, Inc.,
generated not only daylight-like conditions but also rave reviews
from drivers, fans, sponsors and media. That does not mean,
however, that speedway management is planning to move the Daytona
500 _ NASCAR's traditional season-opening Super Bowl _ from Sunday
afternoon into primetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daytona 500 is such a great tradition,'' said John Graham,
the president of DIS. ``I think it's the premier sporting event in
the world. It's documented to be the most watched motorsports event
in the U.S. and in the world. With that kind of tradition and
following, we will probably stay with the tradition of that race at
the time it's run, at noontime on the second or third Sunday in
February.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the entire stock-car portion of SpeedWeeks 1999 at
Daytona will be run during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 2000, we are looking at the possibility of one or two of
those events being run in the evening,'' Graham said. ``In the
event there is a weather delay, the lights do give us additional
flexibility. But for 1999, all events for SpeedWeeks will be run in
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the light bill for Saturday's event ranged between
$25,000 to $30,000, or approximately $5,000 to $6,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, you've got to figure that the estimated 170,000 fans
who turned out for the race will help ISC cover that cost of doing
business. Nuts and bolts With his victory in the Pepsi 400, Winston
Cup points leader Jeff Gordon moved into a tie for 13th place on
the all-time NASCAR winner's list. Gordon has 40 career victories,
matching Bill Elliott and the late Tim Flock.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty is the only Winston Cup driver who has run in all 30
races this season and has yet to lead a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Should Dale Earnhardt Jr. win the remaining three NASCAR Busch
Grand National Series races of 1998, the points leader would tie
Sam Ard's single-season record of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Two new teams have announced plans to compete in the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League in 1999. Indianapolis 500 veteran Scott
Harrington will drive for a team formed by his father, Gene. And
rookie Greg Gorden will drive for Truscelli Team Racing.
Last words
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what `pressure' means. It's like `vacation'
_ it's not a word in my vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Warren Johnson, newly crowned four-time NHRA Winston Pro Stock
champion

 This article is adapted from Neal Gabler's ``Life the Movie: How
Entertainment Conquered Reality,'' to be published next month by
Knopf.  
 By NEAL GABLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 160 years ago, Alexis De Tocqueville observed that
Americans lacked an appreciation for what he called the ``pleasures
of mind.'' Instead, he wrote, they ``prefer books which may be
easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned
researches to be understood. They ask for beauties self-proffered
and easily enjoyed. ... They require strong and rapid emotions,
startling passages, truths or errors brilliant enough to rouse them
up and to plunge them at once, as if by violence, into the midst of
the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words remain, in fact, a pretty good description of the
impulses that drive American popular culture, what one might call a
constant quest for ever greater sensationalism. But the
characteristics Tocqueville ascribed to our books, poetry and
theater are now no longer confined to amusements; they have leached
into almost every aspect of American life.
</P>
<P>
   Any putative Tocqueville looking at America today would see a
whole Republic of Entertainment in which strong and rapid emotions,
startling passages and rousing truths pervade journalism, politics,
education, religion, art and even crime. Indeed, ours seems to be a
world molded in the image of the movies and intended for our
viewing pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   To most of us, this has been obvious for some time in the
country's public life. However serious their subtexts may be, news
events like the O.J. Simpson trials and Lewinskygate are vastly
entertaining spectacles that are promoted, packaged and presented
very much like the latest Hollywood blockbusters, only these
stories happen to be written in the medium of life.
</P>
<P>
   What has been less evident than the transformation of public
events into entertainment, however, is something arguably much more
important: the extent to which entertainment has gradually infested
our own personal lives, converting them into ``movies'' too. It is
not just that audiences may find daily life as entertaining as
fictionalized stories, as ``The Truman Show'' and the director Ron
Howard's forthcoming ``edTV'' have it.
</P>
<P>
   It is that over the years our moviegoing and television watching
has been impregnating the American consciousness with the
conventions and esthetics of entertainment, until we have become
performers ourselves, performing our own lives out of the shards of
movies. One might even think of American life, including quotidian
American life, as a vast production in which virtually every object
is a prop, every space is a set, every person is an actor and every
experience is a scene in a continuing narrative.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long process that has brought us to this point _ a
process that may have been set in motion by the country's very
active sense of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where the class hierarchy was rigid and class
distinctions obvious, any sort of personal theatricality, aside
from that of self-conscious, rebellious Bohemians, was limited to
the upperclasses, which could afford flamboyant display. But in
America, where class boundaries were more porous and distinctions
less apparent, citizens quickly learned that how one looked and
behaved largely determined how one was perceived, prompting Walt
Whitman to lament the ``terrible doubt of appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on class by style infused 19th century American
life with a kind of subtle theatricality as the middle class and
later the working class imitated the affectations of the gentry in
hopes of being regarded as gentry themselves. By the early 20th
century, though, these old models of gentility had yielded to new
models in the mass media, especially the movies, and the change
ushered in a marked difference in aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   What had begun in the 19th century as a way of appropriating
class became in the 20th a way of making one's life more closely
approximate the glamorous visions one read about in novels and
picture magazines or saw on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the burgeoning of mass culture, this everyday
performance art may be America's most ubiquitous art. Though
obviously not everyone is willing to concede that he or she is
becoming a performer, there are telltale signs everywhere that
ordinary life is cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   Take fashion. There was a time when fashion was, as Tom Wolfe
once put it, the ``code language of status,'' a way to express
where one stood in the social order. Nowadays, when nearly everyone
has access to designer clothes, even if it is only a pair of jeans,
fashion is less expressive than imaginative. What one wears doesn't
necessarily convey who one is; it projects who one wants to be _
which makes clothing into costume.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly no coincidence that America's most popular and
influential designer, Ralph Lauren, has demonstrated the greatest
appreciation for the costume functions of fashion. What Lauren,
born Ralph Lifshitz, understood from his own love of the movies as
a boy growing up in the Bronx was that people would pay to
transform their lives into their cinematic fantasies: safari
outfits to make one a colonialist from ``Out of Africa''; denim
jackets and jeans to make one a cowboy from a Hollywood western;
finely tailored English suits to make one an aristocrat from any
number of crisp drawing room melodramas.

STARS BEGIN AGAIN WITH ALL PIECES IN PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The process of building the Stars into a serious contender for
the Stanley Cup begins in earnest tonight. Injured centers Joe
Nieuwendyk and Brian Skrudland are expected to return to the lineup
in a 7:30 game against the Phoenix Coyotes at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as getting Nieuwendyk back gives fans a look at the
three big shooters _ Mike Modano and Brett Hull included _ coach
Ken Hitchcock stresses that trying to view the Stars as a finished
product would be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny business, because the process of being a good
team has to start all over again,'' Hitchcock said. ``The pieces
are there, but as far as the chemistry, we're a ways off.''
</P>
<P>
   That could show tonight as Hitchcock plans to start Nieuwendyk,
last season's team most valuable player, on the ``fourth'' line
with Skrudland and Grant Marshall. Nieuwendyk, 32, has played as a
first- or second-line center his entire career and last season led
the Stars in goal-scoring with 39. The fourth line generally has
the task of checking or banging.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hitchcock has moved fourth-line center Tony Hrkac to
the second line with Jamie Langenbrunner (who moved from center to
left wing) and Pat Verbeek, so Nieuwendyk and Hrkac can be switched
in the middle of the game if Nieuwendyk appears to be playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two pretty big parts of your team back in the same
game. That's going to be an adjustment,'' Hitchcock said. ``Joe's
going to have a tough time, he knows that. But he wants to get
through it and move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said he feels comfortable with both knees that
underwent reconstructive surgery in May. His right knee, which was
injured in a collision in the first game of the playoffs with San
Jose Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment, had a torn anterior
cruciate ligament that was repaired. His left knee had a missing
ACL replaced with a ligament from a cadaver. Nieuwendyk had been
playing for seven seasons without an ACL in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it should be stronger. I can already feel the
difference,'' Nieuwendyk said of having two healthy knees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leading the team in goal-scoring, Nieuwendyk also
set a franchise record with 11 game-winning goals (second in the
NHL), was the team's top scorer on the power play with 14 goals
(tied for fifth in the NHL) and finished second in the NHL in
faceoff percentage (59.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a complete player who does a lot of things,'' said Hull,
who started his career as a teammate of Nieuwendyk's with the
Calgary Flames. ``I don't think he's lost a step, even with the
knee injuries. He's going to add a lot to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's importance to the Stars was underscored in his
absence from the playoffs. Without him, Modano faced extended
pressure and wasn't as effective as the first-line center. Without
Niuewendyk, linemate Verbeek, who was second on the Stars in
goal-scoring with 31 during the regular season, also wasn't as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``With both lines last year, other teams had to make a choice,''
Modano said. ``And if they chose to send their checkers at us, then
Joe and Patty took advantage of it. They were the line that picked
us up a lot of times last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the process begins of getting that combination and
chemistry back. Nieuwendyk likely will see some playing time on the
power play, but he hasn't practiced with a regular unit and will
have to work his way onto a power play that has become the most
prolific in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where they play me or what they want to do with
me, I just want to get in,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Nieuwendyk's return also schedules him to be on the
ice Saturday when Marchment, whom Nieuwendyk called a ``dirty
player,'' returns to Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm looking forward to it,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I
need to get back into the game and playing against a guy like him
is part of the game.''
Severyn rests
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brent Severyn rested his sore neck and back
yesterday and is not expected to play tonight, Hitchcock said. The
move is, in part, designed to give Severyn a better chance to play
Saturday when Marchment is scheduled to return and Severyn's
fighting skills and toughness could be needed.
Modano rests
</P>
<P>
   Modano missed practice yesterday with a sore hip flexor. He said
he expects to practice today.

 UNDATED: room melodramas.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time, he realized that these transformations were
more than a matter of costuming. With his home furnishings and
accessories as well as his ad campaigns, Lauren sells an image of
life, a kind of collage of movie fantasies that, in his own words,
``represent living, not fashion'' and that, more specifically,
provide the ``whole atmosphere of the good life'' that movies had
always purveyed. One writer called him the first image manager,
which is exactly what he is. He (italics)gave(end italics) the
middle class what the upper classes and celebrities had always had:
a conscious esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   What Ralph Lauren is to the materials of image, Martha Stewart
is to their deployment. Like Lauren's, Ms. Stewart's origins were
humble, but like Lauren, she has an instinct for transporting her
followers from their daily grind. Identifying with the bedraggled,
unfulfilled, unappreciated middle-class housewife, Ms. Stewart, as
a life style consultant, offers a vision of domestic perfection
that owes more to movies and television sitcoms than to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to realize that the creation of a fine family, a
lovely life style and a comfortable home is kind of a national art
form in itself,'' she told her readers of her syndicated column
with a nod to the theatricality of it. So devout an esthete is Ms.
Stewart that she has even issued instructions on how to shovel the
snow from your sidewalk: ``Always leave an inch of snow so it looks
nice and white. Esthetics are very important in snow removal.''
</P>
<P>
   While designers like Lauren and life style counselors like Ms.
Stewart are in the business of image management, more and more
architects are in the business of creating the sets on which the
life movie could unfold. Stores like Niketown and malls like the
Mall of America outside Minneapolis or Horton Plaza in San Diego,
theme restaurants like the Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood or
Jekyll and Hyde, and hotels, museums, churches and schools were now
furnishing stages for the performance of shopping, eating,
sleeping, watching, worshiping or learning.
</P>
<P>
   As Andy Warhol once said of New York restaurants, ``They caught
on that what people really care about is changing their atmosphere
for a couple of hours'' _ that is, escaping into their own life
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the set restricted to individual spaces. Whole areas had
become back lots, to use the Hollywood term for the studios' old
tracts where outdoor scenes were shot _ areas like West 57th Street
and the South Street Seaport in New York or Peachtree Center in
Atlanta or Navy Pier in Chicago. The intellectual historian Thomas
Bender, looking at the way America's inner cities were being
colonized and commercialized by chain stores, theme restaurants and
other tourist attractions, summoned a new urban vision in which the
city was an ``entertainment zone _ a place to visit, a place to
shop; it is no more than a live-in theme park,'' which he believed
was designed to hide a grittier, dirtier, more problematic city
from us.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, if many of us now live on stages, dress in costumes and
follow esthetic guidance, these things are only symptomatic of a
larger reconceptualization of life itself. Nearly 50 years ago, the
sociologist David Riesman identified the emergence of a new type of
social character in America that he called ``other-directed,'' by
which he meant, essentially, that one's goals were directed toward
satisfying the expectations of others _ an audience.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, other-directed Americans were conscious of
performance and of the effects of affect, a self-consciousness that
led another sociologist, Erving Goffman, to conclude that in the
20th century ``life itself is a dramatically enacted thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Goffman's analysis, every American was engaged in a series of
plays and a series of roles, an ``exchange of dramatically inflated
actions, counteractions, and terminating replies'' _ in short, an
enactment of the scenes of daily life. What Goffman didn't seem to
foresee when he was writing in the late 1950s was how much more
complex the performance would become, how many more scenes and
roles there would be to play on a daily basis and how much farther
the front stage would extend into the backstage until the show
never seemed to end.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the demands of daily performance at work, at school,
at social engagements, even at home, would become so onerous that
one could no longer be compared to a classical actor digging into
his kit bag to find a character the way a Laurence Olivier had.
Rather, Americans were on stage so often that they were forced to
become Method actors mastering the art of playing themselves by, as
Elizabeth Taylor once described the technique, ``making their
fiction reality.'' Daily life had become a show. ``A whole day of
life is like a whole day of television,'' Andy Warhol observed,
anticipating ``The Truman Show.'' ``TV never goes off the air once
it starts for the day, and I don't either. At the end of the day
the whole day will be a movie.''

 UNDATED: a movie.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if one lived a movie, as Warhol said, it wasn't just the day
that qualified as a performance; it was the entire life. It was
(italics)life(end italics) now that had a beginning, a middle and
an end like conventional movies. It was (italics)life(end italics)
now that was increasingly being plotted to let the ``actor'' live
out his or her fantasies, albeit within the restraints of physical
appearance, financial resources, talent, cooperation and a myriad
of other impediments.
</P>
<P>
   One now chose a genre to which one aspired and then eased into
the role. If you wanted to be a young professional or a Bohemian
artist or a man of leisure or an outdoorsman, you conformed your
life to the conventions of each. You dressed the way they dressed,
acted the way they acted, associated with the kinds of people with
whom they associated.
</P>
<P>
   Though in practice this was all somewhat amorphous, what really
seemed to illustrate how rapidly personal life was advancing toward
theater was the advent of a new profession: self-styled ``life
coaches,'' reportedly 1,500 of them as of last year, who advise
clients on how to reorient their lives to reach what one coach
calls fulfillment but what someone else might call a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   What the coaches do, along with routine ego boosting, is replot
the client's life. They tell him how he should organize his time,
how he should deal with business matters, whether or not he should
host a party or take a trip. ``It's like painting a canvas for a
`life assignment,' '' said one coach.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are as overtly self-conscious about their life movies
as these clients, but a good many Americans are still embarked on a
campaign to live out their life vision as it has been shaped by
mass culture. ``At one point in cultural history we asked whether
movies furnished an adequate likeness of real life,'' the
psychologist Kenneth Gergen once observed. ``The good movies were
the more realistic. Now we ask of reality that it accommodate
itself to film. The good person, like the good party, should be
more `movieistic.' '' Or to put it another way, where we had once
measured the movies by life, we are learning to measure life itself
by how well it satisfies the narrative expectations created by the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, we have been changing not only the contours of our
lives but the very justification for our existence. Traditionally,
realizing one's dreams was only one part of the life experience. It
was understood that a full life necessarily entailed both our
failures and our triumphs, our agonies and our ecstasies.
</P>
<P>
   This was why Aldous Huxley's brave new world seemed so
terrifying even though its inhabitants were in a perpetual state of
bliss. In Huxley's view, they had sacrificed their humanness to
their happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we have not yet arrived at the point where we can shape
our lives to our specifications as writers shape movies, but we are
probably closer to living in ``Pleasantville,'' to cite the title
of the new film about a 1950s television universe of unruffled joy,
than any previous generation. In the movie, the town of
Pleasantville is disturbed by the arrival of ``real'' humans who
bring with them a pungent taste of ``real'' life.
</P>
<P>
   In our own Pleasantville, though, the issue is not how much more
exciting reality is than our movie and television glosses; it is
how little reality seems to count when life itself is a gloss.
After all, when life is a movie, who needs reality?
</P>
<P>
   Huxley notwithstanding, that may just turn out to be the central
question of the next millennium.

MIAMI TEACHERS IN EDISON PROJECT TO BE OFFERED STOCK OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock options are usually reserved for high-paid executives or
employees of high-tech start-up companies. But teachers in the
for-profit Edison Project school in Miami will begin receiving them
under a program believed to be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced Wednesday by the Miami Dade Public
Schools, the teachers union there and the Edison Project, the
private company that runs one of Miami's public elementary schools
and four dozen others around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time of growing interest nationwide in
finding new ways to reward teachers. Edison, a privately held
start-up company that expects to go public in the next few years,
provides a way for teachers and other school employees to benefit
in the company's potential success. It gives them the right to buy
stock at a relatively low price, no matter how high it might go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is to give teachers a broader sense of
ownership in the enterprise in which they are the key
professionals,'' said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., Edison's chairman.
``They are not giving up anything, but we want them to participate
if Edison does well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Tornillo, executive vice president of the United Teachers of
Dade, local 1974 of the American Federation of Teachers, applauded
the new plan, calling it ``the first time in the history of
American education that teachers have become direct economic
stakeholders in the public schools where they work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' added Tornillo.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Odden, an expert in teacher compensation at the University
of Wisconsin, said performance awards for teachers had begun to be
offered in school districts around the country, including ones in
Kentucky and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 90s phenomenon,'' he said. But while applauding such
incentives, he said it was too early to say whether they would
improve education.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under Edison's Miami program, full-time staff members will be
able to buy Edison shares at a set ``exercise'' price during a
10-year period. Edison's board has said the stock price under the
options would be no more than $6.15 a share.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock price rises above that amount, the value of the
options will rise, giving school employees a profit. If the stock
price remains below the exercise price, the options will be
worthless, but employees would not need to use them. Generally,
companies set their stock option prices at levels that are expected
to generate profits for those who hold them.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher options program will begin in Miami, where Edison
runs the Henry S. Reeves Elementary School, which has 1,175
students in kindergarten through fifth grade, but Edison officials
said they would offer a similar program at the other 50 schools
they run this year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was approved by the Miami-Dade school district,
teachers and staff at the school, their union local and Edison.
Under the plan, teachers at the Reeves school will be granted
options valued at $3,000 each when fully vested after five years.
Other employees, like cafeteria workers and custodians, will
receive options worth $1,000 each. The principal will receive
$10,500 in options.
</P>
<P>
   Edison already offers cash bonuses in a few other schools, and
has reached agreement in Miami on a separate program of cash
bonuses that will be based on student achievement, community
satisfaction and the school's success in meeting Edison's goals. No
dollar amounts have been worked out.

STUMPEL HEADS LIST OF INJURED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. - An injury to No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel was the
most noteworthy in an epidemic of afflictions that conspired to
leave Los Angeles Kings coach Larry Robinson with just enough
healthy players for his 20-man lineup against the Florida Panthers
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, held without a point the first four games, is day to
day with a left-hip-flexor strain. Additionally, rookie wing Josh
Green missed the game with a left-shoulder strain suffered in a
scrape with Keith Jones during Sunday's 5-5 tie with Colorado.
Defenseman Steve Duchesne, officially scratched as a coach's
decision, has been bothered by a mild groin strain for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries allowed defenseman Garry Galley and center Roman
Vopat to crack the lineup for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel's injury came to light Tuesday. Robinson, concerned by
the performance of a player who led the Kings with 79 points last
season, wanted to know why Stumpel was struggling. Stumpel told
Robinson he'd been bothered by the hip since the Kings' final
exhibition game Oct. 4 in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be OK,'' Stumpel said. ``But it
didn't get better, and now it's getting worse. It's hard to move on
the ice. The problem is skating, starting and stopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said, ``Apparently, it's been bothering him more than
we thought, and here we are getting mad at him because he's not
playing as well as he's capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Pete Demers said that if it was late in the season or
during the playoffs, Stumpel probably would be able to play. But
five games into an 82-game season, it's more important for Stumpel
to rest until he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For Stumpel, who missed most of training camp with an ankle
injury, this means more time on the exercise bike, less time on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a hockey player,'' Stumpel said. ``You like to play
hockey and skate. If you have to ride the bike, after a few days,
you get sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury updates: As for the other injured players, Duchesne is
day to day, and so is Green. Center Ian Laperreire remains
sidelined indefinitely with a partially torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Stephane Fiset's groin injury is mild enough that he
might be able to play soon, possibly Friday at Tampa Bay. But
goalie Jamie Storr is sidelined indefinitely with his groin injury,
which is much more serious than Fiset's.
</P>
<P>
   Storr's absence means goalie Manny Legace, Wednesday's starter
against the Panthers, will be around for a while. Even if Fiset
plays against Tampa Bay and makes it through the game without ill
effects, the Kings probably also will keep goalie Alexey Volkov
around until they are certain Fiset's injury is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cashing in: Not only are Legace and Volkov getting a taste of
life in the NHL, they are getting a taste of NHL finances, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have two-way contracts. Legace's salary is $80,000
when he's in the minors, $400,000 when he's in the NHL. Volkov was
making $47,500 while with Halifax in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey
League, and makes $425,000 in the NHL.

A SERIES OF TIDBITS FROM WORLD OF BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   News, rumors and opinions from the World Series:
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles appear to be leaning toward Florida Marlins
assistant Frank Wren as their next general manager. The other
finalists are White Sox assistant Dan Evans and Braves assistant
Dean Taylor. The Rangers interviewed Wren in 1994 before they hired
Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   The early word on pitcher Randy Johnson is he's looking for a
three-year deal worth between $10 million and $13 million per
season. Johnson would prefer to play for the Arizona Diamondbacks
because he lives in the Phoenix area. But if that doesn't happen,
he would prefer to return to the American League.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Rangers have done little with pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre's agent, Tony Attanasio, except exchange phone
messages. But re-signing him as a free agent could turn out to be
an expensive proposition. Major-league officials said Mets pitcher
Al Leiter has turned down a four-year, $28 million offer from his
team. Meanwhile, Kevin Brown, 33, is rumored to be seeking a
seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are expected to decide shortly between Davey Johnson
and Kevin Kennedy as their next manager. Nobody really knows which
way new general manager Kevin Malone is leaning, but betting money
appears to favor Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Molitor has been seen at the World Series sitting with
commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball president Paul
Beeston. Baseball's top honchos would like Molitor to become a
deputy commissioner and liaison to the players' association in the
hopes of smoother labor relations. Molitor hasn't decided whether
he'll play another season.
</P>
<P>
   Two words on the supposed low television ratings for the World
Series: sports bars. Hasn't anybody figured out that many members
of baseball's target audience are sitting in their favorite saloons
watching the game with others rather than at home?
</P>
<P>
   Officials said few teams are talking trade right now, preferring
instead to wait on the free-agent market. But three players likely
to be traded during the off-season are Angels outfielder Jim
Edmonds, Mets catcher Todd Hundley and Braves pitcher Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs have exclusive negotiating rights with their free agents
for 15 days after the Series. The Red Sox are expected to use this
time to make one more run at first baseman Mo Vaughn. If they can't
get it done within that period, he's gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   Last word on the Mets is they were ready to give Mike Piazza a
$98 million, seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Padres general manager Kevin Towers said it's important for the
club to re-sign at least a couple of their free agents before the
Nov. 3 vote on their new stadium. Said Towers: ``We want to be able
to say, `See this guy is coming back, that guy is coming back,
we're still going to be good, we're still going to be here spending
money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch can demand a trade
because he was traded in the middle of a multiyear contract. But
the Yankees are trying to keep that from happening by giving him a
two-year, $18 million extension.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's old team, the Minnesota Twins, might have a $17
million payroll next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said re-signing center
fielder Bernie Williams is a top priority, but they might have to
give him $14 million a year to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is trying to revive the winter meetings. The last true
winter meetings were held in 1992 but were stopped because owners
felt the meetings had become a free-agent bazaar that allowed
agents to play one club against another. But the absence of the
meetings has not stopped salaries from skyrocketing, and Selig
likes the positive publicity and news generated at last year's
expansion draft in Phoenix.

KARL PRINDLE, 95, WHO MADE CELLOPHANE MARKETABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Vt.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Prindle, an industrial chemist who helped transform
cellophane into a mass-market wrapping, and then devised a way for
the masses to unwrap it without breaking their fingernails, died on
Oct. 13 at a hospital in Willoughby, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He was 95 and was an inventor of both moisture-proof cellophane
and the zip-tape strip used to open billions of cellophane-wrapped
cigarette and chewing-gum packages and other tightly sealed
products.
</P>
<P>
   In a career in which he was always looking for an encore,
Prindle made his most significant contribution to commercial
science as a 24-year-old research assistant for the old DuPont
Cellophane Co., which was based in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that what people still persist in calling cellophane
is rarely anything of the biodegradable, cellulose sort, but a
petroleum-based product known as polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of half a century, cellophane was among the
most ubiquitous and profitable products. But until Prindle came
along, it was known primarily as an attractive, elegant and highly
expensive wrapping for high-ticket items like perfumes. Because it
was porous, it was unsuitable for wrapping cigarettes, candy and
other products that required protection from moisture.
</P>
<P>
   By helping to develop a complex, four-component coating that
increased cellophane's moisture resistance, Prindle helped lay the
groundwork for a commercial bonanza that gave DuPont a virtual
monopoly on a product that was not its own.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its long and close identification with E.I. du Pont
de Nemours &AMP; Co., it is easy to forget that unlike, say, nylon, and
other signature products, cellophane was not a DuPont invention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it had been developed in France in the early 1900s as the
accidental discovery of a Swiss scientist looking for a coating to
protect restaurant tablecloths from wine stains.
</P>
<P>
   By the time DuPont secured a U.S. license to make cellophane in
1923, it seemed to have little mass-market potential.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Prindle came in. A native of Charlotte (pronounced
shar-LOT), Vt., whose father operated a lumberyard and whose mother
sold insurance to put her two children through college, Prindle
joined DuPont soon after he graduated from Oberlin College in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he had helped develop a moisture-proof version of
cellophane that not only all but displaced the original but gave
DuPont a lucrative, second-generation patent that allowed it to
dominate the cellophane market.
</P>
<P>
   Prindle was given full credit for the invention and had his name
on the patent, along with that of his young boss, William Hale
Charch. But it was DuPont, which had spent $15,000 on the research,
including Prindle's salary, that reaped the millions in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Charch, who died in 1958, went on to a legendary career as a
DuPont research chief. Prindle went to another company and another
cellophane milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the old Dobeckmum Co., which was based in Cleveland, in
1932, Prindle turned his attention to another cellophane problem:
the difficulty of opening anything sealed in it.
</P>
<P>
   While his invention will seem rather more crucial to anyone who
has tried, say, to open the wrong end of a pack of cigarettes, his
solution was as simple as it was ingenious: He put a stickum on a
thin strip of cellophane and stuck it to the inside of the
cellophane wrapper with a protruding tab that could be pulled to
cut cleanly through the wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing to get the stickum just right, but Prindle
was a perfectionist if nothing else, and it is a tribute to his
ingenuity that similar strips are still used on packages made of
polypropylene.
</P>
<P>
   During his years with Dobeckmum, which was bought by Dow
Chemical Co. in 1957, Prindle developed Lurex, a synthetic metallic
thread widely used to give fashions affordable glitter, and scores
of other products, but none that quite rivaled cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have shared in the millions his inventions made for
their corporate owners, but Prindle managed to do quite well for
himself. After his retirement in 1968 he concentrated on his hobby,
investing, and made millions in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Prindle's wife Mary, to whom he was married for 66 years, is
deceased. He is survived by two daughters, Janet of New York and
Anne Johnson of Dayton, Ohio; a sister, Eleanor Benning of
Charlotte; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He had the satisfaction of outliving his own product. The last
U.S. manufacturer of cellophane went bankrupt last year, and
cellophane is no longer made in the United States.

AIKMAN BACK, SHOWS NO RUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman returned to
practice yesterday for the first time since suffering a fractured
collarbone six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey said Aikman threw the ball sharply and showed
no signs of rust from the lengthy layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good out there,'' said Aikman, who acknowledged
that he felt a little pain when throwing. ``It's the first day.
I'll get more practice time tomorrow and next week. I need all the
practice I can get. I feel confident about going out and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who was replaced by Jason Garrett the past five games,
took most of the snaps at practice. He will continue to do so
leading up to the Cowboys' Nov. 2 game at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Aikman's collarbone, which is still broken, won't be
completely healed until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern is getting hit,'' Aikman said. ``I haven't
been hit yet. There is a concern about whether the shoulder will
hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will fit Aikman with extra padding to support the
collarbone. However, Aikman said the padding is really useless in
protecting against a direct hit. But more than taking a direct hit,
Aikman is concerned about how the collarbone will hold up if he has
to stick out his left arm when he is falling.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gailey and the rest of the Cowboys were just
happy to have him back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look like he missed hardly anything,'' Gailey said.
``He looked very good. Other than the obvious tangible things, it's
good to have him back for the intangibles, as well. He's been a
great leader for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bye this week, Aikman will use the extra time to get back
into practice and allow his collarbone to heal more.
Briefly
Receiver Billy Davis (left foot), defensive end Kavika Pittman
(soreness), defensive tackle Chad Hennings (left ankle) and
defensive tackle Leon Lett (left knee) missed practice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he will use the bye week to get cornerback Deion
Sanders more involved as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys will also use the bye week to begin work
on a game plan for the Thanksgiving Day matchup against the
Minnesota Vikings because that game comes during a short week.

FREEDOM BRINGS RESULTS AT ONE LOS ANGELES CHARTER SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Health education teacher Larry Marshall has
worked at Palisades Charter High School for 33 years, yet he barely
recognizes the place.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the Pacific Palisades school has
reached its capacity of 2,500 students -- doubling the enrollment
in just a few years. There's a waiting list of 600 students and
even private school pupils are taking a second look, with more than
200 returning to the campus during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and others credit Palisades' metamorphosis to a host of
reforms, including achieving charter status in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed a whole lot,'' Marshall said. ``Before, it wasn't
really going up. Now it's going up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the school in a coastal community approximately 18 miles
west of downtown Los Angeles became a charter, average Scholastic
Assessment Test results have shot up eight points for a combined
verbal and math score of 1,007 and the number of students enrolling
and completing Advanced Placement courses has doubled. The school
also has made computer literacy a graduation requirement for the
class of 2002 and established a math, science and technology magnet
as well as a new media entertainment academy.
</P>
<P>
   Palisades is part of a complex of eight fiscally dependent
charter schools that includes five elementary schools, one middle
school and a continuation high school. As a dependent charter, the
complex relies on the Los Angeles Unified School District for
funding but is able to obtain state and district waivers to perform
certain functions, such as draw students from outside its
attendance boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Each campus in the complex also belongs to LEARN, the district's
largest reform effort, which gives teachers, parents,
administrators and school staffers more authority over their
budgets and curriculum. The complex joined the charter movement to
increase enrollment, implement complexwide programs and increase
schools' power and autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them more independence and gives them the ability to
work together and plan together,'' said Stuart Bernstein, leader of
the Hamilton/Palisades/University cluster, which includes the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized reading and math scores have improved 5 to 6
percentile points, the dropout rate is down 4 percent, the
attendance rate is up 6 percent, the number of disadvantaged
students entering four-year colleges has increased and most of the
schools now boast waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   And with the help of a $677,644 Annenberg Challenge Grant, the
complex has implemented mentoring, tutoring, parent education and
college awareness programs to help underachieving students. As part
of the grant, Palisades Charter High School created a satellite
tutoring center in South Central Los Angeles for its traveling
students. Now it hopes to create another one for students who live
in East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're victims of our own success. They're literally banging
down our doors from all parts of the district,'' said Merle Price,
principal of Palisades Charter High. Local youngsters now account
for 40 percent of total enrollment compared to less than 30 percent
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Price said the charter and the Los Angeles Educational Alliance
for Restructuring Now (LEARN) reform movements have had positive
impacts on the complex. Charter status allowed the high school to
set higher graduation standards than the district, requiring all
students to perform 10 hours of community service each year from
ninth through 12th grades and demonstrate computer literacy by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charter freed everybody up to develop new ideas, the way
kids could be engaged, the type of courses, the type of
instruction,'' Price said. ``LEARN helped us learn and implement
new curriculum. They were very compatible.''

LOS ANGELES COMPANY FORMED TO AID CHARTER SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Bill Siart lost his bid last year to become
superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, but that
hasn't halted his campaign to reform the nation's second-largest
school system.
</P>
<P>
   From a fourth-floor office in Santa Monica, Calif., the former
chairman of First Interstate Bancorp has launched a for-profit
company, Exed LLC, that will handle business matters for charter
schools -- everything from accounting to purchasing to janitorial
services.
</P>
<P>
   Siart hopes his effort will build and strengthen the charter
school movement, which he sees as an alternative to the LAUSD's
poor-performing campuses for parents who can't afford private
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I've looked into it, the basic problem with urban
education is they don't have competition, they haven't been forced
to change,'' Siart said. ``Charter schools provide another choice
for parents, and that competition should force everyone to improve
their product.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are allowed to operate free of most state and
district regulations, with the expectation that student achievement
will improve. While all charters become instructionally
independent, some of the schools opt to have their districts
continue to handle their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Siart said it is the business of running a school that often
intimidates educators, and keeps them from full charter autonomy --
or from becoming a charter school altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like facing the start-up of a small business,'' Siart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Price, principal of Palisades Charter High School, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am contacted several times a year from groups who are
considering charters. Their reasons range from dissatisfaction with
their local school system to wanting to focus on a particular
philosophy. The common denominator is their reluctance to handle
the fiscal side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   An outside consultant is evaluating the finances of the
Palisades charter cluster -- a group of eight schools in Pacific
Palisades, which includes Price's high school. When their fiscal
report is presented -- likely in early 1999 -- the schools will
have to decide whether it's time to become financially independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my focus to be on my students' educational progress, I
don't want to get caught up negotiating contracts when I should be
visiting classrooms,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Exed will do some of the financial work, or negotiate contracts
from service providers. Sometimes, that might mean that the charter
campus contracts with its own school district for certain work. But
however it's done, Siart believes he can save the charter schools
money.

SOME CRITICS QUESTION INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charter schools in the Los Angeles Unified School
District have boosted test scores and student attendance rates but
they aren't a panacea for reform, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite federal and state legislation making it easier to create
charter schools, educators still have trouble finding affordable
land for campuses. Many administrators also lack experience running
financially independent schools.
</P>
<P>
   And because charter schools can tailor educational programs to
meet the needs of their students, the reforms can't be easily
replicated throughout the district, said Day Higuchi, president of
United Teachers Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are the blueprint for reforming the
district,'' Higuchi said. ``You see a wide variation in curriculum
and standards. They may be very good for certain groups of students
but they're not good for all students. Students who are left out
will continue to be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to Yvonne Chan, principal of the Vaughn Next Century
Learning Center in Pacoima, a suburb approximately 20 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Nearly every student qualifies
for the federal government's free and reduced-priced lunch program
and 82 percent have limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the school received a National Blue Ribbon and California
Distinguished School award for its outstanding curriculum, rising
test scores and student attendance rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is guts,'' Chan said. ``You need to have a
willingness to do it. It's not `we can,' but `we will.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are public schools run under contract by
teachers, parents and administrators who promise to improve student
performance in exchange for independence from school districts.
</P>
<P>
   If the school fails, it's closed down.
</P>
<P>
   During the past several years, federal and state legislation has
released money for such campuses while lifting caps restricting
their numbers. Starting in January, a new state law will allow the
creation of 250 more charter schools, followed by 100 new schools
each successive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more resources,'' Chan said, noting that the
relationship between her school and the district has improved
during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more understanding by the media and the
public,'' she said. ``Battles with senior staff and the unions have
been settled. I no longer call it `battle,' it's more
`negotiation.' I don't need to fight anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see monumental changes occurring in education as the
number of charter schools increases and transforms how schools are
run and students are taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're undergoing a potential sea change,'' said Guilbert
Hentschke, dean of the School of Education at the University of
Southern California. The academician said the number of charter
schools is on the rise, especially among private companies that
contract with public school districts to operate campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, not only are individual schools becoming charters but
for-profit systems of schools are creating charters,'' said
Hentschke, who anticipates the number of such charters doubling
from 24 to 48 nationwide this year. ``It's a healthy thing for
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   To become a charter, a school must show how it will improve
student performance in a detailed proposal to the Board of
Education that includes everything from the school's mission
statement to achievement goals to fiscal management, if it is
independent. The state Board of Education also must approve the
charter.
</P>
<P>
   But many educators, more comfortable in front of a classroom
than in front of a ledger sheet, remain wary of running a
financially independent school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a $2 million to $3 million enterprise is something
that educators are not necessarily good at,'' said David Patterson,
charter schools consultant for the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lucente, co-director of Fenton Avenue Charter School in Lake
View Terrace, a Los Angeles suburb near Pacoima, agreed. This past
summer, he helped train 14 charter schools in fiscal management
during a seminar in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest hangup for educators,'' he said. ``They
have little experience in budgetary finance. If we're going to help
this movement proliferate, we're going to have to help others
understand budgetary finance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding affordable land also is a hindrance for those interested
in establishing charters. Unlike other states, California does not
provide capital funding for start-up charters to purchase land.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps most start-up charters from happening is being able
to secure real estate. Finding it, let alone paying for it,''
Hentschke said.

   ``It's Hillary's village, finally,'' said Principal Yvonne Chan,
referring to the adage oft-quoted by the first lady, that it takes
a village to raise a child.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Pelayo, whose three children attend Vaughn, said she
was drawn to the school because of its parent involvement. Parents
must sign a contract that calls for, among other responsibilities,
volunteering 30 hours each year, reviewing their children's
homework and visiting the school's family center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to talk to teachers and work together. This is a
team of parents and teachers working for children,'' said Pelayo,
who works as an enrollment clerk at Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vaughn has ended each fiscal year with a nearly $1
million surplus, including $1.2 million in the first year of
operation, which the school used to buy property for the 14 new
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Vaughn generates stays at Vaughn,'' Chan said. ``We're
free to deploy human and fiscal resources. You can give big
bonuses, fire people. . . . You don't have to go through the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenton -- once considered one of the worst schools in the Valley
-- also has made gains since becoming a charter school in 1994.
Named a California Distinguished School, the nation's largest
elementary charter school has made technology education its focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very little control as to what policies would be
governing us,'' said Lucente, who helps oversee the year-round
school with 1,300 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.
``This school community now has total control.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, the school was able to wire an integrated sound,
image and data network for the entire campus. It also has been able
to install 350 computers -- with Internet access -- and provide
each fifth-grader with a classroom computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the bottom. Now we're on the top,'' Lucente said.
</P>
<P>
   At Fenton, overall standardized test scores rose nearly 48
percent this year, with fifth-graders showing the most improvement.
Their scores in reading, math and language increased by nearly 72
percent from last year. Reading scores rose from the 11th
percentile in 1996-97 to the 20th percentile this year; math scores
increased from the 19th percentile to the 29th percentile and
language marks grew from the 15th percentile to the 27th
percentile.
</P>
<P>
   Even Montague Charter Academy in Pacoima, the youngest charter
school in the Valley, has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1996, the school increased its redesignation rate
of limited-English-proficient students into English-only classrooms
by 46 percent -- the highest rate in the district in 1996-97. The
school also boosted student attendance from 91 percent in 1992 to
98 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized test scores remain below the 50th percentile,
though more students are reading at grade level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test scores haven't moved much but students are moving from
one level to the next,'' said Principal Diane Pritchard, citing a
class that had begun with scores below the 25th percentile and has
now reached grade level.

CHARTER SCHOOLS GET RESULTS WITH FREEDOM

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the northeast San Fernando Valley, which is
home to some of the worst-performing schools in Los Angeles,
Cristina Moran says her two daughters are farther ahead than many
students their age.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason is simple, she asserts: They attend Fenton Avenue
Charter School in Lake View Terrace, one of three charter schools
in the Valley and 30 in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   Moran's 8-year-old daughter has her own classroom computer to
surf the Web, write essays and even draw. Her 7-year-old daughter
also has access to a computer in the classroom. Best of all, Moran
said, is that both girls recently scored at or above the national
average on the Stanford 9 Achievement Test -- a remarkable feat,
considering that the average student in the LAUSD scored in the
bottom third nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them being average and above average is super,'' said Moran,
who works as a teaching assistant at Fenton. ``I feel teachers are
going above and beyond to get them the manipulatives they need,
whether it's from the BookMobile or the Internet or another
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in response to calls for academic reform seven years
ago, charter schools are granted financial autonomy and freedom
from state and LAUSD rules in exchange for improving student
performance. That means parents and teachers decide what books are
used, where to spend the school's money and how children will be
taught.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that charter schools don't have to comply with
state laws such as Proposition 227, which virtually bans bilingual
education and requires that public schools enroll
limited-English-proficient children in one-year English-immersion
classes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, if student performance doesn't
improve, the schools can be shut down. So far, only one has closed
in the district: Edutrain Charter School in downtown Los Angeles in
1994, for inappropriate spending.
</P>
<P>
   Since the charter movement started in 1991, nearly 800 such
schools have opened nationwide including 154 in California. The
LAUSD oversees nine charters that cover 30 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores show that most charter schools have made good on
their promises to raise student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News analysis of the Stanford 9 Achievement Test found
that the district's charter schools scored well into the 50th and
60th percentiles, with seventh-graders achieving the 69th
percentile in language and ninth-graders reaching the 69th
percentile in math.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of charter schools said they are having success
because they can experiment with different administrative and
educational approaches for which they are held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taken out of the system, you can't point fingers.
We've taken on the responsibility totally now,'' said Joe Lucente,
co-director of Fenton. ``If something's not working, we have the
ability to fix it and fix it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   An independent evaluation of 13 charter schools in the district
indicates they show great promise: charter students performed just
as well or even better than students at similar, noncharter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, charter schools have had fairly high levels of
student performance,'' said Priscilla Wohlstetter, professor and
director of the Center on Educational Governance at the University
of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Guilbert Hentschke, dean of the School of Education at USC, said
that nationwide, about 4 percent of all such schools have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not all good. They're all different,'' Hentschke said.
``That's a vastly smaller rate than most start-up businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even champions of charter schools said it is too early
to determine how well the schools are doing. Schools that performed
well on standardized tests did so before adopting charters.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley schools that have made the biggest gains are
Fenton Avenue and Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in suburban
Pacoima, approximately 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a charter school in 1993, Vaughn received
California Distinguished School and National Blue Ribbon awards.
Visitors have included first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and state
schools Superintendent Delaine Eastin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Vaughn razed a crack house to build 14 classrooms. Now
using a combination of school funds and in-kind labor, the school
is nearing completion on a $3 million campus complex that will
feature a community library, mini-museums, a business co-op, child
care center for staff and -- in collaboration with California State
University, Northridge -- a professional development lecture hall.

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
backed down from a threat to leave the Middle East peace talks
Wednesday night after Palestinian and Israeli security officials
met with the director of central intelligence and apparently made
enough progress on key issues to satisfy the Israelis, Palestinian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While Netanyahu had threatened to leave the talks and fly home
Wednesday night unless the Palestinians moved on how to change
their charter to eliminate a clause calling for the destruction of
Israel and on extraditing wanted Palestinians, he continued to meet
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The director of central intelligence, George Tenet, was meeting
simultaneously with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai of Israel
and Palestinian officials, including negotiator Saeb Erekat, and
apparently narrowed differences sufficiently to allow Netanyahu to
withdraw his ultimatum. American officials had regarded the
ultimatum, one said, as ``a childish ploy'' intended for Israeli
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, the Americans, Israelis and Palestinians
have been working to produce a final agreed text of some 20 pages
that lays out the phased exchange of 13 percent of West Bank land
over 12 weeks in return for specific Palestinian actions to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting late Wednesday afternoon with Albright to go over
an American document spelling out an agreement, Netanyahu issued a
statement saying there ``can be no agreement'' unless ``substantial
progress'' is made on two issues: a commitment by the Palestine
National Council to publicly change its charter and renounce its
call for the destruction of the state of Israel, and a deal to
extradite Palestinians wanted for allegedly attacking Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has said the Palestine
national charter has been stripped of its clauses demanding the
destruction of Israel, but Israelis complain that the amended
charter has never been published. Arafat has offered to have an
amended charter approved by the smaller Palestine Executive Council
of the National Council, but the Israelis insist that the whole
National Council meet for a public vote within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat gave President Clinton a letter assuring him that the
clause had been deleted, and Americans officials say they have no
reason to doubt that.
</P>
<P>
   On extradition _ which the Israelis call ``transfer'' so as not
to prematurely recognize the Palestinian Authority as a legal state
_ Netanyahu wants 36 people handed over to Israel for trial. Israel
charges them with involvement in attacks against Israelis, and at
least some of them serve in the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans believe that they have worked out a satisfactory
compromise. Under this plan, the CIA, which sits on a security
committee with Palestinian and Israeli security chiefs, will
examine the Israeli cases and decide which Palestinians should be
jailed and tried, but in Palestinian courts. The Israelis
apparently find this compromise unacceptable now, although they
originally accepted it. The difference appears to be sudden
opposition from Israeli settlers briefed on Tuesday by Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, some officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also say they want firm Palestinian commitments to
reduce the number of Palestinian policemen to numbers laid out in
the Oslo accords, which were signed in 1993 and govern the
relations between Israel and the Palestinians. Israelis also want
Palestinians to confiscate unregistered, illegal weapons. The
Americans believe that those issues are also essentially settled.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement is also supposed to include the immediate
resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks on a final peace
settlement, which is supposed to be complete by next May 4, when
the Oslo process runs out.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has threatened to declare Palestinian statehood
unilaterally the next day, and the Americans are eager to get
beyond these interim issues and get both sides into serious talks
on a final settlement. These talks would deal with such contentious
issues as whether there will be a Palestinian state and the status
of Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel and the Palestinians have been deadlocked for 19
months, unable to agree even to carry out the existing accords.
</P>
<P>
   Even while Albright and Netanyahu were meeting Wednesday
afternoon, Israeli officials were busily and visibly bringing
packed suitcases out onto the lawn. First the Israelis said they
would leave at 10 p.m. Then they said Netanyahu's plane would take
off at midnight, then at 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said that the Israeli drama was crude
and that Albright was ``bemused'' by the display. But it was a
dramatic example of the brinkmanship American officials expected
during the endgame of these tortuous negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My betting is that will turn out to be a childish ploy,'' the
official said. ``I woudn't think their private posture is quite as
stark as their public posture.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials made it clear that in their view the
Palestinians had done enough to keep the talks going, and that the
Americans would put the onus for any failure on the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu telephoned the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations and asked them for support and
``political cover'' with American Jews and the Clinton White House
if he had to leave, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A rupture of the talks would cause a serious dispute between the
United States and Israel just a few weeks before Clinton faces
midterm elections for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, urged
Netanyahu and his delegation not to leave, saying it would be
``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a sufficient basis on which to proceed,''
Rubin said, including on security issues, ``to bring peace and
security to the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us feel we are at a crucial period and we want
to advance the cause of peace, and we can't do it alone,'' he said,
all but blaming Netanyahu for causing this crisis.

 WYE MILLS, Md.: this crisis. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One knowledgable official said, ``The Americans believe that in
each of the key elements that constitute a systemic approach to
fighting terrorism, the Palestinians have provided serious and
effective responses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans ``have the bulk of what is needed on the security
front,'' the official added. ``They are asking whether the Israelis
want an agreement or an argument?''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli threat had been brewing all day, as it became clear
that Netanyahu still had difficulties with a security package,
worked out over weeks between Palestinians and the Americans. But
what was not clear, even to American officials, was whether the
Israeli difficulties were with the charter and extradition or were
a result of domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi always has his eye on his domestic constituency and the
state of his coalition,'' an official said, using Netanyahu's
nickname. ``He's either trying to prove he's getting the best deal
possible, or he's decided that the deal on offer will break his
government apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for their part, were following their usual
strategy of siding with the Americans whenever possible. Ahmad
Tibi, a senior adviser to Arafat, said the Palestinian leader had
telephoned Netanyahu to urge him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are satisfied with the Palestinian working
plan,'' Tibi said. ``We are very sorry that we are hearing that the
Israelis are once again raising new demands. But after we heard
that the American administration is satisfied with the Palestinian
working plan, after the long discussions over weeks, any new demand
will not be accepted, and we believe these new demands are a
pretext to bring the negotiations to failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Israeli representative to the United
Nations, Dore Gold, said the Palestinian ``work plan'' on security
``simply isn't detailed enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gold and Israeli officials said Netanyahu, having made such
a major political issue out of a public charter change by the
Palestinians and getting justice for Israelis killed by terrorism,
needed firm assurances on those two points.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, was unusually blunt
Wednesday afternoon. ``It's simple and sad,'' he said, ``because we
came here to reach an agreement, and we applaud the effort of the
Americans. But we find that the Palestinians are not willing to
fulfill their obligations, old and new, and there is a
deterioration in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He went through the Israeli difficulties, then said: ``There are
36 terrorists, and we have all kinds of versions of the arrest of
these people. But we see unwillingness of the Palestinians to go
along with these matters. We are ready to release some prisoners
they want, including some who raped children. But what kind of
entity is the Palestinian Authority that wants rapists and
murderers on their territory?''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, American officials described their work on the
text, which is a revision of the longstanding American proposal for
this interim accord, as ``a grand bargain'' intended to get over
the last difficult obstacles of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The text,'' Rubin said Wednesday, ``is designed to get the
peace process back on track. Despite the intensity of the work, it
is not at all clear that the tough choices needed to reach peace
can or will be made. It's an open question.''

KENNELLY REGRETS CRITICIZING PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. _ Democratic Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, who told
newspaper editors Tuesday that she was disappointed with the
support she had received from her party during her campaign for
governor, backed away from those comments Wednesday, saying that
she regretted her criticism but had no regrets about entering the
race.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party chairman said that Kennelly's
original remarks were driven by frustration with her own
fund-raising efforts. As Kennelly's position in the polls has
tumbled, her campaign has had trouble raising money. And those poll
numbers fell further Wednesday as Quinnipiac College released a
poll showing Kennelly trailing Gov. John G. Rowland by 48 points.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday with the editorial boards of The
Advocate of Stamford and The Greenwich Time, Kennelly said she had
been ``naive'' and should have been more realistic about her
chances to defeat Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   She also criticized the Democratic State Central Committee and
its chairman, Edward L. Marcus, saying they had failed to raise
money for herself and other Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, Kennelly said she regretted
``criticizing anyone'' during her meeting with the editorial
boards. But in an interview earlier in the day her campaign
manager, Jonathan W. Pelto, said the party needed to do more to
help its nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the outcome on Nov. 3, it's clear the Democratic
Party needs to do more to rebuild its infrastructure and support
its candidates,'' Pelto said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent financial disclosure statements,
filed three weeks before the election, Rowland has $2.17 million on
hand and Kennelly has $348,000. Marcus said he had personally
raised and donated $40,000 to Kennelly's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the party's central committee, which organizes
get-out-the-vote drives, could barely pay its bills, much less give
money to candidates. Marcus said the party had not given money to
an individual candidate since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle we have been able to stay out of debt,'' Marcus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennelly's father, John M. Bailey, ran the state Democratic
Party from 1946 to 1975, when the parties had a bigger role in
getting their candidates elected.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, conducted from Oct. 13 to Oct. 19, showed Rowland
leading Kennelly 72 percent to 24 percent among likely voters. The
survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percent
for likely voters, according to the poll's director, Douglas
Schwartz.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rowland, in an interview with the Connecticut Radio Network,
said his strong showing in the polls reflected the strength of the
economy, support for his administration's policies, and problems
with Kennelly's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are generally happy with the direction of the
state, happy with their leadership and that is reflected in the
polls,'' he said. The Quinnipiac College poll found that 83 percent
of registered voters were satisfied with general conditions in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Kennelly was in Danbury to criticize Rowland's proposal last
year to cut rail service along the Danbury, Waterbury and Shoreline
East lines. The candidate, who has said in the past that polls are
important, said she was ignoring the new poll and concentrating on
the election.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did not regret entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran for the right reasons,'' she said, ``to make sure
Connecticut was first again in educating all its children, in
having a good environment, and first in having a good
transportation system.''

POWELL, LARRY TO START
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ There's been a couple of changes in the USC
starting lineup: Marvin Powell has become the new starter at
fullback and defensive end Lawrence Larry has reclaimed his
starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who has been a reserve all season, was named a starter
Wednesday by USC coach Paul Hackett in place of Ted Iacenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really stepped up,'' Hackett said of the Birmingham High
School graduate. ``We still have the other guys, but Marvin has
really done a nice job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hoping somebody would step up and Marvin did a
great job. I'm really excited about where he is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who played tight end last year, started four games at
fullback in 1996. He is the third Trojan, along with Iacenda and
Brennan Ochs, to start at fullback this season.
</P>
<P>
   As for defensive end, Larry has overtaken Shamsud-Din
Abdul-Shaheed, who started most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership is valuable to us, especially with Marc Matock
out with an injury,'' defensive line coach Ed Orgeron said of
Larry, a Littlerock graduate. ``I feel this is Lawrence's senior
year, and he's come on strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It also hasn't hurt Larry's cause that the coaching staff feels
Abdul-Shaheed has some maturity issues to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's making strides in that area, but he needs to keep
on making strides,'' Orgeron said. ``I think that's part of my job.
Some need a little more help in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also announced that Eric Denmon would start at center
but continue to share time with Matt McShane.
</P>
<P>
   __ Good news for Soward: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward is
continuing to do well academically since experiencing problems last
spring. Soward received a B on his history midterm two weeks ago.
He also had his last 6 a.m. running session Wednesday, which occurs
when a player misses a class.
</P>
<P>
   __ Van Raaphorst passes tests: Quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst
passed a second round of tests at USC University Hospital, which
found no reason to explain why Van Raaphorst suffered nausea during
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put this behind me and go out and play,'' Van Raaphorst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said he was not concerned that the tests could not
explain his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want an answer,'' he said. ``But what if the answer is
really bad?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Cusano still out: Doctors did not clear linebacker Mark
Cusano (sore thigh muscle) to play and he sat out another day of
practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about him,'' Hackett said. ``We're hoping
to have him for the game. We've got our fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   He will try to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kori Dickerson has been bothered by back spasms
but is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Long time, no see: USC has not played in Eugene since 1993.
The Trojans did not play the Ducks in 1995 and '96 and played
Oregon at the Coliseum last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans defeated the Ducks 24-13 in '93.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's forecast is for showers with the temperature in the
low 50s.
