<HEADLINE>  Toronto 1996 Bidders: We Warned IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Organizers of Toronto's failed bid for the 1996  
Olympics say they warned the International Olympic Committee eight 
years ago that many of its members were seeking improper privileges 
and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Seagram, one of the organizers, told a news conference  
Thursday that the committee spent more than $500,000 to cover the 
cost of IOC members breaking or stretching rules governing visits 
by members to cities bidding for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Toronto group, 26 of 69 IOC members who visited  
the city broke IOC rules either by bringing more than one guest, 
coming more than once or staying longer than allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were constantly harassed by many IOC members looking for  
favors,'' Seagram said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the absence of any meaningful or enforceable rules, it was  
often extremely difficult to say `No.' But we did. At the same 
time, we saw improper practices and we were subjected to many 
abuses of our hospitality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said the committee submitted a 33-page report to the IOC  
-- including president Juan Antonio Samaranch and vice president 
Dick Pound of Montreal -- on Jan. 9, 1991, shortly after losing the 
vote for the 1996 Games to Atlanta. Along with outlining its 
findings of abuse, the report contained recommendations for reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said he and other committee members were prepared to  
provide specific names and incidents, but didn't because the IOC 
never followed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We'll get back to you,''' Seagram said. ``But they  
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, reacting late Thursday to the news conference, said  
senior IOC member Marc Hodler did ask Toronto organizers for 
specifics about their allegations but that local organizers never 
provided any. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know they never followed through with the names,''  
Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to send a letter this week to leaders of the  
candidate cities for all the Olympics from 1996 through 2006, 
requesting details of any alleged misconduct by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faced with that request I hope that Toronto will provide us  
with the specific facts we need to investigate,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Toronto organizers' report, the most blatant  
abuse by IOC members was the misappropriation of travel expenses 
and airline tickets or passes provided by Toronto officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto group also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--It did not pay any explicit bribes to IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	--The gifts it provided to IOC members cost were within the $150  
limit stipulated by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--It was not reimbursed the money it spent on rent for a Finnish  
IOC member and her husband, who obtained a forestry job with the 
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in Sault Ste. Marie with the 
help of Paul Henderson, the head of the Toronto Olympic bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish member, Pirjo Haeggman, was the first IOC member to  
resign because of the ongoing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the Haeggmans were having marital problems at the  
time and that he was only trying to help Pirjo, a longtime friend, 
and not seeking to sway her vote. He said the Toronto group 
expected to be repaid for the rent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram and Henderson said the Toronto committee never paid any  
bribes or offered lavish gifts to win votes. However, the group's 
report says: 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, many IOC members expect to receive gifts above  
and beyond what anyone would judge to be courteous and gracious. 
Cash, jewelry or other items easily converted to cash were hinted 
at on several occasions. We were surprised to discover on more than 
one shopping trip that the bid city host was expected to pay for 
all purchases made by not only the (IOC) member, but the (member's) 
guests as well.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Alderman Guilty in Payoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A city councilman was found guilty Thursday of  
accepting $7,000 from an undercover informant in an ongoing FBI 
sting on political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury deliberated for two hours before returning the  
verdict against Virgil Jones, 49, in the probe Operation Silver 
Shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Jones took payoffs of $4,000 and $3,000 to  
allow the informant -- posing as a contractor -- to operate a rock 
crusher in his ward. The payments were made in December 1992 and 
January 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had testified the money represented a legal political  
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and an associate, Charles Nix, were convicted of  
conspiracy to commit extortion and attempted extortion. Jones also 
was convicted of filing two false tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the courthouse grumbling that the jurors were unfair and  
rushed to judgment because they were tired and wanted to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how you can review the evidence in two hours,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a Chicago police officer, is running for re-election in  
next month's city elections and said he would try to continue to 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces up to four years in prison when he is sentenced June 4.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones is the fifth city councilman convicted in the probe, which  
began in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb: $43.1 Mil Loss in 4Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc., mulling the sale of  
its sunglasses and hearing-aid businesses, posted a fourth-quarter 
loss of $43.1 million despite a surge in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The net loss, equal to 77 cents a share, compared with a profit  
of $7.4 million, or 13 cents a share, a year ago. Sales climbed 26 
percent to $599.1 million from $473 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time charges, earnings rose 39 percent to $41.9  
million, or 75 cents a diluted share -- a penny lower than Wall 
Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb fell 18 3/4 cents to close at $62.87 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The optics and eye health care company took a charge of $85  
million to reflect a decline in the market value of its Miracle Ear 
hearing-aid business, which it bought in 1993 and now wants to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunglasses sales dipped 8 percent in the quarter, with  
double-digit growth in Europe more than offset by sharp declines in 
Asia and Latin America. Bausch &AMP; Lomb said in November that it may 
jettison or spin off the premium fashion eyewear business to focus 
on eye health care. 
</P>
<P>
	In line with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, the company also revealed that it is lowering from $51 
million to $24.6 million an after-tax charge it took in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge was related to research projects that were already  
under way at Storz Instrument Co. and Chiron Vision Care when it 
acquired the companies for $680 million. The buyouts catapulted 
Bausch &AMP; Lomb ahead of Texas-based Alcon Laboratories as the 
world's largest eye-care company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in its ophthalmic drug and surgical instrument business  
almost quadrupled to $173.2 million from $44.5 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Vision care revenues rose 9 percent, driven by strong growth in  
the disposable and replacement lenses businesses. The health care 
segment rose 5 percent, but hearing-aid sales were flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is in the midst of a restructuring to trim $100  
million in costs by 1999 and eliminate 1,900 jobs to counter 
setbacks in the contact-lens and sunglasses markets. It employs 
more than 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Bausch &AMP; Lomb earned $25.2 million, or 45 cents  
a diluted share, down from $49.4 million, or 89 cents a share, in 
1997. Sales jumped 23 percent to $2.36 billion from $1.92 billion.

<HEADLINE> Teen Found Guilty in Lynching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARFIELD, Pa. (AP) -- A 16-year-old girl was convicted Thursday  
of hanging a learning-disabled teen-ager and bashing the gasping 
girl's face with a rock so she wouldn't tattle about a plan to run 
away to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Holtmeyer could get life in prison for the killing of  
Kimberly Jo Dotts, 15. Prosecutors dropped their plans to seek the 
death penalty against Ms. Holtmeyer at the request of Kimberly's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel she should get the death penalty,'' said Jodi  
Dotts, Kimberly's mother. ``When you're on death row, you're there 
so long with nothing to bother you. In jail, she'll be with the 
murderers and rapists. We thought the death penalty would be too 
easy for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated less than a day and found Ms. Holtmeyer  
guilty of murder, aggravated assault and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holtmeyer and her mother cried and shook as the verdict was  
read. Her mother had to be escorted out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly, a short, overweight girl, was hoping to make friends  
when she was invited to sleep over at another teen-ager's house 
last May. But she found herself in the woods with a group of kids 
she barely knew who were planning to run away to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone complained that Kimberly might snitch on them. A noose  
was pulled over her head, the other end slung over a maple branch, 
and Ms. Holtmeyer and 18-year-old Aaron Straw yanked on the rope 
with all their strength, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, witnesses said, after Kimberly's body dropped to the  
ground, Ms. Holtmeyer smashed the girl's face with a 
basketball-sized rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Lanager, 15, told the jury that Ms. Holtmeyer laughed after  
the hanging and later said she wanted to ``cut Kim up, scatter her 
all over the woods and keep one of her fingers as a souvenir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw also testified against Ms. Holtmeyer, after District  
Attorney Paul Cherry said he would consider not asking for the 
death penalty against him. Ms. Lanager and two other teens who 
testified had murder charges against them dropped, and their cases 
were handled in the juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Holtmeyer's attorney, Bryan S. Walk, said the teens were  
liars who traded outlandish stories for lesser charges.

<HEADLINE> Harrington Comfortable As NBA Rookie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- One of Al Harrington's new teammates is more  
than twice his age. Several others were playing in the NBA when the 
18-year-old was in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the first-round draft choice has no qualms about joining  
the Indiana Pacers a few months after after getting his high school 
diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing with these guys and I feel like I belong,''  
Harrington said. ``I have no regrets about skipping college and 
feel relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Perkins, the oldest member of the Pacers at 37, has been  
impressed with what he's seen of the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al has a lot to learn,'' said Perkins, who is starting his  
15th NBA season. ``The enthusiasm that he has throughout practice 
just goes on. ... He's crazy. He doesn't know what's in store for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, at the same time he gives a shot in the arm to all of us.  
He has a lot of talent. He could be one of the premier stars of the 
league after three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington, who set a school record of 1,104 rebounds in three  
years at St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J., also can 
entertain his new teammates. He sang five solos playing the role of 
cowboy Frank Butler in his school's production of ``Annie Get Your 
Gun'' and sang a duet with Rosie O'Donnell on her television show. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting ready for the NBA was his top priority since being  
the first high school player selected in last summer's draft. He 
joined the Pacers for their minicamp, then stayed in town to work 
out with his future teammates during the six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason he can relax is that the 6-foot-9 forward is joining  
a veteran club that set a franchise record with 58 NBA victories 
last season and reached the seventh game of the Eastern Conference 
finals before losing to eventual NBA champion Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My defense is the big thing I need to work on,'' said  
Harrington, who scored 1,307 points and blocked 179 shots in high 
school. ``Scoring is not my responsibility. My role is to take care 
of a few minutes, be productive, grab rebounds, play defense and 
give the starters a breather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Larry Bird said Harrington is mature for his age.  
</P>
<P>
	``He fits in very nice with our guys,'' Bird said. ``All of them  
are looking out for him, trying to help him. You don't see it (his 
youth) on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how different is life for an 18-year-old with nine teammates  
30 or older? 
</P>
<P>
	``Being around these guys it's like I'm in high school,'' he  
said. ``We just all have fun together. I don't feel I have to prove 
anything to anybody but myself. I came here prepared for coach 
Bird's training camp. That was the biggest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one thing is different.  
</P>
<P>
	``I go to the training table for treatment after practice,'' he  
said. ``I never used to do that in high school.''

today what President Clinton and most other politicians have 
avoided saying: Any permanent solution to keep Social Security from 
going broke will almost certainly require increasing taxes or 
cutting benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan also  
repeated his criticism of one element of Clinton's plan, having the 
government investment around $700 billion of Social Security money 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Herculean efforts,'' Greenspan said, he doubted  
decisions on investing this money could be insulated from political 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	On the politically sensitive issue of benefit cuts or tax  
increases, Greenspan said the demographics of a huge baby boom 
generation retiring and fewer workers left to support retirees 
present policy-makers with few choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood, these taxes will have to be raised, or  
benefits cut, given that the system as a whole is still 
significantly underfunded,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in his State of the Union message, Clinton put forward  
a	   On that point, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, 
``We could not agree with him more on the fact that we need to do 
more. The president has made clear that he needs to work with 
Congress in order to reform. In addition to reserving the surplus 
and paying down the debt, we need to do more to reform the system. 
And we look forward to having that debate with Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in his State of the Union message, Clinton put forward  
a major proposal that would reserve about 60 percent of the 
government's projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years, an 
estimated $4.4 trillion, for shoring up the Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said changes to Social Security will also likely needed,  
but has not said what they should be. The president said he 
believes deep benefit cuts or increases in the payroll tax rate 
will not be necessary, however. Republican leaders in Congress have 
also said they want to avoid increasing taxes or reducing retirees' 
standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan in his prepared testimony made no comments about  
current economic conditions. The central bank cut interest rates 
three times last fall to keep the U.S. economy from being dragged 
into recession by the global financial crisis. But most analysts 
expect no further rate cuts unless global financial conditions once 
again threaten to destabilize the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's views carry great weight on Capitol Hill, given what  
most politicians believe has been his exceptional direction of 
monetary policy during the current lengthy period of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also considered a top authority on Social Security. He  
chaired the blue-ribbon commission that recommended the last major 
changes to the government's giant benefits program in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan praised the main thrust of Clinton's initiative, to  
pay down the national debt, but he said a section of the Clinton's 
program that would directly invest about $700 billion in the stock 
market was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has argued that decisions on where to invest  
this money would be made by an independent board insulated from 
political pressures. But Greenspan said he doubted this approach 
would work because the large sums of money being talked about would 
inevitable lead to pressures from elected officials to have a say 
in how that money was being used. 
</P>
<P>
	And political decisions on such investments would make the  
economy less efficient and ultimately lower Americans' standard of 
living, the central banker argues. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan did praise Clinton's proposal to reserve the bulk of  
coming budget surpluses for shoring up Social Security, calling it 
a ``major step in the right direction'' because it would boost 
America's low national savings rate. But he warned that the $4.4 
trillion in surpluses being projected over the next 15 years are 
based on uncertain economic forecasts and might well fall short of 
those projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that raising taxes to bolster Social Security may  
``prove too burdensome'' given that the government's second biggest 
social program, Medicare benefits for the elderly, will also need 
bolstering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed chairman did not express a preference for how benefits  
could be cut, but he did note several choices -- raising the 
retirement age, reducing payments or lowering the annual 
cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considerations such as these should not be taken off the  
table,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Black Lawyer Defending Klansman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILLSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A black lawyer representing a Ku Klux  
Klan member used the opinion of a black Supreme Court justice to 
bolster his argument that Virginia's cross-burning ban is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing Wednesday in was David Baugh's second attempt to get  
a judge to dismiss the cross-burning charge because it deprives his 
white client of his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll County Circuit Judge Duane Mink gave attorneys six weeks  
to submit additional arguments that he will consider before ruling 
whether the law is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Black, imperial wizard of the International Keystone  
Knights of the Klan, was charged on Aug. 22 with burning a cross in 
a public place, a felony punishable by one to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Black, 50, of Johnstown, Pa., was the leader of a KKK rally in a  
farm pasture where 18 people wearing robes with pointed hats and 
carrying torches stood around a 25-foot burning cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Baugh, a member of the American Civil Liberties Union's Virginia  
board of directors, cited a 1992 case in which the U.S. Supreme 
Court struck down a St. Paul, Minn., ordinance with language 
similar to the Virginia law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sole purpose of this statute is to suppress an expression  
of a group despised by the majority,'' Baugh said. ``I despise the 
KKK. But if we are going to have a democracy we are going to have 
dissent and we must tolerate political dissent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Gregory Goad argued that Virginia's law  
is different from Minnesota's because it is ``viewpoint neutral and 
equally prohibits cross-burning by anyone, to intimidate anyone, 
for any reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baugh said the state's argument was ``disingenuous.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody and their mother knows a cross burning is a racist  
political act,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baugh then quoted an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas in  
another cross-burning case: ``In Klan ceremony, the cross is a 
symbol of white supremacy and a tool for the intimidation and 
harassment of racial minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Mink upholds the law, Black, who was not in the courtroom,  
will be tried in March.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Martin Wants Redemption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tony Martin won't be able to sleep much on Saturday  
night. He never can the night before a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The clock will make its relentless march toward the dawn of  
another day -- 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, maybe even 3 -- but Martin 
fights off the urgency to slumber. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll visualize the game in his head, maybe seeing a touchdown  
catch or two, a champagne celebration, the presentation of the 
Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The following morning, having finally dozed for a few hours,  
Martin will begin to grasp the reality of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those hours leading up the game are always the hardest. He  
doesn't feel like eating -- ``That's why after the game, I'm 
starving'' -- and this Sunday will be more anxious than most. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, it's the Super Bowl. The opponent is the defending  
champion Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The butterflies are big for me in the hotel before the game,''  
the Falcons receiver admitted. ``It has to make you nervous, 
knowing that millions of people are going to be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, also playing in his hometown of Miami, a jittery  
Martin and the San Diego Chargers were on the receiving end of a 
Super-sized embarrassment, falling to San Francisco 49-26 in a 
title game that wasn't even that close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't perform very well at all, including myself,'' he  
recalled. ``I was real nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that palm-sweating experience, no one would blame Martin  
if he never wanted to go back. Last year, he invited a few friends 
to join him around the television set on Super Sunday, only to find 
that wasn't much fun, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather be at the game,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin never expected to get another chance in Atlanta. But last  
summer, after a trying season with the Chargers under then-coach 
Kevin Gilbride, he was dealt to the Falcons in a move he still 
finds baffling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I really knew why I got traded,'' Martin said. ``When  
it happened, I was going, `How could they trade their top 
receiver?' It was probably the biggest mistake in franchise 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might be overstating things a bit, but Martin -- acquired  
for a second-round draft pick -- has certainly made a key 
contribution toward the Falcons' first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Teaming with Terance Mathis, they gave the Falcons a pair of  
receivers with more than 1,100 yards -- numbers that were topped 
only by Minnesota's duo of Randy Moss and Cris Carter. Not than 
anyone seemed to notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no respect for the old guys,'' said Mathis, 31. ``We  
didn't talk about being the best tandem in the league. We just 
talked about being the best old guys at our position. We have fun 
with that. We've had fun with our age and the things we've overcome 
to get to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has a soulmate on the other side of the field.  
</P>
<P>
	``He and I work so well together,'' said Martin, who led the  
Falcons with 66 receptions for 1,181 yards and six touchdowns. ``I 
can't explain it. When I first got here, we just clicked like 
brothers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, they have a lot in common. Both were late-bloomers,  
struggling through their early years in the league. Martin, a 
college quarterback, didn't become a full-time starter until his 
seventh season. 
</P>
<P>
	Their styles are different, but complementary. Mathis had 64  
receptions for 1,136 yards and 11 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a gritty guy who will get in there and block and make the  
tough third-down catch,'' Martin said of Mathis. ``I can stretch 
the defense with my speed, get deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While overshadowed most of the season by other receivers, Martin  
certainly has the respect of the Broncos' secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year, he continues to get better,'' Denver cornerback Ray  
Crockett said. ``To me, Tony Martin is one of the best 
route-running receivers in the league. Everybody looks at him as a 
fast receiver, but no one gives him credit for his routes. There's 
no other receiver in the league that I've seen with the double 
moves and things to get deep like Tony Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to look at him as a receiver that you have to fear.''  
</P>
<P>
	Martin doesn't want to squander his chance at Super Bowl  
redemption. He's back in his hometown, close to his family and his 
friends, but determined to avoid the nightlife and distractions 
that turned the last trip into such a miserable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to avoid all the distractions,'' he said.  
``That's impossible. But you have to say no to some people. You 
can't please everybody. I try to tell that to the other guys. You 
have to understand that you're here to play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if he could only do something about those nerves.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Unveils New One Rate Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two phone services. One rate. One bill.  
</P>
<P>
	Sounds simple enough. And that's the key to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s  
Personal Network promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Sunday, AT&AMP;T will offer long-distance and wireless  
phone service on a single bill at the same rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative, which costs $29.99 a month and 10 cents a  
minute, could save heavy-volume callers money. The payment system 
unveiled Wednesday, the first of its kind from a major telephone 
company, also may prod AT&AMP;T's rivals to reduce the complexity of 
their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is going to get a lot simpler for anyone trying to  
juggle'' different services, AT&AMP;T president John Zeglis said in a 
teleconference. ``We're taking the confusion out of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the new AT&AMP;T plan, people don't need to worry about whether  
they are making a call using their cellular or home phone, said 
Fred Voit, an analyst with Yankee Group, a Boston-based research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a call,'' Voit said. ``This is going to be the  
future of telephony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other major phone companies offer customers some plans that are  
similar to parts of the AT&AMP;T initiative. Sprint Corp., for example, 
sells long-distance and mobile-phone service for 10 cents a minute, 
but doesn't put it on one bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Sprint spokesman said it was too early to say whether the  
company would follow AT&AMP;T's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T's Personal Network promotion is the company's latest effort  
to buoy its long-distance sales, which fell 3.6 percent last 
quarter as customers continued to defect to rival providers of 
cheaper service. 
</P>
<P>
	To encourage customer loyalty, the $29.99 plan requires  
customers to sign a one-year contract that obligates them to pay 
for a year's worth of service. In addition to mobile-phone and 
long-distance service, the promotion includes a personal toll-free 
number, with incoming calls costing 10 cents a minute, and a 
calling card for the same per-minute fee. 
</P>
<P>
	For $44.94 a month, AT&AMP;T throws in Internet access, including  
150 hours a month of use. 
</P>
<P>
	While AT&AMP;T is starting a big marketing push for its Personal  
Network plan, including a television commercial during the Super 
Bowl, the promotion is targeted to a select group of users -- 
technically savvy people who make a lot of calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-in-one package is worth it for customers who make at  
least 200 minutes of mobile-phone calls a month, and make most of 
those calls locally, said Samuel Simon, head of the 
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington 
D.C.-based consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan's 10-cents-a-minute rate applies only to calls made  
from a consumer's local calling area. The rate shoots up to 60 
cents a minute once mobile-phone users wander too far -- such as a 
Chicago resident who vacations in the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Those customers would be better off with AT&AMP;T's popular Digital  
One Rate promotion, a pricing package that charges users from 11 
cents to 15 cents a minute, no matter where they are calling from. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may well be able to find equal if not better individual  
plans,'' Simon said. ``It is a great rate for very heavy users.''

<HEADLINE> Alice Starr Speaks Out on Adultery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Put in the first lady's shoes, the wife of  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says she ``would rather not be 
married'' to a husband that is not faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Starr, in an interview in the March issue of the Ladies'  
Home Journal, said she could not imagine herself in Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's position, after the president admitted his affair with 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a vow to be faithful to one another when we married,''  
said the 49-year-old Mrs. Starr. ``We've lived up to that vow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if she were in Mrs. Clinton's place?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather not be married to someone who doesn't love me  
enough to remain faithful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Mrs. Starr also defended her husband's  
investigation of the president, calling his motivations 
``altruistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She admitted that her husband's sudden fame has made their life  
at home more difficult. U.S. marshals scan their mail for bombs and 
threats, guard their front door and shadow the three Starr 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	As for rumors that her daughter, Carolyn, who is a freshman at  
Stanford University, exchanged heated words with Chelsea Clinton, 
who is a sophomore there, Mrs. Starr said it isn't true and that 
the two have never met. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she ever met Chelsea, she'd give her a hug,'' said Mrs.  
Starr. Carolyn ``knows what a tremendous ordeal she's been 
through.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Thanks to Strong Dollar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Thursday with the help of a  
strong dollar, rising together with stocks for the first time this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/16  
point, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.12 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds had been moving in the opposite direction from stocks all  
week, rising when stocks fell thanks to their appeal as safe-haven 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Treasury market rose along with stocks Thursday as  
further gains in the dollar's value against other currencies helped 
make dollar-denominated securities more attractive to overseas 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged or up 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities were 
up 1/16 to 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, was off 
7.51 points at 1,321.12 . 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.47 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.37 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.23 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage 
point to 4.28 percent. One-year yields were 4.50 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.02 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.31 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.81 percent from 4.83 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 125 15/16 from 125 1/2. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.10 percent from 5.12.

<HEADLINE> Con Ed Sells Two NYC Electric Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Company of New York Inc. is  
selling two of its electric generating plants and 36 gas turbines 
to two energy companies for a combined total of $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison is divesting electric generating capacity located in  
New York City as part of the electric utility industry 
restructuring. In order to create a competitive wholesale 
electricity market, the generating facilities were divided into 
three groups, each of which will be purchased by a different 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	NRG Energy Inc. is purchasing the 842-megawatt Arthur Kill  
Generating Station on Staten Island and the 614-megawatt Astoria 
Gas Turbines in the borough of Queens for $505 million. 
</P>
<P>
	KeySpan Energy is purchasing the 1,753-megawatt Ravenswood  
Generating Station and the 415-megawatt Ravenswood Gas Turbines, 
both in Long Island City, Queens for $597 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids for the third group, which consists of the 1,090-megawatt  
Astoria Generating Station and the 765-megawatt Gowanus and Narrows 
Gas Turbines, are due in late February. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis-based NRG Energy, one of the largest independent  
power producers in the world, develops, and operates independent 
power production and cogeneration facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based KeySpan Energy subsidiaries distribute natural  
gas to nearly 1.6 million customers throughout New York City and 
Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Con Edison is one of the nation's largest utility  
companies, with more than $7 billion in annual revenues and $14 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	NRG and KeySpan said they will offer employment to all Con  
Edison employees working at the facilities being sold and will 
honor all union contracts.

	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- It's been more than three months since the  
body parts of Margarita Flores were discovered in Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flores, 40, was 8 1/2 months pregnant, a mother of five and had  
been lured from her home by someone posing as a charity worker with 
the promise of free baby furniture and a year's supply of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the woman accused of posing as the charity worker is  
charged in her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Josefina Sonia Saldana, 40, was charged Wednesday with two  
counts of first-degree murder. An arraignment scheduled for 
Thursday was delayed until Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flores was seen arguing with Ms. Saldana before she  
disappeared Sept. 14. Ms. Saldana was arrested on a kidnapping 
charge several days later when police learned she had brought a 
dead fetus to the hospital the day after Ms. Flores, 40, 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released the cause of death of the fetus,  
but tests showed it didn't belong to Ms. Saldana. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wouldn't reveal the results of DNA tests on Ms. Flores  
and the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The motive is undetermined at this time. The investigation is  
still ongoing,'' Detective Solomon Wells said Thursday. He would 
not reveal any other details in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Partial remains of Ms. Flores' body were found in the trash Oct.  
6 in Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Saldana hasn't made any comment on the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Standing outside the courtroom, Mrs. Flores' husband, Heliodoro  
Cruz, remembered how the last time he saw his wife, she was leaving 
with a woman to go to a warehouse to pick up the promised diapers 
and furniture. They never returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated because this is taking so long,'' Cruz said  
Thursday. ``I want this to end soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ms. Flores' five children, they are receiving counseling  
and are handling the loss of their mother better as time passes, 
Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult. They ask for her every day,'' he said.

	In the spotlight: Jennifer Jason Leigh  

</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* If you're looking for twisted and tormented, Jennifer  
Jason Leigh is your actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the characters I've played are very extroverted or out  
there or living on the edge,'' Leigh says. ``I don't live that way 
at all. But I care about them for some reason, or I want to explore 
that, or I want to be that for a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Robert Altman's ``Kansas City,'' she ruined her hair and  
wore a set of badly yellowed and broken false teeth. She played 
Blondie, a small-time gangster's wife who idolizes Jean Harlow, the 
glamorous movie star of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, if this girl's pretty, it's just not going to  
work,'' she explains. ``I wanted her to be something pathetic. It's 
what made me care about her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Jennifer Lee Morrow was born on Feb. 5, 1962,  
in Los Angeles. Her father was actor Vic Morrow, who died in a 1982 
helicopter crash while filming ``Twilight Zone: The Movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She made her first film appearance at 9. As a teen, she took the  
name Jennifer Jason Leigh, borrowing the middle part from family 
friend Jason Robards. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks before high school graduation, she dropped out of  
school and took a part in a low-budget horror flick, ``Eyes of a 
Stranger.'' In 1982, she starred in Amy Heckerling's brashly 
entertaining ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Leigh has sought to play psychologically troubled  
characters, usually ones with a streak of dark self-destruction. 
Her roles include a panorama of prostitutes, psychos, phone-sex 
suppliers and junkies in films like ``Miami Blues,'' ``Single White 
Female'' and ``Short Cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Upcoming:* Leigh will star in ``eXistenZ'' with Willem Dafoe.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Sees Good Old Trash Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The luminous, the lightweight and the loose-lipped  
have a way of stealing the Super Bowl spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	For every Joe Montana, John Riggins and Emmitt Smith, there's  
been a Mark Rypien, Larry Brown and Desmond Howard who took MVP 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
	For every serious game prediction, there's been a Joe Namath  
guarantee and a Jim McMahon moonshot. 
</P>
<P>
	And this year, there's the Shannon Sharpe-Ray Buchanan  
trashathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's Thursday's installment:  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe: ``Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the  
high heels away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just 
what I heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan: ``I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't tell  
me he doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta cornerback, who wore a dog collar to media day  
because the Falcons are considered underdogs, clearly isn't taking 
a backseat to the Broncos tight end in the dissing department. But 
that's one of the few areas where defending champion Denver and 
upstart Atlanta appear equal heading into Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrell Davis, last year's most valuable player in the big game  
-- and this season's NFL MVP -- frowns when asked which team fans 
were most familiar with, 
</P>
<P>
	his defending champions and Atlanta's first-timers.  
</P>
<P>
	``People rate you according to your status,'' said Davis, the  
fourth 2,000-yard rusher in league history this season, ``and if 
you start to live like that, I think it becomes a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what it takes for me to get ready to play on this  
level. I always make time to work out. I knew that was the most 
important thing for me ... even when I was on the road, I was 
working out in hotels. I know where my bread is buttered and it is 
on the field, not off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, the Broncos are far better known. They have a  
future Hall of Fame quarterback in John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	They have ``Romo,'' intimidating linebacker Bill Romanowski,  
whose antics -- spitting, stomping on opponents -- give him a 
recognizable image, even if it doesn't match his true persona. 

</P>
<P>
	They have Sharpe, the runaway winner of the runaway mouth award  
this week. His brother Sterling might appear more often on 
television as an ESPN commentator, but it's Shannon who has become 
the family's media star. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Ed McCaffrey, that rarity in the NFL, a white wide  
receiver. There's safety Steve Atwater, a terrifying tackler, and 
soup-seller DE Neil Smith, approaching 100 sacks for his career. 
And don't forget placekicker Jason Elam, who merely tied a 
28-year-old record by nailing a 63-yard field goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at it as being stars,'' fullback Howard Griffith  
said. ``We look at it as having good football players who know how 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, he quickly added, that's just what the Falcons have, even  
if hardly anyone outside of Georgia -- and many folks inside the 
state -- don't know it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They might not get the credit they deserve because they  
haven't been on a winning team that gets a lot of attention,'' 
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Take Chris Chandler, the Falcons quarterback, for example.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chris might not be considered a star, but he's as good as any  
of the so-called stars,'' Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	A losing tradition certainly has inhibited the development of  
headliners in Atlanta. Former Falcons such as Brett Favre, Deion 
Sanders and Andre Rison had to go elsewhere to become household 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's best defensive player, Jessie Tuggle, is the leading  
active tackler in the league and has made five Pro Bowls. Yet 
middle linebackers on such middling teams as the Dolphins (Zach 
Thomas), Steelers (Levon Kirkland) and Buccaneers (Hardy Nickerson) 
get far more publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Terance Mathis and Tony Martin don't get near the attention  
given the 49ers' Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens or the Jets' Keyshawn 
Johnson and Wayne Chrebet. But who had better numbers this season? 
</P>
<P>
	The only Falcons with much recognizability before this stunning  
season were placekicker Morten Andersen, who made his reputation in 
New Orleans; quarterback Steve DeBerg, who seems to have been a 
backup to all of the league's recent greats; and defenders Eugene 
Robinson and Cornelius Bennett who made it to the Super Bowl with 
other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that worry Atlanta? Heck no.  
</P>
<P>
	``People will know all about us,'' Tuggle said, ``if we win on  
Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Questions Keep Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe has all the answers, and yet the  
Super Bowl questions keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Ray Buchanan wear his dog collar Sunday? Will Paul  
Tagliabue do the Dirty Bird if the Atlanta Falcons win? Will John 
Elway ever quit? Will Sharpe ever quit talking? 
</P>
<P>
	The game is only two days away, and we still don't know. But the  
final day of media access to players Thursday yielded a few clues. 
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS HUNGRIER?   	
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons are in the Super Bowl for the first time in their  
33-year history, and linebacker Jessie Tuggle has been with them 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was part of the problem; I wanted to be part of the  
solution,'' he says. ``We're not satisfied. It has been a long time 
coming, and I'm just trying to seize the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sounds hungry. On the other hand, Denver Broncos cornerback  
Ray Crockett sits at an interview table with a cup of coffee, two 
half-eaten muffins and an empty bag of chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS MORE INTIMIDATING?   	
</P>
<P>
	The taunt-trading between Sharpe and Buchanan escalates into a  
war of words worthy of pro wrasslin'. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon looks like a horse,'' says Buchanan, the Falcons' Pro  
Bowl cornerback. ``I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't 
tell me he doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's comments are quickly relayed by reporters to Sharpe,  
the Broncos' Pro Bowl tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that?'' Sharpe responds. ``Well, I think he's ugly,  
but did I ever call him that? No. Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the 
lipstick and the high heels away. I'm not saying he's a 
cross-dresser; that's just what I heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Broncos.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS QUICKER?   	
</P>
<P>
	A reporter asks Atlanta's Cornelius Bennett, ``Do you feel the  
game is getting closer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is,'' Bennett responds quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the 38-year-old Elway fields one final question  
before playing perhaps his final game. 
</P>
<P>
	``John, you say you're a smarter quarterback as you've gotten  
older. How much smarter are you having Terrell Davis in the 
backfield?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a genius,'' Elway responds quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	Edge: none.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS HEALTHIER?   	
</P>
<P>
	Bennett is 0-4 in Super Bowls, so it's not surprising to learn  
he's a bit queasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have one of the worst stomach problems in the history of the  
league,'' he says. ``I take medicine twice a day for a nervous 
stomach. Sometimes I have a bout of diarrhea. But those are just 
juices that tell you you're getting ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos guard Mark Schlereth is also hurting, and not just  
because he has undergone surgery 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real pain to sit in this hot tent and answer the same  
questions over and over,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: none.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS BETTER PREPARED?   	
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta offensive lineman Bob Hallen sits with nine empty chairs  
at an interview table reading a sports column headlined, ``This war 
to be won in trenches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver receiver Andre Cooper, also by himself, reads the daily  
stock market summary. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH BACKUP QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN TESTED BY THE SUPER BOWL  
PRESSURE? 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 45-year-old Steve DeBerg is surrounded by four  
cameras, five tape recorders, 10 notepads and Hall of Fame 
quarterback Sonny Jurgensen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to come talk to you,'' Jurgensen says. ``You're the only  
guy here older than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Denver's Bubby Brister is interviewed by three reporters,  
including two from the same wire service. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Falcons.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH COACH IS ON THE VERGE OF CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE?   	
</P>
<P>
	Denver's Mike Shanahan dismisses the suggestion he's a candidate  
for burnout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It always seems to me the guys who have burnout have a lot of  
money in the bank,'' he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Dan Reeves, meanwhile, squints at a foreign reporter  
who speaks with a thick accent. 
</P>
<P>
	``How valuable is Morten Andersen to you?'' the reporter asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``Where are you from?'' Reeves says.  
</P>
<P>
	``Denmark,'' the reporter answers.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh,'' Reeves says. ``I thought you were from south Georgia.''  
</P>
<P>
	Edge: none.  
</P>
<P>
	-- WHICH TEAM IS MORE TALENTED?   	
</P>
<P>
	Broncos tight end Byron Chamberlain answers a question while  
holding his Mini-Disc player in one hand and his cell phone in the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Falcons defensive tackle Esera Tuaolo demonstrates  
his vocal skill for a camera crew by singing the national anthem 
and the gospel song ``Eyes On The Sparrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be in the choir in school,'' he says, ``but I  
never had the chance because I grew up on a banana farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: none.

<HEADLINE> New Bears Coach Hires 3 Assistants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- New Chicago Bears coach Dick Jauron is  
counting on an old friend and a guy he barely knows to help him in 
his first NFL coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron on Thursday announced he's hired Indianapolis defensive  
line coach Greg Blache as his defensive coordinator and Louisiana 
Tech coach Gary Crowton as his offensive coordinator. Rex Norris 
was hired as the defensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Blache, who's been in Indianapolis the past five seasons, and  
Jauron worked together as assistants in Green Bay under Mike 
Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very bright guy, a hardworking guy. I think he's an  
articulate guy, a loyal man,'' Jauron said. ``I know what he's 
about, I know he'll work hard for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two complement each other, Blache said. While Jauron is  
laid-back to the point of being unflappable -- ``When nuclear bombs 
go off, Dick's not going to flinch,'' Blache said -- Blache is the 
``wild man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron, Jacksonville's former defensive coordinator, said he  
doesn't plan to call plays. But Blache said it wouldn't bother him 
if Jauron did. There won't be any ego clashes between the two 
friends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We approach the game pretty much the same way,'' Blache said.  
``My ego is not about it having to be done my way. I get 
satisfaction out of winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton put together one of the nation's most dangerous offenses  
at Louisiana Tech. The Bulldogs' pro-style offense averaged 542 
yards per game last season -- second-best in the nation -- and led 
the nation with 429.8 yards passing per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton was 21-13 in his three seasons at Louisiana Tech.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of confidence in his ability, his ability to  
score points, to put a lot of pressure on a defense,'' Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron hasn't worked with Crowton before, but he's worked with  
enough people who have. Crowton was quarterbacks coach at Boston 
College from 1991-93 under Tom Coughlin, Jauron's boss in 
Jacksonville, and he comes highly recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream I had as a youngster, to make it one day to  
the NFL,'' Crowton said. ``It's the highest level of football, and 
it's where I always wanted to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither Blache nor Crowton have any experience as NFL  
coordinators -- Crowton's never coached in the NFL at any level -- 
Jauron said he's not too concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Blache spent 10 years as an assistant at Notre Dame and Tulane  
before becoming the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville 
Bulls of the USFL in 1983. He spent two years with the Bulls, and 
then a year each at Southern University and Kansas before landing 
in Green Bay in 1988. He was the Packers' defensive line coach for 
six seasons before moving to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	After stints as an assistant at Brigham Young, Snow Junior  
College and Western Illinois from 1982-87, Crowton was New 
Hampshire's quarterbacks coach from 1988-90. He moved to Boston 
College from there. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton also was offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech (1994)  
and Louisiana Tech (1995). 
</P>
<P>
	``You want some experience, yes,'' Jauron said. ``(But) I think  
you have to believe the guy you're hiring is the best guy for you 
and your organization, and that's what we're doing.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are making  
progress as the delayed start of the NBA season approaches. Coach 
Del Harris just isn't sure how much progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he's never been in this position before.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're doing all right,'' Harris said after a scrimmage  
Wednesday night. ``I like the guys' attitudes. We've got work to 
do. I'm counting on guys really applying themselves these last 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played a little better, a little less sloppy  
(than in Monday night's scrimmage at UC Santa Barbara). But we 
still obviously need all the time we have allotted to us to smooth 
our game out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were making their first appearance at the Forum in  
eight months -- since they were swept by Utah in the Western 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17,505-seat arena was about half full. The fans were quite  
receptive and pretty boisterous throughout the scrimmage, which 
lasted a little over two hours. Tickets were distributed free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage consisted of five periods, with players being used  
on both the Gold and Purple teams and the score reverting to 0-0 at 
the beginning of each period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal's first shot was blocked from the side by  
6-foot-6 rookie Ruben Patterson, drawing oohs and aahs from the 
crowd. Shortly thereafter, the fans groaned when O'Neal missed his 
first two foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were two of the few he missed, though. O'Neal led all  
scorers with 31 points including 9-of-14 from the foul line. Rick 
Fox scored 26 points, Bryant had 23, and Patterson and Travis 
Knight added 20 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Sam Jacobson missed most of the scrimmage after suffering  
a strained hip flexor. He's listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who practiced formally for the first time at UC  
Santa Barbara last Thursday, face the Los Angeles Clippers in 
exhibition games Friday and Saturday nights, and open the 
abbreviated season Feb. 5 against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the scrimmage, 12-year-old actress Lindsay Ridgeway sang  
``The Star Spangled Banner,'' and longtime announcer Chick Hearn, 
who hasn't missed a Lakers broadcast in over 34 years, introduced 
Harris and the team's 14 players. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if the lockout had never occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see you back,'' Hearn told the cheering fans.  
``And this is only the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things were handled quite informally. Harris and each player  
spoke briefly to the crowd from midcourt before the scrimmage 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	The warmest receptions went to Hearn, O'Neal, Bryant and Eddie  
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the LA fans -- the best fans in the world,'' O'Neal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player heard some boos mixed in with the cheers --  
backup forward/center Elden Campbell, the subject of preseason 
trade rumors but apparently about to start his ninth year with the 
team.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Leaving Congress Feb. 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bob Livingston, who last month made the  
surprise decision to leave Congress just weeks before he was to 
become speaker of the House, said Wednesday he will formally resign 
on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, R-La., said he met with Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster  
over the weekend, and they agreed on the date so that special 
elections to fill the seat could take place in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having consulted with legal counsel and the governor of  
Louisiana, it has become apparent that in order for a special 
midterm election to be held this spring, I have no choice but to 
vacate my office by no later than Feb. 28, 1999,'' he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He formally announced his resignation date in a letter to  
Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, who has represented his state's 1st District  
centering in Metairie since 1977, stunned his colleagues when he 
announced during the debate on impeaching President Clinton on Dec. 
19 that he would not seek the House speakership and would step down 
from his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, Livingston, heading off press exposes,  
acknowledged that he had had extramarital affairs that had nearly 
destroyed his 33-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, new Speaker  
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., named Livingston as Appropriations Committee 
chairman, a pivotal position in deciding how federal funds are 
distributed every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston led GOP efforts to trim government spending, but also  
resisted efforts by his fellow conservatives to attach 
controversial legislation to spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gingrich announced that he was leaving Congress after  
Republicans lost seats to the Democrats in last November's 
election, Livingston was the overwhelming choice of his party to 
become the next speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	A special election to fill Gingrich's seat is scheduled for Feb.  
23. Currently there are 222 Republicans in the House, with 211 
Democrats and one Democratic-suppporting independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was elected House speaker on Jan.  
6.

<HEADLINE> Wages, Benefits Rise 3.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer programmers on the West Coast, real  
estate agents and Wall Street traders are among the Americans who 
enjoyed robust increases in their wages and benefits last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone is sharing in the biggest overall compensation  
increase in five years. Those with lackluster gains include factory 
workers in the Midwest, textile mill employees in the South and 
minimum-wage earners across industries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a considerable gap in wage growth in various parts of  
the country,'' said economist Mark Vitner of First Union Corp. in 
Charlotte, N.C. ``The strongest gains are currently in the West, 
where ... the high-tech sector helped drive wages up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, brisk economic growth driven by consumer spending  
pushed up wages and benefits by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip in 
five years and a slight improvement over the 3.3 percent gain in 
1997, the Labor Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third consecutive year that compensation increased  
faster than the year before. Although modest when compared with 
gains of around 5 percent in the late 1980s, the latest rise 
represents a significant increase in purchasing power because 
inflation in consumer prices fell to just 1.6 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, some regions and occupations recorded considerably  
slower growth, reflecting spillover from the world economic slump 
and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages slowed in the Midwest, where factories have begun to  
struggle a bit, Vitner said. The slowing was even more dramatic in 
the South, where a weakening energy sector and layoffs in the 
textile and apparel industry have limited increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation increased 4.9 percent in the West, up from 3.5  
percent the year before. But it went up just 2.6 percent in the 
South, down from 3.8 percent. It rose 3.3 percent in both the 
Northeast and Midwest. That was an improvement for the Northeast 
over 1997, when compensation rose 3 percent but a decline in the 
Midwest, where it had been 3.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996 and 1997, certain occupations, such as home health care,  
and certain regions, such as the South, got a boost because of 
minimum-wage increases, 50 cents an hour in 1996 and 40 cents in 
1997. There was no such increase last year, noted economist Mark 
Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing some real weakness in compensation growth in  
retail trade .. and low-end health services,'' he said. ``It's why 
there was a significant deceleration in the South.'' That region 
has a larger share of low-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Job categories with weaker growth included transportation and  
material-moving, 1.4 percent, and health services, 0.9 percent. 
Retail trade compensation increased 3 percent, but -- just in the 
final three months of the year -- it fell 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation increased robustly at public utilities, 5 percent,  
reflecting severance payments resulting from deregulation, 
particularly at telephone companies. In finance, insurance and real 
estate, it rose 5.9 percent, reflecting record home sales and the 
expanding mutual-fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation numbers are being tracked carefully by  
inflation-wary policy-makers at the Federal Reserve. They are 
scheduled to meet next week to decide whether to change interest 
rates. Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers last week that the 
possible emergence of wage pressure is one of the central bank's 
principal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists, however, say they see little chance of a surge this  
year if overall economic growth slows as they expect. The 
fourth-quarter compensation increase, 0.7 percent, was weaker than 
the rise in the July-September period, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, the advance in just wages and salaries -- excluding  
benefits such as health insurance -- actually slowed slightly, to 
3.7 percent, compared with 3.8 percent in 1997. Benefit costs, 
however, increased 2.6 percent, up from 2.1 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Labor Department said seasonally  
adjusted first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped 
by 15,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 301,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories for  
big-ticket durable goods jumped 1.9 percent in December, a strong 
ending to the weakest year since the last recession.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Target Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the world's major scientific  
organizations took a cautious step into the global warming debate 
Thursday, and its entry promptly drew criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	A policy statement from the American Geophysical Union concluded  
that, despite some uncertainties, evidence is growing that release 
of human-produced chemicals into the air will change climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world may already be committed to some degree of  
human-caused climate change,'' said Tim Killeen, a professor of 
atmospheric science at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	While not recommending specific policy steps to counter the  
threat, the union concluded that ``the present level of scientific 
uncertainty does not justify inaction'' regarding plans and 
policies to prevent climatic change. 
</P>
<P>
	The product of a year's study of scientific research, the policy  
statement does not purport to provide new evidence, only to put the 
geophysical union on record in light of current evidence. A similar 
policy statement was issued in 1990 by the American Meteorological 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The AGU's decision to issue the statement attracted quick fire  
from groups that contend sufficient evidence does not exist to link 
global climate change with chemicals in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that this distinguished science organization has  
succumbed to political correctness at the expense of scientific 
integrity,'' said Paul Georgia, of the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, a public policy think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American Geophysical Union has betrayed science and  
embraced politics in ... calling for governmental action to stop 
global warming,'' the Institute said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The AGU statement carefully avoids recommending action to stop  
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it recommends development and consideration of ways to  
reduce emissions and to adapt to any climate changes that may 
occur, leaving the final decision on action to government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Science cannot be the sole source of guidance on how society  
should respond to climate issues,'' the statement concludes. It 
notes climate change could be beneficial in some areas, damaging in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer Alert, which describes itself as a nonpartisan consumer  
organization, also attacked the American Geophysical Union 
statement as espousing the ``gloom and doom scenarios of global 
warming advocates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide and other chemicals have been increasing in the  
atmosphere for more than a century as wastes from industry and 
automobiles were added to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	In dispute is whether these changes have actually had an impact  
or whether recent warm seasons remain within normal variability of 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
	One camp worries that action to reduce chemicals in the air will  
come too late to prevent dangerous overheating of the climate. The 
other frets that unnecessary or premature action will damage the 
economy and cost jobs in the energy industries. 
</P>
<P>
	One focus has been last year's Kyoto protocol, an international  
agreement specifying reductions in carbon emissions. The Clinton 
administration has not yet submitted the agreement to the Senate, 
where its future seems bleak. 
</P>
<P>
	The AGU said it produced the statement, approved unanimously by  
a 26-member board, in an effort to offer guidance about the 
scientific consensus on global warming. Union members were offered 
a chance to comment on the statement via the organization's 
Internet page, and changes were made after many did so, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington-based American Geophysical Union has about 35,000  
members around the world, mostly scientists engaged in Earth and 
planetary research.

<HEADLINE> Military Pay Raise on GOP Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to provide the military with an  
across-the-board 4.8 percent pay raise next January, with the 
possibility of larger increases later to reward achievement and 
encourage re-enlistment, is heading for early Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay raise, if enacted, would be the largest for the military  
since 1982. The measure would also provide more generous retirement 
and GI Bill educational benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,  
said the legislation would contribute to the ``desperate need to 
stop, for the 14th year, a decline in defense spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His panel overwhelmingly endorsed it on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Soon the full Senate will be acting on this bill, and I expect  
to receive strong bipartisan support,'' Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., meanwhile, put the  
bill high on a list of measures on which he said he expected quick 
action -- once the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton has 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to do something quickly about the military,'' Lott  
told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``We've got to pay attention to 
the fact that morale is down, we are losing ground in readiness, 
and on pay and pensions we are shortchanging them and they are 
getting out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also predicted early Senate debate on education legislation  
and on bills on the Federal Aviation Administration, juvenile 
crime, bankruptcy reform, financial services reform, a second round 
of changes in welfare programs and fast-track trade negotiating 
authority for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also predicted early Senate consideration of measures to  
help ease year 2000 computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he thought Clinton's trial would be over in ``two  
weeks at the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And then we have work to do,'' he said. ``We need to get a  
burst of activity to show that we are attending to the people's 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has asked for a $12 billion increase in defense  
spending, including a 4.4 percent salary increase next January. 
Warner called that amount inadequate, but praised Clinton for 
recognizing the need to turn around the decline in defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have done in the committee is a first step in trying  
to restore the morale and readiness of our armed forces,'' said 
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a senior committee Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 11,000 enlisted families in the United States military  
on food stamps today. That's a disgrace, and we've got to stop it. 
... I hope the administration will give its wholehearted support, 
rather than its halfhearted and dilatory support of the compelling 
requirements of the military,'' McCain added. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides raising military pay, the committee's legislation would  
overhaul the retirement system, restoring the 50 percent basic 
retirement pay at 20 years service that was in force before 1986, 
when it was lowered to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also adopted a proposal by Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga.,  
who ran the Veterans Administration during the Carter 
administration, that would eliminate the $1,200 contribution 
required of military members who elect to participate in the GI 
Bill, which helps pay for college. It would also allow the 
educational benefits to be transferred to a spouse or child, at the 
discretion of the Defense Department.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Gets Crucial Support in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush's loss is Steve Forbes'  
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grubbs, former Iowa Republican chairman and a key state  
operative, has agreed to work for Forbes' presidential campaign 
after flirting with the Bush camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just spent the last two months evaluating the situation,  
looking at all the candidates, and decided finally it's Steve 
Forbes' ideas I want to see succeed,'' Grubbs said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is a coup for Forbes, who is trying to build a campaign  
organization after spending $4 million in Iowa three years ago only 
to finish fourth in the state's first-in-the-nation presidential 
caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't stop with Grubbs.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes strategist Bill Dal Col says three of the state's top  
social conservatives have said they would support the millionaire 
businessman: Bobbie Gobel, head of the Christian Coalition; Steve 
Scheffler, former field director for the Christian Coalition; and 
Nancy Streck, a top activist. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gobel ally says she will ``be supportive'' but won't leave the  
Christian Coalition. The coalition's support could be critical to 
Forbes as he tries to court social conservative voters he alienated 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also has lined up the leadership of Sen. Phil Gramm's  
1996 Iowa team, including Bob House, Troy Bishop, Chad Olson and 
John Steinman. Gramm finished fifth in the Iowa primary. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Grubbs  
presented a detailed campaign plan for Iowa that included putting 
him on the payroll immediately and reinforcing the Iowa staff March 
1. The timetable was too quick for Bush, who has not decided 
whether to run, and Grubbs didn't want to wait, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	An ally of Forbes, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
Grubbs felt Bush wasn't following through on commitments regarding 
resources for the Iowa campaign. Indeed, speculation has increased 
in the state that Bush may not campaign hard in Iowa if he runs, a 
suggestion dismissed by Bush allies who say the governor can't 
commit resources to a campaign he has yet to launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the Forbes and Bush allies, Grubbs said: ``They're  
both right to a certain extent. The bottom line is Iowa is going to 
be competitive, and Steve Forbes is the candidate I believe will 
make the commitment to win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, is expected to form an exploratory  
committee or announce that he is not running in March. Forbes has 
not formally announced his intentions but is almost certain to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will be in Washington this weekend to attend the  
closed-door Alfalfa Club dinner. The club exists solely to host the 
annual dinner at which a presidential nominee is meaninglessly 
anointed and the city's political elite crack jokes about each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's father, former President George Bush, also is expected to  
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	While in town, the Texas governor plans to meet with old  
political allies, and the subject of a likely presidential race 
will almost certainly come up, advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential rival, former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander,  
plans to announce his candidacy March 9 in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't be wearing a checkered shirt, the trademark of his  
failed 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No more plaid shirts,'' spokesman Steve Schmidt said Thursday  
by telephone from Alexander's Nashville office. ``It got in the way 
of his message last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, also seeking the GOP presidential  
nomination, is making his first trek to New Hampshire since he 
became a candidate. He will meet privately with supporters in 
Manchester, N.H., on Saturday before taking questions from 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore will be in the state Feb. 3, hoping to  
build on a political organization that has made him an early 
favorite against former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only 
Democrat to announce his opposition to the vice president so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made his first trip to the first-in-the-nation primary  
state this week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton will travel to New Hampshire this month to  
give Gore a political boost. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, former American Red Cross director  
Elizabeth Dole will be in the state Feb. 8 to deliver a 
long-scheduled speech. Allies say she is more likely than ever to 
form a presidential exploratory committee and might time her 
decision to coincide somehow with the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole has been calling supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ford To Buy Volvo Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is buying the passenger  
car division of Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.45 billion, adding another 
premium brand name to the portfolio of the world's No. 2 automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today, Ford is expected to assume  
ownership of Volvo Cars' worldwide sites, including three assembly 
plants and two powertrain plants in Europe and the 
passenger-vehicle product development center in Goteborg, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also gets the right to use the Volvo brand for passenger  
cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks. Volvo 
retains its corporate brand for commercial vehicles and 
non-automotive products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said Volvo was one of many  
companies with which Ford has been talking following last year's 
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. Car makers around the 
world are trying to boost their profits and efficiency through 
acquisitions and joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has been talking to everybody in the industry for at  
least the past year,'' the FOrd chairman said. But he said 
negotiations with Volvo intensified in the last month after Ford 
executives became convinced ``Volvo wanted us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by regulators and stockholders.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford stock was up 44 cents to $60.75 per share in early trading  
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is no stranger to Sweden, where the U.S. automaker has been  
operating since 1924 and now sells passenger and commercial 
vehicles through an 87-dealer network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just in Sweden, we are part of Sweden,'' said Jac  
Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive officer. ``And through 
our new relationship with Volvo, we plan to be part of the fabric 
of the country for many years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo said the sale would allow the company to concentrate on  
improving its other operations, including commercial trucks and 
interests in construction equipment, marine engines and aerospace 
equipment. It also said the sale of Volvo Cars will allow that unit 
to invest more in development and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo Cars' future prospects will, by being an important part  
of one of the world's largest and most profitable automotive 
groups, improve considerably,'' said Leif Johansson, Volvo AB 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is complementary for both companies, with no overlap  
of brands, said analyst Gregory Kagay of McDonald &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of like a whale swallowing a guppy,'' Kagay said.  
``The implications for the industry are not overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts questioned the price tag. Nick Colas of Credit  
Suisse First Boston said, ``It's an interesting acquisition but an 
over-the-top price. ... It exceeds the financial value of Volvo'' 
by $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	However, William Clay Ford Jr. said the price was ``very fair''  
given Volvo's potential for growth worldwide. Ford also said the 
presence of other bidders did not alter Ford's price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our price was our price going in and we didn't get caught in a  
lot of last-minute bidding up,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has been one of several auto companies considering mergers  
or acquisitions since the DaimlerChrysler merger. Italy's Fiat SpA 
and Germany's Volkswagen AG had reportedly expressed interest in 
Volvo, but recent speculation had focused on Fiat and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine reported Wednesday that Ford's offer won  
out over a $7 billion bid by Fiat SpA, which also wanted to 
purchase Volvo's commercial truck business. Ford has nearly $24 
billion in cash, Fiat just a $1.5 billion reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat confirmed today it only wanted to buy the entire company.  
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of just the car sector wasn't in our strategic  
interests and therefore was never part of our negotiations,'' the 
company said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring Volvo will allow Ford to expand its 10 percent share  
of the European market by offering a broader line of near-luxury 
sedans and station wagons. Volvo would also help Ford in its effort 
to market itself as a leader in automotive safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford already owns Britain's Jaguar Cars Ltd., whose cars are  
priced well above Volvo's. Ford's European cars, meanwhile, are 
priced below Volvo's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is there's so little overlap, even with  
Jaguar,'' said analyst Joe Phillippi of Lehman Brothers. ``Volvo 
prices end way before Jaguar prices start, so that's not really an 
issue. In Europe, it helps them enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford earned $22 billion last year, more than triple the $6.9  
billion it earned in 1997, but that included a $16 billion gain 
from the spin-off of The Associates, a financial subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, one of the world's smaller automakers, sold nearly  
400,000 cars last year, 100,200 of them in the United States. 
Sweden was its second-largest market, with 53,600 cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Volvo has been involved in merger  
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders blocked a proposed merger with Renault SA of France  
in 1993. Opponents, mostly small shareholders in Sweden and 
midlevel managers, were worried about control of Volvo and jobs 
moving outside Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be less of a concern with Ford as an owner, based on  
the way the automaker has handled its acquisition of Jaguar, 
keeping it as a largely separate entity based in England. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Nasser stressed that Ford has no plans to make major  
changes in the way Volvo operates. Volvo's management will stay in 
place and the ``personality'' of its cars will remain intact, he 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Christer Karlsson, a Stockholm School of Economics professor,  
said Ford was the best partner for Volvo among those that were in 
acquisition discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a disaster if they Americanized Volvo, but I'm  
sure that they don't want to damage the trademark, but rather 
strengthen it,'' he said. ``Ford has let Jaguar stay an English 
car.''

<HEADLINE> Family Sues State Over Foster Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When the state needed to find a foster home for a  
troubled 15-year-old girl, a family from a wealthy suburb welcomed 
her into their home. 
</P>
<P>
	The welcome didn't last long. Within 18 months, the girl had  
been sent elsewhere after she allegedly lured the family's 
11-year-old son into sex and later became pregnant with his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost a decade later, the family is suing the state,  
saying social workers concealed the girl's sexual history and 
negligently put her in a home where she could seduce a young boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't consensual sex. He didn't even know anything about  
sex,'' the boy's mother told jurors earlier this week as the trial 
opened in Suffolk Superior Court. Testimony was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit against the Department of Social Services and  
Mentor Inc., a private agency that placed the girl, the family said 
it was not told the teen was promiscuous and had a possible history 
of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials say they informed the family of her troubled  
background. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave (the foster mother) the information that she needed --  
that she was sexually aggressive and they needed to supervise 
her,'' Frank Fitzgerald, the Mentor caseworker who paired the teen 
with the family, testified on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The foster parents shook their heads during Fitzgerald's  
testimony, and their 20-year-old son hung his head. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was placed with the family, then living in Duxbury, in  
1990, and the seductions allegedly took place that year and the 
next, until the boy's mother found the two children embracing in 
June 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the family then ended its care of the girl, but did  
not learn she was pregnant until after she was moved from the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 23, was never charged with a crime. The boy's  
family reportedly has had some contact with her and her 6-year-old 
daughter, now living just north of Boston in Revere. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to their lawsuit, parents are also worried the state  
could make their son reimburse Massachusetts for aid given the 
mother since the child's birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Murphy, a Department of Revenue spokeswoman, said the agency  
had not issued an order seeking reimbursement. But she conceded it 
had moved for an order to establish paternity in the case, a 
preliminary step in seeking child support and back payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts have been suspended pending the outcome of the  
civil lawsuit case, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mentor learned the foster mother had caught the two  
children embracing, the agency filed a child abuse neglect 
petition, claiming the two had not been properly supervised. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's lawyer, Michael Giunta, suggested the move was a  
ruse to cover the agency's foster-care placement.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Aide Created Phony Church List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- Although the National Baptist Convention USA  
boasted of having 8.5 million members, the black church 
organization's mailing list never exceeded 15,000, a former 
assistant for the group's president testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonita Henderson, the Rev. Henry J. Lyons' former administrative  
assistant, said the convention claimed to encompass 33,000 
churches, but its own list showed between 5,000 and 7,000 churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Henderson said she did not know where the 8.5 million  
figure originated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Lyons told me nobody really knew. They just gave out the  
number,'' she testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henderson later said that Lyons created a phony list of  
church members by using a $90 set of phone discs from a computer 
store. She said she used the directory to store millions of names, 
addresses and phone numbers on floppy disks for Lyons to sell to a 
life insurance company that thought it was getting the convention's 
mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are charged  
with racketeering. They allegedly financed a lavish lifestyle by 
swindling more than $4 million from corporations -- such as the life 
insurance company -- seeking to do business with the convention's 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said the 8.5 million figure was a hoax used to  
attract companies. They estimate the convention's membership may 
have been fewer than 1 million people. However, the total is 
difficult to estimate because churches in the convention generally 
did not share their membership lists with the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henderson also testified that she'd had a sexual affair with  
Lyons, who paid her rent on her Tampa apartment and shared her bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons is also charged with stealing $250,000 the Anti-Defamation  
League of B'nai B'rith donated to rebuild burned black churches in 
the South.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon To Get $2.5M Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The millions of tourists who visit Grand Canyon  
National Park each year soon will be spared what the park 
superintendent says are moth-eaten exhibits in ancient buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Del E. Webb Foundation on Thursday announced a $2.5 million  
donation to the Grand Canyon National Park Foundation for the 
renovation of the Community Building, built in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of five historic but outdated buildings at the South  
Rim that will be improved and transformed into a Heritage Education 
Campus, featuring the latest technological bells and whistles to 
showcase the canyon's human, geological and natural history. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based Del Webb will provide $500,000 a year for five  
years to transform the Community Building into an education center 
brimming with classrooms, interpretive centers, meeting rooms, 
offices, an outdoor deck with rock garden and other features. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other buildings will also be renovated over the next  
several years as part of a $55 million facelift. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy wear and tear from ever-growing numbers of tourists -- some  
5 million annually -- and the park's ancient infrastructure have 
taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Superintendent Robert Arnberger said the new education  
complex marks the start of a dramatic shift in the way visitors 
experience the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground will be broken April 23 on the Canyon View Information  
Plaza, the hub of a mass-transit system designed to end automobile 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex and light-rail system, which will whisk tourists to  
the rim from Tusayan, just south of the park, are ``the most 
significant changes that man has marked on the Grand Canyon,'' 
Arnberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The light-rail system is scheduled to be up and running in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Antione Walker: Next Scoring Champ? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- Now that Michael Jordan is gone, somebody  
has to lead the NBA in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Why not Antoine Walker?  
</P>
<P>
	``Me?'' he said. ``I don't know. It's hard to say because you  
never know what your role's going to be on this team. We've got a 
lot of guys who can score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other Boston Celtics has done it as well as Walker.  
</P>
<P>
	He was 31st in the NBA in scoring with a 17.5 point average as a  
rookie, then jumped to fifth last season at 22.4. Jordan won the 
scoring title in the last 10 years he played in the NBA, 
interrupted only by a stint in minor-league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	His retirement leaves the race wide open. In addition to Jordan,  
only Shaquille O'Neal, Karl Malone and Mitch Richmond outscored 
Walker last season. And now the Celtics have added shooting coach 
Andy Enfield to help Walker, a 64 percent free-throw shooter, and 
his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get better at free throws if I plan on having the  
ball late in the game when you get fouled,'' Walker said. ``That's 
not something that I'm overly concerned about because I know I'm 
capable of doing that with a little concentration, a little work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the 6-foot-9 Walker averaged 20.8 shots per game  
but hit only 42.3 percent of them. Still, he led the team in 
scoring in 55 games. Rookie Ron Mercer was second, leading 14 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercer should improve on his 15.3-point average, and rookie  
Paul Pierce provides added offensive punch. And point guard Kenny 
Anderson, limited by injury to 16 games last season with Boston 
after being traded by Toronto, is adept at distributing the ball to 
the open man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to get everyone involved,'' guard Dana Barros said  
of Anderson. ``I think if Antoine was on a team that didn't have as 
much scoring and wasn't playing the type of style that we were, 
maybe he could lead the league. But I don't think he will now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, the highly-touted rookie from Kansas, already is  
impressed with Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can lead this league in almost every offensive category,''  
Pierce said. ``He's that good a talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker tied for seventh in the NBA last season with 10.2  
rebounds per game. For the Celtics, he was first in steals and 
second in assists and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics prefer a running style that should improve now that  
they have Anderson for a full season. That means they're not likely 
to call a lot of plays for Walker or isolate him on a defender. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fine with general manager Chris Wallace if Walker doesn't  
replace Jordan as the NBA's leading scorer, but he wouldn't mind if 
Walker emulated other parts of Jordan's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has that capability'' to be the top scorer, Wallace said.  
``I think we would prefer to have an Antoine Walker that's ranked 
very high in a number of statistical categories ... and we're 
winning. We're more concerned about that than leading the league in 
scoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That philosophy has worked for the Celtics throughout their  
glorious history. No team has won more than their 16 NBA titles. 
Yet they've never had a league scoring leader. Not Bob Cousy. Not 
Bill Russell. Not John Havlicek. Not Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe not Walker even if Jordan no longer has a lock on the  
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to prejudge my statistics right now,'' Walker said.  
``If the opportunity is there for me to score, I think I can score 
with the best of them. But I think my job this year and from now on 
with the Celtics is to fit in wherever I can.''

<HEADLINE> Hingis-Mauresmo Is Australia Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Amelie Mauresmo's thickly muscled  
shoulders bulge from her dark blue tank-top, and she struts cockily 
around court like a weightlifter in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's tennis has seen a lot of talented teens come along in  
recent years, from Martina Hingis to Venus and Serena Williams to 
Anna Kournikova, but none is quite like Mauresmo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Frenchwoman, who surprisingly has landed in the  
Australian Open final Saturday against the two-time defending 
champion Hingis, wields a one-handed backhand like Pete Sampras. 
It's a deep topspin shot that comes off the racket with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's tennis hasn't seen a shot like that since the heyday of  
Gabriela Sabatini, though the Argentinean didn't hit quite so hard. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 Lindsay Davenport was stunned by the force of those shots,  
the last one on match point, in her 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 semifinal loss 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was playing a guy, the girl was hitting it so  
hard,'' Davenport said. ``She hits the ball not like any other 
girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport wasn't being catty. If anything, she was amazed at the  
way Mauresmo has taken the women's game to a new level with her 
sculpted physique and big strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it as a compliment,'' said Mauresmo, who won the junior  
Wimbledon and French titles in 1996 but never had gone beyond the 
third round in the main draw of a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo pumps iron and works out hard in the gym three days a  
week when she's not playing. French tennis federation trainer 
Christophe Ceccaldi said she's stronger than some of the men 
players in her combination of sheer strength, dynamic power and 
cardiovascular conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare in women players to have all three,'' Ceccaldi  
said. ``The whole package makes her a top flight athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo is proud of her strength and stamina, all designed, she  
said, so that she can be ``the one that stays longer on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is more to Mauresmo than muscles. When she plays  
Hingis, 18, it will be a matchup of teens who know how to think on 
the court and who are intense competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In her victory over Davenport, Mauresmo showed she can figure  
out a player's weaknesses, exploit them, make adjustments in her 
own game and reach down for something extra when the match is on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are precisely the qualities that define Hingis' game, and  
the match between them could be memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's men's semifinal, Thomas Enqvist reached his first  
Grand Slam tournament final by beating 91st-ranked Nicolas Lapentti 
of Ecuador 6-3, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	His opponent in the championship match will be the winner of the  
match between 1996 French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
33rd-ranked Tommy Haas of Germany. Kafelnikov, at No. 10, is the 
only surviving men's seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist, set back last year by a foot injury, now has won 14  
consecutive matches this year, including victories over U.S. Open 
champion Patrick Rafter and runner-up Mark Philippoussis in the 
third and fourth rounds here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting, unbelievable, to be in a Grand Slam  
final,'' said the 24-year-old Swede, who once was ranked sixth in 
the world and now is No. 21. Enqvist's best previous Grand Slam 
tournament result was the 1996 Australian, where he lost in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti had come from behind in three five-set matches this  
tournament and upset seventh-seeded Karol Kucera in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, Enqvist said, ``I felt like I had to keep the  
pressure up, and I was able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``There never have been as many good players as now.  
Twenty or 25 players can go to a Grand Slam tournament and have a 
chance to win it. That has to be very exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Are Anti-Saddam Groups Effective? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military commander in the Persian  
Gulf sharply criticized the Clinton administration's strategy for 
toppling Saddam Hussein, saying U.S. support for Iraqi opposition 
groups is ill-conceived and could further destabilize the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we need is another rogue state,'' Marine Gen.  
Anthony Zinni told the Senate Armed Services Committee at a hearing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we had Saddam gone, by any means, we could we end up  
with 15, 20, 90 groups competing for power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni criticized what has become the centerpiece of long-range  
U.S. policy toward Iraq. President Clinton last week designated 
seven organizations eligible for up to $97 million in U.S. military 
aid under the so-called Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zinni told the panel, ``I will be honest. I don't see an  
opposition group that has the viability to overthrow Saddam at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James Foley defended the  
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration is determined to redouble its efforts to  
work closely with the members of the Iraqi opposition in order to 
promote regime change in Iraq. ... And we will be reviewing the 
possibility of different ways of working with them in the coming 
weeks and months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I would fully endorse Gen. Zinni's conclusion that we  
believe that this is not going to be an easy or short-term 
effort,'' Foley added. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni, who commands all American forces in the Persian Gulf  
region, also told the panel that Iraq still may have Scud missiles 
capable of reaching Israel and retains the capability of 
manufacturing biological and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Zinni rated overall success of Operation Desert Fox as  
high. ``We're seeing more damage -- damage that we were very 
conservative in estimating until we had more proof or more 
evidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified as military officials announced that two U.S.  
warplanes dropped bombs on an anti-aircraft artillery installation 
in northern Iraq on Thursday after observing fire from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of any damage to the F-15Es or injuries to  
their crews. Both planes continued their patrols of the northern 
no-fly zone over Iraq after the incident, Capt. Mike Blass of the 
U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni told the Senate panel that since the end of the U.S.  
strikes in December, Iraq had violated no-fly zones in northern and 
southern Iraq more than 70 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's clear that Saddam has been a loser and his air  
defense system has been a loser in these engagements,'' Zinni said. 
``I would emphasize, though, our pilots are still at risk. This is 
not an undangerous mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In criticizing the policy of support for Iraqi opposition  
groups, Zinni took on a prized congressional Republican initiative, 
one originally opposed by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	An early critic of the plan, Zinni was asked by senators if he'd  
changed his mind now that the administration had embraced the 
policy as its own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zinni said the policy ``could further destabilize the area''  
and ``could be very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we need is a disintegrated, fragmented Iraq,''  
Zinni said. ``Because the effects on the region would be far 
greater, in my mind, than a contained Saddam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Saddam is dangerous. Saddam should go. There's not a doubt  
in my mind. But it is possible to create a situation that could be 
worse. And that's my concern. These groups are very fragmented. 
They have little if any viability to exact a change of regime in 
and of themselves. Their ability to cooperate is questionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Undersecretary Walter Slocombe, testifying at the same  
hearing, supported the current policy, saying: ``We believe we have 
a comprehensive strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, one of a handful of  
Democratic sponsors of the 1998 legislation, told Zinni: ``I don't 
think any of us ... are naive about the difficulties involved. But 
unless we try, there's going to be no change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the seven groups Clinton selected as eligible to receive  
U.S. support have said they do not want such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tehran-based Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq  
-- an umbrella for several Shiite Muslim opposition groups -- said 
that accepting the money would mar its reputation inside Iraq. And 
the Kurdish Democratic Party, a major Iraq Kurdish opposition 
group, announced, ``We do not intend to receive this kind of aid.'' 
The KDP's leader, Massoud Barzani, reportedly has said he does not 
favor toppling Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other groups -- the London-based Iraqi National Congress and  
the Jordanian-based Iraqi National Accord -- have welcomed the U.S. 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said that ``we have no  
immediate plans'' to begin doling out the $97 million in military 
aid and said the administration was working with opposition groups 
in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the only way we're going to break through the  
cycle of crises with Saddam Hussein is to see a transition to a new 
government in Iraq,'' Crowley said. ``We are working with the 
opposition and with other governments in the region to increase 
political support for the Iraqi opposition and make their efforts 
as effective as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Hingis-Mauresmo Is Australia Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Amelie Mauresmo's thickly muscled  
shoulders bulge from her dark blue tank-top, and she struts cockily 
around court like a weightlifter in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's tennis has seen a lot of talented teens come along in  
recent years, from Martina Hingis to Venus and Serena Williams to 
Anna Kournikova, but none is quite like Mauresmo. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Frenchwoman, who surprisingly has landed in the  
Australian Open final Saturday against the two-time defending 
champion Hingis, wields a one-handed backhand like Pete Sampras. 
It's a deep topspin shot that comes off the racket with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's tennis hasn't seen a shot like that since the heyday of  
Gabriela Sabatini, though the Argentinean didn't hit quite so hard. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 Lindsay Davenport was stunned by the force of those shots,  
the last one on match point, in her 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 semifinal loss 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was playing a guy, the girl was hitting it so  
hard,'' Davenport said. ``She hits the ball not like any other 
girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport wasn't being catty. If anything, she was amazed at the  
way Mauresmo has taken the women's game to a new level with her 
sculpted physique and big strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take it as a compliment,'' said Mauresmo, who won the junior  
Wimbledon and French titles in 1996 but never had gone beyond the 
third round in the main draw of a major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo pumps iron and works out hard in the gym three days a  
week when she's not playing. French tennis federation trainer 
Christophe Ceccaldi said she's stronger than some of the men 
players in her combination of sheer strength, dynamic power and 
cardiovascular conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very rare in women players to have all three,'' Ceccaldi  
said. ``The whole package makes her a top flight athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo is proud of her strength and stamina, all designed, she  
said, so that she can be ``the one that stays longer on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is more to Mauresmo than muscles. When she plays  
Hingis, 18, it will be a matchup of teens who know how to think on 
the court and who are intense competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In her victory over Davenport, Mauresmo showed she can figure  
out a player's weaknesses, exploit them, make adjustments in her 
own game and reach down for something extra when the match is on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are precisely the qualities that define Hingis' game, and  
the match between them could be memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's men's semifinal, Thomas Enqvist reached his first  
Grand Slam tournament final by beating 91st-ranked Nicolas Lapentti 
of Ecuador 6-3, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	His opponent in the championship match will be the winner of the  
match between 1996 French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
33rd-ranked Tommy Haas of Germany. Kafelnikov, at No. 10, is the 
only surviving men's seed. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist, set back last year by a foot injury, now has won 14  
consecutive matches this year, including victories over U.S. Open 
champion Patrick Rafter and runner-up Mark Philippoussis in the 
third and fourth rounds here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very exciting, unbelievable, to be in a Grand Slam  
final,'' said the 24-year-old Swede, who once was ranked sixth in 
the world and now is No. 21. Enqvist's best previous Grand Slam 
tournament result was the 1996 Australian, where he lost in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapentti had come from behind in three five-set matches this  
tournament and upset seventh-seeded Karol Kucera in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, Enqvist said, ``I felt like I had to keep the  
pressure up, and I was able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``There never have been as many good players as now.  
Twenty or 25 players can go to a Grand Slam tournament and have a 
chance to win it. That has to be very exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Swedes Brood Over Volvo Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Safe, clean and a trifle stodgy, Volvo  
cars are the essence of Swedishness, and the decision to sell the 
company to American giant Ford kept Volvo President Leif Johansson 
awake at nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult, emotional decision between 2 and 4 in the  
morning,'' Johansson said Thursday, hours after the proposed sale 
of Volvo's car division was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is buying only the car division, and Volvo AB is holding on  
to its profitable truck, bus, construction equipment, marine and 
aeronautical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	But however successful, those businesses don't have the quiet  
cachet of Volvo cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with the shoddy, inefficient cars that rolled off  
American assembly lines in the 1970s, Volvos seemed almost handmade 
-- and they appealed to the same consumers who drank micro-brewery 
beers. 
</P>
<P>
	They came in relatively small quantities -- just 400,000 last  
year -- and they were ecologically low-impact. With their array of 
innovative safety features, they were seen as a responsible luxury, 
and that image is bolstered by their rather stolid styling. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been a perfect fit for baby-boomers who grew up with  
liberal ideas and then became wealthy -- the ultimate car for the 
``soccer mom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of which meshes with Sweden's self-image as a country where  
liberal social policy and strong environmentalism don't mean 
denying oneself some comforts. Even Volvo's plants fit the image: 
their yards are orderly and the buildings look as precise and clean 
as architectural drawings. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving the car division over to Americans, the bold and messy  
industrial predators, takes something away from Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would really hurt if Volvo Cars were entirely owned by  
Ford. Volvo is so Swedish,'' Bertil Johnsson, chairman of the 
Swedish labor confederation LO, was quoted as saying by the Swedish 
news agency TT. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the sentimentality, however, the sale of Volvo's car  
division is characteristically Swedish, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A diligent and unemotional pragmatism led Sweden from being a  
somewhat backward country a century ago to being the industrial 
power it is today -- and Swedish industrialists have not been afraid 
of going global, when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's other automaker, Saab, is 50-percent owned by General  
Motors and it's widely expected that GM will take it over entirely 
within a few years. Astra pharmaceuticals is in the process of 
merging with Britain's Zeneca, Pharmacia merged with Upjohn and 
Swedish telecommunications giant LM Ericsson is moving much of its 
management to London. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, after describing his pre-dawn anxieties about selling  
the car division, said when the sun came up, he was confident that 
the sale was the best way to keep Volvos ``Swedish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's size and resources will allow Volvo cars to continue  
their reputation of being the enlightened man's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking at big problems in product development ...  
lean-combustion engines, fuel cells,'' he said, adding that Volvo 
didn't have the money to develop these technologies, but Ford does. 
</P>
<P>
	And the rest of Volvo is likely to behave with typical prudence.  
Volvo will get 50 billion kronor ($6.45 billion) in cash for the 
sale, but it's not planning to go on a bender. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo this month announced its interest in buying rival Swedish  
truck-maker Scania, and the cash is sure to be an asset in that 
bold move. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo may have sold part of itself to America, but that may help  
another company stay Swedish.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss Quit Cancer-Case Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. abandoned a building at  
its headquarters after seven women working there developed breast 
cancer, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The jeans company began an initial inquiry in January 1997 after  
several women were diagnosed with breast cancer while working at 
the four-story Saddleman building at Levi's Plaza, Levi spokesman 
Clarence Grebey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation later expanded to include cancer researchers  
and Patricia Buffler, former dean of the University of California, 
Berkeley's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	No link was found between the cancer and the building, but with  
employees concerned and the company restructuring, Levi relocated 
200 employees from the building last October. The remaining 
furniture was removed from the building last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the reports to date have shown that there is absolutely  
no evidence to suggest any link between these illnesses and the 
workplace,'' according to an e-mail message sent to employees and 
obtained by the San Francisco Business Times in a story published 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite this, we fully understand the unacceptable level of  
anxiety that this ongoing issue has caused,'' the memo continued. 
``Consequently, we have decided to relocate employees in the 
building as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women all worked in desk jobs and did not work with  
hazardous chemicals or special machinery, Grebey told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is alarming that a number of women developed breast  
cancer, the cancer researchers said that random occurrences like 
this happen throughout the general population inexplicably in 
various surroundings,'' Grebey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite assurances by the company that the building was safe,  
employees wanted to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling among employees was that there was a hex on the  
building,'' said Diane Dito, a former process leader in Levi's 
Prevention Health and Safety Team. ``Some people felt very strongly 
that it was the building, and the only way to satisfy them was to 
get them out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The building is owned by an Atlanta-based real estate advisory  
firm that oversees investments from private and public pension 
funds. At least two companies have considered moving into the 
building, the weekly newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No lawsuits have been filed.

<HEADLINE> Light Linked to Gamma Ray Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Astronomers have recorded visible light from  
the source of a gamma ray burst for the first time, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected at 4:47 a.m. EST Saturday and  
was detected by two orbiting observatories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts happen several times a week, but they come and  
go so fast astronomers have never before been able to link optical 
observations with the gamma ray detection. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the stellar eruption originated about 10 billion  
light years away but was so powerful in visible light that it could 
have been sighted from the ground with binoculars if someone 
happened to be looking at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the burst had occurred somewhere in our galactic  
neighborhood, it would have been so bright that night would've 
turned into day,'' said Chryssa Kouveliotou of the Universities 
Space Research Association, a contract science group at the 
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said that the burst appeared to originate from near the  
constellation Corona Borealis, visible in the predawn northern sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst phenomenon was discovered in 1967, but the  
bursts remain mysterious. They occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, with the peak of each burst lasting 
from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Astronomers do not know 
their origin or precise cause. Some speculate that bursts originate 
from black holes. Since gamma rays are invisible to the eye, the 
eruptions were unknown until the development of gamma ray 
detectors.

<HEADLINE> Here's the Word on the Dirty Bird </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jamal Anderson invented it. O.J. Santiago  
popularized it. Even ol' stick-in-the-mud Dan Reeves gave it a try. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the ``Dirty Bird'' is the dance craze sweeping the NFL.  
Start flapping your arms, it's time to party like it's 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that fans can identify with,'' Atlanta Falcons  
receiver Terance Mathis said. ``Fans may not know a player on this 
team, but they know what the Dirty Bird is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who haven't been able to visit Arthur Murray this  
season, here's a quick primer on the Dirty Bird: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raise your right hand in the air (also known as ``raising the  
roof''), then bring the arm down across your chest to form a wing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Perform the same motion with your left arm.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Flap both arms together as if trying to fly.  
</P>
<P>
	``From there, it's whatever you feel like,'' said Santiago, the  
Falcons' second-year tight end. ``You can bounce with it, break it 
down, do whatever you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Anderson claims to have invented the Dirty Bird -- stealing  
a few moves from his college chums at the University of Utah -- it 
was Santiago who clearly brought it to national attention in a Nov. 
8 victory at New England. 
</P>
<P>
	After catching a touchdown pass, Santiago flapped his arms,  
strutted around in the end zone and squawked like a crow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I created the dance, but O.J. took in national,'' Anderson  
conceded. ``I did it in a game nobody cared about (the previous 
week against St. Louis). O.J. did it in a big game, and then he 
added all those sound effects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Reeves, the team's 55-year-old coach, was coaxed into  
performing the Dirty Bird after the Falcons made the Super Bowl. He 
performed it right in the middle of the Metrodome after the Falcons 
defeated the Vikings 30-27 for the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go around town in Miami, and all you can hear is people  
talking, `Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds.''' Mathis said. ``I think we're 
the Atlanta Dirty Birds now instead of the Atlanta Falcons. It's 
been ... very, very catchy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos, who play the Falcons on Sunday, have their own  
end-zone celebration, ``The Mile High Salute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You really have to practice on doing the Dirty Bird,'' Mathis  
said. ``I think the Dirty Bird is tougher to learn than the Mile 
High Salute. I'll take the Dirty Bird any day.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Salt Lake City Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Justice Department is trying to  
determine whether a Salt Lake Olympic official carried $50,000 to 
Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 just before the 2002 Winter Games were 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Godfrey, a former city councilman, said he was contacted by  
the FBI on Wednesday and met with agents that evening to discuss 
what he had told reporters earlier in the week: that a bid 
committee staff member had told him of carrying $50,000 in cash to 
Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey said Thursday he promised the FBI agents he would not  
disclose what he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recounted the conversation he said occurred in the summer  
of 1996, when he and the other man were reminiscing about what they 
had been doing the year before. Godfrey, who was a councilman at 
the time and traveled to Budapest, declined in an interview to name 
the man.

	``He was saying that his trip to Budapest was a bit  
uncomfortable because he had to carry $50,000 in cash. So it wasn't 
a pleasant flight for him,'' Godfrey said. ``He didn't say what it 
was for. He said he gave it to another staff member for expenses 
and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey said he didn't press the man for details.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, we had won the bid. I really didn't want to hear  
anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After this winter's revelations that Salt Lake's Olympic bid  
committee lavishly courted International Olympic Committee members 
before the IOC vote, the information seemed more interesting, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Justice Department, an ethics panel for the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee and the United States Olympic Committee 
are investigating the extravagant payments, gifts, free medical 
care and scholarships for IOC relatives. The SLOC ethics probe is 
due by Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC during the weekend said its investigation had found Salt  
Lake's bid committee spent more than $800,000, including cash 
payments, on 14 specific IOC members. Utah's attorney general has 
promised an investigation into whether state laws were broken after 
the Justice Department and SLOC probes are finished. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the bid committee staff, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said he took no large sums of cash to Budapest. But the 
financial people on the bid may have carried cash to pay hotel and 
food expenses for some of the 300 people who made up Salt Lake's 
delegation, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Peterson, a former city official, handled finances for the  
bid committee after he joined up in 1990 and continued in that job 
after the city won its bid and formed the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, J.J. Bullock, said Thursday afternoon that  
Peterson was interviewed by the Justice Department on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock declined to say whether Peterson was questioned about  
$50,000 carried to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has been mum about his role in the bid committee, in  
part because when he was forced out of SLOC in 1996, he signed a 
contract that demanded his silence about Olympic matters.

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Criticized for Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- When a Disneyland visitor was fatally  
injured by a flying piece of metal last month, the folks at the 
self-proclaimed ``Happiest Place on Earth'' had the blood and 
debris cleaned up within a half-hour, before investigators could 
get a look at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Legally, Disneyland did nothing wrong. But to some, the quick  
cleanup illustrates a corporate arrogance and an extreme desire to 
preserve the Disneyland illusion of innocence, even at the expense 
of accountability to its guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's greed. You couple the greed with the arrogance and  
there's no reason why they have to be responsible to anyone,'' said 
Henry Giroux, an education professor at Pennsylvania State 
University and author of ``The Mouse That Roared: Disney and the 
End of Innocence,'' to be published by Roman &AMP; Littlefield in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	John Luetto, an Orange County lawyer who claims to have filed  
the only successful lawsuit stemming from an injury at Disneyland 
since the park opened in 1955, said: ``They're intent on assessing 
the situation themselves without outside authority. That's what's 
at play most often when you encounter Disneyland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's accident happened the day before Christmas, when  
the sailing ship Columbia was easing up to the dock and an 8-pound 
cleat -- a piece of metal used for tying down mooring ropes -- broke 
loose from the vessel. Luan Phi Dawson, 33, of Duvall, Wash., was 
fatally struck in the head. His wife and a Disneyland employee were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland spokesman Ray Gomez said the mess was cleaned up  
quickly ``because it was in a very visible location in the park. It 
could easily be seen from several viewpoints. It was Christmas Eve 
and there was a huge number of children in the area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez denied Disneyland neglects its responsibility to protect  
guests, saying ``safety is part and parcel of our guests' having a 
good experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland guests, however, have no way of knowing how safe the  
rides are. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine people have died at the theme park, most of them apparently  
because of their own foolishness, such as trying to switch cars on 
a moving ride. 
</P>
<P>
	But Disney doesn't release comprehensive injury figures, and  
doesn't have to. While mobile amusement parks have been subject to 
state oversight since 1968, permanent ones were exempted at the 
request of the Walt Disney Co., according to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Luetto's client was stabbed by a fellow Disneyland patron in  
1981 and bled to death after being treated by an on-site nurse and 
driven to a hospital that had no trauma center. Disneyland workers 
didn't contact paramedics, Luetto said. An Orange County jury 
awarded the mother and brother of the slain man $600,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	In last month's accident, Disneyland immediately contacted  
paramedics via a special, direct line but did not call police. 
Police learned of the accident from the paramedics and got there 40 
minutes after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Colson, an Anaheim city spokesman, said that while police  
have no reason to believe any crime was committed in the accident, 
detectives would prefer to examine a scene themselves instead of 
letting Disneyland authorities make that determination for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're attempting to make sure that there's not a repeat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the California Occupational Safety &AMP; Health  
Administration, which is investigating because an employee was 
injured, would prefer that an accident scene not be disturbed, 
spokesman Dean Fryer said. But there is no such requirement under 
the law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal-OSHA investigators are looking into whether Disneyland was  
improperly stopping the ship with a cleat -- which state officials 
say is only for mooring, not stopping -- and whether the employee 
docking the ship had been properly trained. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael T. Berry, Disneyland's new operations chief, told the  
Los Angeles Times that dockworkers are no longer allowed to stop 
the Columbia with a rope and cleat. Details on the new Columbia 
operating procedure were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney has agreed to contact police on all major accidents in  
the future. But it admitted no wrongdoing in its handling of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	If the dead man's wife sues, she apparently will have to do so  
in Orange County, where attorneys contend jurors are sympathetic to 
Disney because the park, with a workforce of about 12,500, employs 
so much of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland tickets carry a warning on the back that all ticket  
holders are agreeing to litigate any claims for injury or loss in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	Colson denied suggestions by some Disney critics that Anaheim  
police hold Disneyland to a different standard than other 
businesses, and he called Disneyland an ``excellent corporate 
citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said having former Disneyland employees on the police  
force, including the chief and a captain, is a benefit for the 
public because it gives officers inside knowledge of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	As for releasing Disneyland's injury statistics, Gomez said  
Disney is not convinced that would be helpful to the 14 million 
visitors to Disneyland every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Disneyland's Florida counterpart, Walt Disney World, has been  
the target of similar criticism. It is one of three Florida 
amusement parks exempted from state oversight. According to 
Florida's inspector, however, those three big parks have higher 
safety standards than the state's. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Disneyland visitors on a recent afternoon said they'd like  
to see more oversight and know more about ride safety records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at how many thousands of people come here a day,'' said  
Michelle Kinsley, a 32-year-old mother from Alhambra who was eating 
lunch in front of the closed dock.

<HEADLINE> New Pen Draws Very Tiny Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Combining the ancient technology of a quill  
with a modern computer-driven microscope, researchers have created 
a pen that draws lines one-millionth of an inch thick, giving 
science a new way of manipulating molecules in the world of the 
very, very tiny. 
</P>
<P>
	The work is an important step toward someday developing  
electronic chips that are a thousand times smaller than those now 
used in computers. It moves into unknown corners of what is known 
as the nanoworld, said Chad A. Mirkin, a chemistry professor at 
Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now down to a scale that has never been explored  
before,'' said Mirkin, the senior author of a study appearing 
Friday in the journal Science. ``Materials change when they are 
this very small scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirkin's team has learned how to draw a line that is 15  
nanometers wide. The smallest electronic circuits now in 
development are about 180 nanometers. A nanometer is one-billionth 
of a meter. A fine human hair, in contrast, is about 10,000 
nanometers thick. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something really new,'' Harvard University Professor  
Charles M. Lieber said of the work by Mirkin and his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieber said the advance is exciting because, unlike other  
techniques, ``it writes directly on a surface on a nanometer 
scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the experiment, Mirkin and his team used an atomic force  
microscope -- a common laboratory instrument -- and an extremely fine 
stylus or pen tip made of silicon nitride. The lines were drawn on 
a gold-coated silicon chip using a special type of ink. 
</P>
<P>
	The atomic pen worked in the same way that quill pens were once  
used to write. Ink flowed down the pen tip onto the surface, just 
as ink flows from the hollow of a dipped quill pen onto paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The water that collects naturally on the microscope tip is a key  
part of the process, Mirkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our ink is not flowing directly from the tip onto the  
surface,'' he said. Instead, it flows through the water, which 
forms a tiny hollow tube, like a capillary, that allows the 
researchers to write a very narrow line. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quill pen, that same capillary formation holds ink inside  
the hollow feather until the point is touched to a surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The new nanometer drawing technique is significant because it  
could be used to deposit a variety of materials onto a surface, 
Mirkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, an electricity-conducting material such as copper  
or silver could be laid down -- a few molecules at a time -- to 
create an electronic circuit chip. It would be possible to ``draw'' 
a million lines, or circuits, in a single inch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If scientists can build smaller chips, that would allow them to  
build more powerful computers and more sophisticated electronics 
using the same amount of space that present devices use. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could put a lot of circuits on a very small chip,'' said  
Mirkin. ``We are approaching the point where you cannot go any 
smaller because we are almost manipulating this material one 
molecule at a time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To draw on the nanometer scale, the researchers first programed  
a computer with the desired shape. The computer then sent commands 
to direct the movement of the pen tip on the atomic force 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	The current technique has no immediate practical value, but it  
does show how nanometer circuit boards could be made, Mirkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	His team is working toward a printing system that would work in  
a way similar to dot matrix printers -- but on a very small scale. 
Such machines, though, will take years to develop.

<HEADLINE> Online Investors Complain to SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You might call them vox investori. Hundreds of  
Main Street investors are complaining to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission about getting burned by online brokerage firms 
in stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of amateur investors have joined the ranks of Internet  
traders at a time when stock prices are swinging wildly on heavy 
volume on the Nasdaq Stock Market, especially in hot Internet 
stocks. The surge prompted both the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, and SEC 
Chairman Arthur Levitt to warn investors this week to use as much 
caution trading online as when going through a traditional broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, asked by a senator  
Thursday about the recent trading frenzy in Internet company 
stocks, said ``undoubtedly, some of these small companies, whose 
stock prices are going through the roof, will succeed. And they 
very well may justify even higher prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority are almost sure to fail. That's the way the  
markets tend to work in this regard,'' Greenspan said during his 
appearance before the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trading temperature has risen, so have investors'  
complaints to the SEC: They jumped to around 1,100 in the year 
ended Sept. 30 from about 250 the previous year, according to the 
market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And that may be just the tip of the iceberg, with an estimated  
10 million people expected to be trading over the Internet by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a rare person who complains,'' Nancy Smith,  
director of the SEC's office of investor education, said in an 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many frustrated investors don't take the trouble to put it in  
writing, she noted. Those who do usually have already complained to 
their online broker and are copying in the SEC regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples from the SEC's files:  
</P>
<P>
	--A California man placed a market order online in May to buy  
1,000 shares of EntreMed, a biomedical company whose stock has been 
moving sharply. He figured the order would be executed promptly 
near $13 a share, which was where EntreMed was quoted at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Market orders are executed fully and promptly without regard to  
price, as opposed to limit orders, which are filled only at a price 
specified by the investor or better. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a delay, and by the time the man's order was executed,  
he said he was charged $83 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Maryland couple placed a limit order to sell 300 shares of a  
stock but changed their minds two minutes later, specifying a lower 
target price. Four minutes later, as the stock continued to drop, 
they canceled the second order, wishing to hold on to it. 
</P>
<P>
	They received a computer message: ``Both orders closed/nothing  
done,'' but then got a confirmation that the first order was 
executed six minutes after the second order was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The most frequent complaints against online brokerages,  
according to the SEC: 
</P>
<P>
	--Failure to process investors' buy or sell orders or delays in  
executing trades. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investors having trouble getting into their online trading  
accounts or reaching their broker by e-mail or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Errors in processing trading orders.  
</P>
<P>
	The complaints appear to be evenly spread among the 100 or so  
online brokerage firms, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, one of the SEC's investor assistance specialists --  
there are now 18 or so -- evaluates the complaint and contacts the 
online brokerage firm involved. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the investors use e-mail to make their  
complaints, while 45 percent write ``paper'' letters and an 
additional 15 percent call the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get the phones ringing off the hook and the letters  
pouring in, it's quite a challenge,'' Ms. Smith said. She added 
that so far, her office has been able to handle the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, Ms. Smith advises, investors should talk to  
their broker and try to resolve the complaint. If that fails, they 
should write to the brokerage firm's compliance officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If no resolution is reached, investors should send a copy of the  
complaint to the SEC's investor education office at 450 5th Street, 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The agency's Web site is at 
www.sec.gov.

<HEADLINE> Intel Splits Stock 2-for-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- In a move widely anticipated by  
financial analysts, Intel Corp. has announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
that will make shares more affordable to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion  
in sales last year, said Thursday that the split takes effect April 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors greeted the news by bidding Intel up $4.43 3/4 at  
$137.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly shows that the company is doing well,'' said  
Prudential Securities technology analyst Hans Moseman in Palo Alto. 
``This split makes Intel stock more attractive to small investors 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split would be the 12th since Intel went public in 1971. The  
last split, also 2-for-1, was in June 1997. The company has 1.67 
billion shares of stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	An investor who purchased $100 worth of Intel stock when it  
first went public in Oct. 1971 would now be holding shares worth 
$397,597. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stock split, a company increases the number of shares  
outstanding without increasing its total market value. A share 
valued at $100, for example, might be exchanged for two shares 
valued at $50 each, or three shares worth $33.33 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	A split is usually interpreted as a sign that a company expects  
its stock to continue to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other high tech companies have announced stock splits  
this month, including Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., eBay 
Inc. and Yahoo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel makes about 85 percent of the world's computer processors,  
and manufactures memory chips plus hardware for computer networks, 
communications and graphics.

<HEADLINE>  It's Mr. Ed Vs. the Dog Collar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The guy with the dog collar got Shannon Sharpe's  
goat by saying he looks like a horse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl name-calling contest between Ray Buchanan and  
Shannon Sharpe reached new depths Thursday. Buchanan said Sharpe 
looks like Mr. Ed, and Sharpe said Buchanan should put away his 
high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	The war of words worthy of pro wrasslin' was waged by two  
players separated by 20 miles, but linked by a media throng happy 
to fuel the feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon can always win, because he can talk,'' said Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback. ``But Shannon looks like 
a horse. I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't tell me he 
doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's insults were eagerly relayed by reporters to Sharpe,  
the Denver Broncos' Pro Bowl tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that?'' Sharpe responded. ``Well, I think he's ugly,  
but did I ever call him that? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the high heels  
away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just what I 
heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe calls himself the best trash-talker in the NFL, but he  
met his match in Buchanan, whose media savvy has made him a Super 
Bowl star before the game even kicks off. Buchanan guaranteed a 
victory for the Falcons, then stole the spotlight at media day by 
showing up in a dog collar symbolic of their underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
	With coaches Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan no longer willing to  
discuss their long-standing feud, Sharpe and Buchanan have seized 
the spotlight. It's a marquee motormouth matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's barbs were the most pointed yet, though delivered  
with a nudge and wink. Both players talk with tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I see Ray in a snowstorm,'' Sharpe said, ``and his truck is  
broken down and mine is running perfect, would I pick him up? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More likely, the 195-pound Buchanan and the 230-pound Sharpe  
will cross paths Sunday. Buchanan made reference to the mild 
concussion Sharpe suffered in the third quarter of the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd better watch out for himself,'' Buchanan said. ``He might  
get knocked out like he did that last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe responded: ``I'm not hard to find -- I'm No. 84, and I've  
got the biggest mouth on the field. Tell Ray I'll be looking for 
him also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players cracked grins when they finally paused for breath.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe: ``I don't take what anybody says about me seriously.  
It's kind of like a heavyweight fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan: ``Guys are going to talk. We all know it's just the  
nature of the game. It's going to boil down to what happens on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so the taunts and threats are merely pregame entertainment,  
much like Cher or KISS.

<HEADLINE> Economists Set Gloomy Scenario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Economists set a gloomy scenario of  
further financial turmoil ahead Thursday as world business and 
political leaders began a six-day meeting aimed at putting a human 
face on ``globalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The annual World Economic Forum got off to a faltering start  
after snowstorms caused rare transport chaos in Switzerland, 
delaying the arrivals of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, German 
President Roman Herzog and others. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the early sessions, economists warned of more  
potential currency troubles in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Rudiger  
Dornbusch, an economist who had long predicted this month's 
devaluation of the Brazilian real, said South Africa and Turkey 
could be in line for major currency declines. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute of International  
Economics in Washington, said the U.S. dollar is headed for a sharp 
drop against the euro and the yen this year, largely due to the 
United States' huge current-account deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, delegates to the gathering of government and business  
leaders expressed optimism on the global outlook, slightly clouded 
by fears that Asia's financial crisis could worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, with Brazil's crisis continuing and Russia still in  
the doldrums, the delegates will discuss a wide range of economic 
problems likely to affect the Group of Seven leading industrial 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil devalued its currency in mid-January, and its financial  
markets have been highly volatile ever since. Market watchers fear 
the turmoil there will eventually affect the United States, as many 
U.S. companies do business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said Thursday Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan  
has canceled his trip to the forum, where he could have met leading 
G-7 officials including U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates tend to view the forum as an opportunity to meet on  
the sidelines to cut deals and resolve conflicts. Gore and Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov have scheduled a meeting for 
Friday.

	The war of words worthy of pro wrasslin' was waged by two  
players separated by 20 miles, but linked by a media throng happy 
to fuel the feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon can always win, because he can talk,'' said Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback. ``But Shannon looks like 
a horse. I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't tell me he 
doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's insults were eagerly relayed by reporters to Sharpe,  
the Denver Broncos' Pro Bowl tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that?'' Sharpe responded. ``Well, I think he's ugly,  
but did I ever call him that? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the high heels  
away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just what I 
heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe calls himself the best trash-talker in the NFL, but he  
met his match in Buchanan, whose media savvy has made him a Super 
Bowl star before the game even kicks off. Buchanan guaranteed a 
victory for the Falcons, then stole the spotlight at media day by 
showing up in a dog collar symbolic of their underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
	With coaches Dan Reeves and Mike Shanahan no longer willing to  
discuss their long-standing feud, Sharpe and Buchanan have seized 
the spotlight. It's a marquee motormouth matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's barbs were the most pointed yet, though delivered  
with a nudge and wink. Both players talk with tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I see Ray in a snowstorm,'' Sharpe said, ``and his truck is  
broken down and mine is running perfect, would I pick him up? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More likely, the 195-pound Buchanan and the 230-pound Sharpe  
will cross paths Sunday. Buchanan made reference to the mild 
concussion Sharpe suffered in the third quarter of the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd better watch out for himself,'' Buchanan said. ``He might  
get knocked out like he did that last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe responded: ``I'm not hard to find -- I'm No. 84, and I've  
got the biggest mouth on the field. Tell Ray I'll be looking for 
him also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players cracked grins when they finally paused for breath.  
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe: ``I don't take what anybody says about me seriously.  
It's kind of like a heavyweight fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan: ``Guys are going to talk. We all know it's just the  
nature of the game. It's going to boil down to what happens on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so the taunts and threats are merely pregame entertainment,  
much like Cher or KISS.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Look To Save Cuba Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos hopes the  
White House can help save a plan for a series of exhibition games 
between his players and a Cuban all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and Clinton's national security advisor, Samuel Berger,  
will probably meet this week, administration officials told the The 
(Baltimore) Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos returned from Havana last week without an agreement from  
the Cuban government to have the Orioles and the Cuban team play 
one exhibition game in Baltimore and one in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they allowed the Orioles to meet with Cuban officials,  
the Clinton administration added the condition that proceeds from 
the games could only benefit the Cuban people and not Fidel 
Castro's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright suggested that Caritas,  
the Catholic Church's international aid organization, could 
distribute the funds to help the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government, however, said the money should help  
victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. And the Cubans were 
reportedly annoyed that a representative from Catholic Relief 
Services -- a sister organization of Caritas -- traveled to Cuba with 
Angelos to suggest ways to distribute the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the fate of the series is uncertain, although a compromise  
may be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nuccio, a former advisor on Cuba to the Clinton  
administration, said the Cuban government may be worried about that 
members of its team will defect if a game is played in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, a single game in Havana may be more appealing.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Coroner Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The retiring ``coroner to the stars'' and the  
model for TV's ``Quincy'' has a post-mortem on his own career that 
can be summarized in two words: no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	As chief medical examiner, Thomas Noguchi had many legendary  
cases, and he talked about them all, often irking Hollywood and 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	He determined heroin killed Janis Joplin, that an injection of  
heroin and cocaine snuffed the life of John Belushi and that 
Marilyn Monroe swallowed 40 to 50 Nembutal capsules. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the world that Natalie Wood and William Holden were  
drunk when they died. 
</P>
<P>
	He even disputed 75 witnesses to the assassination of Robert F.  
Kennedy. They said Sirhan Sirhan fired repeatedly from a distance 
of several feet, standing directly in front of the senator. But 
after performing an autopsy, Noguchi said one of the bullets 
entered just behind Kennedy's ear, fired so close to his head there 
were powder burns on his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1982, county officials were fed up with such outspokenness.  
They accused him of mismanagement, making improper public 
statements and using company time for personal business. He was 
demoted to staff pathologist and relegated to the basement of Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no qualms about anything I said during that period.  
What do I care?'' the Noguchi, 72, said this week, 38 years after 
entering the county morgue for the first time. ``I don't need to 
adjust the facts for some political reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not go quietly when the county Board of Supervisors  
demoted him. He sued, pursuing his case to the state Supreme Court, 
which refused to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quincy,'' which starred Jack Klugman as the medical examiner,  
ended in 1983 after a seven-year run on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Noguchi, whose coroner colleagues were throwing him a  
retirement party Friday night, wants to be a witness-for-hire in 
civil trials -- or a television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	Noguchi, who was divorced the year he was demoted and never  
remarried, says he isn't keen on retiring, but his civil servant 
pension is fully vested -- he can collect his full salary without 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a character,'' he said. ``I'll be just fine.''

<HEADLINE> 'Yahoo!' Says GeoCities To Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Van Stralen knew little about the  
lucrative combination of stock options and corporate mergers in 
1996 when he signed on as a software engineer with GeoCities Inc., 
then an Internet nobody with only eight other employees. 
</P>
<P>
	He has learned a lot since then.  
</P>
<P>
	On news Thursday that GeoCities was being acquired by Yahoo!  
Inc. in a $5.02 billion deal, Van Stralen and other GeoCities 
workers stood to benefit nicely as the Los Angeles-based company's 
stock soared 56 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I joined I really didn't think, 'We're going to turn this  
into something.' It was a good place to work and learn,'' said Van 
Stralen, 31, now a manager in GeoCities' electronic commerce 
operation. ``I didn't know about stock options then, but since then 
I took a crash course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Options are part of the standard compensation package offered to  
most GeoCities employees, allowing top executives and rank-and-file 
workers to buy shares at bargain prices. Employees also are allowed 
to buy shares at smaller discounts through a payroll deduction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	For GeoCities top executives, the potential gain from the Yahoo!  
deal is substantial. The value of options on 1.6 million shares 
held by Thomas Evans, the company's president and chief executive 
officer, was $217 million when calculated at the Wednesday's 
pre-announcement closing price of $75 a share, said Judith Fischer, 
publisher of Executive Compensation Reports. Evans' agreement 
allows him to buy the shares at $17 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief technical officer John C. Rezner has the same deal on  
977,000 shares, which would be valued at $129.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman David C. Bohnett, who co-founded GeoCities with Rezner  
in 1994, has options to buy 600,000 shares for $2.28 each, which 
would result in a gain of $88.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Such compensation is not unusual, especially among high-tech  
companies, Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does reflect the wild stampede to wild amounts of options  
being awarded to executives,'' said Fischer. ``Five years ago we 
stopped and looked when we saw an executive getting 15,000 or 
100,000 shares, and now it's in the millions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The options, which typically vest over a four-year period, help  
convince employees to stay put. But Bohnett said he expected few 
GeoCities workers to leave even after their options are vested. The 
drive to work is strong, especially among executives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of these people have to work,'' he said, naming a few of  
the company's top officers. ``You just want to continue, it's so 
exciting. People may decide they want to start something on their 
own, but that's what vesting is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Workers learned about the deal on Wednesday afternoon, when  
Evans and some Yahoo! executives summoned most of the company's 
nearly 300 employees to stand among the cubicles in the large, open 
work floor in the headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People cheered,'' said Leanne Pylott, 30, a business  
development specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Stralen and other employees interviewed at GeoCities'  
headquarters on Thursday declined to comment specifically on the 
amount of options they held. All, however, expressed enthusiasm 
over the merger with Yahoo!, the latest in a spree of acquisitions 
that are transforming the Internet from a confusing collection of 
disparate sites into a more organized place to shop, do research 
and exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is known as a ``portal''  
because it gives users a gateway to other services including stock 
quotes, news, and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, based in Los Angeles, is used by several million  
people to set up home pages on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	It has organized the pages into 41 ``neighborhoods'' to attract  
like-minded visitors. For example, the ``Heartland'' neighborhood 
caters to families while NapaValley is for wine lovers. GeoCities 
also runs a wide collection of discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities earns revenue through the sale of advertising and by  
providing systems for handling checks and credit card numbers to 
operators who want to sell via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In buying GeoCities, Yahoo! is betting that e-commerce will  
someday be as common as today's trip to the mall. It's a gamble 
because GeoCities has yet to turn a profit. The company lost $8.4 
million, or 27 cents a share, during the last three months of 1998 
on sales of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohnett said that will change as GeoCities and Yahoo! grow.  
</P>
<P>
	``This company has developed a strategy of embedding commerce in  
an (Internet) community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Approve Con Ed Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidated Edison Inc.'s plans to buy its  
suburban neighbor, Orange &AMP; Rockland Utilities, was approved 
Wednesday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The $790 million merger is expected to save Con Ed $500 million  
over the next 10 years. The company has not indicated whether any 
of the savings will be passed on to its 3.3 million electricity 
customers and 1.2 million gas users. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange &AMP; Rockland will keep its name and be operated as a  
separate subsidiary of Con Ed, said Rich Mulieri, a Con Ed 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still requires approval from the Public Service  
Commission in New York, and the Public Utility Commissions in New 
Jersey and Pennsylvania, where Orange &AMP; Rockland does business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security and Exchange Commission must also sign off on the  
deal and the U.S. Justice Department will review the merger for 
antitrust violations, Mulieri said. Those approvals are expected by 
the summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison customers now pay some of the highest utility bills  
in the nation. The utility's current rate structure is to continue 
until March 30, 2003, Mulieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison agreed to pay $58.50 a share for Orange &AMP; Rockland's  
outstanding shares. The company's 13.5 million shares are held by 
20,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250 overlapping jobs, a small fraction of the two  
companies' work forces, are to be eliminated through reduced hiring 
and attrition, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison, with annual revenues of more than $7 billion, has  
14,500 workers. Orange &AMP; Rockland, which takes in $650 million a 
year, employs 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Edison covers New York City and Westchester County. Orange &AMP;  
Rockland serves the two New York counties in its name plus Bergen 
County in New Jersey and Pike County in Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon To Get $2.5M Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The 5 million tourists who visit Grand Canyon  
National Park each year soon will be spared what the park 
superintendent acknowledges are moth-eaten exhibits in ancient 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Del E. Webb Foundation on Thursday announced a $2.5 million  
donation to the Grand Canyon National Park Foundation for the 
renovation of the Community Building, built in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of five historic but outdated buildings at the South  
Rim that will be improved and transformed into a Heritage Education 
Campus, featuring the latest technological bells and whistles to 
showcase the canyon's human, geological and natural history for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Superintendent Robert Arnberger said the new education  
complex marks the start of a dramatic shift in the way visitors 
experience the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground will be broken April 23 on the Canyon View Information  
Plaza, the hub of a mass-transit system designed to end automobile 
congestion at the rim. 
</P>
<P>
	The new education complex and light-rail system, which will  
whisk tourists to the rim from Tusayan, just south of the park, are 
``the most significant changes that man has marked on the Grand 
Canyon,'' Arnberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The light-rail system is scheduled to be up and running in 2002,  
Arnberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	R.H. Johnson, president of the Del E. Webb Foundation, presented  
a $500,000 check to Eugene Polk, chairman of the Grand Canyon 
National Park Foundation. Phoenix-based Del Webb will provide 
$500,000 a year for five years to transform the Community Building 
into an education center brimming with classrooms, interpretive 
centers, meeting rooms, offices, an outdoor deck with rock garden 
and other features. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other historic buildings will also be renovated over the  
next several years as part of a $55 million facelift. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy wear and tear from ever-growing numbers of tourists and  
the park's ancient infrastructure have taken a toll, foundation 
president Gene Polk said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Skier Maier Probed in Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators in Pitkin County are looking  
into allegations that a joyride by Olympic gold medalist Hermann 
Maier left a car damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier and Austrian teammate Andreas Schifferrer allegedly  
damaged a bicycle and a 1986 Acura during a night of partying Nov. 
28 after the World Cup ski races. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's owner, an Aspen snowboard show owner, hasn't been able  
to use the car since the damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's technically still under investigation. We're waiting for  
the victim to make a decision whether he wants to follow through 
with charges,'' said Ron Ryan, the Pitkin County Sheriff's 
investigator working the case. ``If the victim files charges, we 
would get a warrant and arrest him. The victim just wants this 
resolved. He says he is going against his grain to do that because 
he's a snowboarder. All he wants is his vehicle repaired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said the victim told him last week that no one from the  
Austrian team or a local attorney representing Maier had contacted 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier is scheduled to participate in the World Alpine Ski  
Championships starting in Vail this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because there was damage to the car, that makes it a little  
more serious than joyriding,'' Ryan said.

<HEADLINE> Online Investors Complain to SEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You might call them vox investori. Hundreds of  
Main Street investors are complaining to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission about getting burned by online brokerage firms 
in stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of amateur investors have joined the ranks of Internet  
traders at a time when stock prices are swinging wildly on heavy 
volume on the Nasdaq Stock Market, especially in hot Internet 
stocks. The surge prompted both the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq market, and SEC 
Chairman Arthur Levitt to warn investors this week to use as much 
caution trading online as when going through a traditional broker. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trading temperature has risen, so have investors'  
complaints to the SEC: They jumped to around 1,100 in the year 
ended Sept. 30 from about 250 the previous year, according to the 
market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And that may be just the tip of the iceberg, with an estimated  
10 million people expected to be trading over the Internet by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a rare person who complains,'' Nancy Smith,  
director of the SEC's office of investor education, said in an 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many frustrated investors don't take the trouble to put it in  
writing, she noted. Those who do usually have already complained to 
their online broker and are copying in the SEC regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples from the SEC's files:  
</P>
<P>
	--A California man placed a market order online in May to buy  
1,000 shares of EntreMed, a biomedical company whose stock has been 
moving sharply. He figured the order would be executed promptly 
near $13 a share, which was where EntreMed was quoted at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Market orders are executed fully and promptly without regard to  
price, as opposed to limit orders, which are filled only at a price 
specified by the investor or better. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a delay, and by the time the man's order was executed,  
he said he was charged $83 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Maryland couple placed a limit order to sell 300 shares of a  
stock but changed their minds two minutes later, specifying a lower 
target price. Four minutes later, as the stock continued to drop, 
they canceled the second order, wishing to hold on to it. 
</P>
<P>
	They received a computer message: ``Both orders closed/nothing  
done,'' but then got a confirmation that the first order was 
executed six minutes after the second order was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The most frequent complaints against online brokerages,  
according to the SEC: 
</P>
<P>
	--Failure to process investors' buy or sell orders or delays in  
executing trades. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investors having trouble getting into their online trading  
accounts or reaching their broker by e-mail or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Errors in processing trading orders.  
</P>
<P>
	The complaints appear to be evenly spread among the 100 or so  
online brokerage firms, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, one of the SEC's investor assistance specialists --  
there are now 18 or so -- evaluates the complaint and contacts the 
online brokerage firm involved. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the investors use e-mail to make their  
complaints, while 45 percent write ``paper'' letters and an 
additional 15 percent call the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get the phones ringing off the hook and the letters  
pouring in, it's quite a challenge,'' Ms. Smith said. She added 
that so far, her office has been able to handle the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, Ms. Smith advises, investors should talk to  
their broker and try to resolve the complaint. If that fails, they 
should write to the brokerage firm's compliance officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If no resolution is reached, investors should send a copy of the  
complaint to the SEC's investor education office at 450 5th Street, 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The agency's Web site is at 
www.sec.gov.

<HEADLINE> Report: O's Try To Save Cuba Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles are seeking the White  
House's help in arranging a series with a Cuban team, a newspaper 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owner Peter Angelos and President Clinton's national  
security adviser, Samuel Berger, will probably meet this week, The 
(Baltimore) Sun reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls Thursday by The Associated Press to Angelos' office and  
Berger's press office were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos returned from Havana last week without an agreement from  
the Cuban government to have the Orioles and the Cuban team play 
one exhibition game in Baltimore and one in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they allowed the Orioles to meet with Cuban officials,  
the Clinton administration added the condition that proceeds from 
the games could only benefit the Cuban people and not Fidel 
Castro's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright suggested that Caritas,  
the Catholic Church's international aid organization, could 
distribute the funds to help the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban government, however, said the money should help  
victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. And the Cubans were 
reportedly annoyed that a representative from Catholic Relief 
Services -- a sister organization of Caritas -- traveled to Cuba with 
Angelos to suggest ways to distribute the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the fate of the series is uncertain, though a compromise may  
be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans ``don't want to make it easy to fund groups that are  
independent of the government,'' said Bernard Aronson, a former 
State Department official and co-author of a study on U.S.-Cuban 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nuccio, a former advisor on Cuba to the Clinton  
administration, said the Cuban government may be worried about that 
members of its team will defect if a game is played in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, a single game in Havana may be more appealing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's playing politics with this,'' Nuccio told The Sun.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Ads: Wrestlers, Lingerie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Muscular wrestlers and shapely lingerie models  
will share the spotlight with football during this Sunday's Super 
Bowl telecast in the year's biggest attraction for both the NFL and 
Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation and sexy fashion peddler  
Victoria's Secret are among about 30 advertisers who are paying Fox 
television an average of $1.6 million for each half-minute Super 
Bowl commercial slot. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a Super Bowl record and is 23 percent higher than last  
year's record of $1.3 million. It amounts to an average of $53,333 
per commercial second. This year's National Football League title 
game, being played in Miami, pits the Atlanta Falcons against the 
defending champion, the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is roughly three times the highest-rated TV series in  
prime time, but it may not be an all-time record. Some reports put 
the average cost of the last episode of ``Seinfeld'' at $1.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, advertisers are getting a chance to show off before  
TV's biggest audience of the year on a day that resembles a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The research firm Eisner &AMP; Associates said its survey of 1,000  
adults last weekend indicates about 7 percent of the audience tunes 
in just to see the ads and more than one-third expect to discuss 
them Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the Super Bowl of football, it's the Super Bowl  
of advertising,'' said Jerry Solomon, who buys commercial time for 
clients of SFM Media. ``Everybody talks about the commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer Inc. will be back in the game for the first time  
in 14 years. The California company is widely credited for making 
the Super Bowl a commercial showcase with its 1984 ad that 
introduced the easy-to-use Macintosh computer to a public baffled 
by complicated machines from rivals. Apple also advertised the 
following year, but has been absent since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Its new ad features the talking computer HAL from ``2001: A  
Space Odyssey'' and is set some time in the future. HAL reminds a 
visitor named Dave that ``computers began to misbehave'' in the 
year 2000, creating a ``global economic disruption'' because they 
were not programmed to recognize the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	But HAL notes Macintosh models alone worked perfectly and asks,  
``You like your Macintosh better than me, don't you, Dave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-time Super Bowl advertiser, the World Wrestling  
Federation, gives a look at a ``typical'' day at its offices. 
Executives pummel each other and bodies crash through glass 
partitions while WWF stars like the Undertaker, the Rock, Sable and 
Stone Cold Steve Austin coolly try to dispel ``misperceptions'' 
about the kind of entertainment WWF matches provide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Super Bowl novice, Victoria's Secret invites viewers to  
tune in Wednesday for the first Internet telecast of its annual 
spring fashion show. Neither Super Bowl team will be there but 
``you won't care,'' the ad says before showing several models in 
revealing outfits from last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get women to smile and men to take notice,'' said  
Ed Razek, chief marketing officer for Victoria's Secret, a division 
of Intimate Brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser's Louie the Lizard, the architect of a failed attempt  
to electrocute the Bud frogs on last year's Super Bowl telecast, 
gets a tongue-lashing from the frogs in one of nine ads from 
Anheuser-Busch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based brewer is the single largest advertiser on  
this year's Super Bowl at five minutes and 15 seconds. It 
reportedly paid as much as $2 million per half-minute and will be 
the only brewer on the telecast. The company has declined to reveal 
exactly what it paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express has an ad that shows what can happen when you  
hire a rival courier -- it shows a hockey crowd screaming for the 
arrival of the Stanley Cup championship trophy only to get a box of 
donkey feed. The cup was shipped by mistake to a rural town in 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other regular advertisers, M&AMP;Ms will introduce a crispy  
variety of its famous candy and Frito-Lay will pitch Cracker Jack 
and new barbecued Doritos. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola has scaled back to two half-minute ads after running  
five last year. Spokesman Jon Harris said the company will debut a 
new theme for its flagship Pepsi brand closer to the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., the biggest soft drink company, is absent as are  
other veterans such as Nike Inc., IBM Corp. and McDonald's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rookies include two Internet job site operators,  
HotJobs.com. Ltd. and TMP Worldwide's Monster.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is starting pre-game coverage more than seven hours ahead of  
the kickoff and expects to generate a total of $150 million in 
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! To Buy GeoCities for $5.02B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Business Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc., one of the top sites on the  
Internet, is buying rival GeoCities Inc. for $5.02 billion, a deal 
that will broaden Yahoo!'s Web services by allowing customers to 
set up home pages or chat with others on a vast array of topics. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase is the latest in a spree of deals that are helping  
transform the Internet from a chaotic collection of disparate sites 
into a more organized place to shop, do research and exchange 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a consumer perspective, these companies will come  
together so the consumer experience becomes richer,'' said Sajai 
Krishnan, a principal with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. 
``The Internet starts delivering on all the hype. It starts 
becoming easier to use, less complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such deals are also creating a more effective medium for  
advertisers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, Calif., was the third-most visited  
Web destination last month, attracting 27 million Internet users, 
according to researcher Media Metrix Inc. It is known as a 
``portal'' because it gives users a gateway to other services 
including stock quotes, news, and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other players in the fast-consolidating Internet industry,  
Yahoo! wants to expand further by pulling in a range of other 
popular sites where it can direct its visitors. The two sites will 
continue to operate separately, but will have more links to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, based in Los Angeles, is the No. 5 Web destination  
and has been used by several million people to set up home pages 
where they can publish their writings, post their family photos or 
try to sell things. These pages can be established in one of 41 
``neighborhoods.'' For instance the ``Heartland'' neighborhood 
caters to families while NapaValley is for wine lovers. GeoCities 
also runs a wide collection of discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s main limitation is that many users only use it for  
brief periods of time, something advertisers dislike. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! went after GeoCities ``because they're trying to keep  
people on their Web sites for a long as possible, and give people 
as little opportunity as possible to leave,'' Krishnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	One additional aphrodisiac attracting these players is the  
potential to capture a chunk of the Internet's fast-growing sales. 
Last year, online sales totaled $4.9 billion, and are projected to 
jump more than five times, to $29 billion in four years, according 
to Jupiter Communications LLC. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Yahoo! was willing to pay a 52 percent premium over  
GeoCities' closing stock price Wednesday, even though the company 
reported Thursday it lost $8.4 million, or 27 cents a share, on 
sales of $7.5 million last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very comfortable with this premium,'' said Yahoo! chief  
executive Tim Koogle, who will head the combined company. ``There 
is a competitive market for leading brands that have a very large 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race to capture visitors to the Web has created a frenzied  
pace of consolidation among Internet businesses. Internet 
companies, many of whom aren't expected to be profitable for years, 
have seen their stocks soar due to incredibly high expectations 
among investors for a big payoff in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	These companies are using their high stock prices as currency to  
snap up competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In its deal, Yahoo will exchange about 10.6 million shares of  
its stock for the 31.4 million shares of GeoCities common stock. In 
addition, Yahoo will convert about 8.9 million GeoCities stock 
options into about 3 million Yahoo stock options. Based on 
Wednesday's closing prices, the deal was worth $4.58 billion, 
however Yahoo!'s stock rose more than 9 percent on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, jumping $31.87 1/2, to $367.75, thereby increasing the value 
of the deal. GeoCities's stock rose 56 percent, up $42.25 a share 
to $117.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other recent purchases, At Home Corp., a provider of  
high-speed Internet access, reached agreement last week to buy 
Excite Inc., one of Yahoo!'s biggest rivals, in a deal now worth 
$6.55 billion. America Online Inc., the biggest Internet service 
provider agreed last fall to buy Web software company Netscape 
Communications Corp. in a deal now valued at $7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's deal puts pressure on Lycos Inc., the fourth  
most-visited Web site, to find a partner in the fast-shrinking pool 
of major sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos reportedly has put a 20 percent stake of its shares up for  
sale, and one industry insider said Lycos has been talking with 
Microsoft Corp. about an alliance. Another major Web destination, 
Alta Vista, is said to be talking with major media companies after 
its parent, Compaq Computer Corp., announced plans Monday to spin 
off the unit into a separate subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos and Microsoft declined comment. Compaq did not immediately  
return a phone call.

<HEADLINE> Racer Weaver Has Pole for Rolex 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Englishman James Weaver gave team  
owner and co-driver Rob Dyson his first Daytona International 
Speedway pole Thursday in the opening round of qualifying for the 
Rolex 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a nice plus after all the years here,'' Dyson  
said. ``In fact, I think it's the first front row start for us at 
Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver's Riley &AMP; Scott Ford toured the 3.56-mile, 11-turn course  
-- which uses about three-quarters of the 2.5-mile, high-banked 
NASCAR oval and a twisting infield section -- in 1 minute, 40.869 
seconds. That translates to 127.05 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Second fastest at 125.56 was Didier Theys of Belgium, who put  
last year's pole- and race-winning Ferrari 333SP on the outside of 
the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something in the engine was not right,'' said the disappointed  
Theys, who combined with Mauro Baldi, Arie Luyendyk and then-team 
owner Gianpiero Moretti to win last year's race. ``We were fighting 
the (fuel) mixture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out and did two laps and it was no good, so I came in  
and we made a change. Then I went back out and all of a sudden we 
only had two minutes left, so I had to go for one quick lap,'' 
Theys explained. ``I had to pass maybe one car in the hairpin and 
lost time a little in a couple of places, so it wasn't so great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver's take on qualifying was just the opposite.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went out and did my first flying lap and my second flying  
lap and then straight back in again,'' he said. ``It was just one 
of those qualifyings when everything falls into your lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver will share his ride with Dyson, Dorsey Schroeder and  
Stuart Hayner, while Theys' co-drivers will be Baldi, Luyendyk and 
new owner Fredy Lienhard of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-four of the record 88 cars entered in the race, which  
begins Saturday at 1 p.m. EST and ends exactly 24 hours later, made 
qualifying runs on Thursday. But only the top two cars locked in 
starting spots for the classic sports car endurance event. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more of the sleek, open-cockpit Ferraris were close behind  
the leaders, with CART Champ car driver Max Papis of Italy third at 
124.87 and Alan McNish of Scotland, last year's LeMans 24-Hours 
winner, at 124.82. Another Dyson-owned Riley &AMP; Scott, with Butch 
Leitzinger at the wheel, was fifth at 124.457. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change this year is an air restrictor required for  
all cars in the Can-Am cars, the fastest of the four U.S. Road 
Racing Championship divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've changed the rules now to be more in line with what  
they do in Europe,'' Weaver explained. ``That has pegged the 
horsepower probably at about 640 for the Ferraris, and we're 
probably still about 615 in long distance trim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ferraris could probably race at 700 (horsepower)  
comfortably, so that should help tighten up the competition a 
lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the winning Ferrari won by eight laps over a Porsche  
911 shared by McNish, Danny Sullivan and a trio of German drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest GT2 car on Thursday was a Chevrolet Corvette driven  
by Canadian Ron Fellows, who will co-drive this weekend with Chris 
Kneifel and Indy Racing League driver John Paul Jr. Fellows got 
around the course at 117.66 and was 15th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Cort Wagner topped GT3 at 34th overall in a Porsche 911, turning  
a lap at 109.99, while the fastest in the new GTT division was Tony 
Puleo at 45th overall at 107.41 in a Chevrolet Camaro.

<HEADLINE> Max Weinberg Has Best of Both Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The sound cut through one wall, across a hallway  
and through another wall to the backstage dressing room where Max 
Weinberg talked. There were horns, guitars and -- making him a 
little nervous -- the drums. 
</P>
<P>
	``My replacement is sitting in this week,'' the leader of the  
Max Weinberg 7 explained, after pausing to listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he said, catching himself. ``He's not my replacement.  
He's my sub. He's very well aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This leave of absence idea takes some getting used to. The  
bandleader for ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' will be absent for 
about six months starting in March. He's becoming ``Mighty Max'' 
again, the drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and will 
travel the world with the year's most anticipated rock concert tour 
before returning to TV at the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's see: one person, two dream jobs. Weinberg is grateful he  
wasn't forced to make a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	When Springsteen announced in January that he would tour with  
the E Street Band for the first time in 11 years, Weinberg 
approached O'Brien and producer Jeff Ross. Was there any way he 
could do this? 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't about to quit. No way. O'Brien's show had given the  
48-year-old what few faded rock 'n' rollers ever get -- a second act 
in life. He'd never missed a Conan show -- 1,048 in a row -- even 
arranging to appear by satellite from Los Angeles when Springsteen 
asked him to drum on the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	After a shaky start, ``Late Night'' has hit its stride with the  
audience and critics. It's a great gig. If NBC had said no, 
Springsteen would be looking for another drummer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Bruce, the guys in the band,'' Weinberg said. ``I love  
the history and the music. But the last 5 1/2 years have really proved 
to me that I moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien and Ross gave him the chance to move back. They  
recognized the importance of this reunion to Weinberg and to rock 
history and felt the show was on solid footing to weather the 
change. Guitarist Jimmy Vivino will fill in as bandleader. Weinberg 
is in rehearsals with Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg said he's returning to the road as much for his  
11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son as for himself. Dad spent 
15 years with the E Street Band, but his children have never seen 
them perform. So they'll take time off from school to follow their 
parents on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want my children to see me in this sort of mythical  
situation that I was in that was pretty much over by the time they 
came around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg has a keen memory for dates, and here's one he'll never  
forget: Oct. 18, 1988. That was the day Springsteen called to say 
he wanted to try some new things and didn't need the band anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	There were inklings. Weinberg was convinced at the end of the  
``Born in the USA'' tour in 1985 that the band had played its last 
show; they had worked hard for more than a decade and conquered the 
world. What more was there to do? Springsteen called the band back 
for two more, shorter runs but when Weinberg saw the billing, 
``Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel of Love Express featuring the E Street 
Band,'' he knew the end was near. Featuring? 
</P>
<P>
	But even if you're in a bad marriage, it's still a shock to be  
handed divorce papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was at the same time the most horrifying experience I've  
ever been through and the most liberating,'' he said. ``It was a 
tremendous period of personal growth. It was the first time in my 
life that I had been out of a band. It was the first time that I 
had been given walking papers. Plus, I had a family to support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinberg went to Seton Hall, the New Jersey college, earned a  
degree in communications. He briefly tried law school. He even 
turned to a buddy, ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, for advice on how to cope 
when the band you've made your life has broken up. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen urged him to keep drumming, but Weinberg had given  
it up by the day four years later when he spotted Conan O'Brien on 
a Manhattan street corner and introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fluke, just like when he answered an ad in the Village  
Voice and wound up in the E Street Band. O'Brien had just been 
selected to replace David Letterman when he left for CBS. He wanted 
something musically that no one else was doing and liked Weinberg's 
idea for a neo-swing band. The drummer auditioned and got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	About three-quarters of the mail Weinberg gets these days is  
about O'Brien's show, not the E Street Band. He suspects many young 
fans don't know his past life. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, a 14-year-old aspiring drummer sent a letter about  
how he loved to watch Weinberg drum. He wasn't getting along with 
his father and found it odd that he could relate to someone his 
father's age on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	One night his father confronted him about staying up late. The  
boy talked about how he liked to watch O'Brien's drummer, Max 
Weinberg. That's funny, the dad said, Bruce Springsteen used to 
have a drummer with that name. He looked at the screen and 
recognized Weinberg behind the kit. 
</P>
<P>
	So on a Friday night, father and son stayed up to watch  
Weinberg, Dad talking about all the Springsteen concerts he saw in 
the 1970s. Some of the ice was broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first thought when I realized that I would be doing this  
tour with the E Street Band was that I hope this guy takes his son 
to this concert,'' Weinberg said. ``I think a lot of that's going 
to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	IN BAD TASTE: Hold your nose or laugh -- that's your choice. The  
Independent Film Channel pays tribute to gross-out filmmaker John 
Waters Friday night with the TV premiere of ``In Bad Taste: The 
John Waters Story'' at 8 p.m. EST. The documentary will be followed 
by Waters' movie, ``Polyester.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Industry Grows Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The worldwide personal computer industry  
grew 15 percent last year, led by strong demand in the United 
States, where 37 percent of all households are now connected to the 
Internet, according to preliminary statistics being released Friday 
by Dataquest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affordability and growing relevance of Internet content is  
sustaining double-digit PC growth in the U.S.,'' said Bill Schaub, 
vice president for Dataquest's personal computing and peripherals 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide, Compaq Computer Corp. remains the No. 1 seller of  
PCs, shipping 12.8 million computers in 1998 to gain 14 percent of 
the market. International Business Machines Corp. kept the No. 2 
position with 8.2 percent of the market, but Dell Computer Corp. 
decreased the gap, growing 65 percent in 1998 to account for 7.9 
percent of all PCs shipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dell now has posted 13 consecutive quarters of 50 percent-plus  
growth, leveraging its business model to insure that they are the 
price leader in the professional market,'' said Schaub. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard Co. finished the year as the fourth-largest  
shipper of personal computers, with 5.8 percent of the market, and 
Packard Bell NEC Inc. was fifth with 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report released by International Data Corp. based on  
preliminary calculations showed slightly different figures for PC 
sales and market share but concurred with Dataquest as to the top 
five vendors in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Firm Defrauder Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An executive at a securities brokerage firm was  
convicted of defrauding clients out of nearly $2 million with help 
from a fellow executive, prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Bahlav, managing director and part owner of S.F.I.  
Investments, Inc., was convicted by a jury Wednesday on charges of 
securities fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy. Frank Fasano, 
president and majority owner of the firm, pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit securities fraud in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bahlav and Mr. Fasano violated the fiduciary trust that is  
essential between the public and its licensed securities 
professionals,'' said Zachary W. Carter, U.S. attorney for the 
eastern district of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers persuaded more than 20 of their retail brokerage  
customers to lend them stocks, bonds and cash under false 
pretenses. Those assets were sold for cash, which the brokers kept 
for their own use. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were from New York City, Long Island, New Jersey,  
South Carolina, Virginia and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahlav and Fasano swindled their customers out of savings that  
took years to accumulate, and squandered funds that clients were 
counting on for retirement and their families' futures, said 
Carter. ``The convictions in this case ensure that they will be 
held accountable for the frauds they committed,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahlav faces up to 15 years in prison and more than $4 million  
in fines. Information on Fasano's sentence was not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan-based S.F.I. Investments closed in July 1997. There  
was no telephone listing for either Fasano or Bahlav.

<HEADLINE> 3 Jailed for Homeless Asbestos Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Three men who pleaded guilty to using  
untrained homeless men to remove cancer-causing asbestos from a 
factory were sentenced to prison Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ordered Buddy Vernon Frazier,  
35, of Chattanooga, Tenn., to serve two years and six months in a 
federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Chance Gaines, 25, of Arab, Ala., was sentenced to two years and  
nine months. Frazier's nephew, James E. Bragg, 24, of Chattanooga, 
received two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the federal  
Clean Air Act and use false Social Security numbers to get asbestos 
worker certification for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	They faced a maximum penalty of five years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Frazier recruited several homeless men from the Community  
Kitchen in Chattanooga to attend an asbestos training course in 
Memphis, Tenn., in early 1996, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the asbestos training certificates obtained by those men,  
Frazier obtained false identification cards from the Wisconsin 
Department of Health and Family Services, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier used those ID cards for about a dozen other homeless men  
removing asbestos from the Weyerhaeuser Co. factory in Marshfield, 
prosecutors said. The workers were untrained and did not follow 
proper procedures, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asbestos was widely used during the 1940s and 1950s for  
insulation in factories, ships and power plants. It later became 
known that, when inhaled, asbestos can cause lung cancer and 
asbestosis, a lung-scarring disease.

<HEADLINE> Angola Wants U.N. Mission To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- The Angolan government wants U.N.  
peacekeepers to leave the country but is willing to let U.N. aid 
workers stay, a senior official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Higino Carneiro, deputy minister for Territorial Administration,  
told Angola's parliament that the government will reject a U.N. 
Security Council resolution to keep some peacekeepers in the 
southwestern African country. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers were sent to monitor the implementation of a  
1994 peace accord, which disintegrated last month. Fighting has 
spread throughout the country, prompting the United Nations to pull 
all its personnel back to the capital, Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government will not accept the continued presence of any  
member of the United Nations observer mission in Angola,'' Carneiro 
told the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Assembly responded with two motions, one urging the  
government to terminate the U.N. mission and another blaming the 
United Nations for the slide back to war. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has spent $1.5 billion over the past four  
years on implementing the peace deal. The peacekeepers' mandate 
expires Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report on Angola earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan recommended pulling out the U.N. mission, but the 
Security Council supported ``a multidisciplinary presence'' in 
Angola, presumably involving political, military and humanitarian 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	As a sign of the worsening situation in Angola, Faustino Muteka,  
minister for Territorial Administration, told lawmakers that the 
government was preparing an official document announcing that it 
was abandoning the 1994 peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council has blamed UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for  
the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola -- for failing 
to carry out key elements of the agreement requiring the rebel 
force to disarm and turn over territory to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil war erupted in Angola after its 1975 independence from  
Portugal. A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Havana, the Cuban government on Thursday denied recent  
reports that Cuban military advisers are helping Angola's army in 
the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``That information is totally false,'' Foreign Ministry  
spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said at a weekly news conference. ``We 
have a civilian presence, such as doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Cuban doctors and nurses are working at the Luanda  
Military Hospital, where wounded government troops are being 
treated as part of a cooperation agreement. Cuban doctors also run 
two private clinics in Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban forces fought on the government side after the civil war  
first erupted in 1975, but withdrew forces in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Keep Advancing; Dow Up 78.27 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes resumed their advance at midday  
and were posting healthy gains, as investors digested some 
high-profile merger announcements and a slew of earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
78.27 at 9,278.50. On Wednesday, the Dow skidded 124.35 to close at 
9,200.23, ending up only 18 points for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market is merger driven,'' said Ted Theodore, director of  
research at Avatar Associates, ``and you have this added feature of 
a very good earnings picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advancing issues had a relatively weak 9-to-7 lead on  
decliners on the Big Board, where volume came to 357.78 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 45.10 at 2,452.24, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite up 
15.47 at 1,258.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks were again leading the way, as Internet search  
service Yahoo! announced it is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! shares were up 12 7/16 at 348 5/16, while GeoCities  
shares were soaring 36 7/16 at 111 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Ford Motor Co. said it will buy the  
automotive operations of Sweden's AB Volvo for $6.45 billion. 
Ford's shares were up 5/8 at 60 15/16, but Volvo's American 
depositary receipts were down 1/2 at 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Internet service provider American Online were up 8  
7/16 at 173 15/16 in leading volume on the Big Board. The company 
reported that its second-quarter earnings nearly quadrupled, 
handily beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly shares were up 1 1/8 at 91 7/8 after the drug maker  
announced strong earnings and authorized a $1 billion stock 
repurchase program. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecommunications company GTE Corp.'s shares were up 1 13/16 at  
68 after the company said its profits rose 22 percent in the fourth 
quarter, beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testied  
before the Senate Budget Committee this morning. He repeated his 
earlier criticism of a Clinton Administration plan to have the 
government invest around $700 billion of Social Security money in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Herculean efforts,'' Greenspan said, he doubted  
decisions on investing this money could be insulated from political 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors hadn't made much of the proposal, announced earlier  
this month in President Clinton's State of the Union address, and 
didn't have much reaction today to Greenspan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news, the Labor Department reported that  
Americans' wages and benefits rose last year by 3.4 percent, the 
fastest clip in five years and a slight improvement over 1997. But 
wages and benefits did cool in the fourth quarter, good news for 
investors who are worried that wage pressures could prove 
inflationary and prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest 
rates.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Bring Cup to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the Detroit Red  
Wings to the White House on Thursday to celebrate their second 
straight year as Stanley Cup champions, joking they had been back 
often enough that he should clear an annual day for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is becoming such a regular thing. ... We should just have  
Michigan Day at the White House,'' Clinton said, standing to the 
left of the silver Stanley Cup in the East Room. 
</P>

	The Red Wings swept the Washington Capitols in four games for  
their second championship in 1998. Team captain Steve Yzerman was 
named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said of Yzerman, ``when the chips are down, you always  
made the plays. That's something every leader needs to do, and you 
have done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton especially acknowledged former defenseman Vladimir  
Konstantinov and former team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, both in 
wheel chairs, bringing Mnatsakanov nearly to tears. They have been 
recovering for the past 19 months from disabling injuries suffered 
in a limousine accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman joked with Clinton that during the playoff games, ``I'm  
sure you were in your hotel room with your Red Wings jersey on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yzerman gave Clinton a home Red Wings jersey and this  
year he added to his collection by giving him an away-game jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Scotty Bowman presented Clinton with a miniature replica  
of the Stanley Cup. ``You know, Mr. President, how difficult it is 
to win the first one, and how challenging it is to repeat a second 
time,'' Bowman said as Clinton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting with the president, players joked about their two  
visits to the White House in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a first name basis with everyone here,'' said  
defenseman Larry Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out if they've redecorated,'' Yzerman added.  
</P>
<P>
	But one star player, center Sergei Federov, was visiting the  
White House for the first time, having missed last year's visit 
because he had no new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very new to me. I'm very excited,'' Federov said.  
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov traveled on the Red Wings' plane  
with their teammates for the first time since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov's wife, Irina, said he was aware during the day  
that he was meeting with the president, and with some prompting, he 
remembered last year's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's much more aware this year,'' she said. ``He's enjoying  
it. He's having a ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Konstantinov stole the show as he gave President  
Clinton a thumbs-up while sitting back in his wheelchair and 
Clinton returned the sign.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Hard Drive Mechanic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crash is the most feared word in the computer  
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacker and virus come close but trail in sheer terror factor,  
because although they can cause crashes, they're much more rare and 
far less likely to strike the average Joe. 
</P>
<P>
	Crashes don't discriminate, don't destroy for thrills and show  
no mercy. They can bring down the mightiest corporate network, 
wiping out vital business data, or the lowliest home PC, erasing 
family finance records, kids' homework and Mom's favorite recipes. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations have technicians on staff to bird-dog such costly  
disasters and elaborate backup mechanisms in place to forestall 
economic ruin, but common folk don't, putting them at serious risk 
of losing everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Riding to the rescue comes ``Hard Drive Mechanic Deluxe''  
(Encore Software, for DOS and Windows, $49.99), a powerful utility 
made for the PC user who doesn't have a computer science degree 
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Computers are incredible time-savers, but occasionally they take  
a lot of that time back with hard drive crashes, often requiring 
hours or days and considerable expense to repair or replace fallen 
drives and then more time for tedious reinstallation of all the 
wiped-out programs and files. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything not backed up on floppy disks or add-on storage drives  
can be lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the panic most feel when a hard drive goes on the  
blink and the fact that few people back up their files with the 
kind of devotion needed to salvage everything after a devastating 
crash, a utility that accomplishes what ``Hard Drive Mechanic 
Deluxe'' does, as quickly and easily as it does, is nothing short 
of a cyberspace miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Using it, software-related hard drive crash sufferers can  
restore their computers back to normal in minutes, not hours. The 
user manual is easy to understand, never resorting to highly 
technical language. Directions are clear and easy to follow. And 
the program's graphic interface is pleasantly plain, making the 
drive restoration a simple matter of taking things step by step. 
</P>
<P>
	The average restoration time is five minutes. Its developer,  
Higher Ground Diagnostics, claims a recovery rate of better than 98 
percent for all types of software-related crashes, typically caused 
by incompatible software, viruses, flawed or stalled program 
installations, bad Internet downloads or hacker vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	What it pulls off with apparent ease is the digital equivalent  
of a brain-dead person recovering fully, without any lingering 
cerebral damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard Drive Mechanic Deluxe'' works with Windows 95 and Windows  
98, even with earlier Windows versions and their precursor, DOS. It 
works on all kinds of hard drives, even the huge multi-gigabyte 
models on the latest high-powered machines. 
</P>
<P>
	For high-tech heavies and business users with multiple drives,  
it can repair up to eight hard drives on a single PC. 
</P>
<P>
	It can also warn of impending doom, making it a valuable ally in  
the fight against fatal hardware-related failures caused by faulty 
or aging parts, wear and tear, power surges or invasions of dust 
and grime. 
</P>
<P>
	Linking with the Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting  
Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) that is built into most hard drives 
manufactured since 1996, the program keeps tabs on drives' 
mechanical and electronic elements and will alert users when 
problems first start to appear, long before a breakdown -- allowing 
for file backup and hardware repair or replacement before any major 
damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard Drive Mechanic Deluxe'' can bring considerable peace of  
mind for a fairly modest price and could be priceless to the many 
average PC users too busy surfing the Web, crunching numbers, 
chatting online or playing games to back up files. 
</P>
<P>
	If you must crash, at least do it with a safety net.

<HEADLINE> Death-Row Man Denied Clemency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- An Oklahoma parole board has rejected  
clemency for a condemned man who killed his mother, stepfather and 
a grocery store clerk when he was 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Sellers, 29, pleaded with the board Wednesday, saying he  
was deluded by Satanism at the time of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm begging you for mercy,'' he said. ``I can't imagine what I  
could say today to cause you to have mercy on me. The only thing I 
know to do is try to show my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board unanimously rejected the application, and Sellers is  
scheduled to be executed Feb. 4 -- the first time anyone would die 
for crimes committed at the age of 16 since 1959, when Maryland 
executed Leonard M. Shockley. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers was four months past his 16th birthday when he shot and  
killed store clerk Robert Bower, 32, on Sept. 8, 1985. Sellers had 
told a companion, ``I want to see what it feels like to kill 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, 1986, Sellers shot and killed his mother, Vonda  
Bellofatto, 32, and stepfather, Paul Bellofatto, 43, in their 
bedroom shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, now a Christian involved in outreach ministries from  
his death row cell, once worshipped the occult. At his trial, the 
defense said Sellers was addicted to the game ``Dungeons &AMP; 
Dragons'' and it dictated his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Bellofatto, one of Sellers' uncles, said his nephew was  
old enough to appreciate what he was doing at the time of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was old enough to drive a car, a 4,000-pound death  
machine,'' he said. ``But he's not old enough to know shooting your 
mother in the face is wrong? Give me a break.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Seeks Clemency for Mo. Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- With a papal plea, the governor's  
grace and a lottery winner's luck, convicted triple murderer 
Darrell Mease has escaped the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether Gov. Mel Carnahan will evade  
political consequences for granting clemency to Mease following a 
face-to-face plea from Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, a Baptist and a Democrat, is running for a U.S. Senate  
seat next year in a state where it's widely accepted that most 
voters favor capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``God help him if there are any grieving relatives (of Mease's  
victims), because he will need the pope to come back to campaign 
for him,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry 
Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	On 26 occasions, Carnahan has allowed the death penalty to  
proceed. Before Thursday, he had commuted a death sentence just 
once, for a man whose jury wasn't told of his mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has spoken out frequently against capital punishment  
and he did so again during his two-day visit to St. Louis this 
week. In 1991, before Carnahan was governor, the pope asked 
Missouri to reduce the sentence of Glennon Sweet for killing a 
state trooper. Carnahan reviewed Sweet's case, but declined to halt 
his execution last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday afternoon, the Vatican's secretary of state,  
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, met with Carnahan and relayed the pope's 
plea for Mease. Later, the pope, after a prayer service at a St. 
Louis church, came down off the altar and personally asked the 
governor to ``extend mercy'' to Mease, Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease was convicted of killing a former drug partner, Lloyd  
Lawrence, 69; his wife, Frankie Lawrence, 56; and their grandson, 
William Lawrence, 19, in May 1988. They were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	His Jan. 27 execution date was set last November by the state  
Supreme Court. Four days later, the court changed the execution 
date to Feb. 10. The court didn't give a reason, but many believed 
it was because the papal visit to St. Louis would coincide with the 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan announced his decision in Washington, defending it and  
insisting that it didn't bind him to any course of action in the 
future. The plea from the pope, under the ancient mosaics and 
soaring dome of the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica, created 
``extraordinary circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continue to support capital punishment, but after careful  
consideration of his direct and personal appeal and because of a 
deep and abiding respect for the pontiff and all he represents, I 
decided last night to grant his request,'' Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very moving time, a very moving moment for me. It was  
one of those moments that one would never expect to happen in one's 
life,'' the governor said. ``And I felt that this response from me 
was appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commutation was a rare victory for the pope, who has failed  
in other attempts to block U.S. executions, most recently that of 
Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death in Texas last year for two 
pickax killings. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul praised the ``generous decision'' of the governor when  
he learned the news, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians, however, were shaking their heads at Carnahan's  
decision and its effect on the 86 men and one woman still on 
Missouri's death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to wonder what the impact will be on future actions of  
death penalty cases and ... if this is a statement by the 
administration that all future capital punishments cases would be 
commuted,'' said David Klarich, a Republican state senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Others cited an apparent inconsistency: Since the pope also  
called for an end to abortion, would Carnahan, a steadfast backer 
of abortion rights, change his position on a late-term abortion ban 
that he has vetoed? 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to listen to the pope, we should listen to  
everything he says,'' said Senate Republican Leader Steve Ehlmann 
of St. Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Justus, who led Taney County's prosecution of Mease, said  
the inmate should have remained on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed with his decision, but I respect it,'' Justus  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Corrections had been trying for two  
months to track down relatives of Mease's victims, a standard 
practice prior to an execution, but hasn't been able to find 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Little was known about Mease, now 52. His lawyer, Laura Higgins  
Tyler, said he served in Vietnam and was honorably discharged in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease gave a videotaped confession that he had hidden along a  
path near the Lawrences' farmhouse and shot them with a 12-gauge 
shotgun while they rode by on all-terrain vehicles. He later 
recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyler said her client was ``awestruck'' when she telephoned him  
with the news of Carnahan's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrell has remained very steadfast to his faith in that he  
would receive relief from God,'' she said. ``I'd say this sure 
looks like a miracle to me.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! To Buy GeoCities </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58  
billion in stock, securing Yahoo!'s position among the dominant 
Internet search and directory services. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deal combines Yahoo!, the third-largest Internet  
destination, with No. 5 GeoCities and could unseat America Online 
Inc. as the most popular starting point for information and 
services on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! plans to place ads on GeoCities' site to try to lure its  
visitors to Yahoo!'s already popular Web destination. Yahoo! hopes 
to prod online businesses into buying more advertisements by 
offering them a broader Web network with more potential shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to Yahoo!'s Web site will be able to use GeoCities'  
technology to create their own Internet home pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate maintaining GeoCities as a stand-alone, very,  
very strong brand. There's a lot of brand equity in this company,'' 
said Tim Koogle, chief executive officer of Yahoo!, who will head 
the merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to capture visitors to the Web has created a frenzied  
pace of consolidation among Internet businesses. Internet companies 
are using their high-flying stock prices as currency to snap up 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home Corp., a provider of high-speed Internet access, reached  
agreement last week to buy Excite Inc., one of Yahoo!'s biggest 
rivals, in a deal valued at $6.7 billion in stock at the time of 
the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, America Online Inc. is fighting to protect its  
position as the top Internet access provider and Web destination. 
The Dulles, Va.-based company agreed last fall to buy Netscape 
Communications Corp. for about $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deal also puts pressure on Lycos Inc., the fourth  
most-visited Web site, to find a partner in the fast-shrinking pool 
of independent search and directory services, known as portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s 52 percent premium for GeoCities underscores the  
stratospheric valuations of these tiny companies, most of which 
didn't exist a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, which hosts Web pages created by individuals, has  
slightly more than 290 employees. In the final three months of 
1998, the Los Angeles-based company lost $8.4 million, or 27 cents 
a share, on sales of $7.5 million, according to its financial 
results also released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, a comprehensive Web site offering everything from news  
to free e-mail, has about 800 employees and earned $18.5 million on 
sales of $76.4 million in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very comfortable with this premium,'' Koogle said in an  
interview. ``There is a competitive market for leading brands that 
have a very large audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! already owns a roughly 4 percent stake in GeoCities and  
the two companies have worked together over the past year by 
offering some of each other's services to customers. While Yahoo! 
has talked with other companies, negotiations with GeoCities grew 
serious this past week-and-a-half, Koogle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, Calif., hopes the combined company  
will save money on technology costs by using Yahoo!'s computers to 
handle some of GeoCities' massive Web traffic and transactions such 
as online purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the At Home-Excite merger, which combines companies in  
different Internet fields, today's marriage reflects Yahoo!'s 
unique strategy of focusing on its Web services. That frees Yahoo! 
to forge alliances with Internet access providers like Bell 
Atlantic Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many recent Internet mergers, it's hard to predict who's  
going to come on top as the No. 1 Internet gateway because many 
partners share common customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal announced today, Yahoo will exchange  
about 10.6 million shares of its stock for the 31.4 million shares 
of GeoCities common stock. In addition, Yahoo will convert about 
8.9 million GeoCities stock options into about 3 million Yahoo 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities's stock was up about 46 percent in heavy afternoon  
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rising $34.50 a share to 
$109.50. Yahoo!'s stock was up about 2 percent, rising $7.12 1/2 to 
$343 and increasing the value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Media General Profit Up 11.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General, a Southeastern newspaper  
publisher and broadcaster, reported its profit rose 11.6 percent in 
the fourth-quarter, in part because of higher classified 
advertising revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General said Thursday it earned $22.1 million, or 82 cents  
a share, in the quarter that ended Dec. 27, compared to $19.8 
million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period in 1997. Revenue 
rose to $251.3 million from $242.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. The  
company's stock rose 93 3/4 cents, or by 2 percent, to close at 
$48.43 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond-based Media General has 21 daily newspapers, including  
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Tampa Tribune in Florida and the 
Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and 14 television stations. The 
company also has interests in cable television, recycled newsprint 
and online communications. 
</P>
<P>
	While its publishing operation reported gains in classified ads,  
``overall, the pace of advertising appears to be slowing,'' 
chairman and chief executive officer J. Stewart Bryan said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income at the company's newsprint division fell  
sharply because of higher costs for raw materials and lost 
production days because of required maintenance, Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General's cable TV business also had less favorable  
results because of rising programming expenses and a rate freeze. 
The broadcast division's results improved slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last year, profit was $70.9 million, or $2.67 a  
share, compared to a $10.5 million loss, the equivalent of 40 cents 
a share, in 1997, when it spent $710 million to buy newspapers and 
television stations from Park Acquisitions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue last year rose to $974 million from $910 million.

<HEADLINE> Man Asks To Be Spared Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A wealthy, politically connected  
attorney convicted of killing his mistress asked a jury today to 
spare him the death penalty for the sake of his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Capano did not change his story that another mistress was  
responsible for killing Anne Marie Fahey, nor did he apologize or 
express remorse. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would not beg for his own life, but asked that he be  
spared the death penalty for the sake of his family. He has four 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Capano's 76-year-old mother, Marguerite,  
tearfully pleaded for her oldest son's life from her wheelchair 
before the dry-eyed jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is not a murderer,'' she said. ``I don't care what  
anyone says, they will never convince me of that. I love him. I 
need him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee told jurors to  
disregard Mrs. Capano's statements about her son's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``That question has been resolved and that is an improper  
comment,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors convicted Capano on Jan. 17 of the murder of Ms. Fahey,  
who was Gov. Thomas Carper's scheduling secretary. Their sentencing 
recommendation to the judge will end their three-month involvement 
with a case that exposed lurid details about Delaware's rich and 
politically powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2 1/2 years, Capano maintained he didn't know what had happened  
to Ms. Fahey after they dined at a posh Philadelphia restaurant 
June 27, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In a surprising turnaround, Capano, 49, admitted at his trial  
that he stuffed Ms. Fahey's body in a cooler and dumped it at sea. 
But he claimed another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, accidentally 
shot her in a jealous, suicidal rage. Ms. MacIntyre denied even 
being at Capano's house that night.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Viagra Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROWN POINT, Ind. (AP) -- A man was charged Thursday with  
stealing 3,500 tablets of the impotence drug Viagra from the 
self-storage facility where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Steven Drisner, 21, was arrested at the Merrillville police  
station after confessing to twice using master keys to two storage 
units leased by Viagra maker Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake County Detective Tim Wardrip said none of the pills, which  
were valued at about $35,000, have been recovered. He said Drisner 
was cooperating with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer sales representatives rented two storage lockers at the  
U-Haul self-storage facility in November. One representative 
noticed 1,600 of the pills missing from a locker on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	A second sales representative found an additional 1,900 pills  
missing Dec. 29. The pills retail for $10 each, Wardrip said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drisner, who had worked at the storage center for about a year,  
was being held Thursday at the Lake County Jail in Crown Point on 
two counts of felony theft. He faces up to six years in prison if 
convicted and is scheduled for a bond hearing Friday.

<HEADLINE> Gillette's 4Q Earnings Rise 4 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Strong sales in the Gillette Co.'s new MACH3 razor  
system helped push the personal product maker's fourth-quarter 
earnings up 4 percent over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also makes Duracell batteries and Oral-B  
dental products, said Thursday that net income rose to $435 
million, or 39 cents per share. That compared with $418 million in 
the fourth quarter of 1997, or 36 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 6 percent, to about $3.2 billion, up from a bit  
less than $3 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's earnings were in line with analysts' predictions.  
</P>
<P>
	The MACH3, the successor to the company's popular SensorExcel,  
went on sale in the United States in July and in Europe three 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Alfred Zeien said sales of the new  
razor and blade were ``exceeding our expectations on every 
measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The razor system, he said, has been outselling SensorExcel by a  
margin of 10-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's total share of the blade market in the United States  
is about 71 percent up from about 68 percent a year ago, he said -- 
the highest share for the company since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette also said U.S. battery sales rose 11 percent. December  
is typically the biggest sales month for batteries in the United 
States. Sales in the company's toiletries and stationery products 
experienced a significant drop, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette earned $1.1 billion in 1998, down from $1.4 billion in  
1997. Revenue was virtually unchanged from the previous year at 
about $10.1 billion. Excluding the company's April sale of Jafra 
Cosmetics International, sales increased 5 percent over the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report was released after the market had closed.  
Shares of Gillette rose $3.56 1/4 to $57 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Peanuts, Buffalo Steaks on the Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pro football supremacy is not the only thing  
up for grabs in the Super Bowl. Georgia peanuts and Colorado 
buffalo steaks are also on the line, thanks to a bet between the 
mayors of Atlanta and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Confident that the Falcons will upset the Broncos in Sunday's  
game, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell is betting some of his city's 
treasures such as peanuts, spare ribs from an Atlanta eatery and a 
case of Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has overcome incredible odds all season,'' Campbell  
said at the meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors Thursday. 
``Now we are headed to a Super Bowl victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Mayor Wellington Webb said he was so sure the favored  
Broncos will win, he was willing to put up Colorado buffalo steaks 
and a football autographed by Broncos players after they beat the 
Green Bay Packers in last year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a championship football and this is as close as you  
are ever going to get to it,'' Webb joked. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the bargain, the losing mayor will have to wear a cap  
of the winning team for an entire day after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he experienced that indignity in 1996 when he had  
to wear a New York Yankees cap around his office for a day after 
they beat the Atlanta Braves in the World Series.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Bids Farewell to St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A stooped and weary Pope John Paul II bade  
farewell to St. Louis after a six-day journey to the Americas, 
during which he challenged the United States to use its political 
might to make the world a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic faithful wept, cheered and waved  
handkerchiefs Wednesday night as the 78-year-old pontiff walked 
hand-in-hand with Vice President Al Gore along the tarmac at 
Lambert Airport before boarding the TWA Boeing 767 for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Touch me, Holy Father! Touch me!'' a man in a wheelchair  
pleaded over and over. The pope turned from the line of dignitaries 
to bless the man. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's voice was hoarse and his hands were unsteady, but  
during his five-day journey to Mexico City and his 31-hour stay in 
St. Louis, he led worship services for tens of thousands and met 
with presidents and prelates on a schedule that would have 
exhausted a far younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said 
Wednesday evening during a prayer service at the Cathedral 
Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege,'' he said. ``Its exercise is  
morally justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis on Tuesday and met with President Clinton, avoiding 
what could have been a supremely awkward moment by making no 
mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he warned that the United States faces a moral test  
over abortion and euthanasia, just as it did over slavery on the 
eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	He also attended a youth rally where he got rock-star treatment  
from a crowd of 20,000, and celebrated a Mass for 100,000 
worshippers at the Trans World Dome, where he condemned the death 
penalty in some of his strongest terms yet, saying even those who 
commit ``great evil'' must be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said. He 
called the death penalty ``cruel and unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message resulted today in Gov. Mel Carnahan commuting the  
death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell Mease to life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reaching this decision, I took into account the  
extraordinary circumstances of the pope's request and the 
historical significance of the papal visit to St. Louis and the 
state of Missouri,'' Carnahan said. ``I continue to support capital 
punishment, but after careful consideration of his direct and 
personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect for the 
pontiff and all he represents, I decided last night to grant his 
request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mease, convicted of murdering a drug partner and two others in  
southwest Missouri in 1988, had been scheduled to die Wednesday. 
His execution was postponed in December by the Missouri Supreme 
Court, apparently because of the pope's visit to St. Louis. The 
execution had been rescheduled for Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought uncertain  
reactions from some of those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of 
somewhat who commits a heinous offense, ``that's the thing. It all 
boils down to a matter of forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive 
an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews to the Romanesque cathedral that houses the world's largest 
collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi participated in 
a papal prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his triumphant visit to Mexico, John Paul celebrated Mass  
before 1 million people at an auto raceway; held a private Mass for 
a select group of 250 bankers, politicians and church patrons; and 
signed a declaration setting out the church's goals in the Americas 
for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration condemned unbridled capitalism, drug  
trafficking, corruption and ``the culture of death'' -- abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. The pope also said the church 
must try harder to reach the rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Alleged NY Killer May Plead Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A prosecutor still plans to seek the death  
penalty against a man accused of killing eight women, despite the 
defendant's offer to plead guilty in hopes of receiving a lighter 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall Francois, a former school monitor, is accused of  
strangling the women over a 22-month spree and stashing their 
corpses in the home he shared with his family in Poughkeepsie, 80 
miles south of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were found last year and Francois was charged with  
eight counts of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents unsealed Wednesday, it was revealed that  
Francois, 28, offered to plead guilty last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dutchess County District Attorney William Grady said he will  
still push for the death penalty, and it was unclear whether the 
court would even accept Francois' plea. A decision is expected as 
soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other case that is as worthy of consideration for  
the death penalty as this case,'' Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois' lawyer Randolph Treece said his client's plea offer  
was ``consistent with his sense of remorse, his sense of closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a chance for this to be closed, resolved and for  
everybody to move on,'' Treece said. ``If we go forward at trial I 
can tell you it's going to be litigated and it's going to be 
litigated vigorously.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: $965M for Job Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKTON, Va. (AP) -- Pledging to close ``the skills gap,''  
President Clinton proposed nearly $1 billion in new and increased 
spending Thursday to retrain dislocated workers, teach illiterate 
adults to read and increase job opportunities for disadvantaged 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you think about how almost every form of work today is  
different from what it was just a few years ago and how rapidly the 
nature of work is changing,'' Clinton said, ``we are going to be 
challenged to change our whole conception of what education is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president traveled to this Washington suburb to announce the  
details from his latest budget proposals at a training facility 
jointly run by AT&AMP;T, Lucent Technologies, the Communications 
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was enthusiastically received by the 1,300 workers at  
the facility, whose work involves customer relations, equipment 
maintenance and billing. The president toured a computer lab where 
workers enhance their cyber skills and met with students receiving 
advanced training. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have now is a situation in America where the income  
gap, that we all know widened over the previous 20 years or so, is 
largely a skills gap, and that it applies across all kinds of 
industries,'' Clinton said. ``We have to close that skills gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined by Education Secretary Richard Riley and  
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who said that even though 
unemployment was at a 30-year low and wages were on the rise, there 
was no reason to hold off investing in worker training. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half of our adult population today has a high school degree or  
less, and we know that the jobs of the future are going to require 
significantly more education,'' Herman said. ``This is a 
knowledge-based economy and what you learn today is going to 
directly impact what you earn tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's initiatives, totaling $965 million,  
received an initial blessing from a key House Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the White House will quickly shape these proposals into  
legislation as soon as possible and move them to Congress for 
consideration,'' said Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the 
Education and Workforce Committee. ``We will spar on a variety of 
education issues this year, but not these. What the president is 
talking about today should enjoy broad bipartisan support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The items highlighted by Clinton included $190 million in  
increased spending in fiscal 2000 over last year's figures for 
adult education and family literacy programs, $368 million more for 
job retraining assistance and $405 million to increase youth 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	For disadvantaged youth, the package calls for a new $100  
million program promoting partnerships between schools and 
employers to reduce school dropout rates and a $33 million increase 
in YouthBuild, a program that puts at-risk young people to work 
rehabilitating housing for low-income and homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the original sponsor of YouthBuild,  
said the increase in ``this simple and successful'' program 
represented a ``commonsense investment in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked for a five-year commitment to the Workforce  
Reinvestment Act, which was enacted last year. Among other things, 
the act provided for ``one-stop career'' centers to make it easier 
for those out of work to get assistance and information about the 
new skills they need for new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is seeking a $95 million increase in adult  
education grants to increase the number of teachers and the 
resources available for adults who are learning to read. The 
president also proposes a 10 percent tax credit for employers who 
provide workplace literacy programs.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport lashed out at the  
Australian media, saying she was taken out of context in reports 
quoting her statement that France's Amelie Mauresmo ``played like a 
guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said the media coverage, which focused on Mauresmo's  
looks and sexual orientation, was cruel to the 19-year-old who beat 
her to reach the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately you guys love to write the worst line possible  
and unfortunately you have hurt a very nice girl,'' Davenport told 
reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys totally took it out of context ... I was totally  
talking about the tennis. ... You know she's an incredible player. 
And I'm sorry that all this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said she had not spoken to Mauresmo to clear the air  
and did not think she would get to see her before leaving 
Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STRONG SHOULDERS:* Too much is being made of Amelie Mauresmo's  
shoulders, says her coach Christophe Fournerie. 
</P>
<P>
	The unseeded Frenchwoman won a place in the final by blasting  
No. 1 Lindsay Davenport off the court, prompting comments about her 
muscular physique and the time she spends in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her muscles on her shoulders are natural,'' Fournerie said.  
``If all you have to do is go lift heavy weights and build up your 
shoulders to be No. 1 in the world, then everybody would be doing 
it,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fournerie said he noticed Mauresmo had broad shoulders five  
years ago, but making them bigger was not part of the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's strong. If she hits the ball hard, its not all coming  
from the shoulder, its part of everything -- how she hits the ball, 
her technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amelie doesn't just spend her time in the gym, it's a lot more  
than just lifting weights.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEEDS RARITY:* Amelie Mauresmo's appearance is only the eighth  
time since the Open era began in 1968 that an unseeded woman will 
play in a Grand Slam tournament singles final. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the first since Venus Williams reached the title match at  
the 1997 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one of the seven previous unseeded players went gone on the  
win a Slam title -- Australia's Chris O'Neil, whose 1978 Australian 
Open win was her only Slam crown. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG CLIMBER:* Nicolas Lapentti has assured himself of a giant  
climb up the tennis rankings by reaching the Australian Open 
semifinals, where he lost to Sweden's Thomas Enqvist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Ecuadorian was ranked 91st coming into this  
tournament, but now will be in the top 40 when the new rankings 
come out next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist, who was ranked as high as No. 6 in 1996, reached his  
first Grand Slam final by beating Lapentti, assuring himself of 
climbing from his present 21st rank to at least No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be eighth or ninth if he wins here.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 Pete Sampras skipped this tournament, citing fatigue, but  
the players with a chance to overtake him either withdrew or lost 
in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Marcelo Rios withdrew with a back injury on the eve of the  
first round, and will fall to No. 5 or 6. Alex Corretja will be No. 
2. U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter will be either No. 3 or 4. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COURT CLOWN:* After being beaten in the doubles final, former  
Wimbledon semifinalist Natasha Zvereva joked that she may retire 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova beat Zvereva and  
partner Lindsay Davenport 7-5, 6-3, Zvereva said she would be back 
next year ``unless I retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zvereva, who won the 1997 doubles title with Hingis, later said  
she was only joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't take me seriously. I'm just a big clown. What I said  
doesn't mean anything,'' Zvereva said.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Rejects Impeachment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday crushed a  
Democratic call for an immediate vote on President Clinton's fate 
and adopted their own plan to allow public airing of Monica 
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony at Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid-fire developments on the Senate floor followed strict  
party lines after Senate leaders deadlocked in daylong efforts to 
negotiate a bipartisan timetable for the conclusion of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides envisioned a final vote on impeachment by Feb. 12,  
and the depositions are to begin on Monday. But there were numerous 
differences on key details in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 55 to 43 against a motion by Sen. Tom Daschle, the  
Democratic leader, to go immediately to four final hours of debate 
and then vote on the two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the Senate rejected Daschle's plan to limit to  
writing all records of the depositions of witnesses, preventing the 
videotaping the House Republican prosecutors want and the White 
House opposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans then pushed through their rules -- 54-44 -- which  
would permit videotaping of the questioning and leave open the 
possibility that it would be aired publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting came after hours of sparring between Republicans and  
Democrats over the way to conduct the final stages of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, put the rival plans to  
votes with a minimum of explanation, which prompted one of his 
colleagues to ask about details. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chief Justice William Rehnquist declined to answer Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian tells me it is never the function of the  
chair to interpret a resolution,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans wanted to leave room for a vote on ``fact finding''  
that would state formally that Clinton had committed offenses, even 
if he wasn't to be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic scenario would have prevented Republicans from  
even submitting such a document for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On the issue of witness questioning, Democrats wanted to exclude  
any videotaped material from the trial record -- meaning that images 
of Ms. Lewinsky would not be available for public showing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans countered with a proposal to allow portions of  
the depositions to be made public ``whether transcribed or on 
videotape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The votes unfolded suddenly after a day in which the trial had  
marked time while backroom negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking aggressively,'' Lott said at one point after he  
and Democratic Leader Tom Daschle had met and swapped proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart called for a swift  
end to the trial and said that in the Senate, ``the Republican 
majority has to answer to the country of why they want to continue 
to extend this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came one day after Republicans used their  
majority muscle to reject a call for immediate dismissal of the 
charges against Clinton, and to order subpoenas for Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 44 votes posted by Clinton's defenders on each of the  
two roll calls Wednesday may well have been more significant, 
showing the president had more than enough support to gain eventual 
acquittal on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Thursday's votes, Ranit Schmelzer, an aide to Daschle,  
said that House prosecutors had ``made it clear they wanted 
senators to be able to look these witnesses in the eye. ... We feel 
it is appropriate for the senators to do that, but it is not 
appropriate for the public to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said Republicans ``want to  
preserve the right of the Senate to use videotape as it sees fit. 
... The Democrats want to foreclose and gag the Senate's right to 
use videotape in evidence before we heard what is in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``findings of fact'' emerged as a major hurdle to an  
agreement, as well. They would involve a formal finding that 
Clinton committed some or all of the alleged offenses -- but would 
not remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats objected strongly, even before the small group of  
Republicans working on the issue had produced a final draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be able to do by majority vote what the  
Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev. ``It would be constitutionally fraught with ... 
peril.

	The witness issue has been a controversial one throughout the  
trial, and ironically, it appeared that each side -- the White House 
and House prosecutors -- wanted to preserve its right to seek 
additional evidence or witnesses if something unexpected turned up 
in the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan or Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former prosecutor, was asked by  
reporters at one point during the day whether he could imagine 
anything new arising from the depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could imagine it, but I doubt it would happen,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Orleans' NCAA Ticket Sales Sag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The Louisiana Superdome usually has no  
problem selling tickets for college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the top 10 college basketball crowds have been in the  
arena -- a statistic officials used to snag one of this year's NCAA 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	But something is happening to ticket sales for March's  
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say we're a little concerned when we see how  
tickets are selling in New Orleans as compared to the rest of the 
sites,'' said Bill Hancock of the NCAA. ``There were some concerns 
about awarding the games to New Orleans, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 5,696 of the 24,831 tickets for the March 12 and 14 dates  
have been sold. Another 1,700 are being held for the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the other seven sites, Boston with 18,000 seats and Denver  
with 16,000 are sold out, according to Hancock. Three -- Milwaukee, 
Seattle and Orlando -- are nearly sold out, and Charlotte and 
Indianapolis each has sold about 16,000 tickets but are not close 
to selling out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The site selection committee knew they were taking a risk when  
they assigned the event to New Orleans,'' Hancock said. ``They have 
never had a first and second round before. They had regionals and 
did just fine, but first and second round is different. It's more a 
grassroots, common-folks kind of event and certainly doesn't have 
the corporate appeal or glitzyness of the Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slow ticket sales are not a concern, according to Jay Cicero of  
the New Orleans Sports Foundation. He said New Orleans 
traditionally is a market of late buyers.

<HEADLINE> State Regulators Warn on Y2K Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People should watch out for investment scams  
exploiting fears of Year 2000 computer problems, state securities 
regulators warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some con artists have tried to persuade people to take their  
money out of banks to avoid computer glitches, then turn it over to 
be invested with them, the North American Securities Administrators 
Association said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's bankers recently told Americans not to panic over  
the Year 2000 date change, promising that ATM machines, credit 
cards, checks and banking services will be functioning normally. 
They also warned that withdrawing massive amounts of cash could 
make consumers vulnerable to being robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	The state regulators said other promoters are sending  
unsolicited e-mail messages selling investment opportunities in 
companies or products that are touted as fixing the Year 2000 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows how big of a deal the Y2K bug will be. But panic  
can lead people to make stupid mistakes -- something that con 
artists know well,'' said NASAA President Peter Hildreth, who also 
is New Hampshire's director of securities regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are practical, common-sense things investors can do to  
protect themselves short of burying their money in the backyard or 
hiding it under their mattress,'' Hildreth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group advised people to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Keep at least six months' worth of bank and brokerage  
statements on hand, in case a problem develops at the turn of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask your broker what their firm is doing to remedy the problem  
and what procedures are in place for potential problems or 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask for a report on Year 2000 readiness from corporations in  
which you own shares. 
</P>
<P>
	--If you manage your investments and personal finances using  
off-the-shelf money management software, check with the vendor to 
make sure it is Year 2000 compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check with the company that made your computer and its  
operating system to be sure they are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of a Senate committee on  
Year 2000 problems, has said the financial services sector -- 
including the banking and securities industries -- appears to be in 
the best shape of all the seven priority areas he has identified.

<HEADLINE>  Pope Bids Farewell to St. Louis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A stooped and weary Pope John Paul II bade  
farewell to St. Louis after a six-day journey to the Americas, 
during which he challenged the United States to use its political 
might to make the world a better place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic faithful wept, cheered and waved  
handkerchiefs Wednesday night as the 78-year-old pontiff walked 
hand-in-hand with Vice President Al Gore along the tarmac at 
Lambert Airport before boarding the TWA Boeing 767 for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Touch me, Holy Father! Touch me!'' a man in a wheelchair  
pleaded over and over. The pope turned from the line of dignitaries 
to bless the man. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul's voice was hoarse and his hands were unsteady, but  
during his five-day journey to Mexico City and his 31-hour stay in 
St. Louis, he led worship services for tens of thousands and met 
with presidents and prelates on a schedule that would have 
exhausted a far younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radical changes in world politics leave America with a  
heightened responsibility to be for the world an example of a 
genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society,'' he said 
Wednesday evening during a prayer service at the Cathedral 
Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	Power is ``service, not privilege,'' he said. ``Its exercise is  
morally justifiable when it is used for the good of all, when it is 
sensitive to the needs of the poor and defenseless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope, making his fifth visit to the U.S. mainland, arrived  
in St. Louis on Tuesday and met with President Clinton, avoiding 
what could have been a supremely awkward moment by making no 
mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he warned that the United States faces a moral test  
over abortion and euthanasia, just as it did over slavery on the 
eve of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	He also attended a youth rally where he got rock-star treatment  
from a crowd of 20,000, and celebrated a Mass for 100,000 
worshippers at the Trans World Dome, where he condemned the death 
penalty in some of his strongest terms yet, saying even those who 
commit ``great evil'' must be spared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modern society has the means of protecting itself without  
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform,'' he said. He 
called the death penalty ``cruel and unnecessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message resulted today in Gov. Mel Carnahan commuting the  
death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell Mease to life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reaching this decision, I took into account the  
extraordinary circumstances of the pope's request and the 
historical significance of the papal visit to St. Louis and the 
state of Missouri,'' Carnahan said. ``I continue to support capital 
punishment, but after careful consideration of his direct and 
personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect for the 
pontiff and all he represents, I decided last night to grant his 
request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mease, convicted of murdering a drug partner and two others in  
southwest Missouri in 1988, had been scheduled to die Wednesday. 
His execution was postponed in December by the Missouri Supreme 
Court, apparently because of the pope's visit to St. Louis. The 
execution had been rescheduled for Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope's condemnation of the death penalty brought uncertain  
reactions from some of those at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a Catholic, it's easy to be against abortion,'' said  
Douglas Marshall of St. Louis. But as for sparing the life of 
somewhat who commits a heinous offense, ``that's the thing. It all 
boils down to a matter of forgiveness. Are you willing to forgive 
an evil person?'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Wednesday's prayer service, the pope welcomed Muslims and  
Jews to the Romanesque cathedral that houses the world's largest 
collection of mosaics. For the first time, a rabbi participated in 
a papal prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this prayer signify our shared commitment to ever greater  
understanding and cooperation,'' the pope said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his triumphant visit to Mexico, John Paul celebrated Mass  
before 1 million people at an auto raceway; held a private Mass for 
a select group of 250 bankers, politicians and church patrons; and 
signed a declaration setting out the church's goals in the Americas 
for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration condemned unbridled capitalism, drug  
trafficking, corruption and ``the culture of death'' -- abortion, 
euthanasia and capital punishment. The pope also said the church 
must try harder to reach the rich and powerful, not just the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting for the pope to go back and start his  
pilgrimage in Mexico, to close the gap between Mexico and the 
United States,'' Rosalia Vazquez, 21, said in St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sony To Sell Music on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sony Music Entertainment plans to start  
allowing Internet users to download music for a fee and record it 
onto minidiscs, according to a published report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers would be able to choose from music produced by Sony,  
and would be charged according to the number of songs downloaded or 
the playing time of the music, the Asahi newspaper reported. The 
newspaper did not say when the new program would be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The company declined to confirm the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Sony Music Entertainment's parent company, Sony Corp., has been  
aggressively pursuing new recording technologies including the 
minidisc. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at Sony's music division increased 22 percent in the  
three months ended Dec. 31 even as the Sony group's overall profits 
declined by 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Interest Rates Fall / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages fell to a six-week low of 6.74 percent this 
week from 6.78 percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average has remained below 7 percent for more than seven  
months. It reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early October. 
Its peak last year was 7.22 percent in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.37 percent this week, down from 6.42 percent and also a 
six-week low. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.57 percent, the same as last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged about 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE> 400 Filipino Kids Taken Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Gunmen seized 400 children and 70  
teachers and held them hostage today inside a remote elementary 
school in the southern Philippines, town officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada, however, said there were only 50  
children and teachers who were seeking refuge from fighting between 
Muslim rebels and government forces and had not been taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the  
version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Midsayap and other town officials said the children  
and teachers were still being held late today but were safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Romero Arana said about 400 children and 70 teachers from  
several schools in the area had gathered for an English festival 
when about 800 suspected Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels 
converged on the school and prevented them from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they want to use them as shields in case of an attack''  
by government troops, Arana told The Associated Press. He said town 
officials had established radio contact with the armed men and were 
trying to negotiate the hostages' release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Estrada called the report a ``false alarm'' and said  
government troops had also taken refuge in the school, possibly 
leading to the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic fighting broke out between the rebels and government  
forces in the southern Philippines last week after the end of 
Ramadan, the Islamic holy month. Both sides have accused the other 
of starting the fighting, in which at least eight rebels, six 
soldiers and a civilian have died. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the two sides agreed on a cease-fire to prevent  
the situation from worsening, but fighting has continued in some 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Haj Murad, vice chairman for military affairs for the Muslim  
rebels, said today it would take until Saturday for all rebel 
forces to receive the cease-fire order. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed forces chief Gen. Joselyn Nazareno said he had informed  
government troops about the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the recent fighting, Estrada said the government had the  
situation well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no problem. We are in control. If they want peace, we  
will give them peace. If they want war, we will give them war,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada was studying  
the possibility of meeting with MILF chief Hashim Salamat during an 
upcoming visit to Mindanao, the island home to most of the 
Philippines' Muslim minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from the two sides are to meet for three days  
starting Feb. 8 to set guidelines for talks that are to lead to a 
resumption of formal peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Utah Colleges Subpoenaed in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Justice Department has issued  
subpoenas to three Utah colleges in its investigation into whether 
bribes were paid to bring the 2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Utah, Brigham Young and Utah Valley State  
College will be asked to provide information on their dealings with 
Olympic organizers, including tuition payments made for students 
related to International Olympic Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	Two children of IOC members already have been identified as  
attending Utah schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze's son, Sibo, reportedly  
received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi's son, Suhel, said he  
attended BYU and Utah Valley State College. He said Olympic 
organizers paid his tuition bills and provided him with $700 each 
month for living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Utah general counsel John Morris said Thursday  
that the subpoena seeks information on more than one student, but 
he would not say whether another student attended the school at the 
expense of Olympic organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal investigators also asked for information on  
other transactions between the University of Utah and Olympic 
organizers, including contracts for athlete housing and the use of 
Rice-Eccles Stadium for opening and closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena also requested information on medical treatment  
that may have been provided to IOC members at University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university has not been accused by anyone of any  
wrongdoing in connection with this,'' Morris said. ``We're going to 
cooperate in every way with the investigation.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-United Way Chief Verdict Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld  
former United Way of America president William Aramony's seven-year 
prison sentence for cheating the charity out of about $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals ordered a lower court to re-examine whether Aramony can 
afford to pay a $300,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also upheld former United Way financial  
officer Thomas J. Merlo's four-year, seven-month prison term and 
also ordered reconsideration of his $30,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Aramony and Merlo were convicted in April 1995 of defrauding the  
national United Way organization, based in Alexandria. Aramony was 
accused of using the charity's money to pay for high living and 
luxury travel for himself and girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Aramony and Merlo claimed on appeal that U.S.  
District Judge Claude M. Hilton of Alexandria unfairly used several 
legal ``enhancements,'' including one that adds time to prison 
sentences for people who defraud more than one victim.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will announce a deal to buy the  
passenger car division of Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.45 billion at a 
news conference today. ``Our 21st century vision is to become the 
world's leading consumer company that provides automotive products 
and services,'' Ford Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said in a 
statement. ``The addition of Volvo is a meaningful step toward 
achieving this vision.'' Business Week magazine reported on its Web

Fiat SpA, which also wanted to purchase Volvo's commercial truck

today the threat of force in Kosovo is essential to bring about a 
negotiated settlement, and his NATO counterpart, Javier Solana, 
would issue just such a threat later in the day. NATO's 16 
ambassadors, who make up the Council, have been meeting all week to 
fine-tune the wording of a threat to all parties in the Kosovo 
conflict, including allied airstrikes against Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. This threat is to precede a plan for autonomy 
in Kosovo, the poor southern province of Serbia, which is the

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers say they may forgo

witnesses. But the White House also wants the Senate to decide 
against live testimony and opposes a Republican idea that Clinton 
could be found guilty but not removed. Under those conditions, one 
legal adviser said the White House was comfortable to just argue 
the facts ``and bring this to a vote.''

	Colombia Leader Heads to Quake Zone  
</P>
<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana has rushed to  
western Colombia to stop looting by hundreds of earthquake 
survivors and get a logjammed relief effort moving. Men and women 
sacked dozens of stores in the worst-hit city of Armenia, carting 
away such essentials as drinking water and food -- but also liquor, 
furniture and TV sets. Pastrana said more than 240 tons of food had 
been shipped to Armenia and insisted that delays in distributing it 
will be eliminated. The toll from Monday's magnitude-6 earthquake 
reached 878 dead and more than 3,410 injured, a Red Cross 
spokeswoman said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is unveiling more than $800  
million in new and increased spending to retrain dislocated 
workers, teach illiterate adults to read and increase job 
opportunities for at-risk youth. Clinton was announcing the 
proposals today at an Oakton, Va., training facility. The 
proposals, which must be approved by Congress, call for $190 
million in increased spending in fiscal 2000 over last year's 
figures for adult education and family literacy programs, $350 
million more for job retraining assistance, and $303 million to 
increase youth employment.

<HEADLINE> Anglers Try Keeping Gulf Area Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fishery officials approved a plan Thursday to  
close a huge section of the Gulf of Maine to fishing in an attempt 
to replenish once-abundant cod stocks, a move that could ground 
thousands of commercial fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Fishery Management Council voted to close a  
swath of ocean extending about 30 miles from the coast from Cape 
Cod Bay to the border of New Hampshire and Maine. Scallop fishermen 
are exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The new limits will be phased in starting in March.  
</P>
<P>
	The council also voted to cut the daily cod catch from 400  
pounds per boat to 200 pounds elsewhere in the Gulf of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, piecemeal restrictions have been imposed to rebuild  
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But after scientists in December released a report that the cod  
population was at its lowest in 30 years, the New England Fishery 
Management Council decided that action was needed to slash the cod 
catch 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the loss of their livelihood, dozens of fishermen  
from the New England coast testified passionately for hours 
Thursday about what severe cutbacks could mean. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fishermen became so irate that five police officers were  
called in to stand guard at the hearing in a Portsmouth, N.H., 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishermen said the closures would hurt colleagues from  
Massachusetts and New Hampshire with smaller boats, but would go 
easier on those from Maine, who have larger ships and can fish 
farther out at places such as Georges Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're creating a war between ... fishermen,'' testified Paul  
Cohan, president of the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible restrictions could prompt regional economic losses  
ranging from $19.9 million to $21.8 million, according to an 
estimate in a draft analysis completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,500 fishermen could be out of work and 700 boats  
could be grounded, according to an estimate by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., who is seeking federal money to help fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Hearing Resumes in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet is entitled to immunity for  
any crimes he may have ordered while plotting his 1973 military 
coup because it was ultimately successful in taking power, his 
lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords, which must decide the former Chilean  
dictator's fate, is being asked to consider whether the 83-year-old 
general enjoys immunity from foreign courts and, if so, if that 
immunity covers the time before he came to power as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing before the seven-judge panel in Britain's highest  
court resumes today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London at the request of a  
Spanish magistrate seeking his extradition on charges of ordering 
killings, torture and kidnapping during his 17-year-regime. Judge 
Baltasar Garzon says Spaniards were among those slain when Pinochet 
toppled elected Marxist Salvador Allende on Sept. 11, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon has also included in his expanded warrant an alleged act  
of torture that occurred before the coup. He contends Pinochet 
ordered the arrest and torture of a group of Chilean marines in 
August 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Spain, Amnesty International and other human rights  
groups contend that doesn't fall under the general's claims of 
state immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers disagreed, arguing Wednesday that the success  
of the coup meant it represented a government -- even before it 
actually took power. 
</P>
<P>
	Acts done in the ``commissioning and planning of a coup, if  
successful, are covered by state immunity,'' Pinochet lawyer Clare 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you have an opposing side emerging which ultimately  
succeeds, that is enough,'' Montgomery said. ``Those are the acts 
of an embryonic government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords hearing, which has focused on intricate legal  
arguments, may stretch into next week. The judges may take as long 
as they want to issue a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The law lords already ruled once against Pinochet. But the court  
threw out its own 3-2 decision after discovering that a judge who 
ruled against Pinochet had close ties to Amnesty International. The 
group has been involved in the long campaign to bring Pinochet to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	If this panel also finds against Pinochet, he will have to spend  
months -- and possibly even years -- away from home, fighting a 
lengthy extradition process. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the law lords uphold a Nov. 25 High Court ruling giving  
the general immunity, he will be free to return home to Chile, 
where he is unlikely to face trial due to an amnesty law he passed 
before relinquishing power in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested during a visit to London, remains  
under armed guard at a rented mansion west of London. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he 
seized power.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Bananas Win Export Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILO, Hawaii (AP) -- For the first time in 50 years, island  
banana growers will be allowed to send some of their produce to the 
mainland without first treating it for fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture has lifted its requirement  
that all bananas be treated, allowing some varieties to be shipped 
only when full size, green and without cuts or punctures. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana growers looking to export their crops also first must  
obtain USDA certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii produced about 13 million pounds of bananas, with sales  
of $5.2 million, in 1995, the latest state figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers in the past used ethylene dibromide gas to treat bananas  
and other fruit for infestations, but that method was outlawed in 
1984 because the gas was considered a possible carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
	A hot water treatment developed later damaged the fruit too  
badly for shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule changes apply to the shipping of four varieties of  
bananas, three of the Cavendish type and the popular apple banana. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule changes went into effect late last year, and were  
outlined at a meeting Wednesday in Hilo for growers and workers.

<HEADLINE> Toronto 1996 Bidders: We Warned IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Organizers of Toronto's failed bid for the 1996  
Olympics say they warned the International Olympic Committee eight 
years ago that many of its members were seeking improper privileges 
and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Seagram, one of the organizers, told a news conference  
Thursday that the committee spent more than $500,000 to cover the 
cost of IOC members breaking or stretching rules governing visits 
by members to cities bidding for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Toronto group, 26 of 69 IOC members who visited  
the city broke IOC rules either by bringing more than one guest, 
coming more than once or staying longer than allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were constantly harassed by many IOC members looking for  
favors,'' Seagram said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the absence of any meaningful or enforceable rules, it was  
often extremely difficult to say `No.' But we did. At the same 
time, we saw improper practices and we were subjected to many 
abuses of our hospitality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said the committee submitted a 33-page report to the IOC  
-- including president Juan Antonio Samaranch and vice president 
Dick Pound of Montreal -- on Jan. 9, 1991, shortly after losing the 
vote for the 1996 Games to Atlanta. Along with outlining its 
findings of abuse, the report contained recommendations for reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram said he and other committee members were prepared to  
provide specific names and incidents, but didn't because the IOC 
never followed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We'll get back to you,''' Seagram said. ``But they  
didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, reacting late Thursday to the news conference, said  
senior IOC member Marc Hodler did ask Toronto organizers for 
specifics about their allegations but that local organizers never 
provided any. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I know they never followed through with the names,''  
Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to send a letter this week to leaders of the  
candidate cities for all the Olympics from 1996 through 2006, 
requesting details of any alleged misconduct by IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faced with that request I hope that Toronto will provide us  
with the specific facts we need to investigate,'' Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Toronto organizers' report, the most blatant  
abuse by IOC members was the misappropriation of travel expenses 
and airline tickets or passes provided by Toronto officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto group also said:  
</P>
<P>
	--It did not pay any explicit bribes to IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	--The gifts it provided to IOC members cost were within the $150  
limit stipulated by the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	--It was not reimbursed the money it spent on rent for a Finnish  
IOC member and her husband, who obtained a forestry job with the 
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in Sault Ste. Marie with the 
help of Paul Henderson, the head of the Toronto Olympic bid 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish member, Pirjo Haeggman, was the first IOC member to  
resign because of the ongoing scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the Haeggmans were having marital problems at the  
time and that he was only trying to help Pirjo, a longtime friend, 
and not seeking to sway her vote. He said the Toronto group 
expected to be repaid for the rent. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram and Henderson said the Toronto committee never paid any  
bribes or offered lavish gifts to win votes. However, the group's 
report says: 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, many IOC members expect to receive gifts above  
and beyond what anyone would judge to be courteous and gracious. 
Cash, jewelry or other items easily converted to cash were hinted 
at on several occasions. We were surprised to discover on more than 
one shopping trip that the bid city host was expected to pay for 
all purchases made by not only the (IOC) member, but the (member's) 
guests as well.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Industry Wants Government Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil state senators and industry  
representatives called on the Clinton administration and Congress 
to intervene Thursday and help the oil industry survive the most 
severe economic downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do nothing, things are going to get worse,'' Sen. Frank  
Murkowski, R-Alaska, declared at the opening of a hearing by his 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the oil industry's 
economic woes -- what some have called a severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee members expressed support for legislation that  
would give modest tax relief to small oil operators. Some witnesses 
at the hearing suggested the Energy Department should buy oil for 
its emergency reserve in hopes of giving prices a nudge upward. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation introduced Thursday by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, would give a tax credit to operators of marginal oil wells 
and tax relief to those willing to restart some of the thousands of 
wells that have been shut down because they're not profitable with 
the currently depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski and some industry witnesses chided the Clinton  
administration for not buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve at a time when prices are the lowest since 1986, and some 
say the lowest in 50 years, adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal oil purchases for the reserve likely would raise  
worldwide oil prices only slightly, said John Lichtblau, an analyst 
for the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains 563 million barrels,  
purchased over two decades for use in case of a sudden oil 
shortage. But no oil has been bought since 1993. While the Energy 
Department has acknowledged it might be prudent to buy oil for the 
reserve now that prices are the lowest in 12 years, no decision to 
do so has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry's problems, stemming from a 55 percent decline  
in crude prices over the last two years, have seen thousands of 
workers lose their jobs, with no improvement in sight. Small 
companies are threatened with bankruptcy, while larger ones such as 
Exxon and Mobil are pushing toward consolidation to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a barrel of benchmark West Texas Intermediate was  
at just over $11 a barrel last month, compared to $25 a barrel in 
December, 1996. And some lesser grades have been sold for less than 
$6 a barrel, Jay Hakes, head of the federal Energy Information 
Administration, told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, ``the recovery may take some time,'' with prices  
not likely to rebound to the $20 a barrel level until 2000 or 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichtblau attributed the collapse to an oversupply and  
unexpected drop in worldwide demand, largely because of the Asia 
economic crisis and warmer winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important reason was, and still is, the  
Asia-Pacific economic recession,'' said Lichtblau. This region had 
accounted for 80 percent of the annual growth in worldwide oil 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Iraq also was to blame for  
problems in America's oil patch. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil exports were allowed to increase from 700,000 barrels  
a day in late 1996 to 2.5 million barrels a day at the end of 1998 
under a U.N.-approved program, in which the country's oil revenue 
is used to pay for humanitarian assistance. The added supply 
increased the downward pressure on prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while the oil industry suffers, others are benefiting.  
</P>
<P>
	With gasoline prices dipping below a $1 a gallon in many places  
around the country, motorists are enjoying the lowest gasoline 
prices in inflation-adjusted terms since 1942, and possibly the 
lowest ever, according to government analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impact has been felt on the economy as a whole,  
contributing, economists say, to overall economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We estimated that some $40 billion of purchasing power was  
transferred from oil to other sectors of the economy last year as a 
result of the oil price decline,'' said Lichtblau. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakes said that because of low oil prices, ``instead of  
inflation being about 2.3 percent in 1998, we only saw about a 1.6 
percent increase.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Monthly Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's unemployment rate stood at 4.3 percent in  
December, falling from the postwar high of 4.4 percent the previous 
month, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jobless rate for all of 1998 averaged 4.1 percent -- the  
highest since records began being kept in the present form in 1953, 
the Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobless in December also fell, totaling 2.73  
million, down from 2.91 million in November, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobholders shrank by 650,000 in December from a  
year ago to 64.43 million, marking the 11th straight month of 
year-on-year declines. Jobholders in November totaled 64.81 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for men dropped 0.1 percentage point to 4.4  
percent from November, while the rate for women decreased 0.2 
percentage point to 4.2 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	An agency official told reporters that a decline in the number  
of people looking for work in December helped pull down the jobless 
rate, compared to the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Honor Student Charged in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKLEY, Mich. (AP) -- To acquaintances, 16-year-old Sarah Plumb  
is popular and smart. Police describe her far differently -- as a 
robber who stole to support a heroin habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged as an adult with armed robbery and suspected in several  
others, Sarah awaits trial on a count which carries a possible 
sentence of life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the one-time honor student and high school gymnast  
staged a string of robberies in and around this Detroit suburb to 
pay for a heroin habit that cost up to $200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	In all the stickups, the robber said she had a weapon but didn't  
reveal it, police said. Michigan law requires only the threat of a 
weapon for an armed-robbery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Howard Arnkoff said Sarah should be considered  
a juvenile and should have been charged with something less than 
armed robbery, since no weapon was displayed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she gets convicted, it's a non-probational offense. She  
must be incarcerated. She must be sent to prison,'' Arnkoff said. 
``And I seriously doubt she could get the help she needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word of her arrest created such a buzz among Berkley High  
School's 1,300 students Wednesday that the administration took to 
the PA system to discourage rumor-mongering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big surprise,'' said 15-year-old freshman Niki  
Boneff, bowling with friends at Hartfield Lanes after school. 
Berkley, a community of 16,000, typically has a half dozen armed 
robberies each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, hard drugs are few and far between,'' Detective Ray  
Anger said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though she denies committing the robberies, Sarah admits she is  
a heroin addict. She was arrested Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	She told police she began using the drug at age 14 when a  
co-worker at a pizza parlor introduced her and her boyfriend to 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, she got caught cashing a forged check stolen from the  
high school and confessed she was using the money to buy heroin, 
Anger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mom was able to get her into a clinic for a couple of weeks,  
but then the insurance ran out,'' Anger said. ``Two weeks doesn't 
cut it for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The robberies began last month, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 6 p.m. on Dec. 2, she allegedly entered an Amoco station  
next to the high school wearing a skull Halloween face mask and 
told the 17-year-old clerk -- a fellow student -- that she had a 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Plumb made off with $300, then went to her gymnastics team  
practice, police say. 
</P>
<P>
	She later allegedly tried to rob a BP station in Royal Oak on  
Dec. 14, robbed a beer and wine store in Berkley the same day, a 
pizzeria in Clawson on Dec. 15 and another pizzeria in Southfield 
on Dec. 16. She has not been charged in those holdups. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend tipped police to Sarah as a suspect in the first  
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	She is next due in court Feb. 22.

<HEADLINE> Online Investors Complain to SEC </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You might call them vox investori. Hundreds of  
Main Street investors are complaining to the Securities and

</P>
<P>
	Millions of amateur investors have joined the ranks of Internet

Chairman Arthur Levitt to warn investors this week to use as much 
caution trading online as when going through a traditional broker. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trading temperature has risen, so have investors'  
complaints to the SEC: They jumped to around 1,100 in the year 
ended Sept. 30 from about 250 the previous year, according to the 
market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	And that may be just the tip of the iceberg, with an estimated  
10 million people expected to be trading over the Internet by 
year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a rare person who complains,'' Nancy Smith,  
director of the SEC's office of investor education, said in an 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many frustrated investors don't take the trouble to put it in  
writing, she noted. Those who do usually have already complained to 
their online broker and are copying in the SEC regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Some examples from the SEC's files:  
</P>
<P>
	--A California man placed a market order online in May to buy  
1,000 shares of EntreMed, a biomedical company whose stock has been 
moving sharply. He figured the order would be executed promptly 
near $13 a share, which was where EntreMed was quoted at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Market orders are executed fully and promptly without regard to  
price, as opposed to limit orders, which are filled only at a price 
specified by the investor or better. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a delay, and by the time the man's order was executed,  
he said he was charged $83 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	--A Maryland couple placed a limit order to sell 300 shares of a  
stock but changed their minds two minutes later, specifying a lower 
target price. Four minutes later, as the stock continued to drop, 
they canceled the second order, wishing to hold on to it. 
</P>
<P>
	They received a computer message: ``Both orders closed/nothing  
done,'' but then got a confirmation that the first order was 
executed six minutes after the second order was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The most frequent complaints against online brokerages,  
according to the SEC: 
</P>
<P>
	--Failure to process investors' buy or sell orders or delays in  
executing trades. 
</P>
<P>
	--Investors having trouble getting into their online trading  
accounts or reaching their broker by e-mail or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	--Errors in processing trading orders.  
</P>
<P>
	The complaints appear to be evenly spread among the 100 or so  
online brokerage firms, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, one of the SEC's investor assistance specialists --  
there are now 18 or so -- evaluates the complaint and contacts the 
online brokerage firm involved. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of the investors use e-mail to make their  
complaints, while 45 percent write ``paper'' letters and an 
additional 15 percent call the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get the phones ringing off the hook and the letters  
pouring in, it's quite a challenge,'' Ms. Smith said. She added 
that so far, her office has been able to handle the flow. 
</P>
<P>
	As a first step, Ms. Smith advises, investors should talk to  
their broker and try to resolve the complaint. If that fails, they 
should write to the brokerage firm's compliance officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If no resolution is reached, investors should send a copy of the  
complaint to the SEC's investor education office at 450 5th Street, 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The agency's Web site is at 
www.sec.gov.

<HEADLINE> Hand Transplant Patient Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Hand transplant patient Matthew Scott  
flexed his new fingertips ever so slightly Thursday, and one of his 
surgeons said he was almost out of danger of developing blood 
clots. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, a paramedic from Absecon, N.J., received the left hand in  
a 14 1/2-hour operation that ended Monday morning at Jewish Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In a first, brief visit Thursday with two reporters and a  
photographer in his hospital room, Scott sat in a chair with his 
left hand and arm elevated and heavily bandaged. The nails and tips 
of his fingers were visible. 
</P>
<P>
	At Scott's request, no questions were directed to him or his  
wife, Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	At the prompting of Dr. Warren C. Breidenbach, his hand surgeon,  
Scott made the fingers twitch faintly. Breidenbach said he was 
testing the tendons that control finger movement. There is no 
feeling in the hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the transplant will hinge in large part on how  
the tendons respond, Breidenbach said in an interview later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you Matt's going to give it every effort -- he's an  
excellent patient -- but the biologic process is going to ultimately 
control what happens, and we don't know. This is uncharted 
territory,'' Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott's fingers are watched closely for signs of clotting, but  
blood circulation in the hand has been good so far, Breidenbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost out of danger. ... Anything can happen. But the  
fact of the matter is, the majority of blood loss happens in the 
first three days,'' Breidenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 37, lost his left hand in an accident with an M-80  
explosive -- a powerful firecracker -- 13 years ago. He is one of two 
people in the world with a transplanted hand, the other being an 
Australian who underwent the graft in Lyon, France, in September.

<HEADLINE> SEC Warns on Electronic Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As online trading swells with millions of  
armchair investors getting caught up in the excitement, the 
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has a warning: 
Be careful out there in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare public statement to individual investors, Arthur  
Levitt, who heads the market watchdog agency, told people Wednesday 
to use as much caution trading over the Internet as when going 
through a broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's remarks came amid regulators' concern over the recent  
wild price swings and crushing trading volume of the Nasdaq Stock 
Market, especially among hot Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investing in the stock market will always entail risk, no  
matter how you do it,'' Levitt said in an interview with The 
Associated Press. ``It is just as easy, if not more so, to lose 
money through the click of a button as it is to make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By year's end, an estimated 10 million amateur investors will do  
at least occasional trading over the Internet, with online 
brokerage accounts representing about one-quarter of all retail 
stock trades -- a trend that prompted Levitt to warn investors in 
the interview and a press statement issued later. 
</P>
<P>
	People trading online should ``remember the investment basics,  
and not allow the ease and speed with which they can trade to lull 
them either into a false sense of security or encourage them to 
trade too quickly or too often,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all kinds of trading, Levitt advised:  
</P>
<P>
	--Follow three ``golden rules'': Know what you are buying, know  
the ground rules under which you buy or sell a stock or bond, and 
know the level of risk to which you're exposing yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be very wary of buying securities on margin, with borrowed  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	--One way you can reduce your risk in a turbulent market is by  
using limit orders, as opposed to market orders, when placing 
trades in ``hot'' stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Market orders are executed fully and promptly, without regard to  
price. In volatile markets, execution may be at a price that is 
very different from the current quoted price of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Limit orders, on the other hand, are executed only at a price  
specified by the investor or better. Investors using limit orders 
benefit from price protection, but there is the possibility that 
the order won't be executed. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Levitt noted, an investor might want to buy a newly  
released stock, called an initial public offering, that was trading 
at $9 a share. If the investor failed to specify a maximum price 
using a limit order, he or she could end up paying $60, $90 a share 
or even more when the market order was executed. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt also made his first public comments about day trading, a  
risky endeavor used by a small but growing breed of investors, many 
of whom have abandoned their regular jobs for the prospect of quick 
riches. Day traders seek out stocks solely for their sharp price 
swings, buying and selling them quickly to capitalize on the 
short-term movement in price and rarely holding a position 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Strategies such as day trading can be ``highly risky'' for Main  
Street investors, who should engage in it only ``with funds they 
can afford to lose,'' Levitt said. He expressed dismay at stories 
he had heard of people putting up their student loan money, 
mortgages or retirement savings to finance their day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investment should be for the long run, not for minutes or  
hours,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of  
day-trading companies, which sell training courses to novice 
investors. A handful of regulators, particularly in Massachusetts, 
have filed fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the day-trading companies acknowledge they're not  
for everyone, but they say the state regulators are unfairly 
tarnishing the industry because of a few rogue firms that may have 
misled investors about potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
	James H. Lee, chairman and president of the Electronic Traders  
Association, commended Levitt for his concern. He said most 
day-trading companies act responsibly and disclose the risks to 
investors ``because they are getting into a professional's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SEC regulators have tried to encourage technological development  
in the financial markets while also protecting investors, and are 
not ``choking off'' day trading, Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Auto Output Falls 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's auto production fell 8 percent last year to  
10.05 million vehicles for the first contraction in three years, an 
industry association said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Japan's recession took its toll, passenger car output fell  
5.1 percent to 8.06 million, truck production plunged 20 percent to 
1.94 million, and bus production dropped 8.5 percent to 56,953, the 
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic vehicle demand in 1998 fell for the second straight  
year to 5.88 million, a 12.6 percent decline from the year before, 
the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting the gravity of the slump in domestic demand, Toyota  
Motor Corp. said Thursday it will cut production of passenger cars 
at its main plant starting Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota will halve operation hours on one of the two production  
lines rolling out luxury vehicles at its Motomachi plant in central 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The association also said that auto production in December fell  
8.0 percent from the same month a year ago to 778,141, down for the 
second straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic vehicle demand in December totaled 444,349 vehicles,  
down 13.8 percent from a year earlier, it said.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Marino Is Glad JJ Stayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTON, Fla. (AP) -- Dan Marino insists he played only a small  
role in persuading Jimmy Johnson to continue coaching the Miami 
Dolphins. However, he couldn't hide his sense of relief when 
discussing the matter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he left, it would have affected a lot of people's lives  
detrimentally -- the coaches, the players,'' Marino said after he 
was honored as the NFL's Man of the Year for his charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was important to stay,'' the NFL's career leading passer  
added. ``I think we're that close to a Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, distraught over his inability to balance football and  
family, very nearly walked away from the Dolphins two weeks ago 
before a last-minute change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at the team's training complex Jan. 14 intent on  
stepping down as coach and general manager. He found Marino waiting 
outside his office. The two talked, and a longer meeting between 
Johnson and Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga convinced Johnson to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino deflected credit to Huizenga, but said Thursday he was  
glad to have played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a long meeting with Mr. Huizenga. I think me talking to  
him before that helped,'' Marino said. ``I think it helped him want 
to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fired Chicago Bears coach Dave Wannstedt, a former Johnson aide  
at Dallas and the University of Miami, instead joined the staff as 
assistant head coach to take some of the pressure off Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all pulling in the same direction now,'' Marino said.  
</P>
<P>
	Marino accepted his Man of the Year trophy during ceremonies at  
the Miami Children's Hospital-Dan Marino Center, built with the 
help of a $1 million commitment from the Dan Marino Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital, in the far suburbs of Fort Lauderdale, offers  
comprehensive care to children with chronic medical needs. Though 
open only a year, plans already are in the works to double its 
capacity. Marino will contribute an additional $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been our biggest project, and it's something I'm  
extremely proud of,'' said Marino, whose foundation received a 
$25,000 donation from award sponsor Sprint Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino is keeping a low profile during Super Bowl week, saying  
it's frustrating to not be a part of all the hoopla when the game's 
in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough from that standpoint, to think down deep we had a  
chance,'' said the 16-year veteran, whose only Super Bowl 
appearance came in the 1985 game. ``To have it right in your back 
yard, that makes it tough. In some ways it makes you wish it was in 
another city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said he'll watch Sunday's game between Denver and  
Atlanta, but has no plans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about being in the stadium and not playing  
in the game -- I don't feel comfortable,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Bryant To Sign Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant is close to signing a six-year  
contract extension worth about $70 million with the Los Angeles 
Lakers, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the Lakers executive vice president, said Wednesday  
a deal with the 20-year-old Bryant was ``imminent,'' the Los 
Angeles Times reported. Bryant's three-year rookie contract was due 
to expire at the end of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a class organization, so you know there's no  
back-stabbing, nothing going on,'' Bryant told the Times. ``You 
know Jerry's going to take care of you. He's going to give you 
what's fair. ... I'm very fortunate to be in that situation, 
really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant will earn $1.3 million this season. The new deal, which  
will start with the 1999-2000 season, is believed to be worth close 
to the maximum Bryant can earn under the new collective bargaining 
agreement -- a salary of $9 million and a maximum $1.1 million 
increase each season thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's contract would top out at $14.6 million in the 2004-05  
season.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Rises From 11-Year Lows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices jumped 4 percent Thursday on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York, buoyed by unexpectedly heavy 
purchases that boosted the sentiment that export demand is on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, grain futures advanced, while soybeans fell to  
their lowest in nearly 12 years. Pork futures moved sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures bounced after Iran purchased 30,000 metric tons of  
sugar for delivery in March, bringing its weekly total to 118,000 
metric tons. Tunisia this week also purchased 64,000 metric tons of 
sugar on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants found a sense of optimism about sugar prices  
for the first time in weeks. Prices have been pressured by bumper 
world supplies and fears that Brazil, the world's largest grower, 
would export large amounts of its crop amid economic turmoil there 
that has producers seeking hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Further supporting prices was market talk that Russia, one of  
the world's biggest sugar consumers, may be looking to import soon. 
The Philippines also may have to purchase as much as 500,000 metric 
tons of sugar by May to ease a shortage caused by heavy rain, the 
Manila Standard reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.27 cent, or 4.1 percent, to  
6.92 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concern  
about above-normal temperatures and dry weather in winter wheat 
growing regions would leave crops emerging from dormancy vulnerable 
to a late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures traded both sides, tugged higher by the strength in  
wheat and a lack of farmer selling of stored crops, but pressured 
by the beneficial weather in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also advanced amid ideas that U.S. farmers would plant  
fewer corn and wheat crops this spring because of better asking 
prices for soybeans and after the U.S. Agriculture Department 
reported unexpectedly strong export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans slumped to their lowest since mid-1987 as rains  
returned to growing regions in Argentina and Brazil, putting 
farmers there on track toward bumper harvests. That would come at a 
time when U.S. exports are lagging because of economic turmoil 
across the globe, particularly in the key Asian buying region. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat rose 3/4 cent to $2.73 1/4 a bushel; March corn rose 1/2  
cent to $2.16 a bushel; March soybeans fell 2 3/4 cents to $5.10 1/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures finished sharply higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange amid talk that a Canadian meatpackers strike is likely to 
end this weekend, boosting slaughterhouse demand and reducing the 
amount of hogs exported to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors this week had become concerned about declining  
slaughterhouse demand for U.S. pork, a situation that would force 
producers to keep feeding their animals, raising the overall 
surplus tonnage. The declining demand comes in part because of a 
strike by the Canadian Quality Meat Packers union, and rumors of a 
settlement raised hopes that slaughterhouses will see the 
opportunity to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	February lean hogs rose 1.15 cents to 41.95 cents a pound;  
February pork bellies rose 1.58 cents to 55.70 cents a pound.

	NASHVILLE (AP) -- United Methodist Church members have filed  
ecclesiastical charges against one of about 150 ministers who 
jointly performed a blessing ceremony for a lesbian couple Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. David M. Holmes, a longtime gay rights advocate from  
Council Bluffs, Iowa, is the first to be charged following the 
ritual in Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	United Methodist News Service reported the charges, which were  
filed with Bishop Charles Jordan of Des Moines. The news service 
said Sacramento's Bishop Melvin Talbert discussed the situation 
with his cabinet Jan. 21 but is taking no immediate action against 
local sponsors and 80 clergy under his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges are based on a ruling last August by the Methodists'  
highest court, that a policy statementagainst same-sex blessings in 
the church's Book of Discipline is binding law.

</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The editor of The Lutheran, the world's largest  
Protestant denominational magazine, has announced he will retire 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Edgar R. Trexler, who will be 62 at his retirement, is  
a former pastor in Lyons, N.Y. He joined the magazine in 1965 and 
was named editor in 1978. The widely traveled church journalist 
continued in the post after the 1987 reorganization when two 
Lutheran denominations merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran 
Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Kahle, managing editor and second in command, died in  
December. Trexler's successor will be elected at the ELCA national 
assembly in August.

 *Mormons ban missionary e-mail, faxes    	
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Mormon church says missionaries may  
not use e-mail and faxes to communicate with families and friends 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Communication with their families has always been controlled by  
the church in an effort to keep missionaries, usually young adults, 
focused on their work. They are allowed to phone home only on 
Christmas and Mother's Day and are not to write more than once a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Don LeFevre, a church spokesman, said that with the convenience  
of e-mail, ``some missionaries may be communicating more than once 
a week, and that would detract from missionary work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were some exceptions to the ban, such as for  
missionaries living in areas where postal service is poor.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Daniel Herek, a 53-year-old priest, has been  
sentenced to five years in prison for sexually assaulting an altar 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Herek was convicted in August on charges of sexual assaults  
beginning in 1992 at St. Richard Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The archdiocese issued a news release, saying Herek had broken  
trust with young people, parishioners and St. Richard staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Father Herek will begin paying the consequences of the charges  
against him by serving time in prison,'' the statement said. ``He 
bears the irreparable loss of his reputation for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Welch, Herek's attorney, said his client stood quietly as  
his sentence was read and was not surprised by the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's extremely remorseful,'' Welch said.  
</P>
<P>
	Herek and church officials still face a civil lawsuit filed in  
September on behalf of the altar boy. It accuses the Omaha 
Archdiocese of negligence.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Buy Volvo Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is buying the passenger  
car division of Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.45 billion, adding another 
premium brand name to the portfolio of the world's No. 2 automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement announced today, Ford is expected to assume  
ownership of Volvo Cars' worldwide sites, including three assembly 
plants and two powertrain plants in Europe and the 
passenger-vehicle product development center in Goteborg, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also gets the right to use the Volvo brand for passenger  
cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks. Volvo 
retains its corporate brand for commercial vehicles and 
non-automotive products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said Volvo was one of many  
companies with which Ford has been talking following last year's 
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. Car makers around the 
world are trying to boost their profits and efficiency through 
acquisitions and joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has been talking to everybody in the industry for at  
least the past year,'' the FOrd chairman said. But he said 
negotiations with Volvo intensified in the last month after Ford 
executives became convinced ``Volvo wanted us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to approval by regulators and stockholders.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford stock was up 44 cents to $60.75 per share in early trading  
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is no stranger to Sweden, where the U.S. automaker has been  
operating since 1924 and now sells passenger and commercial 
vehicles through an 87-dealer network. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just in Sweden, we are part of Sweden,'' said Jac  
Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive officer. ``And through 
our new relationship with Volvo, we plan to be part of the fabric 
of the country for many years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo said the sale would allow the company to concentrate on  
improving its other operations, including commercial trucks and 
interests in construction equipment, marine engines and aerospace 
equipment. It also said the sale of Volvo Cars will allow that unit 
to invest more in development and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo Cars' future prospects will, by being an important part  
of one of the world's largest and most profitable automotive 
groups, improve considerably,'' said Leif Johansson, Volvo AB 
president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is complementary for both companies, with no overlap  
of brands, said analyst Gregory Kagay of McDonald &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of like a whale swallowing a guppy,'' Kagay said.  
``The implications for the industry are not overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts questioned the price tag. Nick Colas of Credit  
Suisse First Boston said, ``It's an interesting acquisition but an 
over-the-top price. ... It exceeds the financial value of Volvo'' 
by $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	However, William Clay Ford Jr. said the price was ``very fair''  
given Volvo's potential for growth worldwide. Ford also said the 
presence of other bidders did not alter Ford's price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our price was our price going in and we didn't get caught in a  
lot of last-minute bidding up,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo has been one of several auto companies considering mergers  
or acquisitions since the DaimlerChrysler merger. Italy's Fiat SpA 
and Germany's Volkswagen AG had reportedly expressed interest in 
Volvo, but recent speculation had focused on Fiat and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine reported Wednesday that Ford's offer won  
out over a $7 billion bid by Fiat SpA, which also wanted to 
purchase Volvo's commercial truck business. Ford has nearly $24 
billion in cash, Fiat just a $1.5 billion reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiat confirmed today it only wanted to buy the entire company.  
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of just the car sector wasn't in our strategic  
interests and therefore was never part of our negotiations,'' the 
company said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquiring Volvo will allow Ford to expand its 10 percent share  
of the European market by offering a broader line of near-luxury 
sedans and station wagons. Volvo would also help Ford in its effort 
to market itself as a leader in automotive safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford already owns Britain's Jaguar Cars Ltd., whose cars are  
priced well above Volvo's. Ford's European cars, meanwhile, are 
priced below Volvo's. 
</P>
<P>
	``The interesting thing is there's so little overlap, even with  
Jaguar,'' said analyst Joe Phillippi of Lehman Brothers. ``Volvo 
prices end way before Jaguar prices start, so that's not really an 
issue. In Europe, it helps them enormously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford earned $22 billion last year, more than triple the $6.9  
billion it earned in 1997, but that included a $16 billion gain 
from the spin-off of The Associates, a financial subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo, one of the world's smaller automakers, sold nearly  
400,000 cars last year, 100,200 of them in the United States. 
Sweden was its second-largest market, with 53,600 cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the first time Volvo has been involved in merger  
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockholders blocked a proposed merger with Renault SA of France  
in 1993. Opponents, mostly small shareholders in Sweden and 
midlevel managers, were worried about control of Volvo and jobs 
moving outside Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be less of a concern with Ford as an owner, based on  
the way the automaker has handled its acquisition of Jaguar, 
keeping it as a largely separate entity based in England. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Nasser stressed that Ford has no plans to make major  
changes in the way Volvo operates. Volvo's management will stay in 
place and the ``personality'' of its cars will remain intact, he 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Christer Karlsson, a Stockholm School of Economics professor,  
said Ford was the best partner for Volvo among those that were in 
acquisition discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a disaster if they Americanized Volvo, but I'm  
sure that they don't want to damage the trademark, but rather 
strengthen it,'' he said. ``Ford has let Jaguar stay an English 
car.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Hopefuls Find Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Without spending a penny of presidential  
campaign funds, Lamar Alexander aired $1.6 million worth of ads in 
10 states over the last six months of 1998. All that TV time was 
paid for with big donations that would be barred under federal 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander and other presidential prospects have discovered a new  
route around the federal limits on political giving -- through 
Virginia, where there is no cap on political contributions. These 
White House hopefuls are pulling in donations as large as $250,000 
-- 50 times the amount allowed under the post-Watergate federal 
campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become the Cayman Islands for leadership PACs,'' said  
Jennifer Shecter of the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
Washington-based research organization. ``It's such a haven because 
they have no laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though not considered official expenses of their expected  
presidential campaigns, the money pouring into Virginia-based 
committees from across the country helps lay the groundwork for 
bids for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle spent $611,464 through his own  
Virginia PAC in the second half of 1998, much of it to sow good 
will by handing out political donations in early presidential 
primary states. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's Campaign America spread $96,350 among candidates in  
Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses, and New Hampshire, 
site of the first primary. In addition, the New Hampshire 
Republican Party got $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice President Quayle spent most of 1998 helping people,''  
said his spokesman, Cameron Carter. ``It's not unreasonable to 
assume he might ask them to help him should he run for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average contribution reported by the PAC was $21,144. Giant  
agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland gave $100,000. Another company, 
Wilshire Financial Services of Portland, Ore., gave Quayle 
$250,000. Overall, the Virginia PAC raised $697,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle today formally filed a statement of candidacy with the  
Federal Election Commission and set up an exploratory committee, 
which can start raising and spending money for his presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's PAC aired commercials featuring the former Tennessee  
governor, who also served as U.S. education secretary, talking 
about his ideas for better discipline in schools and a tax break to 
help parents. The ads were seen by voters in Iowa, New Hampshire 
and eight other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of the advertisements in New Hampshire was to help  
Republicans in New Hampshire running for office and to bring 
awareness to an important issue,'' said Alexander spokesman Steve 
Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmidt also acknowledged, ``Any time you're on television  
frequently, whether it's on the evening news or the local cable 
access channel, that's going to raise your visibility. That, of 
course, is good for a presidential candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia records show Alexander's We the Parents PAC raised $1.6  
million and spent $1.8 million over six months. The average 
contribution was $19,557. There were four $100,000 contributors, 
including cable TV executive Leo Hindrey of Colorado and Florida 
businessman John Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other potential 2000 Republican presidential candidates,  
conservative activist Gary Bauer and 1996 vice presidential nominee 
Jack Kemp, also have Virginia-based political action committees, 
but neither was as active in 1998 as the Quayle and Alexander PACs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp's Virginia committee reported raising just $63,260 in the  
last six months of 1998 and spending $61,896, including a $40,000 
campaign contribution to Dan Lungren, the unsuccessful Republican 
nominee for governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Dickinson, executive director of Bauer's Campaign for  
Working Families PAC, said the Virginia group was created solely to 
help candidates in the commonwealth and wasn't active last year 
because there were no state elections there. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four candidates also has a related federal PAC  
account to contribute to congressional campaigns and raise money in 
accordance with federal limits. In some cases money raised by the 
state PACs can be transferred to their federal counterparts for 
shared expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party's potential presidential candidates also  
have federal PACs, but so far none has set up an account in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates who accept public money to help finance  
their campaigns must agree to comply with spending limits. But 
their 1998 spending, through state or federal PACs, won't count 
against their presidential primary limits should they formally 
enter the fray.

<HEADLINE> Brokers Charged With Inside Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three stockbrokers and clients pocketed more  
than $140,000 in illegal profits from an insider trading scheme in 
which they saw advance copies of Business Week's ``Inside Wall 
Street'' column, prosecutors contend. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers were charged Wednesday with insider trading for  
allegedly making stock trades based on information before it became 
widely public, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice 
Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers are accused of receiving advance copies of the  
column, or a list of companies it mentioned, from a fourth broker 
and buying stock in the companies that day, according to federal 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth stockbroker, Larry Smath, allegedly obtained the  
column from an employee of Hudson News Co. of New Jersey, and faxed 
it to the other brokers, who shared it with family members and 
clients, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District 
Court in Happauge. 
</P>
<P>
	Smath, 42, pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy to commit  
securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend the other three brokers -- Peter Cohen, 33;  
Seth Glaser, 29; and Joseph Falcone, 39 -- allegedly took sneak 
peeks at the information on several Thursdays in 1995 and early 
1996. Brokers and their clients would allegedly cash in by 
unloading the stock after the prices had risen based on the 
column's favorable coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Inside Wall Street'' column, written by Gene Marcial, is  
first published over the Internet after the closing of the stock 
market on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme ended in January 1996 when Business Week published an  
article, ``Is Someone Sneaking a Peek at Business Week?'' It said 
the SEC had been alerted to Thursday trading on stocks mentioned in 
the column. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, Glaser and Falcone had unlisted phone numbers and could  
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of securities fraud carry a maximum sentence of 10 years  
in prison, as well as fines and restitution, U.S. Attorney Zachary 
W. Carter said.

<HEADLINE>  Senators Disagree Over Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate ran into political snags today over  
terms for taking depositions from three witnesses in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats objected to any plan that 
would include public showing of videotaped testimony from Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans said the  
possible videotape was the major disagreement, but Democrats said 
the dispute was much wider. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats said the Republicans refused to agree to a firm  
closing date for the trial. Many Republicans also were pressing to 
allow the Senate to conclude that Clinton committed offenses 
without removing him from office. And Republicans wouldn't rule out 
calling additional witnesses beyond the three already approved, 
Democrats complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told the Senate at midafternoon he still hoped for an  
agreement setting out arrangements to finish the depositions by 
next Tuesday and then wrap up the trial with closing debate and the 
votes on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there still were questions and differences about  
what to do next, now that the Senate has ordered Ms Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses questioned by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making progress,'' he said. Lott said the  
bargaining is complicated because it involves the House 
prosecutors, Clinton's defense team, lawyers for the witnesses, and 
the Senate, which will decide what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the floor, Lott said it was legalistic bargaining with  
lawyers on both sides trying to take ``a fair advantage'' in the 
witness questioning ordered by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses summoned by the Senate are Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton's  
friend Vernon Jordan, and White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	A public opinion poll published today showed that 57 percent of  
Americans disapprove of the Senate decision to continue the trial. 
The votes to do so and to call witnesses were identical, 56 to 44 
on Wednesday, majorities 11 votes short of the two-thirds it would 
take to convict Clinton and dismiss him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and some Democrats also argued strenuously  
against a GOP proposal that would let the Senate conclude Clinton 
committed some or all of the alleged offenses -- but would not 
remove him from office. The ``finding of fact'' would be by 
majority vote, while impeachment conviction and removal needs 
two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be able to do by majority vote what the  
Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev. ``It would be constitutionally fraught with ... 
peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, defended the proposal, saying the  
finding would be simply ``an expression of opinion of Congress'' 
and therefore could pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, press secretary Joe Lockhart renewed the White House  
appeal for a quick end to the trial, saying it was the Republicans 
who ``have made the choice that they want to keep this around for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself was on Capitol Hill for a memorial service for  
Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, who also was a former senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House on Wednesday signaled that it might skip asking  
for defense witnesses if no new significant information turned up 
in the depositions and other conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle had expressed hope  
they could present a proposal today to conclude the trial by Feb. 
12 or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement approved in party meetings would be presented for  
approval in today's impeachment trial session. If a negotiated 
settlement for the rest of the trial eludes senators, they still 
would need to approve procedures for depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. These issues are expected to be the only business in 
the proceeding today. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers, meanwhile, let Daschle know their views on  
the possibility of forgoing witnesses, according to senior 
presidential advisers who would not be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense team said, first, that there would have to be no new  
damaging information from the three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House also wants the Senate to decide against live  
testimony and opposes a Republican idea that Clinton could be found 
guilty but not removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, one legal adviser said the White House  
was comfortable to just argue the facts ``and bring this to a 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Senate took back-to-back votes that  
demonstrated that Democrats have the muscle to prevent the 
two-thirds majority needed to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	First, senators defeated a motion by Democrat Robert Byrd of  
West Virginia to dismiss the case. With only 34 votes needed to 
block conviction, the Democrats produced 44 votes for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Democrat, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, voted ``no''  
along with 55 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, senators cast their votes in favor of deposing  
Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal. With Feingold again joining 
Republicans for a 56-44 margin.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe, Buchanan in War of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Forget Dan Reeves vs. Mike Shanahan. Ray Buchanan  
and Shannon Sharpe took an insurmountable lead Thursday in the 
Super Bowl name-calling contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Sharpe looks like Mr. Ed, and Sharpe said Buchanan  
should put away his high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	The war of words worthy of pro wrasslin' was waged by two  
players separated by 20 miles but linked by a media throng eager to 
fuel the feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon can always win, because he can talk,'' said Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback. ``But Shannon looks like 
a horse. I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't tell me he 
doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's comments were quickly relayed by reporters to Sharpe,  
the Denver Broncos' Pro Bowl tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that?'' Sharpe responded. ``Well, I think he's ugly,  
but did I ever call him that? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the high heels  
away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just what I 
heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe calls himself the best trash-talker in the NFL, but he  
met his match in Buchanan, whose media savvy has made him a Super 
Bowl star before the game even kicks off. He guaranteed a victory 
for the Falcons, then stole the spotlight at media day by showing 
up in a dog collar symbolic of their underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
	With coaches Reeves and Shanahan no longer willing to discuss  
their soured relationship, motormouths Sharpe and Buchanan have 
emerged as the marquee matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's barbs were the most pointed yet, though delivered  
with a nudge and wink. Both players talk with tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I see Ray in a snowstorm,'' Sharpe said, ``and his truck is  
broken down and mine is running perfect, would I pick him up? No.''

<P>
	More likely, the 230-pound Sharpe and the 195-pound Buchanan  
will cross paths Sunday. Buchanan made reference to the mild 
concussion Sharpe suffered in the third quarter of the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon just runs his mouth saying anything, so we don't need  
to pay attention to him,'' Buchanan said. ``He'd better watch out 
for himself, because he might get knocked out like he did that last 
game. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a team that's going to go out on the field and pull  
up our skirts and show our panties. I'm not saying we wear panties, 
but I'm saying we can't go out there and play like females and win 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe responded: ``I'm not hard to find -- I'm No. 84, and I've  
got the biggest mouth on the field. Tell Ray I'll be looking for 
him also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players eventually paused for breath, cracked grins and  
indicated the taunts and threats were merely pre-game 
entertainment, much like Cher or KISS. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan: ``Guys are going to talk. We all know it's just the  
nature of the game. It's going to boil down to what happens on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe: ``I don't take what anybody says about me seriously.  
It's kind of like a heavyweight fight.''

<HEADLINE>  Senate Rejects Plan to Dismiss Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside Democratic objections, Senate  
Republicans on Thursday opened the door to public broadcast of 
Monica Lewinsky's videotaped testimony as they muscled through 
rules governing the balance of President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rapid-fire series of roll calls, majority Republicans also  
crushed a Democratic call for an immediate vote on Clinton's fate 
and an alternative set of rules that would have barred any public 
viewing of the questioning that Ms. Lewinsky is to undergo early 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	By their votes, Republicans set Feb. 12 as a target date for a  
final vote on Clinton's guilt or innocence on the two articles of 
impeachment, which allege perjury and obstruction of justice. 
``That's our goal and we have set in motion a process that will get 
us there,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters, although he 
conceded the target could slip. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the first deposition would be Monday, with Ms.  
Lewinsky. White House aide Sidney Blumenthal would be deposed on 
Tuesday, and presidential friend Vernon Jordan on Wednesday. All 
the sessions will be recorded on videotape, and Lott said, 
``Exactly what happens to that videotape is not clarified or 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's up to the Senate itself to decide, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On another key point, Republicans left room for a vote on ``fact  
finding'' that would state formally that Clinton had committed 
offenses, even if he wasn't to be removed from office. The 
Democratic scenario would have prevented Republicans from even 
submitting such a document for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House accused the Republicans of ``power politics.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear the spirit of bipartisanship evaporated today, and  
that this has become a Republican impeachment trial,'' said 
spokesman James Kennedy. ``The plan that was adopted is vague and 
it has no certain end. It appears to contain trap doors that could 
significantly extend this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, countered: ``This is not a deep  
dark plot on the part of Republicans to slip anything over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 55 to 43 against a motion by Daschle to go  
immediately to four final hours of debate and then vote on the 
articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the Senate rejected Democratic leader Tom Daschle's  
plan to limit to writing all public evidence of the depositions of 
witnesses, preventing the showing on the Senate floor of the 
videotaping that the House Republican prosecutors want and the 
White House opposes. Playing the tape at the trial, unless the 
session were closed, would put it on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans then pushed through their rules -- 54-44 -- which  
would permit trial use of the videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting came after hours of sparring between Republicans and  
Democrats over the way to conduct the final stages of the trial. 
Despite the obvious partisan tensions, few if any senators 
expressed the kind of anger that marked proceedings late last year 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters he didn't fault Lott for the events of  
the day. ``We simply couldn't bring this matter to a successful 
bipartisan resolution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott returned the favor. ``I'm not ranting and raving and  
blasting them for their motives,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott put the rival plans to votes with a minimum of explanation,  
which prompted one of his colleagues to ask about details. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chief Justice William Rehnquist declined to answer Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian tells me it is never the function of the  
chair to interpret a resolution,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes unfolded suddenly after a day in which the trial had  
marked time while backroom negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart called for a swift  
end to the trial and said that in the Senate, ``the Republican 
majority has to answer to the country of why they want to continue 
to extend this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came one day after Republicans used their  
majority muscle to reject a call for immediate dismissal of the 
charges against Clinton, and to order subpoenas for Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 44 votes posted by Clinton's defenders on each of the  
two roll calls Wednesday may well have been more significant, 
showing the president had more than enough support to gain eventual 
acquittal on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``findings of fact'' emerged as a major hurdle to an  
agreement, as well. They would involve a formal finding that 
Clinton committed some or all of the alleged offenses -- but would 
not remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats objected strongly, even before the small group of  
Republicans working on the issue had produced a final draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be able to do by majority vote what the  
Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev. ``It would be constitutionally fraught with ... 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness issue has been a controversial one throughout the  
trial, and ironically, it appeared that each side -- the White House 
and House prosecutors -- wanted to preserve its right to seek 
additional evidence or witnesses if something unexpected turned up 
in the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan or Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former prosecutor, was asked by  
reporters at one point during the day whether he could imagine 
anything new arising from the depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could imagine it, but I doubt it would happen,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> April Presidential Primary in Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Hoping to pool their political influence, a  
half-dozen Midwestern states may join to create a regional bloc 
during the next presidential primary election. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin are already scheduled  
to conduct presidential primaries or caucuses on April 4, 2000, 
Kansas Deputy Secretary of State Brad Bryant told the Senate 
Elections and Local Government Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's secretary of state is seeking introduction of  
legislation to join the group, and South Dakota's Legislature and 
secretary of state have both shown interest, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the seven states that Kansas Secretary of State Ron  
Thornburgh began talks with four years ago, only North Dakota won't 
be joining the regional primary, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer has said he wants to continue the  
state's February presidential primary because it puts his state 
``in an early position in the primaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Kansas senators questioned the value of the primary bloc,  
expressing doubts that candidates would come to campaign so late in 
the political season. The proposed primary would come after 
nominations are all but secured by the major parties' 
front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost a dead issue by then,'' said Sen. Rich Becker,  
R-Lenexa. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New  
Mexico, Utah and Wyoming began discussing plans to hold a Western 
primary on March 11, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The West, one of the fastest growing parts of the country, will  
gain at least six additional congressional seats by 2000, which 
translates into more delegates to the national conventions of both 
major parties.

<HEADLINE>  Red Wings Bring Cup to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the Detroit Red  
Wings to the White House on Thursday to celebrate their second 
straight year as Stanley Cup champions, joking they had been back 
often enough that he should clear an annual day for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is becoming such a regular thing. ... We should just have  
Michigan Day at the White House,'' Clinton said, standing to the 
left of the silver Stanley Cup in the East Room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings swept the Washington Capitols in four games for  
their second championship in 1998. Team captain Steve Yzerman was 
named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said of Yzerman, ``when the chips are down, you always  
made the plays. That's something every leader needs to do, and you 
have done that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton especially acknowledged former defenseman Vladimir  
Konstantinov and former team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, both in 
wheel chairs, bringing Mnatsakanov nearly to tears. They have been 
recovering for the past 19 months from disabling injuries suffered 
in a limousine accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman joked with Clinton that during the playoff games, ``I'm  
sure you were in your hotel room with your Red Wings jersey on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yzerman gave Clinton a home Red Wings jersey and this  
year he added to his collection by giving him an away-game jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Scotty Bowman presented Clinton with a miniature replica  
of the Stanley Cup. ``You know, Mr. President, how difficult it is 
to win the first one, and how challenging it is to repeat a second 
time,'' Bowman said as Clinton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting with the president, players joked about their two  
visits to the White House in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on a first name basis with everyone here,'' said  
defenseman Larry Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll find out if they've redecorated,'' Yzerman added.  
</P>
<P>
	But one star player, center Sergei Fedorov, was visiting the  
White House for the first time, having missed last year's visit 
because he had no new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very new to me. I'm very excited,'' Fedorov said.  
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov and Mnatsakanov traveled on the Red Wings' plane  
with their teammates for the first time since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov's wife, Irina, said he was aware during the day  
that he was meeting with the president, and with some prompting, he 
remembered last year's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's much more aware this year,'' she said. ``He's enjoying  
it. He's having a ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Konstantinov stole the show as he gave President  
Clinton a thumbs-up while sitting back in his wheelchair and 
Clinton returned the sign.

<HEADLINE> Key Drug Test at Issue for Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Track and field's governing body opens an  
arbitration hearing Friday into Mary Slaney's controversial drug 
case -- with much more at stake than the future of the 40-year-old 
distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging the International Amateur Athletic Federation,  
Slaney's legal team will argue that the widely-used 
testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio used to suspend Slaney is 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test, used by many sports, detects the presence of  
testosterone, a naturally occurring hormone that also is taken in 
concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the hearing finds for Slaney, it would open a wide  
opportunity for female athletes to challenge anti-doping tests,'' 
Arnold Beckett, a former member of the International Olympic 
Committee's medical commission, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters and  
considered the best ever U.S. women's distance runner, tested 
positive for high levels of testosterone during the 1996 U.S. 
Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming that USA Track &AMP; Field dragged in investigating the  
matter, the IAAF suspended Slaney in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF then imposed its own suspension. Slaney challenged the  
ruling, and in September 1997 the USATF cleared her of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the IAAF also cleared Slaney to compete, it refused to  
accept the USATF ruling and referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel will meet in Monte Carlo and is expected to  
convene for three days. The hearing will re-examine evidence from 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	A T-E ratio should normally be about 1-1, but Slaney's original  
sample reportedly was higher than the 6-1 ratio that triggers a 
formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney said that recent research shows that the T-E test is  
unreliable for women who are taking the birth control pill in their 
late 30s or 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arne Ljungqvist, an IAAF vice president and head of the  
body's medical commission, maintains the ratio is a reliable method 
to detect abnormal levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much focus on the IAAF, but this test is the  
accepted method worldwide for testosterone,'' Ljungqvist said in a 
telephone interview from Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to question the validity of the ratio. Tests  
have been carried out on many athletes who use the birth control 
pill in their late 30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If these factors impact the T-E tests ``we would have come  
across this before,'' Ljungqvist said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slaney's team claims that the IAAF is defending the T-E test  
because it has nothing to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case isn't just about Mary,'' Jim Coleman, Slaney's  
attorney, said. ``At stake is whether the IAAF can continue to use 
the T-E ratio in the future. This is a trial of the T-E test.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Senate Roll Call Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights of the Senate's three roll call votes in Thursday's  
Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the Senate rejected, on a 44-54 vote, a Democratic  
proposal to limit to writing all records of the depositions of 
witnesses. The failed effort would have prevented videotaped 
depositions sought by the House Republican prosecutors and opposed 
by the White House. All 44 votes for the proposal were cast by 
Democrats, all 54 against it were cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the Senate rejected, on a 43-55 vote, a Democratic motion  
to go immediately to four final hours of debate in the trial and 
then vote on the two articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. All 43 votes for the move were 
cast by Democrats. Voting against it were 54 Republicans and one 
Democrat, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Republicans pushed through, on a 54-44 vote, their  
rules for the final phase of the impeachment trail. The rules 
permit videotaping of the questioning but leaves until later a 
decision whether to release to the public the transcripts and 
videotapes of the depositions. All 54 yes votes were cast by 
Republicans and all 44 no votes were cast by Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Students Tackle Sudan Slave Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- Barbara Vogel's class of fifth-graders had  
just finished studying slavery in American history when they were 
shocked by a newspaper article. 
</P>
<P>
	It said trade in human lives was still going on in the Sudan.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we read the article, it just hit us. I was wondering,  
`What are we supposed to do? I just got the feeling I've got to 
stop this,'' said Highline Community School student Kyle Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vogel's students started collecting change in jars to purchase  
the freedom of one or two slaves. Then the publicity started -- 
newspaper stories, radio features -- and checks began pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
	One year later, they've sent more than $50,000 to an  
international group that this month sent emissaries to Sudan to 
purchase and free more than 1,000 slaves. And upwards of 100 
requests for more information arrive each week from people who have 
heard about their campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The article, written last February by Associated Press writer  
Karin Davies, said the slave trade has resurged with civil war in 
Africa's largest and poorest country. Local militias, fighting 
without pay for the Sudanese government, claim booty in human 
lives, the story said. 
</P>
<P>
	The slave trade has been confirmed by independent reports as  
well as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sat at my seat, tears just coming down their faces, that  
this evil had not been taken care of,'' Vogel said of her students. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing they said was, `What are we going to do about  
this?' ``Then somebody piped up, `Haven't we learned from our 
past?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Her announcement last Friday that representatives of Christian  
Solidarity International had just returned from buying the freedom 
of 1,050 Sudanese was met by cheers and tears of joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Letters were read: from a Hebrew school, from a family in  
British Columbia, from a Texas retiree who enclosed a check for 
$100 and promised another $25 every month, from a Mississippi 
pastor who wrote, ``It is the ring of voices like yours that can 
end an evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students first sought help from STOP, Slavery That Oppresses  
People. The Massachusetts organization put the class in touch with 
Swiss-based CSI, which recently opened an office in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	CSI spokesman Rob Lanning said members of the organization meet  
with contacts in the Sudan, who deal directly with slave traders. 
Prices per person vary from roughly $70 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	He said CSI, a human rights group founded in 1977, has redeemed  
more than 5,000 slaves since beginning its forays in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Aurora students are the only school class  
participating in the group's work in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashley Smith, 12, said the newspaper story gave her a new  
perspective on her own life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me think about what I have and what they have. I  
shouldn't always want, want, want. I should give more than I 
take,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some classmates thought getting involved in an issue that  
involves humanitarian, religious, social, military, economic and 
tribal issues on the other side of the world would be too 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) it is never too complicated to help another person,''  
Vogel said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura: End Public Radio, TV Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Times may soon be getting a little  
tougher in Lake Wobegon. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jesse Ventura on Thursday proposed eliminating state aid  
for Minnesota Public Radio, which produces Garrison Keillor's ``A 
Prairie Home Companion.'' Ventura also proposed phasing out state 
funding for public television. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a former radio show host, noted that public radio  
stations have more staffing and better equipment than at stations 
where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura would cut aid to public radio by 25 percent in the  
fiscal year beginning July 1. The next year it would decrease 
another 50 percent and be eliminated the third year. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid to public television would be trimmed 25 percent in the  
second year of the next two-year cycle and take it down another 50 
percent in the third year. He would eliminate funding by the fourth 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's aides did not know what current funding levels are.  
</P>
<P>
	An MPR official said state funds -- about 2 percent of the total  
MPR budget -- have never been used to pay for the network's 
operating expenses, only for capital expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	MPR is hoping to use new state money to complete a statewide  
network that would include new stations in small towns not served 
by commercial stations, said Will Haddeland, vice president for 
public affairs.

<HEADLINE> Griffey May Not Want Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. isn't interested right now in a  
contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. And he may not be at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle tried last fall to open discussions with Griffey and  
shortstop Alex Rodriguez. Both are eligible for free agency after 
the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mariners shouldn't be concentrating on me right now, they  
shouldn't be concentrating on Alex,'' Griffey told The News Tribune 
of Tacoma. ``They've got to get somebody who can get some damned 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm signed for two more years. Alex is signed for two more  
years. I'm not going to sign something now -- I don't want to be 
stuck in a situation where we're good one year and not the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, halfway through a $34 million, four-year contract, is  
frustrated the Mariners haven't reached the World Series. The team 
figures to be weaker this year following the departure of Randy 
Johnson, traded last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the best shortstop in baseball (Rodriguez), the best  
center fielder (Griffey), the best designated hitter (Edgar 
Martinez), the best right fielder (Jay Buhner) -- and we haven't won 
anything. We need pitching,'' Griffey said. ``The team doesn't owe 
that to Ken and Alex; it owes it to the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is 29 and Rodriguez is 23. Scott Boras, Rodriguez's  
agent, already is saying the shortstop will top the $105 million, 
seven-year contract Boras negotiated in December for pitcher Kevin 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard the talk about a 10-year, $200 million deal, and three  
or four years ago, I'd have been oohing and aahing about that,'' 
said Rodriguez, who has a $10.6 million, five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now? Winning is my motivation,'' he said. ``What's the  
difference between $100 million and $200 million if you're not 
happy? I don't want to make $150 million and finish in last place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talk to Derek (Jeter) all the time. He'd sign a lifetime  
deal with the Yankees and why wouldn't you? They do everything in 
their power to win. I'm in a tougher situation here. Derek knows I 
like Seattle, but he tells me I have to win. If it's not possible 
to win, why stay?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners hope to start serious negotiations on extensions  
this month and complete them by July 15, when the Mariners move to 
their new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only team I've ever played for and they've made me  
rich at a very young age,'' Rodriguez said. ``I owe them this: I'll 
listen. But I've got to be realistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners were favored to win the AL West last season, but  
finished a disappointing third behind Texas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll make it real simple -- I need pitching,'' Griffey said.  
``Whatever it takes to get us to a World Series. That's what we're 
looking for. Do we have it here? I don't know. Did we have it last 
year? We thought so, but things didn't work out.''

<HEADLINE> Are Anti-Saddam Groups Effective? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military commander in the Persian  
Gulf sharply criticized the Clinton administration's strategy for 
toppling Saddam Hussein, saying U.S. support for Iraqi opposition 
groups is ill-conceived and could further destabilize the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we need is another rogue state,'' Marine Gen.  
Anthony Zinni told the Senate Armed Services Committee at a hearing 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if we had Saddam gone, by any means, we could we end up  
with 15, 20, 90 groups competing for power,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni criticized what has become the centerpiece of long-range  
U.S. policy toward Iraq. President Clinton last week designated 
seven organizations eligible for up to $97 million in U.S. military 
aid under the so-called Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zinni told the panel, ``I will be honest. I don't see an  
opposition group that has the viability to overthrow Saddam at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James Foley defended the  
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration is determined to redouble its efforts to  
work closely with the members of the Iraqi opposition in order to 
promote regime change in Iraq. ... And we will be reviewing the 
possibility of different ways of working with them in the coming 
weeks and months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I would fully endorse Gen. Zinni's conclusion that we  
believe that this is not going to be an easy or short-term 
effort,'' Foley added. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni, who commands all American forces in the Persian Gulf  
region, also told the panel that Iraq still may have Scud missiles 
capable of reaching Israel and retains the capability of 
manufacturing biological and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Zinni rated overall success of Operation Desert Fox as  
high. ``We're seeing more damage -- damage that we were very 
conservative in estimating until we had more proof or more 
evidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified as military officials announced that two U.S.  
warplanes dropped bombs on an anti-aircraft artillery installation 
in northern Iraq on Thursday after observing fire from the site. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no reports of any damage to the F-15Es or injuries to  
their crews. Both planes continued their patrols of the northern 
no-fly zone over Iraq after the incident, Capt. Mike Blass of the 
U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zinni told the Senate panel that since the end of the U.S.  
strikes in December, Iraq had violated no-fly zones in northern and 
southern Iraq more than 70 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's clear that Saddam has been a loser and his air  
defense system has been a loser in these engagements,'' Zinni said. 
``I would emphasize, though, our pilots are still at risk. This is 
not an undangerous mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In criticizing the policy of support for Iraqi opposition  
groups, Zinni took on a prized congressional Republican initiative, 
one originally opposed by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	An early critic of the plan, Zinni was asked by senators if he'd  
changed his mind now that the administration had embraced the 
policy as its own. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zinni said the policy ``could further destabilize the area''  
and ``could be very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing we need is a disintegrated, fragmented Iraq,''  
Zinni said. ``Because the effects on the region would be far 
greater, in my mind, than a contained Saddam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now Saddam is dangerous. Saddam should go. There's not a doubt  
in my mind. But it is possible to create a situation that could be 
worse. And that's my concern. These groups are very fragmented. 
They have little if any viability to exact a change of regime in 
and of themselves. Their ability to cooperate is questionable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Undersecretary Walter Slocombe, testifying at the same  
hearing, supported the current policy, saying: ``We believe we have 
a comprehensive strategy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, one of a handful of  
Democratic sponsors of the 1998 legislation, told Zinni: ``I don't 
think any of us ... are naive about the difficulties involved. But 
unless we try, there's going to be no change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the seven groups Clinton selected as eligible to receive  
U.S. support have said they do not want such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tehran-based Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq  
-- an umbrella for several Shiite Muslim opposition groups -- said 
that accepting the money would mar its reputation inside Iraq. And 
the Kurdish Democratic Party, a major Iraq Kurdish opposition 
group, announced, ``We do not intend to receive this kind of aid.'' 
The KDP's leader, Massoud Barzani, reportedly has said he does not 
favor toppling Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other groups -- the London-based Iraqi National Congress and  
the Jordanian-based Iraqi National Accord -- have welcomed the U.S. 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said that ``we have no  
immediate plans'' to begin doling out the $97 million in military 
aid and said the administration was working with opposition groups 
in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the only way we're going to break through the  
cycle of crises with Saddam Hussein is to see a transition to a new 
government in Iraq,'' Crowley said. ``We are working with the 
opposition and with other governments in the region to increase 
political support for the Iraqi opposition and make their efforts 
as effective as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Groups Vow To Expand Intel Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intel Corp. met here Thursday with privacy  
groups but failed to convince them to drop their boycott over new 
technology in its new Pentium III computer chips that helps 
identify consumers as they move across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the groups promised to expand their boycott to include  
any computer makers that sell machines using the Pentium III, 
expected on the market within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The distributors of a privacy toxin are as liable as the  
manufacturers of a privacy toxin,'' said Jason Catlett, president 
of Junkbusters Corp. of Green Brook, N.J., which helped organize 
the boycott with the Washington-based Electronic Privacy 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp.,  
among the nation's largest computer makers, couldn't be reached 
late Thursday to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy rejected the groups' call for his  
company to recall Pentium III chips already sent to computer 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no comment on their demands other than to say we've  
briefed them,'' Mulloy said. The chips are ``in the hands of the 
(computer makers), and systems are being built.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The groups also said they will consider asking the Federal Trade  
Commission to file a complaint against Intel, and they disclosed 
that attorneys general in some states, including New York and 
Massachusetts, contacted them this week about the privacy issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chip-maker, unveiled new  
technology last week in its newest Pentium chip that can transmit 
its unique serial number internally and to Web sites that request 
it to help verify users. The company said the technology will help 
online merchants eliminate fraud by verifying a consumer's 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to privacy concerns, Intel promised Monday to offer  
free software to let consumers permanently turn off the feature. It 
also pledged to use the software to turn off the technology by 
default in future copies of the chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy groups criticized those steps as inadequate, saying  
they want Intel to require computer makers to turn the tracing 
technology off by default. They also complained that tracer can be 
reactivated without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they want Intel to change its manufacturing process --  
an immensely expensive proposition -- to change all future chips to 
transmit ``0'' as their serial number, effectively rendering the 
technology useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at the end of the meeting they were a little taken  
back,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the privacy information 
center. ``They thought we were going to work together to teach 
people how to use their software. ... We basically said that 
approach won't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of any boycott on Intel would be negligible. The  
company supplies roughly 85 percent of the world's computer 
processors with $26.2 billion in sales last year.

<HEADLINE>  Sharpe, Buchanan in War of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Forget Dan Reeves vs. Mike Shanahan. Ray Buchanan  
and Shannon Sharpe took an insurmountable lead Thursday in the 
Super Bowl name-calling contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Sharpe looks like Mr. Ed, and Sharpe said Buchanan  
should put away his high heels. 
</P>
<P>
	The war of words worthy of pro wrasslin' was waged by two  
players separated by 20 miles but linked by a media throng eager to 
fuel the feud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon can always win, because he can talk,'' said Buchanan,  
the Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl cornerback. ``But Shannon looks like 
a horse. I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude. You can't tell me he 
doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's comments were quickly relayed by reporters to Sharpe,  
the Denver Broncos' Pro Bowl tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that?'' Sharpe responded. ``Well, I think he's ugly,  
but did I ever call him that? No. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the high heels  
away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just what I 
heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe calls himself the best trash-talker in the NFL, but he  
met his match in Buchanan, whose media savvy has made him a Super 
Bowl star before the game even kicks off. He guaranteed a victory 
for the Falcons, then stole the spotlight at media day by showing 
up in a dog collar symbolic of their underdog status. 
</P>
<P>
	With coaches Reeves and Shanahan no longer willing to discuss  
their soured relationship, motormouths Sharpe and Buchanan have 
emerged as the marquee matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's barbs were the most pointed yet, though delivered  
with a nudge and wink. Both players talk with tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I see Ray in a snowstorm,'' Sharpe said, ``and his truck is  
broken down and mine is running perfect, would I pick him up? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More likely, the 230-pound Sharpe and the 195-pound Buchanan  
will cross paths Sunday. Buchanan made reference to the mild 
concussion Sharpe suffered in the third quarter of the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon just runs his mouth saying anything, so we don't need  
to pay attention to him,'' Buchanan said. ``He'd better watch out 
for himself, because he might get knocked out like he did that last 
game. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not a team that's going to go out on the field and pull  
up our skirts and show our panties. I'm not saying we wear panties, 
but I'm saying we can't go out there and play like females and win 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe responded: ``I'm not hard to find -- I'm No. 84, and I've  
got the biggest mouth on the field. Tell Ray I'll be looking for 
him also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both players eventually paused for breath, cracked grins and  
indicated the taunts and threats were merely pre-game 
entertainment, much like Cher or KISS. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan: ``Guys are going to talk. We all know it's just the  
nature of the game. It's going to boil down to what happens on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe: ``I don't take what anybody says about me seriously.  
It's kind of like a heavyweight fight.''

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Is Golota's New Opponent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOTOWA, N.J. (AP) -- Jimmy Thunder tore his left Achilles tendon  
and will be replaced by Jesse Ferguson in a 10-round heavyweight 
fight against Andrew Golota on Saturday in the Convention Center at 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunder's injury and his replacement by the 41-year-old Ferguson  
was announced Thursday by promoter Dino Duva. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ferguson-Golota fight will be part of an HBO-televised  
doubleheader with a 12-round match between Michael Grant and Ahmad 
Abdin for the vacant NABF heavyweight title. The telecast will 
begin at 10:30 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson (26-17, 16 knockouts) was knocked out in the second  
round by Riddick Bowe in a bid for the WBA title in 1993. In his 
last fight, Ferguson, who will be 42 March 20, scored a 10-round 
decision over Obed Sullivan last Dec. 8.

<HEADLINE> Brewers' Loretta OKs $1.495 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Utility infielder Mark Loretta and the  
Milwaukee Brewers avoided arbitration Thursday by agreeing on a 
one-year contract worth $1,495,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta, who made $275,000 last season, had asked for $1.69  
million and the Brewers had countered at $1.3 million. The 
settlement was at the midpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta, 27, hit .316 with six home runs and 54 RBIs in 140  
games last season, when he set career highs in games, average, home 
runs, RBIs, hits, doubles and steals. 
</P>
<P>
	He started 32 games at first base, four at second, 15 at third  
and 50 at shortstop when Jose Valentin faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin will get a chance during spring training to win back  
his starting job 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta, the only Brewers' player to file for arbitration, is  
expected to get plenty of action, especially if the Brewers can 
trade second baseman Fernando Vina for some pitching help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark is a very valuable player for us,'' general manager Sal  
Bando said. ``His versatility and production have been and will 
continue to be vital parts of our club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta, a seventh-round draft pick out of Northwestern in the  
1993 amateur draft, hit better than .340 in four separate months 
last season and was sixth in the NL with a .347 average against 
left-handers.

<HEADLINE> Student Protests Ban on Goatees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHTABULA, Ohio (AP) -- A student fighting his high school's ban  
on goatees has asked the help of a bearded congressman, who says 
he's prepared to extol such bearded notables as Abraham Lincoln, 
James Garfield and Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steven LaTourette, R-Ohio, said he was unwilling to take  
Edgewood High School student Byron Gunter's side in the dispute at

and change a policy that he doesn't think is right.''

	Gunter became upset when school officials ordered him to shave  
off the chin stubble he grew over Christmas break or face 
after-school detention. 
</P>
<P>
	The school allows only mustaches.  
</P>
<P>
	Gunter countered with a note signed by his mother, indicating  
she gave him permission to grow the goatee. He eventually shaved to 
avoid detention and e-mailed LaTourette for advice on challenging 
the policy.

<HEADLINE> NHL Star Yashin Denies Arts Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Hockey star Alexei Yashin on Thursday denied  
allegations that he made a huge donation to Canada's National Arts 
Centre as part of a deal that would profit his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin, the Russian-born captain of the Ottawa Senators, held a  
news conference to explain for the first time why he canceled his 
$665,000 gift after paying only the first of five annual 
installments. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the arts center contended last week that the  
donation had been accompanied by a secretive side deal -- arranged 
by the center's former director -- that would pay $55,000 a year to 
Yashin's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin said his parents never planned to make a profit, and  
asserted that the deal called for them to be paid only to cover 
expenses incurred in helping bring top Russian performers to the 
arts center. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin's contribution, the largest donation ever made in the  
center's 29-year history, was greeted with much fanfare last March. 
Yashin was feted at a special ceremony with the center's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last week, Yashin withdrew his gift, citing only  
``personal reasons'' for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he felt like a criminal when arts center officials  
subsequently held a news conference to say that the deal had 
strings attached and might be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin also said the center seemed to be making no effort to  
import Russia talent, despite its promises at the time the donation 
was negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ottawa Senators have backed Yashin during the controversy,  
praising him for playing well despite the distractions.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Leaves $3.4M for Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KING AND QUEEN, Va. (AP) -- An eccentric millionaire with a  
reputation of being extremely frugal wound up bequeathing $3.4 
million in college scholarships for teen-agers in rural eastern 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this spring, a committee will pick students to receive  
four annual $6,000 scholarships in the name of Thomas Franklin 
Fary. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had made all of his money living in this part of Virginia  
and he wanted to return it to the area,'' William L. Lewis, Fary's 
attorney, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fary died in 1995 at the age of 92.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a fortune made in timber, the millionaire took baths in  
a river rather than pay for water, and hung out at a local store to 
pick up leftover packages of crackers left by diners. 
</P>
<P>
	``When crackers started coming in smaller packages, it nearly  
killed him,'' said Carey Hall, a former King and Queen County clerk 
who knew Fary. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said his client once lost a longtime girlfriend after  
admitting that he loved money more than her. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore tattered clothing and lived in a motel rather a house.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't want the burden,'' Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> Lilly 4th Q Profits Rise 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly and Co. reported Thursday that  
sales of Prozac and the antipsychosis drug Zyprexa keyed a 24 
percent rise in profits during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, which met analysts' expectations, rounded out a  
good week for the Indianapolis-based drug maker. Monday, the 
company partially settled a dispute over patents for Prozac with 
three companies that want to sell generic versions of the 
bestselling antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly said net income during the October-December period climbed  
to $567.3 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $457.5 
million, or 41 cents per share, during the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $2.64 billion, led by  
an 8 percent rise in Prozac sales to $744.5 million. Also, sales of 
Zyprexa rose 62 percent to $432.2 million, in part because 
wholesalers stocked up on the schizophrenia treatment before a 
price hike this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual sales of Prozac, the world's bestselling antidepressant,  
rose 10 percent to $2.81 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Lilly agreed to pay three generic drugmakers $4  
million so they would drop two claims challenging the U.S. patents 
on Prozac that expire in 2001 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Another portion of the patent challenge will move forward on  
federal appeals, but for now Lilly's exclusive hold on the U.S. 
market for Prozac is safe. Because of generic competition, Prozac 
sales overseas are flat, Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest shadow the company had over its head is basically  
dissipated,'' said independent stock analyst Hemant K. Shah. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly struck a deal during the fourth quarter to sell an  
enhanced version of Prozac. Not yet approved for the market, its 
patent lasts until 2015. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Lilly posted a profit of $2.17 billion, or  
$1.94 per share. In 1997, a $2.4 billion writedown of its pharmacy 
benefits unit, PCS Health Systems Inc., caused a loss of $385.1 
million, or 35 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly completed the $1.6 billion sale of PCS to Rite-Aid Corp.  
Jan. 22. Lilly had paid more than $4 billion for the company, which 
turned out to be a bust which turned out to be a bust, contributing 
only a penny per share of profits in all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good riddance to PCS,'' said analyst Neil Sweig of Southeast  
Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual sales increased 16 percent over 1997 levels to $9.24  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly stock rose  
$1.50 to close at $92.25.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Principal Gets Annual Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's more to being a good principal than  
boosting test scores or creating new programs, says Michael J. 
Pladus of Interboro High School in Prospect Park, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	It's important to be a strong defender of public schools, too,  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owe everything to my own public school education. That's why  
we as principals not only have to defend our cause, but we have to 
promote it,'' said Pladus, who was honored today as the 1998 
Principal of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	The award, sponsored by the National Association of Secondary  
School Principals, goes to the top candidate among 53 winners, 
representing each state, New York City, the District of Columbia 
and the Department of Defense schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In four years at the helm of his blue-collar, suburban  
Philadelphia school of 1,200 students, Pladus has added more 
advanced courses, increased state test scores to well above average 
and created special programs to teach about the Holocaust and 
better instruct special education students. 
</P>
<P>
	More important to him is that he's been able to persuade  
successful alumni to come and teach or be administrators at the 
school. Those recruits, who include an engineer, an attorney and a 
college official, show students they also can aspire to college and 
other accomplishments, Pladus said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is any enterprise that allows you to transcend social  
class and economic class, it's our public education system,'' said 
Pladus, 40, who grew up in a working-class coal mining community.

<HEADLINE> Bronco Blockers Keep Low Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- They were the talk of the Super Bowl a year ago,  
precisely because they didn't talk. 
</P>
<P>
	That glare proved too bright for a group accustomed to the soft  
shadows of anonymity, so the Denver Broncos offensive linemen took 
the conventional approach during media interviews prior to this 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	They talked freely and articulately, and nobody paid much  
attention, which is just the way they like it. 
</P>
<P>
	Give them credit for opening gaping holes for 2,000-yard rusher  
Terrell Davis. Just don't make a fuss about it. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a close-knit group, one that tends to keep to itself in  
the locker room, to the point that quarterback John Elway referred 
to the line on Thursday as ``almost like a cult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Dan Neil felt honored by such a description.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find that linemen usually are kind of a  
different breed,'' he said. ``We're guys who don't get any 
limelight, and we like it that way. We'll let other guys get the 
limelight. Just let us go about our jobs. We're a close-knit bunch, 
but usually the linemen are the closest group of guys on any team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks we're a little strange, and they kind of stay  
away from our end of the locker room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway agreed, saying, ``They're kind of in their own little  
world. The key thing for them is the camaraderie they have and the 
way Alex (line coach Alex Gibbs) molds them as a group, the 
cohesiveness that they play with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs molded that group into perhaps the NFL's best line by the  
end of last season. This year's line, with three changes in the 
starting lineup, might not quite measure up to that standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not quite as tied together, not quite as cohesive,''  
Gibbs said. ``We had an exceptional group last year in terms of 
talent and cohesiveness. I don't think we're quite at that point 
this year. We haven't been together as long. But we've made up a 
lot of ground. I will say this: We're one of the good ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos underwent a major reconstruction of their line  
during the preseason. Pro Bowl left tackle Gary Zimmerman retired, 
and right guard Brian Habib signed a free-agent contract with 
Seattle. Habib's projected replacement, David Diaz-Infante, injured 
his knee in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs moved right tackle Tony Jones to his more natural position  
of left tackle, elevated backup Harry Swayne to the starting role 
at right tackle, and plugged in Neil, a second-year pro, at right 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was one of my hardest years, without question,'' Gibbs  
said. ``We kept wondering if Gary was coming back. We had to put a 
new group together. Having John at this point in his career, then 
having a runner who was after NFL records, and you've got to try to 
win 18 in a row, too -- I mean, gosh, this thing was all out of 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided next year will be much simpler. It has to be.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs, who sets a pattern for the group by respectfully  
declining media interviews, spoke this week, conceding he was doing 
so only because of the threat of another NFL fine if he refused to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the linemen gave no interviews all season, relenting  
on media day on the Tuesday prior to the Super Bowl. This year 
during the regular season, the NFL required the Broncos to make one 
lineman available for interviews one day a week. The players then 
dropped their self-imposed silence at the start of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how it happened,'' Neil said. ``I think Tony  
Jones headed the whole revolt. He talked to the media and when we 
confronted him, he said, `Yeah, I'm done with the fines.' A few 
other guys did it, and it became kind of a mutiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linemen levied fines on each other for such offenses as  
being quoted in the media and missing assignments. This year, the 
fines totaled $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been their custom, they took the money and partied. They  
spent about one-third of it on a lavish meal at one of Miami's 
famous seafood restaurants on Monday night. The $1,856 bill 
included $1,039 for 20 jumbo orders of stone crabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' Neil said. ``Best seafood I've ever  
had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with their desire for privacy, however, reserve  
lineman K.C. Jones was fined $500 for disclosing the party to the 
media. And the lovable but cranky Gibbs complained about TV crews 
that greeted their arrival at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much paparazzi,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A recent rally on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ran out  
of steam Thursday as investors took profits and unwound 
cross-shareholdings. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 107.74 points,  
or 0.75 percent, to finish the session at 14,342.32. On Tuesday, 
the average rose 68.05 points, or 0.47 percent, the third straight 
session of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.46 yen, up 1.64 yen from its level late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 115.82 
yen overnight. It ranged between 115.32 yen and 115.77 yen in 
Thursday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, domestic investors realized profits on earlier  
hefty gains, and many unwound cross-shareholdings before the March 
end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The main stock index had risen in eight of the previous 10  
sessions, surging 1,089.09 points, or 8.2 percent, during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices had hovered in positive territory for most of the  
session as the dollar's gains encouraged investors to snap up 
export-oriented high-technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger dollar boosts the value of earnings repatriated by  
Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also increasingly optimistic the government will  
use public funds to help buoy the Nikkei index above 16,000 points 
by late March, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Nikkei finishes the fiscal year ending March 31 below  
16,527 -- the closing level last fiscal year -- many companies will 
be forced to report losses on their shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 5.15 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,110.22. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 367.58 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 416.83 million 
shares Wednesday. Retreats outnumbered advances 711 to 421, while 
166 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar stayed above  
its level on Wednesday, but retreated slightly from strong gains 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar moved sharply higher against the yen  
after the Financial Times reported Japanese banks were hiding 
losses by making pretend-trades in Japanese Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency's dip in Tokyo trading was due to  
profit-taking by Japanese exporters and institutional investors, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.10, up from  
131.59 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.860 percent from 1.810 percent late 
Wednesday, driving down its price down to 99.52 yen from 99.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Auburn's N'diaye No Longer Raw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Mamadou N'diaye was nothing more than a big  
body in constant foul trouble when he first got to Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	No longer the stick-thin 7-footer who first showed up on Cliff  
Ellis' court three seasons ago, N'diaye now is very much a part of 
the seventh-ranked Tigers' success and one of the premier centers 
in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year, Mamadou clearly emerges as the league's most  
improved player,'' Mississippi State coach Rick Stansbury said. 
``He has come so far since he first arrived at Auburn, it's 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	N'diaye (pronounced IN-jhy) had nowhere to go but up.  
</P>
<P>
	A native of Dakar, Senegal, N'diaye had been playing basketball  
all of two years when he got to Auburn. Like most of his 
countrymen, N'diaye grew up playing soccer and never had an 
interest in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't feel like playing basketball,'' N'diaye said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was 18 years old the first time he ever touched a basketball  
and by his own admission he was ``very bad.'' But he found that his 
basic skills -- he really knew only how to block shots -- made him 
just as good as the people who had been playing several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw that if I kept working, I could maybe get better,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was four years ago. Today, Auburn (19-1, 7-1 SEC) wouldn't  
be tied for the best start in school history without him. Sure, 
Chris Porter is the Tigers' offensive weapon and Bryant Smith is 
their defensive stalwart, but their games are rounded out by 
N'diaye. 
</P>
<P>
	With one more season to play, N'diaye has already broken Charles  
Barkley's career blocked shot record of 145, including 52 so far 
this season. He leads the SEC with 2.6 blocks a game and is 
averaging 8.1 points and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches throughout the SEC cite N'diaye when asked who the  
league's most improved player is. Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson 
even called him a ``definite NBA first rounder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	N'diaye, who speaks three languages, was a 20-year-old with  
broken English and raw basketball skills when he showed up at 
Auburn. Ellis had never even heard of him but immediately 
recognized him as ``a diamond in the rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Auburn via Maine Central Institue, a prep school  
where he had enrolled in 1995. N'diaye had been discovered the 
summer before in the Senegal development system by Mike LaPlante, 
then an assistant coach at Maine and a consultant for the 
Senegalese National team. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPlante helped N'diaye get into MCI and signed him to play at  
Maine the next year. But before N'diaye could enroll, Ellis hired 
LaPlante at Auburn. N'diaye furiously tried to get out of his 
commitment with Maine so he could go to Auburn with LaPlante. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the only reason I came to Auburn,'' N'diaye said. ``If  
he went to a Division III school, I would, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis made N'diaye his prime project. The first thing he did was  
insist N'diaye gain weight. N'diaye, who was listed as an 
exaggerated 230 pounds when he arrived, now accurately weighs in at 
248 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ellis tried to teach N'diaye the game. He could always  
block shots, but N'diaye didn't know how to shoot, dribble or stay 
out of foul trouble. He started 11 games as a freshman, averaging 
3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds while fouling out twice. 
</P>
<P>
	He started all 30 games his sophomore year, but spent a large  
part of it on the bench in foul trouble. He fouled out of only 
eight games that year, but had 106 for the year. But his points 
(8.0) and rebounds (6.9) were up, and he blocked 73 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``During his first two years, Dou didn't know that when someone  
pushed him, he shouldn't always push back,'' LaPlante said. ``Now 
he sort of realizes when he can get away with things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has developed in every aspect of the game,'' Ellis said.  
``He's always been an excellent shot blocker and he has finally 
learned how to properly defend. But where he is most improved is in 
the three most important areas: dribbling, passing and shooting.''

<HEADLINE> Split Verdict Not in Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Constitution says nothing about ending an  
impeachment trial by finding that a president committed misdeeds 
but can stay in office. However, legal scholars say the Senate 
probably can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically the Senate can do what it wants,'' said George  
Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg. ``No court 
is going to review a decision that has no real effect on the 
ability of the president to continue in office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican proposal in President Clinton's impeachment trial  
would let the Senate decide he committed wrongdoing in covering up 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky but vote separately not to remove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans believe a simple vote of acquittal would imply  
Clinton had been exonerated on charges of perjury and obstruction 
of justice. The White House wants to avoid a Senate statement of 
presidential misdeeds altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Utah law professor Michael McConnell said Thursday  
he believed the Constitution allows the Senate to make findings of 
wrongdoing although they would be ``legally and constitutionally 
meaningless.'' The only significant action would be the vote on 
removal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no precedent for handling an impeachment verdict this  
way, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California 
law professor. ``I think this is not constitutional, but if they 
want to do it there's nothing to stop them,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's handling of impeachment cases is virtually  
unreviewable in court because the Constitution gives the Senate the 
``sole power'' to try impeachments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution says presidents and other federal officials can  
be removed from office on conviction of high crimes or 
misdemeanors, and that judgment in impeachment cases ``shall not 
extend further'' than removal and disqualification from holding 
future federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate finding that Clinton committed certain misdeeds could  
be considered similar to a censure -- an alternative pushed by 
Democrats but opposed by many Republicans because it, too, is not 
mentioned in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many legal scholars say a censure is perfectly lawful as long as  
it involves only words and has no legal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress can pass whatever resolutions it wants,'' McConnell  
said. ``It can declare National Pickle Week and it can censure the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judges often spell out their factual findings to help explain  
why they make a certain ruling, noted law professor Robert Nagel of 
the University of Colorado. But he said doing so as part of an 
impeachment vote could create a clear precedent that certain acts 
are not enough to remove a president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor, said it  
also could create a poor precedent because ``the impeachment 
mechanism would no longer be a basis for removal from office, but 
an incentive for politically driven impeachments, which is what the 
framers were trying to prevent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal scholars would draw the line at a Senate declaration  
that Clinton was actually guilty of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is not in the business of adjudicating guilt or  
innocence of crimes, except for high crimes and misdemeanors,'' 
said New York University law professor Burt Neuborne. That is up to 
the courts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, a Senate finding that Clinton committed a crime could  
not be used against him in court if he were charged after leaving 
office, several law professors said. Such a Senate finding would be 
considered an opinion and not evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have suggested a deal involving a  
censure plus an agreement by Clinton to pay a fine or admit 
wrongdoing. Such a fine or admission could be imposed only with the 
president's agreement because the Constitution bars Congress from 
imposing punishment on someone without a trial in court. 
</P>
<P>
	A censure alone would not require Clinton's agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a statement with political and historical effect  
but may have no more legal effect than an editorial,'' said Yale 
law professor Akhil Reed Amar.

<HEADLINE> UMass I-A FB Champ Urged To Step Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- With Massachusetts winning its first  
national championship, pressure is building to lift football to the 
big time of Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``While everyone's attention is focused on it and they see how  
much joy it brought to the campus, it really makes sense to do 
that,'' said Dave Robinson, a former board member of the university 
Alumni Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The upgrade project, which has stayed mostly in the background  
since a burst of publicity in 1995, is getting a shove from the 
team's 55-43 upset of No. 1 Georgia Southern last month in the 
Division I-AA championship. With the victory, the Minutemen (12-3) 
capped a remarkable turnaround from a 2-9 record the previous 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The push to move to I-A by campus sports administrators also  
picked up a nudge earlier this month when Connecticut applied to 
join the Big East Conference. That Huskies intend to boost its 
football program to I-A. 
</P>
<P>
	UMass coach Mark Whipple calls the Big East a ``natural''  
destination for his program, too. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his team's surprise national championship has expanded  
interest in the upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people have asked me about it, and more recruits have  
asked me about it than ever before,'' Whipple said. ``We would 
certainly like to head that way,'' he said Thursday. ``Now it's 
much more in my thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the faculty Senate went on record with a vote against  
moving to I-A in football, largely out of worry about the cost of a 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Bracey, the Senate leader, said he agreed with its vote at  
the time. He said many I-A programs lose money. But he said the 
team's championship and the Connecticut plans may supply a new 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``If UMass is going to move up to I-A, this might be a good time  
to look at it,'' he said. ``As an aspiration of the athletic 
department, I think they ought to pursue it.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Capitalize on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capitalizing on anti-impeachment sentiment,  
the Democratic Party raised more than $2 million with a 
fund-raising letter accusing Republicans of ``slash-and-burn 
tactics,'' a top party official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, signed by General Chairman Roy Romer, raised twice  
as much as expected, said Joe Andrew, who is to succeed national 
party chairman Steve Grossman in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the letter does not contain the word ``impeachment,''  
Andrew said that was the issue that struck home. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only politics that people are seeing,'' he said.  
``They're sending $20 because they're upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick  
criticized the fund-raising tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have always viewed the impeachment of the  
president as a constitutional issue and a matter of the rule of 
law, not a political issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Republican House members prosecuting the impeachment  
case, Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, raised the impeachment 
issue in a fund-raising letter just a few days before he addressed 
the Senate. Graham's appeal for money warned that Republicans might 
face stronger election challenges in 2000 for their role in the 
impeachment saga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party's fund-raising letter asks for money to  
help Clinton fight for his proposals on issues such as Social 
Security, education and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now is the time for key Democrats to rally around the  
president and our party,'' Romer wrote. ``Otherwise, nothing stands 
in the way of the GOP's slash-and-burn tactics -- the last Congress 
focused almost entirely on investigating rather than legislating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Democratic National Committee sent out a  
fund-raising letter over James Carville's signature that called 
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr ``as objective as the Spanish 
Inquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzpatrick said RNC fund raising for January also was higher  
than expected. Direct mail has brought in $2.9 million this month 
for the national party, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican donors are very energized by our new leadership  
team in the House and the aggressive agenda of issues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eulogizes Lawton Chiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Clinton took the lectern in the  
Russell Senate Office Building today to memorialize Lawton Chiles, 
a former governor and friend, the musical strains of Chiles' 
granddaughter Christin still echoed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawton would get a huge kick out of knowing that I have just  
been upstaged by his 10-year-old granddaughter,'' Clinton said with 
a laugh after Christin's singing of the Shania Twain hit ``You're 
Still the One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first chuckle in an 80-minute service packed with  
the Florida governor's old congressional colleagues. Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., who traded the chairmanship of the Senate Budget 
Committee with Chiles during his 18-year Senate tenure, recalled 
the day that Chiles plopped a noisy air purifier on the committee 
dais beside Domenici, a former chain smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici also noted that Chiles would be surprised, after all  
his years of tackling deficits, that today's budget debate centers 
around spending a surplus. ``I don't only believe he's surprised, I 
believe he's skeptical,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed: ``Pete's right. He'd want to see all the numbers  
in all the books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiles, who died last month at the age of 68 just as he was  
retiring the governor's seat, had just about been persuaded to be 
Clinton's special envoy to Latin America, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason his life was so rich is that he lived to the last  
hour of the last day thinking about tomorrow, thinking about other 
people's interests, thinking about other possibilities still to be 
developed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was invited to address the Capitol Hill service by  
Chiles' wife, Rhea, who stayed back in Florida to prepare for hip 
replacement surgery. Mrs. Chiles marked her 41st wedding 
anniversary on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was to ``Grandmother and Grandfather'' on their anniversary  
that Christin dedicated her song. Earlier in the service, Lawton 
Chiles IV sang a song he wrote in honor of the governor, who was 
known as ``Walkin' Lawton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Clinton: ``When both the grankids were singing, I was  
thinking, you know, this is what Lawton would liked to have done if 
he had not been a politician -- sort of the wandering minstrel for 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in some ways, he was.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wildcat Pleads Guilty to Perjury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former Northwestern football player who once  
told a federal grand jury that he never bet on Wildcat games now 
says he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Gamble, 26, pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of  
lying to the grand jury investigating sports betting at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	In a plea agreement entered before U.S. District Judge George  
Marovich, Gamble said that he had bet that the Wildcats would fail 
to cover the point spread in a game against Ohio State in October 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second quarter of the Ohio State game, when NU was  
leading the game 9-0, the defendant had a brief conversation on the 
field with NU teammate Michael Senters, who also bet against NU,'' 
the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, the defendant commented to Senters that, given  
how well NU was playing, Gamble and Senters were likely to lose 
their bet,'' it said. They did lose the bet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble could face between six months and a year in prison on the  
charge. But prosecutors said they might seek a lighter sentence if 
he cooperates in their investigation. He had earlier pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble was indicted Dec. 3 along with former Northwestern  
players Senters, Dennis Lundy and Gregory Gill, all on perjury 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The other former players have pleaded innocent, although Lundy's  
attorney acknowledged Wednesday that he will plead guilty to 
perjury at a hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A teammate accused Lundy of intentionally fumbling near the  
goalline in a November 1994 game against Iowa to protect a bet. An 
assistant coach overheard the accusation and the school launched an 
investigation, which was quickly turned over to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lundy was scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court on Feb. 5.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA Rates the Playing Surfaces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Grass isn't always greener and it isn't always  
better than artificial turf -- at least not in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The natural playing surface at 3Com Park, home of the 49ers, is  
bad and getting worse, according to a survey released Thursday by 
the NFL Players Association. It was the lowest-ranked grass field, 
slipping to fifth-worst overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The best field was in Tampa Bay's new Raymond James Stadium. The  
worst was in Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, despite a new carpet 
that was installed two years ago at a cost of $2 million. The field 
ranked last all three years the survey has been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagles and the Phillies had a major role in selecting the  
product ... and $2 million certainly buys you a good piece of 
carpet,'' said Jim Smith, spokesman for the stadium's management 
firm. ``Some players aren't aware that it's new turf and don't 
bother to compare what they have in mind with reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey covered 29 fields. The NFL has 30 teams, but the New  
York Jets and Giants share a stadium at the Meadowlands in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com Park's ranking marked the first time a grass surface  
finished that low. The San Francisco field was ranked the 
13th-worst surface five years ago and seventh-worst in a 1996 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the results show that players not only are concerned  
about the kind of surface they play on, but whether those fields 
are properly maintained,'' said Richard Berthelsen, chief counsel 
for the NFLPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Veterans Stadium, three other stadiums with carpet --  
Cincinnati's Cinergy Field, Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and 
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. -- ranked below 3Com Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's grass field was first in the two previous surveys,  
but that was in the team's former home, Houlihan's Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the top five-ranked surfaces were grass.  
</P>
<P>
	Finishing second was Carolina's Ericsson Stadium, followed by  
Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, Miami's Pro Player Stadium and 
Baltimore's PSINet Stadium. Four of the five stadiums opened in the 
past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Players overwhelmingly preferred grass surfaces. A total of 957  
responded to the survey, with 87 percent preferring natural turf. 
More players said they had no preference than preferred artificial 
turf, 8 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the need to stay competitive in this day of free agency,  
we anticipate that many NFL clubs will recognize that converting 
to, or maintaining a first-class natural grass playing field, is 
paramount in attracting topflight talent,'' NFLPA executive 
director Gene Upshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players were nearly unanimous in their belief that artificial  
turf is more likely than grass to contribute to injuries, and about 
90 percent said it is more likely to shorten their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the respondents said they suffered an injury on  
artificial turf that would not have happened on grass. Almost nine 
of every 10 said playing on an artificial surface will worsen their 
quality of life after football. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Player Stadium, site of this year's Super Bowl, ranked  
fourth-best, slipped from the second-place ranking it held in the 
previous studies. Atlanta and Denver will play Sunday on what is 
essentially a new field, installed by a company run by golfer Greg 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers weren't alone in having a grass field the players  
dislike. Four other teams -- Chicago, New England, Oakland and San 
Diego -- rank in the bottom 15.

<HEADLINE> $1.2 Billion Spent for Chemical Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chemical industry, often at odds with  
environmentalists and health advocates, committed $1.2 billion 
Wednesday for a six-year program of independent research into how 
chemicals affect health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The research initiative brought praise from Vice President Gore  
and other senior administration officials as well as from 
environmentalists who said the studies, however, must be totally 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of the research will be peer reviewed and made  
public -- even if it hurts,'' said J. Lawrence Wilson, chairman of 
Rohm &AMP; Haas Co., promising to ``let the chips fall where they 
may.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wide-ranging program includes an ambitious project that  
earmarks $100 million into general research into 10 priority areas. 
These include research into pathways through which humans are 
exposed to chemicals, risk of disease from exposure, how health 
data from animals relates to humans and better understanding of the 
relationship between chemical exposure and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are fundamental questions that must be better understood  
so our industry can move forward,'' said Arthur Sigel, chairman of 
the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	While the initiative for new general research, which will  
provide money for a host of studies in 10 priority areas, was 
purely voluntary, the broader programs, which will account for more 
than $1 billion, came about in part as a result of prodding from 
government and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry said it would spend $500 million over six years to  
test the toxicity of the 3,000 most widely used chemicals. Gore 
called for such studies in an Earth Day speech last spring after 
the Environmental Defense Fund began pressuring the industry on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $600 million is expected to go toward screening as  
many as 15,000 chemicals to determine whether they pose a threat to 
human hormonal systems, leading to cancer or infertility. 
</P>
<P>
	An Environmental Protection Agency advisory panel last October  
urged such an aggressive testing program to determine whether 
chemicals affect human estrogen levels, leading to cancers and 
neurological and fertility problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the $180 billion industry's commitment of both  
money and other resources was applauded by federal environmental 
and health officials as well as environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``More research, more information, better science is always  
positive,'' said EPA Administrator Carol Browner. While the agency 
wants to monitor the program, she said she's confident the research 
will be independent and objective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very impressed with what I see,'' said Kenneth Olden,  
director of National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 
who praised the industry's research priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these are high risk issues,'' agreed Robert Huggert,  
vice president of research and graduate studies at Michigan State 
University and a former EPA official in charge of research. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Goldman, former EPA assistant administrator for pesticides  
and toxic substances and now a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins 
University, called the industry initiative ``a truly very 
significant commitment of resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most important, she said, is that the funding is not focused on  
``firefighting'' but at trying to answer the long-term questions 
that have puzzled health experts and the industry about the 
relationship of chemicals and public health. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the $100 million for general research is  
expected to go to the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology, an 
independent research institute located in Research Triangle Park, 
N.C. Although formed in 1974 by the chemical industry, its work is 
widely respected for independence. The other one-third will be 
awarded to independent research scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials said the research will be open to peer review  
and public scrutiny. ``The integrity of this research must be 
unquestioned,'' said Wilson, the Rohm &AMP; Haas chairman, who also 
heads the CMA's research committee.

<HEADLINE> Study: No Hanford Link to Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A 10-year study of 3,400 people has found  
no link between Cold War-era radiation releases from the Hanford 
nuclear reservation and the rate of thyroid disease among people 
living downwind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the  
announcement Thursday, upsetting many in the Northwest who for 
years have blamed Hanford for a variety of diseases, particularly 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study, to put it in a simple statement, found no increased  
risk for thyroid disease from exposure to radioactive iodine 
released from the Hanford facility,'' said Paul Garbe, a CDC 
scientific adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Sutherland, who lives downwind from the facility, doesn't  
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they found a link between Hanford and the thyroid disease,  
then they would have to find a link with all the other diseases in 
this area, including autoimmune diseases,'' said Sutherland, 58, of 
Walla Walla, about 50 miles southeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
	She suffers from hypothyroidism -- her thyroid doesn't work -- and  
she believes radioactive releases from Hanford have caused or 
worsened health problems for many people in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies like the (Hanford Thyroid Disease Study) cannot tell  
us if a specific person's thyroid disease is or is not caused by 
Hanford radiation,'' Garbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can only tell us that in this specific group of people we  
did not find a link between the thyroid disease and their estimated 
thyroid radiation dose from Hanford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, the thyroid health of 3,441 people born in eastern  
Washington between 1940 and 1946 was checked for the CDC by the 
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Those people were children when substantial amounts of  
radioactive iodine were released into the air around Hanford 
between 1944 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Study participants were randomly selected from the four counties  
closest to Hanford. Other subjects were selected from counties in 
northeastern Washington, where low or no doses would be expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige Leven at Heart of America Northwest, a Hanford watchdog  
group, contends the study was flawed because it failed to study 
multiple forms of radiation exposure and because counties in the 
control group may have been exposed to fallout from Nevada nuclear 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Scott Davis at the Hutchinson center said the Nevada  
fallout was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanford was built in 1943 as part of the secret World War II  
Manhattan Project, and it continued to produce plutonium for the 
U.S. nuclear arsenal into the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the 560-square-mile Department of Energy site is  
considered the most contaminated nuclear site in the country.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Is New Drawing Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Silver Charm comes into Saturday's  
$500,000 Donn Handicap with the credentials to be a dominant horse. 
Now, racing officials want to measure his star power. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gray California horse will be the focus of attention at  
Gulfstream Park where the National Thoroughbred Racing Association 
launches its latest project to increase the sport's visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Donn is the inaugural event in the NTRA Champions series, 11  
televised races to showcase racing's older champions. With a flurry 
of retirements in recent months, Silver Charm has become the 
unquestioned centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm probably has the highest name recognition and  
awareness level among general sports fans as any horse in the 
division,'' NTRA commissioner Tim Smith said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Triple Crown and Breeders' Cup remain annual staples of the  
sporting scene. But not since the great Cigar tied Citation's 
record of 16 consecutive wins in 1996 has horse racing had a 
drawing card who could capture the interest of the casual sports 
fan whenever he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Baffert, Silver Charm's trainer, recalls when Cigar was  
brought to Del Mar for the 1996 Pacific Classic. A crowd of 44,181 
packed the seaside California track for the race, and Cigar's 
presence sparked a buzz all week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought while watching him, you could tell everybody  
was so enthused with him,'' Baffert said. ``I was like a fan. I 
loved watching him run. You're almost in awe of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar's streak ended in that race when he finished second to  
Dare and Go, but he left an impression on Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself that if I ever have a horse like this, I want  
to make sure I share him with the fans,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Baffert, with the encouragement of Silver Charm owners Bob  
and Beverly Lewis, is making good on his word. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly, just as the NTRA Champions series was getting ready for  
its debut, the retirement of a half-dozen prominent names left the 
handicap division severely weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Away, who won nine consecutive races before finishing third  
in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, was one. So was Favorite Trick, the 
1997 Horse of the Year as a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them at stud were Breeders' Cup Classic champion Awesome  
Again, Coronado's Quest, Gentlemen, Touch Gold and Swain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises resisted any temptation to do the same with Silver  
Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things this industry needs so badly is stars,'' Bob  
Lewis said. ``The only way we can accomplish that is if we can keep 
them on the racetrack. How often do you have Silver Charm and have 
the privilege to run him as a 5-year-old?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm first captured the public's fancy in 1997 when he  
just missed winning the Triple Crown, winning the Kentucky Derby 
and Preakness but beaten by Touch Gold in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He won six of nine starts last year, including the $4 million  
Dubai World Cup, and was second to Awesome Again in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the solo king right now,'' said trainer H. James Bond,  
who sends out Behrens as one of Silver Charm's 11 challengers in 
the Donn. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's top two challengers have solid credentials, if  
not name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bear has won his past two starts in the Cigar Mile at  
Aqueduct and the Broward Handicap at Gulfstream. Puerto Madero, a 
Chilean horse now based in California, took the Native Diver 
Handicap at Hollywood Park last month and has won 10 of 15 lifetime 
starts.

<HEADLINE> Key Drug Test at Issue for Slaney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Track and field's governing body opens an  
arbitration hearing Friday into Mary Slaney's controversial drug 
case -- with much more at stake than the future of the 40-year-old 
distance runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging the International Amateur Athletic Federation,  
Slaney's legal team will argue that the widely-used 
testosterone-epitestosterone (T-E) ratio used to suspend Slaney is 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-E test, used by many sports, detects the presence of  
testosterone, a naturally occurring hormone that also is taken in 
concentrated form to improve performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the hearing finds for Slaney, it would open a wide  
opportunity for female athletes to challenge anti-doping tests,'' 
Arnold Beckett, a former member of the International Olympic 
Committee's medical commission, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney, the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000 meters and  
considered the best ever U.S. women's distance runner, was tested 
during the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Her original sample reportedly was higher than the 6-1 T-E ratio  
that triggers a formal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming that USA Track &AMP; Field dragged in investigating the  
matter, the IAAF suspended Slaney in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	USATF then imposed its own suspension. Slaney challenged the  
ruling, and in September 1997 the USATF cleared her of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the IAAF also cleared Slaney to compete, it refused to  
accept the USATF ruling and referred the case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel will meet in Monte Carlo and is expected to  
convene for three days. The hearing will re-examine evidence from 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaney said that recent research shows that the T-E test is  
unreliable for women who are taking the birth control pill in their 
late 30s or 40s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arne Ljungqvist, an IAAF vice president and head of the  
body's medical commission, maintains the ratio is a reliable method 
to detect abnormal levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much focus on the IAAF, but this test is the  
accepted method worldwide for testosterone,'' Ljungqvist said in a 
telephone interview from Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason to question the validity of the ratio. Tests  
have been carried out on many athletes who use the birth control 
pill in their late 30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If these factors impact the T-E tests ``we would have come  
across this before,'' Ljungqvist said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slaney's team claims that the IAAF is defending the T-E test  
because it has nothing to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case isn't just about Mary,'' Jim Coleman, Slaney's  
attorney, said. ``At stake is whether the IAAF can continue to use 
the T-E ratio in the future. This is a trial of the T-E test.''

	Senate Passes GOP Impeachment Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans late today crushed a  
Democratic call for an immediate vote on President Clinton's fate 
and adopted their own plan to allow public airing of Monica 
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony at Clinton's impeachment trial. The 
developments on the Senate floor followed strict party lines after 
Senate leaders deadlocked in daylong efforts to negotiate a 
bipartisan timetable for the conclusion of the trial. Both sides 
envisioned a final vote on impeachment by Feb. 12, and the 
depositions are to begin on Monday. But there were numerous 
differences on key details in the interim. 

</P>
<P>
	$2.6 Trillion Federal Surplus Seen  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unleashing figures certain to fuel this year's  
budget fight, the Congressional Budget Office today projected that 
federal surpluses will total $2.6 trillion over the next decade, 
hundreds of billions of dollars more than was expected just five 
months ago. Over the decade ending in 2009, CBO said nearly 
one-third of the $2.6 trillion -- $787 billion -- would come from the 
non-Social Security side of the budget. The mere expectation of 
that enormous sum is already opening the door for a bitter partisan 
fight over what to do with that money. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Warns Both Sides in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO today issued a warning to both  
sides in the Kosovo crisis: Negotiate a political settlement now or 
else. NATO's military firepower is cruising the Adriatic Sea and 
ready at allied airfields in Italy, with dozens of ships and planes 
prepared to rain havoc upon recalcitrant Serbs. The allied measures 
also envision a program to cut off arms and financing to the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army. 

</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's Victory Given Official OK  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Hoffa won a federal overseer's  
approval today to assume the Teamsters presidency, but the election 
monitor barred one of his running mates from taking office and 
delayed his decision on two union vice presidents from Canada. Tom 
Leedham, who opposed Hoffa in the December 1998 contest after a 
campaign finance scandal overturned incumbent president Ron Carey's 
1996 re-election and barred him from the rerun, said he had not 
decided whether to appeal. 

</P>
<P>
	Reno Undecided on Campaign Probe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With conflicting recommendations from aides,  
Attorney General Janet Reno today said she hasn't decided if an 
independent counsel should investigate whether former White House 
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes lied to a Senate panel looking 
into campaign finances. Reno must tell a special court tomorrow 
whether investigation by an independent counsel is needed. The 
Ickes case raises the possibility that major portions of Justice's 
campaign finance investigation could land in the hands of a 
counsel, because Ickes played a central role in 1996 Democratic 
fund raising. 

</P>
<P>
	Teachers Found To Lack Training  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four out of five U.S. teachers say they're not  
ready to teach in today's classrooms, and more than a third say 
they either don't have degrees in the subjects they teach or didn't 
spend enough time training in them, says a survey by the Education 
Department. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the survey, 
answered by 3,560 teachers nationwide, illustrates the need to 
change how teachers are trained for changing classrooms.

<P>
	New Pen Opens Up Tiny Universe  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have created a pen that draws  
lines one-millionth of an inch thick, giving science a new way of 
manipulating molecules, according to study appearing tomorrow in 
the journal Science. The work is an important step toward someday 
developing electronic chips that are a thousand times smaller than 
those now used in computers. It moves into unknown corners of what 
is known as the nanoworld, said Chad A. Mirkin, a chemistry 
professor at Northwestern University and senior author of the 
study.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose today as technology shares,  
which had threatened yesterday to end their spectacular run, 
bounced back. At Wall Street's close, the Dow Jones industrial 
average was up 81.10 at 9,281.33. NYSE advancers led decliners 
1,560-1,411. The Nasdaq index was up 70.19 at 2,477.33.

	Three Groups Want NFL Franchises  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three ownership groups, each prepared to lay out  
approximately $1 billion, presented their cases to the NFL's 
expansion and stadium committees today. Two of the groups want a 
team for Los Angeles, which has been without a franchise since the 
Raiders returned to Oakland and the Rams left for St. Louis, both 
in 1995. The third group wants to put a team in Houston to replace 
the Oilers, who left for Tennessee in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Public Help Sought in Ramsey Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors posted a photograph of a  
white, furry bear dressed as Santa Claus on an Internet site 
Thursday in a plea for public help with the JonBenet Ramsey slaying 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Alex Hunter said investigators are hoping  
someone can identify the stuffed animal's manufacturer and 
retailers where it was carried in 1996 or before. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, Hunter's spokeswoman, said investigators had  
been unable to find that information despite trying retailers, 
Internet sites and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say anything more about the toy, including what  
role it may play in the investigation, how the bear came to the 
attention of police and whether police had it in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The indistinct photograph, which may have been cropped from a  
larger image, shows the bear on crinkled paper or material, but not 
posed in a manner to enhance identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy is about a foot long, with a red hat, bolero jacket and  
pants all trimmed in a curled white wool material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make this public request for assistance, knowing that it  
will give rise to considerable speculation about the status of the 
Ramsey case,'' Hunter said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to let this speculation take whatever course it will  
since to confirm or deny theories about what this all means would 
most certainly damage the ongoing investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's  
room, but family members said it did not belong to the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hers,'' the child's aunt, Pam Paugh, told the Denver  
Rocky Mountain News. ``I believe it was on the other (twin) bed in 
JonBenet's room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her  
family's home Dec. 26, 1996, about eight hours after her mother 
discovered a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's  
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion. They have 
denied involvement.

<HEADLINE> Baxter's 4Q Profits Rise 16 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Medical products maker Baxter  
International Inc. said Thursday that its fourth-quarter profits 
rose 16 percent, matching analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter reported $212 million in profits, or 73 cents per diluted  
share, in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with $182 
million, or 64 cents, during the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Baxter rose $3.12 1/2, or 5 percent, to close at $69.81 1/4  
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Baxter said its fourth-quarter sales were boosted, in part, by  
strong demand for its blood-therapy products. Anesthetic products 
also helped fuel sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We performed extremely well, despite the economic turmoil that  
occurred in several countries during the year. We expect continued 
strong growth internationally in 1999,'' said Carlos del Salto, 
Baxter group vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales, paced by those in Latin America, totaled  
$1.8 billion, up 13 percent from the $1.6 billion reported for the 
same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Baxter's profits rose 12 percent to $733 million,  
from $652 million reported in 1997. Earnings per diluted share rose 
10 percent to $2.54, up from $2.31 in 1997. The company said these 
results do not include special charges taken during previous 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the year totaled $6.6 billion, up from $6.1 billion in  
1997.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence Nixed on Pope Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan honored a personal  
request for mercy from Pope John Paul II and spared a triple 
murderer from the death chamber Thursday, a day after the pontiff 
strongly condemned capital punishment in a visit to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, a Baptist, commuted Darrell Mease's death sentence to  
life without parole. Mease, 52, was convicted of killing a 
drug-dealing partner and the man's wife and grandson in southwest 
Missouri in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease was supposed to be executed on Feb. 10, although it  
originally had been scheduled for the week of the pope's visit, 
then was postponed with no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, a popular Democrat planning a run for Senate next  
year, said the pope did not address specifics of Mease's case. The 
governor also said he does not plan to look differently at other 
death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continue to support capital punishment, but after careful  
consideration of his direct and personal appeal and because of a 
deep and abiding respect for the pontiff and all he represents, I 
decided last night to grant his request,'' Carnahan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commutation was a rare victory for the pope, who has failed  
in other attempts to block U.S. executions, most recently that of 
Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death in Texas last year for two 
pickax killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope praised the ``generous decision'' of the governor when  
he learned the news, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Higgins Tyler, an attorney for Mease, said the inmate was  
``awestruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Darrell has remained very steadfast to his faith in that he  
would receive relief from God,'' she said. ``I'd say this sure 
looks like a miracle to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a morning Mass on Wednesday at the Trans World Dome in  
St. Louis, the pope made his most explicit anti-death penalty 
comments ever in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary,'' the pope said in his 30-minute homily. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday afternoon, the Vatican's secretary of state,  
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, met with Carnahan and relayed the pope's 
plea for Mease. Later, the pope, after a prayer service at a St. 
Louis church, came down off the altar and personally asked the 
governor to ``extend mercy'' to Mease, Carnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1997, the pope appealed on behalf of Joseph O'Dell, an  
inmate in Virginia condemned to die for the rape, torture and 
murder of a woman. O'Dell was executed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his earliest death-penalty pleas was for Paula Cooper, in  
1987. The 18-year-old Indiana woman was sentenced to death for the 
stabbing of an elderly Bible teacher. Her sentence was commuted to 
60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan's decision could hurt him in his challenge of  
Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, because most Missouri voters favor 
capital punishment, political analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``God help him if there are any grieving relatives, because he  
will need the pope to come back to campaign for him,'' said 
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. 
</P>
<P>
	Mease murdered Lloyd J. Lawrence, 69; his wife, Frankie M.  
Lawrence, 56; and their grandson, William Lawrence, 19, on May 15, 
1988. Mease confessed that he had hidden along a path near the 
Lawrences' farmhouse and shot them with a 12-gauge shotgun while 
they rode by on all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Corrections had been trying for two  
months to track down relatives of the victims, a standard practice 
prior to an execution, but hasn't been able to find anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been 26 executions carried out during Carnahan's two  
terms in office, and another 87 people are waiting on death row. 
Carnahan has only once before removed an inmate from death row -- he 
commuted two-time killer Bobby Shaw's sentence to life imprisonment 
in 1993 because jurors never heard about Shaw's mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Justus, who was the lead prosecutor in the case against  
Mease, said he still feels Mease deserves to be executed and told 
Carnahan of his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed with his decision,'' Justus said, ``but I  
respect it.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Demands a Microsoft E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust trial ordered the company on Thursday to surrender a 
contested e-mail that threatens to undermine one of its legal 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal e-mail from a software engineer in October 1998  
explains in unprecedented detail some of the ways Microsoft 
combined its Internet browser software into its dominant Windows 
operating system. The government charges the combination amounts to 
illegal ``tying'' under federal antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's unease about the e-mail was evident in efforts to  
avoid turning it over. In part, the company claimed the note was 
covered under attorney privilege because one of its lawyers was 
included in the e-mail's ``cc'' field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, copying a document to an attorney does not make it  
privileged,'' the government complained in court papers that called 
the argument spurious. 
</P>
<P>
	After lawyer Steven Holley told U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson ``I'm not trying to hide the ball here,'' the 
judge ordered Microsoft to turn it over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They recognized the harmful character of the document,''  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Neukom, the company's lead in-house lawyer, told reporters:  
``We didn't have anything to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the e-mail supports claims that Microsoft  
can easily identify which parts of shared computer code relate to 
Windows and which parts relate to its browser, a necessary 
distinction if it were ordered to separate the products. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail's author, David D'Souza, cautioned that part of his  
analysis ``may not be useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier government witness, computer scientist Edward Felten  
of Princeton University, wrote a program to disable Microsoft's 
browser within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Felten testified, however, that he didn't try to distinguish  
which parts of shared code are responsible for which functions -- 
the precise study that D'Souza undertook. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of stuff in there that has no relation at all  
to Web browsing, ... and yet it's in there,'' Felten said. ``If 
there's code that's in there that can be removed, then certainly 
Microsoft is able to remove it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But D'Souza also notes that more than half the shared code in a  
single important file performs functions for both Windows and the 
browser, suggesting a tight integration of the products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the integration is good,'' D'Souza wrote. ``There is  
a HUGE amount of sharing and commonality here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft's decision to bundle its  
browser within Windows is ``tying,'' illegal under antitrust law 
because it requires consumers who buy one product also to buy 
another. It contends the company was trying to ``crush'' Netscape 
Communications Corp., which makes a popular rival browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the courtroom, Microsoft continued its questioning of  
Paul Maritz, senior executive responsible for the company's most 
important consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
	Maritz argued that Microsoft faces upstart competition in the  
high-tech industry, even though Windows is used by more than 80 
percent of the world's desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are occasions in this industry when you reach a point  
where new things become possible,'' said Maritz. ``The Internet 
effect is having a fairly widespread impact on our whole 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boies, the government's lead lawyer, responded that ``no  
monopoly entirely eliminates competitive threats'' and described 
Microsoft's ``present-day monopoly power that has lasted more than 
a decade.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders MD-11 Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airlines have two months to inspect their  
MD-11s for wiring and insulation problems, the latest in a series 
of safety steps arising from the investigation into the crash of 
Swissair Flight 111. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which issued the  
airworthiness directive on Thursday, also said any necessary 
repairs must be completed within the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the cause of the Swissair accident is still unknown,  
the FAA will continue to use information from the (Canadian 
Transportation Safety Board's) investigation to push forward with 
preventive measures that improve safety for the flying public,'' 
FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an interim action until we can determine the full  
extent of any potential wiring problems on the MD-11,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swissair plane, bound from New York to Geneva, plunged into  
the ocean off Nova Scotia last Sept. 2. The crash occurred 16 
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. All 229 
aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Jan. 11 letter to the FAA, the National Transportation  
Safety Board -- which is also investigating the crash -- said it was 
concerned by signs of heat damage and electrical arcing found by 
Canadian investigators in an overhead cockpit panel and the 
avionics circuit bay of the doomed plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the FAA should require an inspection of all  
MD-11s for wiring discrepancies around the cockpit overhead circuit 
panel and the avionics circuit breaker panel. It recommended the 
inspection include examinations for loose wiring, inconsistent wire 
routings, broken bonding wires and chafed and cracked wire 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it was working on Thursday's order prior to  
receiving the letter. The agency has also taken a number of other 
safety steps spurred by the Swissair investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Garvey said the FAA had begun work on an order  
requiring the eventual replacement of insulation aboard the entire 
U.S. commercial aircraft fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire tests conducted after the Swissair crash did not implicate  
the insulation material itself, but rather the water-resistant 
material with which the insulation blankets are wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators discovered the wrap could provide a breeding  
ground for fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the FAA also ordered a one-time inspection of  
MD-11s to detect problems such as nicks, fraying or chafing above 
the left and right front passenger doors. Any problems had to be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators learned that when the doors were raised to the  
open position, sliding panels above them moved inward and could 
chafe the electrical wiring in those areas. That could lead to an 
electrical fire in the passenger cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the agency ordered airlines to inspect lighting  
dimmer switches in the MD-11 cockpit. The FAA said it was concerned 
the switches might overheat and smoke, distracting the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Swissair also agreed in October to discontinue use of an  
advanced in-flight entertainment system on its MD-11s and some 
Boeing 747s as a safeguard against electrical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide there are 174 MD-11s that would be affected by  
Thursday's airworthiness directive. Sixty-five of them are flown by 
U.S. airlines. While FAA orders do not apply to foreign-registered 
aircraft, aviation authorities typically follow each other's safety 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency estimates the inspections will cost $720 per  
aircraft, or $46,800 total for the U.S. fleet.

<HEADLINE> Super Broncos Hold Quiet Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos held an uneventful  
two-hour practice Thursday in preparation for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another day, nobody went down, nobody got hurt,'' coach Mike  
Shanahan said after the workout without pads. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said the team reviewed its game plan, concentrating on  
third-down, short-yardage and goal-line situations. The Broncos 
also reviewed work from Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure the players are looking forward to playing the  
game,'' Shanahan said. ``And again I was happy with their good 
concentration and good effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during practice, several birds buzzed the field,  
swooping in Shanahan's direction before flying off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it a falcon?'' Shanahan wondered.

<HEADLINE> Tunnel Collapses in Oregon, 1 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIMBER, Ore. (AP) -- A tunnel collapsed on a U.S. highway along  
the summit of the rain-soaked Coast Range on Thursday, killing a 
road crew worker and injuring two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation officials said the crew was working to stop water  
that had been pouring through the wooden roof of the two-lane 
Sunset Tunnel when it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The cave-in sent debris crashing onto a worker who was in a  
cherry picker bucket inspecting a large hole in the roof. The 
worker was killed, and the two others were buried by debris. Their 
injuries did not appear to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Dave Davis said  
the arched tunnel has wooden timbers lining the interior, and 
workers were tapping on them to detect weaknesses and decide 
whether to add new timbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old tunnel, with a stone entrance, goes through a  
hillside at the 1,200-foot level of the Coast Range summit, 27 
miles west of Portland. The area has been hit by days of steady 
rainfall, with more than an inch in the 12 hours prior to the 
collapse.

<HEADLINE> Three Groups Seek NFL Franchises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The pricetag for an NFL expansion franchise might  
be nearing $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Three ownership groups, each prepared to lay out approximately  
that amount for a stadium and a team, presented their cases to the 
league's expansion and stadium committees Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the groups want a team for Los Angeles, which has been  
without a franchise since the Raiders returned to Oakland and the 
Rams left for St. Louis, both in 1995. The third group wants to put 
a team in Houston to replace the Oilers, who left for Tennessee in 
1997. Each had 30 minutes to address the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard three excellent presentations that spoke to the issue  
of financing,'' said Robert Kraft, owner of the New England 
Patriots and co-chairman of the committee. ``It gives us three 
wonderful options to deliver our product into each market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has 31 teams with the addition of the expansion  
Cleveland Browns, set to play next season after paying a $530 
million entry fee. That number is unwieldy for scheduling purposes, 
forcing at least one team to be off every week during the season. 
The league has said it would like to go to 32 teams by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance committee also discussed the $800 million sale of  
the Washington Redskins. Both committees will report to a full 
ownership meeting Feb. 16 in Atlanta, but votes are not expected at 
that time. The subsequent meeting takes place in March in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some work to do as a committee,'' Kraft said. ``This  
is a big commitment of between $750 million and $1 billion. The 
good news is whoever winds up with it, there will be a passion for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McNair. who heads the Houston bid, believes the committee  
has a basic problem on its hands. ``I think the NFL wants to be 
back in Houston and wants to be in Los Angeles and is trying to 
figure out how to do that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair invited the committee to look at a model of the new  
stadium he plans for the team he hopes he gets. The model of the 
$300 million retractable-roof stadium cost about $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair's group wore campaign buttons that read ``Houston NFL  
32.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it went well,'' he said. ``They greeted us  
cordially. The most interesting thing was there were very few 
questions asked. That's an indication of how complete our proposal 
was. We've done everything they asked us to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said he exchanged a few words with Michael Ovitz, who  
heads the Los Angeles group planning to build a new stadium in 
Carson, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael said they asked a lot of questions and he probably  
gave the wrong answers,'' McNair said. ``He said he'd never been to 
Houston. I said that made us even, because I'd never been to LA, 
but I was just kidding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz's group was the first to address the owners. They brought  
charts into the meeting room and overstayed their 30-minute limit. 
There was no indication whether that was good or bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very pleasant,'' Ovitz said. ``We've delivered every  
environmental letter they needed. There was a very detailed 
discussion of finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any inclination other than to bring football back  
to LA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Broad, a recent addition to a group headed by Ed Roski,  
which has proposed reconstructing the LA Memorial Coliseum, 
endorsed Ovitz's comment. ``We agree,'' he said. ``We will be 
bringing football back to Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski said his group proposes keeping the outside facade and  
building the new stadium inside that familiar rim. The new seating 
capacity would be 66,000, compared to the old stadium's nearly 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL is very interested in tradition, so it's nice to build  
a new facility and combine it with that tradition,'' Roski said, 
referring to the site of the first Super Bowl and two Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to save everything you remember about that stadium,''  
said J.K. McKay, the director of football operations for the 
Roski-Broad group. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the finance committee, chaired by commissioner Paul  
Tagliabue, heard from brothers Howard and Edward Milstein and their 
partner, Daniel Snyder, who won the bidding war for the Redskins. 
The owners have expressed the hope that John Cooke, son of the late 
Jack Kent Cooke, could be included in the ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	After executors of the franchise met with the committee for two  
hours, the Milsteins and Snyder spoke for about 30 minutes. ``As 
you can imagine, this is an exciting time for us,'' Howard Milstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL vice president Joe Browne said no decision had been made and  
that the issue would be discussed again at the Feb. 16 meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Investment Trust May Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Another municipal investment trust in southern  
China appears to be on the verge of bankruptcy, and officials may 
let it go under rather than attempt a rescue, newspapers reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The assets of Guangzhou International Trust and Investment Corp.  
are still sufficient to cover all borrowings, but the balance could 
change dramatically as a result of recent sales and problems with 
debt repayment, said Shen Bainian, vice-mayor of the capital in 
southern Guangdong province. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary audit by the Guangzhou government found that the  
trust, known as Gzitic, had total debts $2.3 billion compared with 
assets of more than $2.4 billion, Shen told reporters in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guangzhou government is trying to help the company sell  
assets but won't provide any cash if the company's debts become 
unmanageable, Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the government allows Gzitic to go bust, it would be the  
second time a government-backed trust in China has been refused a 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the government closed the investment arm of southern  
China's wealthy Guangdong province, Guangdong International Trust 
and Investment Corp., known as Gitic. Gitic had debts of $4.3 
billion and assets of only $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the investment trust of the northern Chinese  
city, Dalian, reportedly missed payments on millions of dollars in 
loans, adding another name to the list of troubled Chinese trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases have highlighted weaknesses in regulation of  
government-linked investment firms and shaken the confidence of 
foreign investors, who are now considering restricting lending to 
other Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central banker, Dai Xianglong, sought to reassure  
investors Wednesday, saying China was determined to restructure its 
trust and investment companies, some of which have serious debt 
problems after borrowing heavily abroad and circumventing rules for 
obtaining foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Guangzhou government has urged foreign bankers to offer  
flexibility to the trust, which now has more than $400 million of 
foreign debts coming due and is facing requests of immediate 
repayment, the Hong Kong newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the company is having difficulties raising cash through  
asset sales since most of its holdings are minority stakes in 
business ventures rather than material holdings such as real 
estate, the Chinese-language Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.

<HEADLINE> Chinese IOC Member: Leave Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In Beijing's strongest condemnation yet of  
Sydney's selection for the 2000 Summer Games, a senior Chinese 
Olympic official has backed stripping the Australian city of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Olympic Committee honorary president He Zhenliang was  
quoted as saying he was ``extremely furious'' that an Australian 
official offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members 
the night before the 1993 vote that awarded the games to Sydney 
instead of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's more, is the problem just one of these $70,000?'' the  
official Global Times today quoted He as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic spirit has been tarnished. My personal feeling is  
that I would agree with the opinion already put forward by some 
people of canceling Sydney's host qualification in order to show 
the seriousness and fairness of the International Olympic 
Committee,'' He was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted, however, that the IOC has already decided that  
the games will not be moved from Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking the feelings and wishes of the Australian people into  
account, I also can respect the executive committee's decision,'' 
He was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing lost the 1993 vote 45-43, a narrow defeat that stung  
China. Chinese officials blamed ``non-sports factors,'' including 
U.S. criticism of China's human rights record, for the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese suspicions over the loss were deepened by admissions  
last weekend from Australian Olympic Committee president John 
Coates that he offered two African IOC members $35,000 each for 
their national Olympic committees on the eve of the September 1993 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The front-page story on the Olympic scandal was headlined:  
``70,000 American Dollars Defeated Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly newspaper, distributed Thursdays, is published by the  
People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In his interview, which took place Monday, He described Coates'  
money offer as ``totally inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another official newspaper, the China Daily, said today that the  
IOC must do more than expel members to prevent future corruption 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the IOC bribe-takers have shown us, trading power and rules  
for favors is rampant,'' the China Daily said in a commentary 
titled ``IOC disappoints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To repair its image and revive public confidence, the IOC must  
first convince the international community that it is capable of 
regulating itself,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC bribery scandals ``pointed to an imperative need to  
reform the operational mechanisms of the institution,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will ``take more than expulsions to prevent similar incidents  
from happening in the future,'' the commentary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four IOC members have resigned amid vote-buying allegations  
surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics. Five other IOC members essentially have been ousted 
pending a formal IOC vote in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Daily said commercialization has contributed  
``tremendously'' to the prosperity of sports, but has also produced 
greed and is ``leading it astray.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Crabtree OKs 2-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Tim Crabtree, the Texas Rangers' best  
middle reliever for much of last season, avoided salary arbitration 
when he agreed Thursday to a two-year contract that guarantees him 
$1,695,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree, a 29-year-old right-hander who made $290,000 last  
season, gets a $100,000 signing bonus, $620,000 this year and 
$925,000 for 2000. Texas has a $1.3 million option for 2001 with a 
$50,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree had asked for $875,000 in arbitration and had been  
offered $625,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 6-1 with a 3.59 ERA in 64 relief appearances for Texas  
last season. Crabtree, originally selected by Toronto in the 1992 
amateur draft, was acquired from the Blue Jays last March and has a 
14-9 career record with a 3.83 ERA in 175 games with the Rangers 
and Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' option would increase to $1.4 million if Crabtree appears  
in 130 games the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He can earn an additional $50,000 in performance bonuses in  
2000: $25,000 each for 65 and 70 games. If the option is exercised, 
he can earn $250,000 in performance bonuses in 2001: $25,000 each 
for 65 and 75 games, $50,000 each for 30 and 40 games finished and 
$100,000 for 50 games finished.

<HEADLINE> Roller Hockey International Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- When Roller Hockey International returns  
to play in June after a one-year sabbatical, it will offer players 
a form of incentive pay far different than the guaranteed salaries 
in most pro leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, minor league ice hockey players who switch to  
in-line skates for the summer league, will get $300 for each win 
and $200 for each loss -- with bonuses for playoff success. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys have to perform to make money. The more games you  
win, the more money you make. Money is a great incentive,'' said 
Jon Gustafson, general manager of the San Jose Rhinos. ``It creates 
a sense of urgency. In other leagues, there are guarantees and guys 
sometimes take the night off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roller hockey league, which underwent restructuring and  
changed half its teams since 1997, will resume play with 10 
franchises in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconfigured league will have teams in Anaheim, Buffalo,  
Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Minnesota, Las Vegas, St. Louis, San Jose 
and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Rhinos, Anaheim Bullfrogs, Buffalo Wings, Minnesota  
Blue Ox and Saint Louis Vipers remain from 1997. Franchises dropped 
since then are Los Angeles, New York/New Jersey, Orlando (moved to 
Miami), Ottawa and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	The league called off the 1998 season because of economic  
problems that left only three teams ready to play. Now, there's a 
new national TV contract and the league will pay all player and 
coach salaries as well as teams' travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game and the product and the fan support were there, but  
the finances weren't there,'' new league president Bernie Mullin 
said Wednesday. ``The league ran out of money because it used its 
money to bail out a couple of bad franchises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league will provide about $3.5 million -- an average of  
$350,000 per team -- for salaries and travel costs. That money will 
come from the national TV contract and national advertising. The 
league also will keep expansion fees from future teams. 
</P>
<P>
	RHI will have an 11-week regular season with most games on  
Friday and Saturday nights. Eight of the 10 teams will advance to a 
weekend of playoffs on Aug. 20-22, with quarterfinals on Friday, 
semifinals on Saturday and the final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The site for the playoffs is expected to be announced in  
February, with Las Vegas the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	If a team wins the championship, each player has a chance to  
make as much as $12,000 for a three-month season. Many of the 
players make $15,000-$18,000 the rest of the year playing minor 
league hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our guys are minor league hockey players and they're  
looking for something to do in the summer,'' Gustafson said. ``This 
is a lot better than going home and cutting lawns or digging 
ditches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the San Jose Arena Management Company -- which  
runs the San Jose Arena that is home to the Rhinos and the NHL's 
San Jose Sharks -- announced it has taken a 50 percent ownership in 
the Rhinos. 
</P>
<P>
	With the popularity of in-line skating, RHI officials believe  
it's only a matter of time before the league features non-ice 
hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the next few years you're going to see guys who have played  
roller hockey all their lives,'' Mullin said. ``Now we have the 
guys who switch over to us for the summer.''

<HEADLINE> AP Clarifies Lederer Obit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Jan. 22 Associated Press obituary on Jules  
Lederer, former husband of advice columnist Ann Landers, described 
Lederer as the founder of Budget Rent a Car. 
</P>
<P>
	The first business with the name Budget Rent a Car was started  
in 1958 in Los Angeles by Morris Mirkin, a distant relative of 
Lederer. In 1959, Lederer formed a leasing company and leased cars 
to Mirkin. In 1960, Lederer formed Budget Rent a Car Corp. in 
Chicago and began selling franchises.

<HEADLINE> Suspect: Iced Tea Made Me Do It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The iced tea made me do it.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the defense offered by lobbyist Gregory DeLozier, 35, who  
was charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Michelle. She 
was stabbed by a masked intruder Tuesday at a salon where she was 
having her hair done. 
</P>
<P>
	During a videotaped statement he gave police after his arrest,  
DeLozier said sediment in a bottle of iced tea he drank had weird 
side effects. That, coupled with the stress of an upcoming mortgage 
deal the couple was pursuing, made him snap, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DeLozier, the legislative director of the New Jersey  
Association of Realtors, put on a ski mask, sunglasses, a coat and 
gloves Tuesday, and went to the salon. 
</P>
<P>
	At the shop's back door, he held an 8-inch butcher knife to the  
throat of an employee and announced a robbery, police said. Once 
inside, the masked intruder took $40 from the shop owner, then 
turned toward Mrs. DeLozier, accusing her of helping put him in 
jail once, then stabbing her three times in the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say the robbery attempt was an attempt to disguise the  
attack on Mrs. DeLozier. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLozier had worked for the Realtors' association for six years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's a great shock to everybody,'' Executive Vice  
President Walt Baczkowski said. ``He was here for a period of time 
and was very well known by the members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was being held on $400,000 bail. She remained hospitalized in  
stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Steel Execs Wary Over Import Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel industry leaders and supporters  
concerned with last year's surge in cheap imports are vowing to 
remain vigilant despite a one-month drop in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Commerce Department hinted at a reversal in import  
trends, steel executives and lawmakers from steel-producing states 
complained that monthly imports were still too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``These moderate reductions must not be allowed to serve as the  
administration's latest excuse for failing to enforce our trade 
laws and protect American steelworkers,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller 
of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Steel 
Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said Thursday that imports dropped 31 percent in  
December. More dramatic reductions were recorded for imports from 
Japan and Russia, two of the countries blamed for a recent import 
surge that contributed to more than 10,000 U.S. layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley acknowledged that no pattern  
can be drawn from only one month's worth of figures. He promised to 
continue monitoring the data to determine whether to seek trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the one-month drop, import levels were still higher than  
those of 1997, before the Asian economic crisis lowered demand for 
steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel producers contend that much of the product is being  
illegally dumped in the United States at prices dramatically below 
production costs. Formal complaints are pending against Japan, 
Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like, OK, I've been doing something illegal to  
you for months but I'm stopping a little bit now,'' said Rep. Bob 
Ney, R-Ohio. ``These numbers are nothing to us. They're still 
higher than before and we're not going to stop until justice is 
done for those steel workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Wilhelm, president of U.S. Steel Group, said the industry  
will file additional trade complaints as early as next month, 
dealing with different steel products and different originating 
countries from the cases filed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley, speaking with reporters by telephone from the annual  
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, attributed the 
reductions in December to actions taken by the Clinton 
administration, notwithstanding criticisms from the industry that 
President Clinton has done too little. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the Commerce Department threatened that any duties  
applied against Japan and Russia might be retroactive to 
mid-November. Faced with the prospect of additional duties, 
exporters began to cut back their shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration will continue talks to persuade  
Russia to lower shipments to the United States even more and the 
European Union to take a greater share of the foreign steel now 
being sent to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, releasing preliminary trade figures for  
steel for the first time, said Japanese producers shipped 47 
percent less steel in December, compared with the previous month. 
Steel imports from Russia dropped 79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the drop in December was in hot-rolled steel, the target  
of industry's dumping complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are due in about three weeks. The administration  
decided to release preliminary data to give the domestic industry 
an earlier warning of import trends. Officials expect the 
preliminary figures to equal about 96 percent of the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In adjusted figures for 1998 through November, imports from  
Japan increased nearly threefold from a year earlier and imports 
from Russia jumped about 60 percent. Overall, imports to the United 
States went up 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Griswold, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute,  
said he expected the figures to ``give the administration more 
reason to resist the more extreme calls for protection.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imports of Japan Steel Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports from Japan dropped sharply in  
December, a reversal that could let Japan avoid broad trade 
sanctions sought by struggling U.S. producers, the Commerce 
Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first-ever preliminary figures released, the department  
said Japanese producers shipped 384,597 metric tons of steel 
products into the United States, a 47 percent decrease from the 
728,478 in November. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had promised a  
government-initiated trade complaint against Japan unless the 
December figures showed a substantial reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Japan averts for now a government case, which could lead  
to quotas or broad tariffs on imports, the country still faces 
protectionist pressures in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley, addressing reporters from  
Davos, Switzerland, promised to continue monitoring the monthly 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at this one month, and we are encouraged, but  
by no stretch (should anyone) believe we are now walking away,'' 
Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports from Russia, another target of domestic  
complaints, dropped to 135,777 metric tons in December, a 79 
percent decrease from the 658,363 a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, U.S. steel imports in December were at 2.5 million  
metric tons, a 31 percent decrease from 3.6 million in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are due in about three weeks. The administration  
decided to release preliminary data, beginning with the December 
figures, to give the domestic industry an earlier warning of import 
trends. Officials expect the preliminary figures to equal about 96 
percent of the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Through November, Japanese imports climbed to 5.7 million metric  
tons, nearly three times the 2.1 million for the same period in 
1997. Japan is the single-largest source of steel imports, which 
have driven down prices in the United States and contributed to 
more than 10,000 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The December figures confirm reports from Japan that its exports  
to the United States declined late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinya Okuda, director of the steel division at the Ministry of  
International Trade and Industry, said earlier today in Tokyo that 
he expected the ``declining trend to continue into January and 
beyond,'' a trend that he said ``should allay concerns in the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. steel producers and two steelworkers unions already have  
filed dumping complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing 
them of flooding the United States with hot-rolled carbon steel, 
the most common product, at prices lower than the costs of making 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp decrease in Japanese and Russian imports appears to  
reflect the prospect for additional tariffs threatened in a 
November ruling from the Commerce Department. The department 
determined that any duties later applied against those countries 
might be retroactive to mid-November because imports had surged so 
much early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A final ruling is not expected until this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the administration has been under increasing  
pressure to use its power to invoke a clause in U.S. and 
international trade laws allowing the United States to temporarily 
protect an entire industry, rather than examining complaints filed 
by manufacturers, one product and one country at a time.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Warns Both Sides in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO issued a solemn warning Thursday  
to both sides in the Kosovo crisis: Negotiate a political 
settlement now or else. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military firepower is cruising the Adriatic Sea and ready  
at allied airfields in Italy, with dozens of ships and planes 
prepared to rain havoc upon recalcitrant Serbs. The allied measures 
also envision a program to cut off arms and financing to the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a critical turning point in the Kosovo crisis,''  
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters at NATO 
headquarters. ``The next few days will be decisive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six-nation Contact Group, made up of the United  
States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, will meet 
Friday in London to launch a new political initiative to bring 
peace to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be fully backed by NATO's military capabilities,''  
Solana emphasized. ``We are ready to act if necessary. The parties 
must seize this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will attend the  
meeting in London, welcomed NATO's decision as a ``first step,'' 
according to State Department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations aim to get the two sides to accept a U.S. plan  
on expanded self-rule for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Kosovo 
is a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia, and most 
residents favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade's Beta news agency quoted German Ambassador Wilfried  
Gruber as saying the negotiations would be similar to the 1995 
talks in Dayton, Ohio, which ended Bosnia's war, in that ``the 
negotiators will be in one place ... and they will not come out 
until they reach agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American formula provides for the two sides to set aside the  
independence issue for three years, after which the parties could 
resume discussions on the province's long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people have died and nearly 300,000 have been driven  
from their homes in seven months of fighting in Kosovo between the 
KLA and Serb forces. The conflict was halted only by the threat of 
NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 12 cease-fire negotiated by American mediator Richard  
Holbrooke began to fall apart in December as violence mounted in 
the province, culminating in the Jan. 15 killing of 45 ethnic 
Albanians in the village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center said new fighting erupted Thursday when  
about 50 KLA fighters tried to cross the border with Albania south 
of Prizren, a town 40 miles southwest of Pristina, the capital of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rebels were killed by Yugoslav forces, the center said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two other rebels died Wednesday night in another border area  
clash near Djakovica, 12 miles southwest of Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Kosovo, hundreds of ethnic Albanians fled fighting  
that broke out Wednesday near Podujevo when the Yugoslav army and 
Serb police attacked to push rebels back from the main highway 
linking Pristina with Yugoslavia's capital of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top  
policymaking body, Solana said Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic must remove his security forces from Kosovo to levels 
agreed in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-nation Western alliance also demanded that all armed  
ethnic Albanians in the province immediately cease hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO stands ready to act and rules out no option,'' Solana  
said, reading a statement on behalf of the NATO Council. ``The 
North Atlantic Council has decided to increase its military 
preparedness to ensure that the demands of the international 
community are met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the  
United States would continue to pressure Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we will also continue on the NATO track to use the  
credible threat of force to make him comply with the agreements he 
made in October,'' Lockhart said. ``There's an activation order in 
place now for airstrikes and an air campaign, and we expect if he 
is unwilling to comply that those threats may become very real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee, said ``the credibility of NATO is on the line'' 
in the confrontation over Kosovo. The Virginia Republican 
reiterated his view that a NATO force with American troops should 
be put on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for  
policy, said the Clinton administration had no intention of 
introducing U.S. combat forces in Kosovo now -- particularly in the 
absence of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
Contact Group would call on the parties to respond to the political 
initiative within four days. The NATO Council will meet again 
Saturday to back up that initiative with a military ultimatum.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Protect Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, while  
praising President Clinton's plan to use budget surpluses to shore 
up Social Security, said Thursday that any permanent solution will 
almost certainly require either benefit cuts or higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, were even more pointed in their  
criticism of the plan Clinton unveiled in last week's State of the 
Union address. They charged that on closer examination, the 
administration is relying on funny bookkeeping to dodge the tough 
choices needed to provide retirement benefits for 75 million baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici called Clinton's  
program an ``elaborate shell game'' to make the Social Security and 
Medicare programs appear to be in better shape than they are. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were quick to defend their accounting  
methods. But the rising volume of GOP criticism underscored the 
hurdles Clinton faces in trying to win congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's plan, $2.7 trillion of $4.4 trillion in  
projected government surpluses over the next 15 years would be 
devoted to bolstering the Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would use another $700 billion of the surpluses to put  
more resources into Medicare, the health system for the elderly and 
disabled. The remaining $1 trillion would be split equally between 
new spending and the creation of new, private retirement savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan called Clinton's effort to reserve the surpluses ``a  
major step in the right direction.'' But he repeated his concerns 
raised last week about one element of the program, Clinton's 
proposal to invest $700 billion directly in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Herculean efforts,'' Greenspan said, he doubted that  
such huge amounts of money could be insulated from political 
pressures to influence where the investments go. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told lawmakers they should also understand that  
Clinton's program isn't a total solution for the shortfall Social 
Security will face as the baby boomers retire in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Social Security payroll taxes total 12.4 percent of  
workers' wages, split evenly and paid by employees and employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood these taxes will have to be raised, or  
benefits cut, given that the system as a whole is still 
significantly underfunded,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan chaired the blue ribbon commission that 16 years ago  
recommended a combination of benefit cuts and higher taxes to meet 
an earlier Social Security funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify what actions should be taken this time  
around. The most obvious, he noted, are raising the retirement age 
further or lowering the annual cost-of-living increase in Social 
Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	But raising taxes for Social Security could well prove ``too  
burdensome'' given that the government's giant Medicare program 
will also need bolstering in coming decades, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart called  
Greenspan's support for reserving the surpluses and paying down the 
national debt a ``very important validation of this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the issue of possible tax increases or benefit cuts, Lockhart  
said, ``We could not agree with him more on the fact that we need 
to do more. The president has made clear that he needs to work with 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans accused Clinton of using surpluses to dodge the  
tough choices that ultimately will be needed to rescue Social 
Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, the administration is pre-committing the government  
to pay for an additional $3.5 trillion in Social Security and 
Medicare benefits instead of making the difficult choices that are 
necessary to really keep these programs solvent,'' said Domenici, 
R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said, ``The president extends the  
lifespan of Social Security by double-counting the projected 
surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Social Security is collecting $100 billion more than  
it needs each year to pay out current benefits. An IOU for that 
amount is deposited in the Social Security trust fund and the money 
is spent on other government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new proposal would continue to employ this system --  
but it would also deposit in the trust fund a second IOU 
representing the amount that growing surpluses will allow the 
government to pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials concede that the bookkeeping appears  
complex. But they say the bottom line is that Clinton's approach 
would reduce the national debt and put the government's books in 
better shape to deal with future retirement payments.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Customers Report ATM Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- About 10,000 bank card holders on the East  
Coast had their accounts charged more than once for transactions 
made during a 15-hour period, the owner of the network said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	MAC Network customers from about 80 banks were affected, said  
Melinda Mercurio, spokeswoman for Electronic Payment Services Inc. 
in Wilmington, Del. EPS would not reveal names or locations of the 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Errors involved multiple postings of transactions made between  
midnight Sunday and 3 p.m. Monday while the network was making a 
change in its processing system. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a cardholder withdrawing $100 may have been charged  
three times, recording a total debit of $300. It was not 
immediately known how other transactions were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Accuracy checks built into the network turned up the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Mercurio said many of the errors were corrected by Wednesday,  
before most customers were aware of the problem. She was unaware of 
any customers experiencing problems because of the glitch.

	The MAC Network includes about 2,300 banks and 40 million  
cardholders nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Public Help Sought in Ramsey Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors posted a photograph of a  
white, furry bear dressed as Santa Claus on an Internet site 
Thursday in a plea for public help with the JonBenet Ramsey slaying 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Alex Hunter said investigators are hoping  
someone can identify the stuffed animal's manufacturer and 
retailers where it was carried in 1996 or before. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, Hunter's spokeswoman, said investigators had  
been unable to find that information despite trying retailers, 
Internet sites and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say anything more about the toy, including what  
role it may play in the investigation, how the bear came to the 
attention of police and whether police had it in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The indistinct photograph, which may have been cropped from a  
larger image, shows the bear on crinkled paper or material, but not 
posed in a manner to enhance identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy is about a foot long, with a red hat, bolero jacket and  
pants all trimmed in a curled white wool material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make this public request for assistance, knowing that it  
will give rise to considerable speculation about the status of the 
Ramsey case,'' Hunter said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to let this speculation take whatever course it will  
since to confirm or deny theories about what this all means would 
most certainly damage the ongoing investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her  
family's home Dec. 26, 1996, about eight hours after her mother 
discovered a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's  
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion. They have 
denied involvement.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Fishing Restrictions Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fishery officials approved a plan Thursday to  
close a huge section of the Gulf of Maine to fishing in an attempt 
to replenish once-abundant cod stocks, a move that could ground 
thousands of commercial fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Fishery Management Council voted to close a  
swath of ocean extending about 30 miles from the coast from Cape 
Cod Bay to the border of New Hampshire and Maine. Scallop fishermen 
are exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	The new limits will be phased in starting in March.  
</P>
<P>
	The council also voted to cut the daily cod catch from 400  
pounds per boat to 200 pounds elsewhere in the Gulf of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	The restricted area will be divided into three sections to be  
closed one at a time on a rolling basis during the height of the 
fishing season, from March to July. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, piecemeal restrictions have been imposed to rebuild  
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	But after scientists in December released a report that the cod  
population was at its lowest in 30 years, the New England Fishery 
Management Council decided that action was needed to slash the cod 
catch 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the loss of their livelihood, dozens of fishermen  
from the New England coast testified passionately for hours 
Thursday about what severe cutbacks could mean. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fishermen became so irate that five police officers were  
called in to stand guard at the hearing in a Portsmouth, N.H., 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Fishermen said the closures would hurt colleagues from  
Massachusetts and New Hampshire with smaller boats, but would go 
easier on those from Maine, who have larger ships and can fish 
farther out at places such as Georges Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're creating a war between ... fishermen,'' testified Paul  
Cohan, president of the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible restrictions could prompt regional economic losses  
ranging from $19.9 million to $21.8 million, according to an 
estimate in a draft analysis completed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 2,500 fishermen could be out of work and 700 boats  
could be grounded, according to an estimate by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy, D-Mass., who is seeking federal money to help fishermen.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed 4Q Earnings Fall 66 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin's fourth-quarter earnings  
dropped 66 percent, the defense contractor reported Thursday, 
blaming a one-time expense from a subsidiary shutdown and weaker 
space and information technology sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings were $125 million, or 33 cents a share, compared  
with $371 million, or 91 cents a share for the fourth quarter of 
1997. Revenues fell 9 percent to $7.18 billion from $7.88 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's earnings were reduced by expenses of $183 million  
related to the shutdown of its money-losing subsidiary CalComp 
Technology, which makes high-end computer printers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had warned analysts in December that its earnings  
would drop, citing expenses associated with CalComp and weaker 
space-related and information technology sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the one-time expenses, Lockheed's quarterly  
earnings fell 15 percent to $308 million, or 81 cents a share, from 
$363 million, or 89 cents a share. The earnings were in line with 
Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed also forecast that a cost-cutting initiative it started  
last year could save the company as much as $3 billion per year by 
2001. The company's stock initially rose as much as $1.93 3/4 but 
later gave up those gains to move $1.25 lower to close at $35.93 3/4 
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Vance Coffman, chairman and chief executive officer of Lockheed  
Martin, said delays of commercial space launches and military 
aircraft deliveries from 1998 into 1999 hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the corrective actions taken and our productivity  
initiatives, we anticipate improved operating and financial 
performance in 1999,'' Coffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the entire year, net earnings were $1 billion, or $2.63 per  
share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $3.04 per share, in 1997. 
Revenues for the year were $26.26 billion, down from $28.07 billion 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Internet Can Be Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Don't worry about irrational exuberance. Try  
jackpot fever instead. 
</P>
<P>
	No less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan compared buying the latest hot Internet stock to hitting 
a one-in-a-million jackpot in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance Thursday before the Senate Budget  
Committee, Greenspan was asked to explain the surging stock values 
for fledgling Internet companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who once sent stock prices plunging by worrying about  
investors' ``irrational exuberance,'' said that in this case the 
market was behaving in a time-honored fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the potential payoff for companies that succeed in the  
new world of supplying goods and services on the Internet is so 
huge that something he called the ``lottery principle'' was at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``What lottery managers have known for centuries is that you  
could get somebody to pay for a one-in-a-million shot, more than 
the value of the chance. In other words, people pay more for a 
claim on a very big payoff, and that's where the profits from 
lotteries have always come from,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Undoubtedly, some of these small companies, whose stock prices  
are going through the roof, will succeed,'' Greenspan said. ``The 
vast majority are almost sure to fail.''

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura Gets Gun License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former professional  
wrestler and Navy SEAL who has an armed escort, now has a license 
to carry a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wodele, a spokesman for Ventura, confirmed Wednesday that  
the governor has been granted a gun permit. Asked whether the 
governor would be carrying the gun at the Capitol, Wodele quoted 
Ventura as saying, ``That's my private business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a Minnesota law, permit information -- including an  
applicant's reason for requesting one -- is not public information. 
It also wasn't known which police agency granted Ventura's permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years ago, Ventura was denied a permit by the police in  
suburban Brooklyn Park, where he was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura supports loosening handgun permit rules for  
non-criminals who complete gun-safety training and skills testing.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Impeachment Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotes from senators about Thursday's impeachment proceedings:  
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., on negotiations with  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle -- ``Our colleagues have to have faith 
in us. ... We are still going forward with the need for us to have 
some leap of faith in each others' conduct, and this resolution 
calls for that at several points. ... We are really still trying to 
be fair to all sides, and that's a real challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott on bipartisanship -- ``I think senators are tired, but I  
don't think they are out of sorts. ... I'm smiling. I'm not ranting 
and raving and questioning any of their motives or blasting them 
for this and that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. -- ``We are very concerned about live  
witnesses. We don't want the spectacle of Monica Lewinsky or anyone 
else having to be brought in the form that is anticipated in this 
resolution. What little dignity Monica Lewinsky has left, we hope 
we can protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, on the GOP resolution outlining the  
rest of the trial -- ``This is not a deep, dark plot on the part of 
Republicans to slip anything over. ... It is not part of a 
preordained railroad job in any sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP proposal to have a  
``finding of fact'' in which the Senate would vote that the 
president committed crimes but would not remove him from office -- 
``To me, this seems like the dumbing down of impeachment. It takes 
what the Founding Fathers regarded as a very serious and solemn 
process and makes it somewhat frivolous. Because as a result of a 
finding of fact, you would come to the anomalous situation that the 
president, they would say, committed crimes but shouldn't be 
removed from office. Well, if he shouldn't be removed from office, 
then the House never should have sent the articles over in the 
first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., on Democratic objections to making  
public the videotaped depositions -- ``Now they apparently want to 
ensure on the front end without knowing what the depositions might 
produce that they will be guaranteed that nothing in those 
depositions will ever be made public. And of course we could not 
agree to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.Y., on the fact-finding proposal -- ``It  
is a strategic retreat for the Republican majority. They recognize 
the enormous political damage that is being self-inflicted by 
attempting to remove the president from office but still want to be 
able to tell their own constituencies that they found guilt. It's 
an escape route.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah -- ``Now everybody knows that Monica  
Lewinsky is not going to be asked one question about the sordid 
details that occurred. You know she's going to be asked about the 
false affidavit, about the conversations with Betty Currie, the 
conversations with Vernon Jordan, and that's going to be basically 
it. So there's no reason for anybody to be frightened by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, D-La. -- ``It's getting more confusing.''  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore. -- ``If there is something to be  
learned, we are going to learn it by viewing demeanor and weighing 
credibility and clearing up contradictions.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! To Buy GeoCities </HEADLINE>

 *AP Business Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58  
billion in stock, securing Yahoo!'s position among the dominant 
Internet search and directory services. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deal combines Yahoo!, the third-largest Internet  
destination, with No. 5 GeoCities and could unseat America Online 
Inc. as the most popular starting point for information and 
services on the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! plans to place ads on GeoCities' site to try to lure its  
visitors to Yahoo!'s already popular Web destination. Yahoo! hopes 
to prod online businesses into buying more advertisements by 
offering them a broader Web network with more potential shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to Yahoo!'s Web site will be able to use GeoCities'  
technology to create their own Internet home pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We anticipate maintaining GeoCities as a stand-alone, very,  
very strong brand. There's a lot of brand equity in this company,'' 
said Tim Koogle, chief executive officer of Yahoo!, who will head 
the merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to capture visitors to the Web has created a frenzied  
pace of consolidation among Internet businesses. Internet companies 
are using their high-flying stock prices as currency to snap up 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home Corp., a provider of high-speed Internet access, reached  
agreement last week to buy Excite Inc., one of Yahoo!'s biggest 
rivals, in a deal valued at $6.7 billion in stock at the time of 
the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, America Online Inc. is fighting to protect its  
position as the top Internet access provider and Web destination. 
The Dulles, Va.-based company agreed last fall to buy Netscape 
Communications Corp. for about $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's deal also puts pressure on Lycos Inc., the fourth  
most-visited Web site, to find a partner in the fast-shrinking pool 
of independent search and directory services, known as portals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!'s 52 percent premium for GeoCities underscores the  
stratospheric valuations of these tiny companies, most of which 
didn't exist a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, which hosts Web pages created by individuals, has  
slightly more than 290 employees. In the final three months of 
1998, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company lost $8.4 million, or 
27 cents a share, on sales of $7.5 million, according to its 
financial results also released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, a comprehensive Web site offering everything from news  
to free e-mail, has about 800 employees and earned $18.5 million on 
sales of $76.4 million in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very comfortable with this premium,'' Koogle said in an  
interview. ``There is a competitive market for leading brands that 
have a very large audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! already owns a roughly 4 percent stake in GeoCities and  
the two companies have worked together over the past year by 
offering some of each other's services to customers. While Yahoo! 
has talked with other companies, negotiations with GeoCities grew 
serious this past week-and-a-half, Koogle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, Calif., hopes the combined company  
will save money on technology costs by using Yahoo!'s computers to 
handle some of GeoCities' massive Web traffic and transactions such 
as online purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the At Home-Excite merger, which combines companies in  
different Internet fields, today's marriage reflects Yahoo!'s 
unique strategy of focusing on its Web services. That frees Yahoo! 
to forge alliances with Internet access providers like Bell 
Atlantic Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many recent Internet mergers, it's hard to predict who's  
going to come on top as the No. 1 Internet gateway because many 
partners share common customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the deal announced today, Yahoo will exchange  
about 10.6 million shares of its stock for the 31.4 million shares 
of GeoCities common stock. In addition, Yahoo will convert about 
8.9 million GeoCities stock options into about 3 million Yahoo 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities's stock was up 50 percent in heavy midday trading on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market, rising $37.75 a share at $112.75. Yahoo!'s 
stock was up nearly 4 percent, rising $15.12 1/2 to $351 and 
increasing the value of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss Quit Cancer-Case Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. abandoned a building at  
its headquarters after seven women working there developed breast 
cancer, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The jeans company began an initial inquiry in January 1997 after  
several women were diagnosed with breast cancer while working at 
the four-story Saddleman building at Levi's Plaza, Levi spokesman 
Clarence Grebey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation later expanded to include cancer researchers  
and Patricia Buffler, former dean of the University of California, 
Berkeley's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	No link was found between the cancer and the building, but with  
employees concerned and the company restructuring, Levi relocated 
200 employees from the building last October. The remaining 
furniture was removed from the building last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the reports to date have shown that there is absolutely  
no evidence to suggest any link between these illnesses and the 
workplace,'' according to an e-mail message sent to employees and 
obtained by the San Francisco Business Times in a story published 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite this, we fully understand the unacceptable level of  
anxiety that this ongoing issue has caused,'' the memo continued. 
``Consequently, we have decided to relocate employees in the 
building as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women all worked in desk jobs and did not work with  
hazardous chemicals or special machinery, Grebey told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is alarming that a number of women developed breast  
cancer, the cancer researchers said that random occurrences like 
this happen throughout the general population inexplicably in 
various surroundings,'' Grebey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite assurances by the company that the building was safe,  
employees wanted to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling among employees was that there was a hex on the  
building,'' said Diane Dito, a former process leader in Levi's 
Prevention Health and Safety Team. ``Some people felt very strongly 
that it was the building, and the only way to satisfy them was to 
get them out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The building is owned by San Francisco-based Blue Jeans Equities  
West, a development firm that conducted its own independent 
research and concluded there was no building-related cause to the 
breast cancer cases. At least two companies have considered moving 
into the building, the weekly newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No lawsuits have been filed.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A recent rally on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ran out  
of steam Thursday as investors took profits and unwound 
cross-shareholdings. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 107.74 points,  
or 0.75 percent, to finish the session at 14,342.32. On Tuesday, 
the average rose 68.05 points, or 0.47 percent, the third straight 
session of gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.46 yen, up 1.64 yen from its level late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 115.82 
yen overnight. It ranged between 115.32 yen and 115.77 yen in 
Thursday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, domestic investors realized profits on earlier  
hefty gains, and many unwound cross-shareholdings before the March 
end of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The main stock index had risen in eight of the previous 10  
sessions, surging 1,089.09 points, or 8.2 percent, during the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices had hovered in positive territory for most of the  
session as the dollar's gains encouraged investors to snap up 
export-oriented high-technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger dollar boosts the value of earnings repatriated by  
Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also increasingly optimistic the government will  
use public funds to help buoy the Nikkei index above 16,000 points 
by late March, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Nikkei finishes the fiscal year ending March 31 below  
16,527 -- the closing level last fiscal year -- many companies will 
be forced to report losses on their shareholdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 5.15 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,110.22. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.49 points, or 0.49 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 367.58 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 416.83 million 
shares Wednesday. Retreats outnumbered advances 711 to 421, while 
166 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar stayed above  
its level on Wednesday, but retreated slightly from strong gains 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the dollar moved sharply higher against the yen  
after the Financial Times reported Japanese banks were hiding 
losses by making pretend-trades in Japanese Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency's dip in Tokyo trading was due to  
profit-taking by Japanese exporters and institutional investors, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.10, up from  
131.59 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.860 percent from 1.810 percent late 
Wednesday, driving down its price down to 99.52 yen from 99.91 yen.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Warns Both Sides in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO issued a solemn warning Thursday  
to both sides in the Kosovo crisis: Negotiate a political 
settlement now or else. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's military firepower is cruising the Adriatic Sea and ready  
at allied airfields in Italy, with dozens of ships and planes 
prepared to rain havoc upon recalcitrant Serbs. The allied measures 
also envision a program to cut off arms and financing to the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at a critical turning point in the Kosovo crisis,''  
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters at NATO 
headquarters. ``The next few days will be decisive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the six-nation Contact Group, made up of the United  
States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, will meet 
Friday in London to launch a new political initiative to bring 
peace to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be fully backed by NATO's military capabilities,''  
Solana emphasized. ``We are ready to act if necessary. The parties 
must seize this opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will attend the  
meeting in London, welcomed NATO's decision as a ``first step,'' 
according to State Department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations aim to get the two sides to accept a U.S. plan  
on expanded self-rule for Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Kosovo 
is a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia, and most 
residents favor independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade's Beta news agency quoted German Ambassador Wilfried  
Gruber as saying the negotiations would be similar to the 1995 
talks in Dayton, Ohio, which ended Bosnia's war, in that ``the 
negotiators will be in one place ... and they will not come out 
until they reach agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American formula provides for the two sides to set aside the  
independence issue for three years, after which the parties could 
resume discussions on the province's long-term future. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people have died and nearly 300,000 have been driven  
from their homes in seven months of fighting in Kosovo between the 
KLA and Serb forces. The conflict was halted only by the threat of 
NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 12 cease-fire negotiated by American mediator Richard  
Holbrooke began to fall apart in December as violence mounted in 
the province, culminating in the Jan. 15 killing of 45 ethnic 
Albanians in the village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center said new fighting erupted Thursday when  
about 50 KLA fighters tried to cross the border with Albania south 
of Prizren, a town 40 miles southwest of Pristina, the capital of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Three rebels were killed by Yugoslav forces, the center said.  
</P>
<P>
	Two other rebels died Wednesday night in another border area  
clash near Djakovica, 12 miles southwest of Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Kosovo, hundreds of ethnic Albanians fled fighting  
that broke out Wednesday near Podujevo when the Yugoslav army and 
Serb police attacked to push rebels back from the main highway 
linking Pristina with Yugoslavia's capital of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of the North Atlantic Council, NATO's top  
policymaking body, Solana said Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic must remove his security forces from Kosovo to levels 
agreed in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-nation Western alliance also demanded that all armed  
ethnic Albanians in the province immediately cease hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO stands ready to act and rules out no option,'' Solana  
said, reading a statement on behalf of the NATO Council. ``The 
North Atlantic Council has decided to increase its military 
preparedness to ensure that the demands of the international 
community are met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the  
United States would continue to pressure Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we will also continue on the NATO track to use the  
credible threat of force to make him comply with the agreements he 
made in October,'' Lockhart said. ``There's an activation order in 
place now for airstrikes and an air campaign, and we expect if he 
is unwilling to comply that those threats may become very real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed  
Services Committee, said ``the credibility of NATO is on the line'' 
in the confrontation over Kosovo. The Virginia Republican 
reiterated his view that a NATO force with American troops should 
be put on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for  
policy, said the Clinton administration had no intention of 
introducing U.S. combat forces in Kosovo now -- particularly in the 
absence of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
Contact Group would call on the parties to respond to the political 
initiative within four days. The NATO Council will meet again 
Saturday to back up that initiative with a military ultimatum.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Gulp Down Supplement Pills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The only thing better than taking something that  
will make you bigger, stronger and faster is getting it for free. 
That might explain why the Denver Broncos love EAS so much. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by linebacker Bill Romanowski, who gulps 50 pills a day, a  
half-dozen players spread the gospel of Colorado-based sports 
supplement giant EAS -- Experimental and Applied Sciences -- with the 
zeal of religious converts. 
</P>
<P>
	Guys who once answered performance-related questions with  
nothing more technical than ``It must be the shoes,'' now go on at 
length about the benefits of creatine, Myoplex and amino acids. On 
hats, T-shirts and windbreakers, where those same players sported 
swooshes, stripes and assorted other logos, ``EAS'' now rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The company established sponsorship ties with the Broncos in  
1997 and got in trouble with the NFL not long after. Several 
players became so blatant promoting EAS during the playoffs that 
year that the league, seeking to protect its national licensees, 
put its foot down. Any player who wears a company logo not covered 
by the ``Pro-line'' policy during postseason games or official 
functions now faces a $100,000 fine. And that's for first-time 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Though none of the Broncos tested the league's resolve, the  
threats hardly dampened their enthusiasm for EAS. Mention the 
company around Romanowski and a moment later, he pulls a vitamin 
chest from his gym bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stronger, faster, in better shape and I've got more  
experience than I did when I played in San Francisco,'' said 
Romanowski, who is 32, wrapping up his third season in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Older should mean smarter. But when someone pointed out the  
aging process usually works the other way around on the body, his 
eyes sparkled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah,'' Romanowski conceded. ``But not if you train the right  
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Steve Atwater got swept up in the EAS crusade only this  
year, but he's up to 21 pills a day already. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel stronger, recover faster and I haven't been in the  
trainer's room once this season,'' the 32-year-old safety said. 
``Except maybe to get a Band-Aid when I cut my finger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this sounds too good to be true, you're not the only one with  
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the NFL is loathe to go after a company with sponsorship  
ties to any of its teams, it has been bickering with EAS since it 
became the ``exclusive sports supplement provider'' for the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	It began because Romanowski, John Elway and a few other Broncos  
wore EAS merchandise during postgame interviews. The feud escalated 
last summer in the wake of baseball's Mark McGwire-androstenedione 
controversy. That's when the NFL issued a memo warning players 
about ``andro'' and other substances banned by the league but found 
in some sports supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	Though EAS is not the only company offering such supplements, or  
even the only company with NFL endorsers, it was the only firm 
mentioned in the league's memo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players were cautioned because lots of things you can buy in a  
store are on our list,'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. ``We were 
just reminding them they're the ones responsible for what's in 
their bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EAS spokesman Jim Nagle said Thursday, ``I don't really know if  
we've been targeted.'' And Bill Phillips, chief executive officer 
of EAS, said he would never recommend those supplements to athletes 
competing in sports where andro is banned -- such as the NFL or the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	EAS said that the supplements it does provide to the Broncos  
would cost about $2,000 per player at retail. Though Nagle declined 
to say whether the company's relationship with the team and the 
attendant exposure has been good for business, there's little doubt 
business has been good in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Created five years ago, EAS is now the industry leader. Its  
revenues have grown from $30 million in 1995 to $145 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	It is estimated that 75 percent of the Broncos use EAS products,  
ranging from the protein shakes lined up at the training table 
every morning to vitamins to the muscle turbocharger creatine, 
which reportedly builds muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Though creatine is not on the league's banned-substance list,  
the Food and Drug Administration said in April it was uncertain 
whether it ``was absolutely safe for long-term use at levels 
currently being recommended.'' Two NFL clubs, Tampa Bay and 
Cincinnati, have banned it. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of that has convinced the Broncos to quit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been able to improve my performance every year. This  
stuff,'' Romanowski said, rattling a vitamin chest stuffed with 
hundreds of pills, ``really works.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen: More Base Closings Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- During his 24 years in Congress, William Cohen  
earned a reputation for opposing the Pentagon on military base 
closings, particularly those in his home state of Maine. So he 
knows that as defense secretary, his push this year for additional 
base shutdowns will be a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hard truth is that we must have more base closures,''  
Cohen said Thursday in a speech to the Illinois General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen cried foul in the 1980s when, in the waning days of the  
Cold War, the Pentagon sought to shutter Loring Air Force Base in 
Maine. He was a member of the Senate then and, like many others in 
Congress, feared that losing a military base would deal a 
devastating blow to his home state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, Cohen says the record in Maine and elsewhere shows  
that base closures need not bring doom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must see past our fear,'' he said, noting that the Illinois  
community of Rantoul is an example of how the loss of a military 
base -- in Rantoul's case, Chanute Air Force Base, in 1993 -- can be 
turned into long-term economic gain. He said aggressive commercial 
redevelopment on the Chanute property has drawn commercial and 
industrial tenants producing $1.2 million a year in revenue and 
1,400 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters later it was too early to speculate on how  
many bases -- or which ones -- might be closed. The first priority, 
he said, is to convince the public and the Congress that closures 
are needed in order to achieve savings in the long run that can 
help finance the military's needed modernization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine,'' he said, ``in exchange for property we don't want  
and don't need, we can put $3 billion a year into weapons that give 
our troops a life-saving edge, into training that keeps us the best 
in the world, and into the pocketbooks of military families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should offend every one of us that serious needs for our  
troops remain unmet while we squander money on facilities we no 
longer need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen proposed in 1997 and again last year that Congress  
authorize more base closures, but both times he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also used his speech in Springfield, Ill., to promote  
other priorities in President Clinton's fiscal 2000 defense budget, 
which will be submitted to Congress on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He spelled out the administration's rationale for a proposed $12  
billion increase in the 2000 defense budget, to include a 4.4 
percent across-the-board pay raise for troops, improved retirement 
benefits and more money for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most highly skilled and best-trained people in the  
world,'' Cohen said to a friendly but not demonstrably enthusiastic 
audience. ``But they will not remain so without significant 
attention to their quality of life and training,'' which he said 
had been degraded by years of spending cuts and added duties 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to attracting and keeping high-quality sailors,  
soldiers, airmen and Marines is making life easier for them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to give them a satisfactory quality of life. It is a  
moral obligation, but is no less a practical necessity,'' he told 
an audience that included active duty and retired military members, 
including Medal of Honor and Silver Star winner Hal Fritz of 
Chicago, who was wounded in the jungles of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's appearance before the Illinois General Assembly marked  
the start of a campaign to take his message to nontraditional 
audiences. Cohen worries that too much of the public is out of 
touch with the military, and vice versa, and that the disconnect in 
the long run will sap the strength of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is reconnect America to its military,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to address several other state legislatures this year.  
He also intends to travel to Redmond, Wash., in February to speak 
to employees of computer software giant Microsoft Corp., to drive 
home the point that the economic growth and stability of this 
country depends on its defense security.

<HEADLINE> Romo Turns Into Monster on Game Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Beginning four hours before game time, the  
transformation begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski sits down at his  
locker, starts applying his game face and reaches a trance-like 
state that causes teammates to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
	Romocop is ready to do battle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Come Sunday morning, it's time to go to war,'' he said. ``I  
just get in a zone, ready to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to teammate Trevor Pryce, Romanowski ``plays the game  
at a level that a lot of guys can't achieve. His intensity is way 
off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates love him for his full-throttle play. Many  
opponents, however, hate him because his play sometimes continues 
beyond the whistle, because of his borderline cheap shots and 
because of his tendency to taunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Falcons offensive lineman Dave Widell, who played with  
Romanowski at Boston College, said, ``Off the field, he's a family 
guy, a guy you'd like to have dinner with. On the field, he turns 
into a monster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Romanowski's pregame ritual, he mentally reviews the game  
plan and pumps himself up to make every tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brings everything I look for in a football player,'' coach  
Mike Shanahan said. ``The game means the world to him. Every game, 
you know you're going to get his best shot, regardless of the 
situation. I don't say that lightly. Coaches wish they could feel 
that way about every player. It's not a coincidence that he's 
involved in so many big plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pausing, Shanahan added with a smile, ``We just have to get a  
little more intensity out of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski, who played six years in San Francisco and two in  
Philadelphia before signing with Denver in 1996, gained unwanted 
notoriety from a number of incidents last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was fined $20,000 for his helmet-to-helmet hit on Carolina  
quarterback Kerry Collins that broke Collins' jaw in the preseason. 
On a Monday night game against San Francisco, a television camera 
caught Romanowski spitting in the face of 49ers receiver J.J. 
Stokes, and a $7,500 fine resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taunted Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart after an  
interception in last year's AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I get caught up in the heat of battle,'' Romanowski  
said, ``but I don't think of myself as a dirty player. I try to go 
out there and play every play like it's my last. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a violent sport. You're going to be the aggressor, the  
one doing the hitting, or you're going to be the one getting hit. 
I'd rather be on the hitting side. And if I can get inside a 
player's head, I'll do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same player who spit at Stokes is a devoted family man who  
gave his wife, Julie, a romantic birthday dinner overlooking the 
ocean last summer, along with a diamond necklace and a dozen roses. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight pictures of his family are taped to his locker.  
</P>
<P>
	That barely leaves enough room for all the bottles of  
nutritional supplements, vitamins and muscle enhancers that he 
consumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski, a conditioning freak, worked 30 hours a week for  
five months during the past offseason under the tutelage of 
performance coach Randy Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm faster, stronger and more focused,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 32, he appears to be in his prime, not past it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question he is playing the best football of his  
career right now,'' linebacker coach Frank Bush said. ``At his 
position (strong-side linebacker) he is not supposed to be that 
visible and making that many big plays. But Bill is making plays he 
has no business making. The reason is he's better now than he's 
ever been. He's faster. He's stronger. He's smarter. He's just 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush encourages Romanowski's on-the-edge playing style.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want him to be a little crazy out there,'' he said. ``We  
want him to be a little outlandish. But at the same time, we want 
him to be an effective player and a smart player. He's honing that 
skill now. He's still pushing the envelope, but he's doing it with 
a lot more intelligence.''

<HEADLINE> Man Caught With Knife at Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland man holding tickets to the  
impeachment trial was arrested last week when he tried to enter the 
Capitol with an 18-inch knife and explosives hidden in a bag, The 
Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Wilson Johnson, 36, of Capitol Heights, Md., was stopped  
by Capitol Police at 2 p.m. Jan. 20 when they checked the bag on an 
X-ray machine. At the time, President Clinton's lawyers, led by 
special counsel Gregory B. Craig, were presenting their second day 
of opening arguments before a crowded Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told police he kept the knife for ``protection,''  
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol Police said a search of Johnson's bag also turned up two  
M-60 explosive devices, a ``terrorist handbook,'' weapons price 
lists, an article on the Oklahoma City bombing, survivalist 
materials and a Soldier of Fortune magazine. One law enforcement 
source likened the M-60 devices to bottle rockets and said Johnson 
was carrying no match or lighter to ignite them. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was jailed without bond on charges of carrying a  
dangerous weapon and illegal explosives. On Monday, a federal judge 
ordered he be held pending a psychiatric evaluation and set a 
follow-up hearing for March 17 after citing reports that Johnson 
has a bipolar disorder.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Rejects Plan to Dismiss Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brushing aside Democratic objections, Senate  
Republicans on Thursday opened the door to public broadcast of 
Monica Lewinsky's videotaped testimony as they muscled through 
rules governing the balance of President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rapid-fire series of roll calls, majority Republicans also  
crushed a Democratic call for an immediate vote on Clinton's fate 
and an alternative set of rules that would have barred any public 
viewing of the questioning that Ms. Lewinsky is to undergo early 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	By their votes, Republicans set Feb. 12 as a target date for a  
final vote on Clinton's guilt or innocence on the two articles of 
impeachment, which allege perjury and obstruction of justice. 
``That's our goal and we have set in motion a process that will get 
us there,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters, although he 
conceded the target could slip. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the first deposition would be Monday, with Ms.  
Lewinsky, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal and presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan would be questioned over the two following 
days. All the sessions will be recorded on videotape, and Lott 
said, ``Exactly what happens to that videotape is not clarified or 
limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's up to the Senate itself to decide, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On another key point, Republicans left room for a vote on ``fact  
finding'' that would state formally that Clinton had committed 
offenses, even if he wasn't to be removed from office. The 
Democratic scenario would have prevented Republicans from even 
submitting such a document for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House accused the Republicans of ``power politics.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear the spirit of bipartisanship evaporated today, and  
that this has become a Republican impeachment trial,'' said 
spokesman James Kennedy. ``The plan that was adopted is vague and 
it has no certain end. It appears to contain trap doors that could 
significantly extend this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, countered: ``This is not a deep  
dark plot on the part of Republicans to slip anything over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 55 to 43 against a motion by Daschle to go  
immediately to four final hours of debate and then vote on the 
articles of impeachment. Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, was 
the sole lawmaker to cross party lines, just as he was the only 
Democrat to vote Wednesday against dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, the Senate rejected Democratic leader Tom Daschle's  
plan to limit to writing all public evidence of the depositions of 
witnesses, preventing the showing on the Senate floor of the 
videotaping that the House Republican prosecutors want and the 
White House opposes. Playing the tape at the trial, unless the 
session were closed, would put it on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans then pushed through their rules -- 54-44 -- which  
would permit trial use of the videotapes, and leave open the 
possibility of mass distribution by the Senate itself. Two senators 
were absent, Democratic Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who has been 
ill, and Republican Wayne Allard, who has an illness in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting came after hours of sparring between Republicans and  
Democrats over the way to conduct the final stages of the trial. 
Despite the obvious partisan tensions, few if any senators 
expressed the kind of anger that marked proceedings late last year 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle told reporters he didn't fault Lott for the events of  
the day. ``We simply couldn't bring this matter to a successful 
bipartisan resolution,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott returned the favor. ``I'm not ranting and raving and  
blasting them for their motives,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott put the rival plans to votes with a minimum of explanation,  
which prompted one of his colleagues to ask about details. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chief Justice William Rehnquist declined to answer Sen.  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parliamentarian tells me it is never the function of the  
chair to interpret a resolution,'' Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes unfolded suddenly after a day in which the trial had  
marked time while backroom negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart called for a swift  
end to the trial and said that in the Senate, ``the Republican 
majority has to answer to the country of why they want to continue 
to extend this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came one day after Republicans used their  
majority muscle to reject a call for immediate dismissal of the 
charges against Clinton, and to order subpoenas for Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 44 votes posted by Clinton's defenders on each of the  
two roll calls Wednesday may well have been more significant, 
showing the president had more than enough support to gain eventual 
acquittal on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``findings of fact'' emerged as a major hurdle to an  
agreement, as well. They would involve a formal finding that 
Clinton committed some or all of the alleged offenses -- but would 
not remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats objected strongly, even before the small group of  
Republicans working on the issue had produced a final draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be able to do by majority vote what the  
Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev. ``It would be constitutionally fraught with ... 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness issue has been a controversial one throughout the  
trial, and ironically, it appeared that each side -- the White House 
and House prosecutors -- wanted to preserve its right to seek 
additional evidence or witnesses if something unexpected turned up 
in the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan or Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a former prosecutor, was asked by  
reporters at one point during the day whether he could imagine 
anything new arising from the depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could imagine it, but I doubt it would happen,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- No bettor wanted Amelie Mauresmo  
before the Australian Open -- even at odds of 150-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauresmo fought off two match points in the opening around and  
before the third round was still unloved at 100-1 at the legal 
betting parlors. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's leading betting agency Centrebet had Mauresmo at  
16-1 for the title and 7-2 for the match before she beat No. 1 
Lindsay Davenport on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great result for us to have Davenport out. She's easily  
the most backed player in the women's draw,'' Centrebet assistant 
manager Ian Loughlin said. ``Mauresmo was 150-1 to one at the start 
and there were absolutely no takers at all. There's been hardly any 
interest all the way through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said only about $500 had been wagered on Mauresmo before  
Thursday's match and she will be a big outsider again in the final 
against Martina Hingis. Loughlin said he's offering 9-4 on the 
big-serving Maureso, with two-time defending champion Hingis at 
2-5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEPTH CHARGE:* Don't try to tell Yevgeny Kafelnikov, at No. 10  
the only seed left in the semifinals, that there's no depth in 
men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	With world No. 1 Pete Sampras resting, No. 2 Marcelo Rios  
injured and all the rest of the top 10 beaten by unseeded players, 
Kafelnikov is leading the pack of relative unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was reading an article a couple a days ago, it was on the  
floor in our locker room, and Mary Pierce was saying that the 
women's game is much more interesting and has much more depth than 
the men's,'' Kafelnikov said. ``I completely disagree with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game of tennis today is really hard.''  
</P>
<P>
	He singled out No.44-ranked Vince Spadea ousting Andre Agassi as  
an example. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see Spadea beating Agassi, playing wonderful tennis, and  
it creates a lot of intensity around the game. That makes the game 
very wonderful because you wouldn't know who is going to win the 
Slam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A few people dominate the women's tennis.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HABIT FORMING:* Tennis players are a superstitious breed.  
Yevgeny Kafelnikov has adopted the habit of retired Swedish 
champion Bjorn Borg and has not shaved since the start of the 
tournament. By Day 12 he had begun to look decidedly shaggy. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also given up gambling in Melbourne's casino, where he  
has bet on the black this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was quite down these weeks, so I kind of stay away from that  
place for a little while,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RISKING EVERY PENNY:* The competitive spirit also runs strong  
in German semifinalist Tommy Haas -- whether it be on the court or 
playing 10-cent slot machines at the casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach David Ayme said the 22-year-old was most upset to find  
himself down by about $6 with just one coin to go while playing the 
10-cent slots. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very upset he was about to lose $10,'' Ayme said.  
``Then he happens to win enough coins to make up to $15 and he's 
the most excited guy in the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thrill must be in taking risk for its own sake, not the  
money. Haas, in his best performance in a Grand Slam tournament, 
has already earned $113,400 by reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SLAM RECOGNITION:* Martina Hingis received recognition in a  
special ceremony Thursday for becoming only the second woman ever 
to win a Grand Slam in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Swiss last year paired with Mirjana Lucic to  
claim the Australia Open women' title, then partnered Jana Novotna 
to win the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the first woman since namesake Martina Navratilova  
partnered Pam Shriver to accomplish the women's doubles Grand Slam 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	A presentation of flowers was made to Hingis on center court at  
the Australian Open by Australia's Ken McGregor, who last week was 
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SERVE IT UP:* It's been a slow start to the year. The fastest  
serve at the Australian Open would not even make it into the top 10 
fastest serves of last year, according to ATP Tour statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	While six of the fastest servers from last year in men's tennis  
played, including Britain's Greg Rusedski, who topped the list with 
a 149 mph serve at Indian Wells, Calif., none reached the slowest 
speed on last year's top 10 list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Netherlands' Richard Krajicek and Rusedski are fastest at  
the tournament so far, both with serves clocked at 132 mph. The 
slowest speed to make the top 10 last year was 133 mph, shared by 
Marcelo Rios and Brian MacPhie in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming in second in Melbourne are Marat Safin, Mark  
Philippoussis and Marc Rosset, all with 131 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven others broke the 124.3 mph mark, including Tommy Haas,  
Thomas Enqvist and Vincent Spadea. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest women's serve so far in the tournament is Venus  
Williams' 117.5 mph.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Evaluation for Shooting Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered the man  
accused of killing two U.S. Capitol police officers to undergo a 
second psychiatric evaluation at a federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Weston, Jr. will spend 30 days at the U.S. Medical  
Facility for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo. Weston, 42, is 
accused of gunning down officers John Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut 
last July 24 in the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the defendant proceeds to trial and is convicted of  
murdering federal police officers engaged in their official duties, 
the government could request the death penalty,'' U.S. District 
Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in a 12-page order. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also rejected a prosecution request to videotape the  
new examination, but indicated he might reconsider the request 
based on the recommendations of the Bureau of Prisons or the 
government's expert. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-appointed government psychiatrist examined Weston in  
October. Dr. Sally Johnson found that Weston was incompetent to 
stand trial and should be hospitalized indefinitely. Johnson, 
associate warden at the Federal Corrections Institute at Butner, 
N.C., also wrote the psychiatric report that argued Unabomber 
Theodore Kaczynski was mentally competent for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan's ruling marked a partial victory for both prosecutors  
and defense attorneys in the case. Prosecutors have been seeking 
the inpatient evaluation, and defense attorneys have opposed 
efforts by the government to videotape any examination of Weston. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan noted that government attorneys are likely to challenge  
Johnson's recommendations on hospitalizing Weston indefinitely. He 
said a lengthy inpatient evaluation by a team of psychiatrists, 
psychologists, nurses, ward staff and corrections officers might 
provide a more complete picture than the original 20 hours of 
examination by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan limited the scope of the examination at Springfield to  
determining Weston's competency to stand trial on the charges in 
the six-count Capitol shooting indictment.

<HEADLINE> Total Mutual Fund Assets Decline / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $541.7 million to $845.69 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $978.3 million to $695.01 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets decreased by $436.6 million to $150.69 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $4.49  
billion to $585.15 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $4.70 billion 
to $535.05 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $208.0 
million to $50.11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.431 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.435 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.40 percent in the week ended Tuesday from 4.47 percent in the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.48 percent from 4.51 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.50 percent from 4.58  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield fell to 
4.58 percent from 4.61 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
54 days, unchanged from the previous week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.22 percent as of 
Wednesday, up from 2.21 percent in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
rose to 0.99 percent from 0.98 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was 4.14  
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged. But yields 
rose on 1-year CDs to 4.29 percent from 4.27 percent, rose to 4.36 
percent from 4.35 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs and rose to 4.49 percent 
from 4.48 percent on 5-year CDs.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Clinic Bombing Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- In the early morning light, New Woman  
All Women Health Care doesn't seem to need much of the $4.5 million 
President Clinton is proposing to improve abortion clinic security. 
</P>
<P>
	A protective glow from a dozen bright lights bathes the small,  
two-story building, which a year ago Friday became the site of the 
nation's first fatal bombing at an abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Coils of razor wire trim the roof. Four security cameras look  
down from the brick walls, pointed at parking areas and the yard 
where the bomb went off, killing an off-duty policeman and 
critically injuring a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing set off a manhunt that continues for Eric Robert  
Rudolph, 32, believed by the FBI to be hiding out in the forested 
hills around his home in western North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite nonstop searches and Rudolph being placed on the FBI's  
10 Most Wanted List, authorities seem no closer to catching him now 
than they were when a witness reported seeing his gray Nissan 
pickup truck near the clinic after the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting disheartening,'' said clinic attorney Wendy Crew.  
</P>
<P>
	Bomb shrapnel remains embedded in the legs and torso of nurse  
Emily Lyons, left scarred and with only one eye by the nail-packed 
bomb. It went off outside the clinic just a few feet from her as 
she arrived for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Officer Robert Sanderson, who was moonlighting as a  
security guard at New Woman, took the brunt of the blast, probably 
saving Mrs. Lyons' life. He died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held Friday for Sanderson. That same  
day, Mrs. Lyons plans to publish online the first part of a 
biographical book titled ``Life's Been a Blast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyons has overcome shyness and her injuries to become a  
spokeswoman for abortion rights since the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't need to forget this,'' said Mrs. Lyons, who has  
undergone 13 operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people have reached out to Mrs. Lyons, including  
Dana Ford. She runs the Otherside Lounge, an Atlanta gay nightclub 
which Rudolph is accused of bombing 11 months before the Birmingham 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nails and other evidence found in searches of Rudolph's home,  
pickup truck and mini-warehouse led authorities to charge him in 
the 1996 Olympic Games bombing in Atlanta, in which a woman died, 
and explosions at an abortion clinic and the club there. 
</P>
<P>
	Added security and the identification of Rudolph as a suspect  
have helped ease the minds of clinic workers. But a sense of fear 
looms. 
</P>
<P>
	When abortion opponents prepared for last week's annual march to  
mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing 
abortion, Operation Rescue leader David Lackey got a call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had one of the assistant (clinic) directors call me last  
week and ask if I was going to hurt her children,'' said Lackey, 
who has denied any involvement with the blast but was still called 
to testify before a federal grand jury. ``These people are living 
in a lot of fear.''

<HEADLINE> Feds, Disabled Sue Yankee Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The House that Ruth built should be renovated to  
better handle disabled people, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White says. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials on Thursday joined a lawsuit against the New  
York Yankees, and added New York City as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- filed in December on behalf of three New Jersey  
citizens and a Manhattan man, all wheelchair users -- claims the 
area of Yankee Stadium set aside for them has restricted views. It 
also says they must pay nearly 100 percent more for their tickets 
and can only get them by calling the stadium during certain hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is the national pastime and Yankee Stadium is home to  
its most storied franchise,'' White said. ``This lawsuit seeks to 
ensure that people with disabilities will have an equal opportunity 
to experience the thrill of the game in this historic place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said the organization does not  
comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and calls on the court to  
make the Yankees fix the stadium so its more accessible to 
wheelchair users. The 75-year-old ballpark reserves 64 wheelchair 
spaces and 24 accompanying seats for each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Joseph Reilly, of Tenafly, N.J., said he stopped going  
to Yankees games in 1977 because he couldn't see anything from the 
section set aside for wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said one area for wheelchair users behind the main  
box level has no seats for companions and costs twice as much as 
most stadium seats. The other area, located on the field box level, 
limits wheelchair users to one companion and costs up to three 
times as much as general stadium seating, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yankees have always been famous for hitting home runs,''  
Reilly, 56, said during a telephone interview. ``What's the point 
in going if you can't see one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Theresa Murphy, of Middletown, N.J., said she tried to  
get two Yankees tickets for one of the playoff games last September 
with the Cleveland Indians as an early birthday present for her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	After calling a ticket agent and being told he could not help  
her, she called the Yankee Clubhouse store in Manhattan, which told 
her to call the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called the stadium, I reached a man who told me he  
couldn't help me because the woman who handles such tickets was out 
to lunch,'' she said. ``So I hung up and wrote a letter to Mr. 
(George) Steinbrenner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I phrased it very nicely, saying all I was asking for is help  
in getting the tickets. I was happy to pay for them,'' Mrs. Murphy 
said. ``I got no response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other plaintiffs -- James Pascuiti of Mountainside, N.J., and  
Walter Rynasko of Manhattan -- did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Brokers Charged With Inside Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three Long Island stockbrokers were charged with  
insider trading for allegedly using advance copies of Business 
Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column to make stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Cohen, 33, and Seth Glaser, 29, who were brokers at  
Renaissance Financial Securities Corp. in Mineola and Joseph 
Falcone, 39, who was a broker at Prudential Securities in Melville, 
were charged with insider trading for using the information, said 
U.S. District Attorney Zachary W. Carter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Smath, who also worked at Renaissance, pleaded guilty  
Tuesday to conspiracy to commit securities fraud for allegedly 
obtaining the column from an employee of a company that distributes 
the magazine and faxing it to the other brokers, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court  
in Hauppauge, Smath was paid to obtain pre-published copies of the 
``Inside Wall Street'' column -- in which positive information about 
publicly traded companies is often reported -- and send it to the 
three other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smath allegedly received a copy through a friend working at  
Hudson News Co. in New Jersey. The company distributes Business 
Week and other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the Hudson News employee -- who allegedly also  
received a payoff -- was not released. A message left with Hudson 
News was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	On several Thursdays in 1995 and early 1996 Cohen, Glaser and  
Falcone allegedly received faxes of the column, or a list of 
companies mentioned in it, and would then buy stock in the 
companies before the stock markets closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The column by Gene Marcial, which is printed in Business Week,  
is first available to the public over the Internet Thursday after 
the closing of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers and their clients would allegedly cash in by  
unloading the stock after the prices had gone up based on the 
column's favorable coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, Glaser, Falcone and their clients allegedly made profits  
of more than $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme ended suddenly in January 1996, when Business Week  
published an article, ``Is Someone Sneaking a Peek at Business 
Week?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The article mentioned that the Securities and Exchange  
Commission had been alerted that trading on Thursdays in stock 
mentioned in the column, an indication that someone might be 
getting an early look. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the brokers had unlisted phone numbers and could not be  
reached for comment. A man who answered the phone at Smath's home 
declined to give his name but said all calls were being referred to 
attorney Michael Bachner. Messages left with Bachner were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no telephone listing for Renaissance Financial. No one  
answered the phone at Prudential in Melville late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of securities fraud carry a maximum sentence of 10 years  
in prison, as well as fines and restitution, Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Knows He's in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The topic was Texas. But Gov. George W.  
Bush spoke a lot about Washington and a ``national spotlight'' 
during his State of the State address. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in a major speech, Bush acknowledged that his  
ongoing indecision over a White House bid had taken center stage, 
calling the future ``a question that has dominated my life in 
recent weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been asked about it. You have been asked about it,''  
the Republican told legislators. ``You didn't ask for it -- but it 
is here anyway. And we can either view it as a distraction, or 
seize it as an opportunity to show the world what limited and 
constructive government looks like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush noted that the nation's second-largest state, with the  
world's 11th-largest economy, runs well with a Legislature that 
meets only 140 days every other year. 
</P>
<P>
	Molly Beth Malcolm, who chairs the Texas Democratic Party, said  
Bush ``sounded more like a candidate for president than a 
governor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the son of former President George W. Bush, is considered  
an early front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Other possible candidates are former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
millionaire businessman Steve Forbes, former cabinet secretary 
Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and activist 
Gary Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said repeatedly that he is thinking -- but remains  
undecided -- about the GOP presidential nomination. He repeated that 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big answer to the question is, I really don't know yet,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the first Texas governor re-elected to consecutive  
four-year terms, did propose a $2 billion school property tax cut; 
sales tax reductions on diapers, over-the-counter medicines and 
access to the Internet; and a series of business tax breaks 
designed to promote research and give relief to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would follow through on a campaign pledge to end  
``social promotion'' of school children. He called for a pilot 
program of vouchers that would use tax dollars to send children in 
poor-performing public schools to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's a huge debate raging, but we must not trap  
students in low-performing schools. It is time to see if it 
works,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged tougher standards against drunken driving,  
requiring parental involvement when minor girls get abortions and 
mandatory jail time for juveniles who commit crimes with guns.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Imports of Steel Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department offered a glimmer of  
hope Thursday to struggling U.S. steel producers, reporting that 
imports into the United States dropped 31 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	More dramatic reductions were recorded for imports from Japan  
and Russia, two of the countries blamed for a recent import surge 
that contributed to more than 10,000 U.S. layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said he was encouraged by the  
figures but promised to continue monitoring the data to determine 
whether to seek trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the one-month drop, import levels were still higher than  
those of 1997, before the Asian economic crisis lowered demand for 
steel abroad and forced foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The temperature was lowered from 106 to 104,'' said Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. ``It's still 
too high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Wilhelm, president of U.S. Steel Group, said the industry  
will file additional trade complaints as early as next month, 
dealing with different steel products and different originating 
countries from the cases filed in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley, speaking with reporters by telephone from the annual  
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, attributed the 
reductions in December to actions taken by the Clinton 
administration, notwithstanding criticisms from the industry that 
President Clinton has done too little. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the Commerce Department threatened that any duties  
applied against Japan and Russia might be retroactive to 
mid-November. Faced with the prospect of additional duties, 
exporters began to cut back their shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration will continue talks to persuade  
Russia to lower shipments to the United States even more and the 
European Union to take a greater share of the foreign steel now 
being sent to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first time the Commerce Department has released  
preliminary trade figures for steel, it said Japanese producers 
shipped 384,597 metric tons of steel products into the United 
States in December, a 47 percent decrease from the 728,478 in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports from Russia dropped to 135,777 metric tons in  
December, a 79 percent decrease from the 658,363 a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, U.S. steel imports in December were at 2.5 million  
metric tons, a 31 percent decrease from 3.6 million in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures are due in about three weeks. The administration  
decided to release preliminary data to give the domestic industry 
an earlier warning of import trends. Officials expect the 
preliminary figures to equal about 96 percent of the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In adjusted figures for 1998 through November, imports from  
Japan increased nearly threefold from a year earlier and imports 
from Russia jumped about 60 percent. Overall, imports to the United 
States went up 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the drop in December was in hot-rolled steel, the target  
of industry's complaints that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally 
dumped steel in the U.S. market at prices dramatically below 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had threatened a  
separate, government-initiated trade complaint against Japan if the 
December figures did not show a substantial reduction. Such a case 
could lead to quotas or broad tariffs on imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinya Okuda, director of the steel division at the Ministry of  
International Trade and Industry, said in Tokyo that he expected 
the ``declining trend to continue into January and beyond,'' which 
he said ``should allay concerns in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Griswold, a trade analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute,  
said he expected the figures to ``give the administration more 
reason to resist the more extreme calls for protection.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Splits Stock 2-for-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- In a move widely anticipated by  
financial analysts, Intel Corp. has announced a 2-for-1 stock split 
that will make shares more affordable to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion  
in sales last year, said Thursday that the split takes effect April 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors greeted the news by bidding Intel up $4.43 3/4 at  
$137.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly shows that the company is doing well,'' said  
Prudential Securities technology analyst Hans Moseman in Palo Alto. 
``This split makes Intel stock more attractive to small investors 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split would be the 12th since Intel went public 26 years  
ago. The last split, also 2-for-1, was in June 1997. The company 
has 1.67 billion shares of stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	An investor who purchased $100 worth of Intel stock when it  
first went public in Oct. 1971 would now be holding shares worth 
$397,597. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stock split, a company increases the number of shares  
outstanding without increasing its total market value. A share 
valued at $100, for example, might be exchanged for two shares 
valued at $50 each, or three shares worth $33.33 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	A split is usually interpreted as a sign that a company expects  
its stock to continue to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other high tech companies have announced stock splits  
this month, including Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., eBay 
Inc. and Yahoo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel makes about 85 percent of the world's computer processors,  
and manufactures memory chips plus hardware for computer networks, 
communications and graphics.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Head: Word Flap Mishandled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mayor Anthony Williams acted ``niggardly'' in  
accepting the resignation of an aide who used that word at a staff 
meeting, the NAACP's chairman said Thursday, lamenting how racial 
sensibilities are so tender that innocent people can be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole episode speaks loudly to where we are on issues of  
race,'' said Julian Bond. Even ``imagined slights are catapulted to 
the front burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the aide, David Howard, said he shouldn't have used  
``niggardly,'' which means stingy and has no racial connotation but 
sounds like a slur. ``I would hope that this will be a red flag to 
us, that we need to learn to perceive things from the other 
person's point of view,'' he said. Howard has insisted that 
resigning was his idea and the mayor should not be blamed for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who is black, said initially that Howard, who is  
white, showed poor judgment even though he ``didn't say anything 
that was in itself racist.'' He said later that an investigation 
was continuing and Howard might return to the staff -- but in a 
different job -- if he's ultimately found to have done nothing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seems to me the mayor has been niggardly in his judgment on  
this issue,'' Bond said pointedly. ``You hate to think you have to 
censor your language to meet other people's lack of 
understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he voiced regret about the nation's ``fixation on these  
little quirky things and a real hesitation to speak to the serious 
large issues.'' In addition to chairing the nation's largest civil 
rights organization, Bond, who is black, teaches at the University 
of Virginia and is a student of language. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's population is about two-thirds black.  
</P>
<P>
	Dictionaries trace ``niggardly'' to Scandinavia and attribute no  
offensive meaning to it. But the possibility of confusion is raised 
in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, which says the word is 
often shunned to avoid misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be highly sensitive to say that in a roomful of  
people with various backgrounds,'' said the book's author, Bryan A. 
Garner, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond said the nation has a ``hair-trigger sensibility'' on race  
that can be tripped by both real grievances and false ones. ``These 
affronts do happen, they are expected to happen, and even innocent 
parties can find themselves victims.''

<HEADLINE> Company Saves Workers With Miracle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Dave Talbot hardly remembers how the  
twisting 200-foot flames charged and retreated. He wasn't really 
watching the Titan Mobile Home factory burn -- it was his future he 
saw consumed that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood there ... everything was gone. I felt empty. I felt  
lost,'' said Talbot, a supervisor who started with Titan 26 years 
ago when it opened its factory on the outskirts of town. ``I prayed 
for a miracle because it was the only thing left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just when the future looked its bleakest for Talbot, his 200  
co-workers and this upstate village of 2,300, Talbot's prayer was 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan and its parent company, Champion Enterprises, announced  
last week that they not only planned to rebuild the plant, but will 
expand as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Titan and Champion told employees they would receive full  
salary and benefits while the plant was being rebuilt. Workers and 
residents couldn't believe their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the last big business we have here ... If workers had to  
go elsewhere, we would not only have lost them, but their families 
and their homes,'' said a smiling B.J. Evans, who owns a village 
pizza shop. 
</P>
<P>
	``This just doesn't happen in corporate America. A decision  
based on compassion and loyalty. Usually, you hear about companies 
leaving workers and their communities high and dry,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Titan has become an economic bedrock for the Waterville area, a  
rural Everytown, U.S.A., tucked between hills in the Mohawk Valley 
about 60 miles southeast of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Waterville was first settled in 1793. Kodak founder George  
Eastman was born here in 1854, and knitting mills fueled the 
village's prosperity until the early 1900s. Once they closed, there 
wasn't much industry until Titan arrived in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, flanked by churches and a park, the two-block business  
district is dominated by mom-and-pop eateries and the Food King 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it had some lean years early, Titan has prospered over  
the last decade. It had record sales in 1998 when it produced more 
than 1,100 mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the jobs, which pay an average of about $25,000  
annually, and the spinoff spending they provide, Titan pays nearly 
$80,000 a year in local taxes.

	``It's not only important financially, it's important  
psychologically for our community for them to stay,'' said 
Waterville Central Schools Superintendent James Van Wormer. 
</P>
<P>
	While concern and allegiance were factors, plant General Manager  
Jack Ireton-Hewitt said the company also wanted to keep the trained 
work force on standby to reopen that much faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last six years, we've grown in size and sales. That's  
because of the sophistication of our workers. We want to keep this 
group together,'' he said. ``We're just trying to do the right 
thing and get our operation back up as quickly as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Titan hopes to have its modernized and expanded plant built and  
operating within the next four months, Ireton-Hewitt said. The 
project will cost about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Champion, based in Michigan, is the nation's leading builder of  
manufactured homes with sales of over $2.2 billion a year and more

	Chief executive officer Walter Young said he was only vaguely  
familiar with the story of Malden Mills Industries in Lawrence, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire three years ago destroyed the mill and caused more than  
$300 million in damages. Owner Aaron Feuerstein kept all of his 
1,400 employees on the payroll and rebuilt the mill complex. 
President Clinton latched onto Feuerstein as a symbol of compassion 
in an age when many businesses seem to see workers as costs to be 
cut.

	Titan carpenter John Wellman of Earlville is a father of four  
with a stay-at-home wife. He said he has some time to kill, but at 
least he doesn't have to worry about how he's going to pay the 
bills or find a new job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated to think about having to refinance. I didn't know how  
I was going to do it. I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm 
not dreaming,'' Wellman said. ``They must think an awful lot of us. 
It's like a miracle.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Stadium Deal Lacks NFL OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The NFL will not approve the New England  
Patriots' move to Hartford by the time team owner Robert Kraft and 
Gov. John G. Rowland plan to make the deal ironclad, a league 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraft and Rowland have said they'll sign a development agreement  
by Feb. 5. But the deal -- which also must be approved by 24 of the 
NFL's 31 teams -- will not be discussed by the football bosses 
before Feb. 16, league spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
	The development agreement was first expected to be signed Jan.  
15, but Kraft and Rowland agreed to extend the deadline to Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey James, a spokesman for the Patriots, said the absence of  
an NFL vote will not hold up the development agreement. He said the 
team had expected to sign the agreement before getting NFL 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL executives gathered in Miami on Thursday, but the Patriots'  
move from Foxboro, Mass. to Hartford was not scheduled to be 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's next meeting will be held Feb. 16 in Atlanta,  
Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a decision before that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A $374 million spending bill to build the Patriots a Hartford  
stadium sailed through the General Assembly Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The development agreement, which will legally commit Kraft to  
Hartford, will contain all the details of the deal laid out in the 
framework of the spending bill.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Earnings Down 60 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
tumbled 60 percent, hurt by restructuring costs and falling prices 
for chemicals and plastics. But the results came in just above Wall 
Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday it earned $144 million, or 65  
cents per share, in the last three months of 1998, down from $357 
million, or $1.55 per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales dropped 8 percent to $4.44 billion from $4.80 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to lower prices, costs to cover the closing of its  
magnesium business and other restructuring moves reduced earnings 
by 45 cents per share. Excluding those costs, Dow Chemical's 
earnings of $1.10 per share were slightly ahead of analysts' 
predictions of $1.08 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical stock closed up $1.06 1/4 at $88.06 1/4 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Dow Chemical earned $1.30 billion, or $5.76 per  
share, after restructuring costs of about $1 billion. The company 
earned $1.80 billion, or $7.70 per share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $18.44 billion from $20.02 billion.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Leslie Alexander accused  
Ecuadorean officials of not seriously pursuing corruption charges 
against ousted President Abdala Bucaram, a leading newspaper 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucaram, known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for his  
eccentric behavior, was removed from office by Congress in February 
1997 for ``mental incapacity'' amid massive street protests and 
charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in the newspaper El Universo,  
Alexander said some corruption charges against Bucaram have been 
pending for two or three years now without resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has the government done after Bucaram left? What did the  
last government do? Nothing. For me, it is all a very hypocritical 
game,'' Alexander was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucaram faces three charges of corruption and misuse of state  
funds in Ecuadorean courts. The Supreme Court last year sentenced 
him in absentia to two years in prison for slandering two 
opposition legislators while he was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucaram, who lives in exile in Panama, has maintained his  
innocence.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Authorities shut down a milk factory on  
Thursday following a scandal in which local media accused Mexican 
legislators of distributing bad milk to their working-class 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Protection Agency and the Health Ministry closed  
the Super Lecheria company after finding its Betty brand milk 
contained high levels of fecal matter, the government news agency 
Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party  
distributed Betty milk at wholesale prices to consumers who have 
been hard-hit by growing inflation in the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Bortolini, one of the Democratic Revolution legislators,  
told reporters his party he was unaware of the health code 
violations and said officials from the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party were trying to smear his party's image.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Rafael Caldera bid farewell  
to the nation Thursday in his State of the Union address, taking 
credit for rescuing Venezuela's one-time model democracy from the 
brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fulfilled our mission. We solved the puzzle and delivered  
the country in peace and democracy,'' Caldera, 83, said as his 
voice broke. Legislators, church leaders and judges gave him a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, who turns over the presidency next Tuesday to former  
coup leader Hugo Chavez, said that when he started his second 
presidency five years ago Venezuela was in political, economic and 
social chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera helped found Venezuela's democracy four decades ago when  
the last dictator was overthrown and he was long a leader of the 
social Christian COPEI party. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez rode a wave of discontent with the traditional  
parties. He has pledged to toss out the 1961 constitution that 
Caldera helped write. Caldera freed Chavez from prison in 1994, 
hoping to heal wounds from the coup attempts.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The Honduran ambassador to the  
United States was sworn in Thursday as the nation's first civilian 
defense minister since the country gained independence 178 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carlos Flores Facusse administered the oath of office  
to Edgardo Dumas Rodriguez in a ceremony before leaders of the 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honduran legislature amended the constitution Tuesday to end  
41 years of military autonomy and establish civilian control over 
the armed forces. The military commander in chief, Brig. Gen. Mario 
Hung Pacheco, formally turned over command to Flores Facusse 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumas Rodriguez, 70, had been a columnist for the newspaper La  
Tribuna, which is owned by the president. He replaces Col. 
Cristobal Corrales Calix, who had only nominal authority over the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Honduras' military has long dominated the country, toppling  
governments in 1956, 1963 and 1972. It abandoned power in 1981, but 
continued to be a powerful force independent of civilian control.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian government wants to  
limit violent programing on television to the late evening hours, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Working together with the major television networks, the  
government plans to ban violent shows until after a certain hour, 
probably 9 p.m., said Lucia Carneiro, spokeswoman for Human Rights 
Secretary Jose Gregori. 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction, inspired by a similar measure in Canada, would  
apply to all programming and could include news and documentary 
shows as well, Carneiro said. Since April 1997, Canada has limited 
violent programs to after 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't yet been decided whether each station will regulate  
itself or whether we will have rules that all stations follow,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence on television was the focus of a meeting in Brasilia  
Wednesday, organized by UNESCO.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are making  
progress as the delayed start of the NBA season approaches. Coach 
Del Harris just isn't sure how much progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he's never been in this position before.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're doing all right,'' Harris said after a scrimmage  
Wednesday night. ``I like the guys' attitudes. We've got work to 
do. I'm counting on guys really applying themselves these last 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played a little better, a little less sloppy  
(than in Monday night's scrimmage at UC Santa Barbara). But we 
still obviously need all the time we have allotted to us to smooth 
our game out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were making their first appearance at the Forum in  
eight months -- since they were swept by Utah in the Western 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17,505-seat arena was about half full. The fans were quite  
receptive and pretty boisterous throughout the scrimmage, which 
lasted a little over two hours. Tickets were distributed free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage consisted of five periods, with players being used  
on both the Gold and Purple teams and the score reverting to 0-0 at 
the beginning of each period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal's first shot was blocked from the side by  
6-foot-6 rookie Ruben Patterson, drawing oohs and aahs from the 
crowd. Shortly thereafter, the fans groaned when O'Neal missed his 
first two foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were two of the few he missed, though. O'Neal led all  
scorers with 31 points including 9-of-14 from the foul line. Rick 
Fox scored 26 points, Bryant had 23, and Patterson and Travis 
Knight added 20 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Sam Jacobson missed most of the scrimmage after suffering  
a strained hip flexor. He's listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who practiced formally for the first time at UC  
Santa Barbara last Thursday, face the Los Angeles Clippers in 
exhibition games Friday and Saturday nights, and open the 
abbreviated season Feb. 5 against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the scrimmage, 12-year-old actress Lindsay Ridgeway sang  
``The Star Spangled Banner,'' and longtime announcer Chick Hearn, 
who hasn't missed a Lakers broadcast in over 34 years, introduced 
Harris and the team's 14 players. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if the lockout had never occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see you back,'' Hearn told the cheering fans.  
``And this is only the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things were handled quite informally. Harris and each player  
spoke briefly to the crowd from midcourt before the scrimmage 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	The warmest receptions went to Hearn, O'Neal, Bryant and Eddie  
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the LA fans -- the best fans in the world,'' O'Neal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player heard some boos mixed in with the cheers --  
backup forward/center Elden Campbell, the subject of preseason 
trade rumors but apparently about to start his ninth year with the 
team.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Head: Word Flap Handled Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the NAACP says Washington  
Mayor Anthony Williams acted in a ``niggardly'' way by accepting 
the resignation of an aide who offended some people by using that 
word in a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to think you have to censor your language to meet  
other people's lack of understanding,'' Julian Bond said today, 
noting ``niggardly'' means stingy and has no offensive connotation 
even though it sounds similar to a slur. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole episode speaks loudly to where we are on issues of  
race. Both real and imagined slights are catapulted to the front 
burner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Howard stepped down after receiving complaints about his  
use of the word in a conversation with other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who is black, accepted the resignation of Howard, who  
is white, saying initially that his aide showed poor judgment even 
though he ``didn't say anything that was in itself racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor backpedaled a bit Wednesday, the day after Howard  
resigned. The mayor said an investigation was under way and Howard 
might return to the staff -- in a different job -- if he's ultimately 
judged to have done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seems to me the mayor has been niggardly in his judgment on  
this issue,'' Bond said pointedly by phone. In addition to being 
chairman of the largest civil rights organization, Bond, who is 
black, teaches at the University of Virginia and is a student of 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a hair-trigger sensibility and I think that is  
particularly true of racial minorities,'' he said. ``These affronts 
do happen, they are expected to happen, and even innocent parties 
can find themselves victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment on the street was split.  
</P>
<P>
	Some residents say Howard, a former Williams campaign worker who  
handled citizen complaints for the mayor's office, is guilty only 
of poor word choice. Others say he should have realized ahead of 
time how the word might be wrongly received. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's quite a bit of hubbub, quite a bit of buzz about it,''  
said Kojo Nnamdi, black host of a public interest talk show at WAMU 
radio. ``It's indicative of the state of race relations in 
Washington. A simple explanation should have sufficed. When it 
comes to race in Washington, apparently a simple explanation 
doesn't get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Deely, a 49-year-old white advertising manager who grew up  
in Washington, says it was only a misunderstanding. ``Howard 
resigned too soon and Williams accepted it too fast,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey Clarke, 54, a professional painter who was born in  
Trinidad and moved to Washington 31 years ago, says Howard 
shouldn't have resigned at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``People make a big deal,'' said Clarke, who is black. ``It's  
just politics. You make a little mistake and you're in hot water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Marcus Marshall, 22, a black employee in a sporting goods  
store, said Howard did the right thing in stepping down. ``I don't 
agree with him saying that kind of word. He should be punished 
because it's so close to ... a degrading word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dictionaries and other language references trace the word to  
Scandinavia and attribute no offensive meaning to it. It is not 
even in the Forbidden American English, a dictionary of 1,400 
``highly offensive and often inflammatory'' words and phrases. 
</P>
<P>
	But the possibility of confusion is raised in A Dictionary of  
Modern American Usage, a new reference published by Oxford 
University Press. The word has no connection to the racial slur, 
the book says. ``Even so, some speakers and writers have come to 
shun it just to avoid misunderstandings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Author Bryan A. Garner, who is white, said modern sensibilities  
should be taken into account when using legitimate but problematic 
language. He recalled an incident at the University of Texas when a 
professor called a Supreme Court ruling ``niggardly'' in class and 
black students asked later whether he had insulted them.

<HEADLINE> Hoffa's Victory Given Official OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Hoffa won a federal overseer's  
approval Thursday to assume the Teamsters presidency, but the 
election monitor barred one of his running mates from taking office 
and delayed his decision on two union vice presidents from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Leedham, who opposed Hoffa in the December 1998 contest  
after a campaign finance scandal overturned incumbent president Ron 
Carey's 1996 re-election and barred him from the rerun, said he had 
not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been two years since the members of this union had  
legitimate, elected leaders,'' Hoffa said in a prepared statement. 
``I call on the Leedham slate to accept this decision and not 
further delay the inevitable with appeals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky refused to certify the  
results for two of the vice presidents from Canada, who ran on a 
separate ticket, while he investigates charges of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherkasky barred Hoffa running mate J.D. Potter from assuming  
his seat on the board. Potter was one of two Hoffa running mates 
charged with wrongdoing by a separate court-appointed board since 
the ballots were tallied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Review Board charged Potter, the leader of a  
Texas local, with lying to the election office about breaking 
donation limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rules, Potter was limited to giving $5,000 to the  
Hoffa campaign, and he said that an additional $5,000 he forwarded 
came from other union members. 
</P>
<P>
	He also contended, according to the charges, that the original  
bills they gave him were still in his car, and he produced $4,700 
in cash from the trunk. But 13 of the bills were not in circulation 
at the time he claimed Potter had collected them. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom O'Donnell, a New York Teamsters leader, also had been  
threatened with expulsion from the union by the IRB for paying the 
salary of a campaign worker who was a convicted felon to the 
worker's wife rather than admit there was a felon on the Hoffa 
campaign payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	But O'Donnell was fined after the 1996 race and Cherkasky  
decided to allow him to join the 24-member union general executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three of Hoffa's slate members from the 1996 campaign  
were charged by the IRB and had to step out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham and the grass-roots reform group that backed him,  
Teamsters for a Democratic Union, painted Hoffa as the candidate of 
old guard union officials who were stripped of power after the 
Teamsters union was forced to sign a federal consent decree to 
avoid racketeering charges in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaking that image is a primary challenge for the son of labor  
legend Jimmy Hoffa, but allegations continue to dog some of his 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
	While he awaits certification, Hoffa and his closest aides have  
begun to review operations at Teamsters headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Md. Sen. Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., was released  
from a Baltimore hospital this morning after she checked in with a 
bad case of the flu, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mikulski, 62, is expected to return to the Senate ``any  
minute now,'' said spokeswoman Mona Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's feeling better than yesterday,'' Ms. Miller said. ``She  
did get some much-needed rest and fluids and antibiotics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator checked into Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore on  
Tuesday after feeling faint. Doctors diagnosed that Ms. Mikulski's 
flu-like symptoms resulted from an inflamed gall bladder, and she 
will require routine surgery within the next 10 days, according to 
a statement from her office. No surgery date has been scheduled 
yet.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Look Forward to Olowokandi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers expect rookie  
center Michael Olowokandi to arrive from Italy late today and hope 
to sign him to a contract over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first pick in last year's draft, Olowokandi is expected  
to sign a three-year deal for $10,368,840. He would get an 
additional $4,662,472 if the Clippers exercise the fourth-year 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't take any time, to sign a contract,'' Clippers  
vice president of basketball operations Elgin Baylor said Thursday 
at the team's media day. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi was released from his contract by Kinder Bologna of  
the Italian League on Monday. Originally, he was bound to that team 
until Feb. 15 -- 10 days after the abbreviated NBA season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi is expected to attend Saturday night's exhibition  
game against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Sports Arena, but it's 
unlikely he'll play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what happened in Europe,'' first-year  
coach Chris Ford said. `I think Michael is going to be a fine young 
player. We're anxiously awaiting his arrival. I think it's just red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got some catching up to do. We'll bring him along  
gradually, we'll see what kind of shape he's in. The most important 
thing is he's willing to listen and to learn. Those are important 
assets right now. It's going to be a learning process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clippers said an MRI examination on forward  
Rodney Rogers' right knee showed no damage and Rogers returned to 
practice Thursday after sitting out a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	However, forward Maurice Taylor, who has a strained quadriceps  
in his right leg, didn't practice and probably won't play in 
exhibition games against the Lakers tonight and Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's day-to-day,'' Taylor said. ``You've got to let it heal.  
It's not something that's going to keep me out too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor injured himself early in training camp but continued to  
practice. He was told by team doctors to take a few days off and 
has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers and Taylor both reported to training camp a few pounds  
over their playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not in great physical shape, you're more vulnerable  
to injuries,'' Ford said.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Murder Defendant Takes Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man accused of killing seven men,  
three women and two baby boys persuaded a judge to let him reopen 
his case and take the stand again as his murder trial neared its 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused serial sex killer Charles Ng was to resume testifying  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the stand for the first time Wednesday, Ng denied half of  
the dozen murders he is charged with. Defense attorney Lewis Clapp 
declined to ask him directly about the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings took place during 1984 and 1985. Ng is accused of  
helping his survivalist buddy Leonard Lake imprison, rape and 
torture the women while using the men's identities to take money 
from banks, credit accounts and even to collect a Super Bowl 
betting pool. Lake committed suicide in 1985 after he was arrested 
for shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stand, Ng, 38, supported his lawyers' contention that  
Lake was solely to blame for the killings, saying he depended on 
Lake for transportation and food and that they would stay together 
at each other's homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng testified that many items belonging to victims that were  
found in his apartment were brought there by Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that Lake had showed him pictures of a bunker  
where prosecutors say sex slaves were kept. But Ng said he thought 
the bunker was just part of Lake's survivalist obsession, ``to 
protect him and his valuables from fallout and things like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clapp asked whether Lake had ever told him about a secret  
chamber where women were imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he said that was a secret chamber, but that was his  
domain. ... He basically told me that was his privacy area. He 
didn't want me to go inside,'' Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, arrested in Canada in 1985, fought extradition for six  
years. The case has been estimated to have cost taxpayers about $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He could face the death penalty if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Feds OK Low-Power Radio Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government took the first step Thursday  
toward creating a low-power, low-cost radio service that would help 
community groups, churches, students and ordinary people get on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission, in a 4-1 vote, offered  
proposals to create thousands of new, licensed low-tech FM radio 
stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts. It would reverse a roughly 
20-year old ban against such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals ``could create a whole new class of voices using  
the airwaves ... opportunities for churches and community groups 
... so many of whom feel that they are being frozen out of 
opportunities to become broadcasters,'' said FCC Chairman Bill 
Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action also responds to consolidation in the radio  
industry, which has made it increasingly difficult for minorities 
and community groups to make their voices heard. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law triggered rapid consolidation in the industry by  
relaxing limits on the number of radio stations held by any one 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, the FCC has received 13,000 inquiries from  
city governments, schools, churches and others wanting to start a 
low-power station. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC proposed that those who want to start a low power  
station would have to meet the same licensing standards as existing 
higher-powered FM stations. To get a higher-power license, 
companies generally must show they want to serve a particular area. 
They must also provide information about any past criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	The process wouldn't automatically disqualify a person or group  
based on their political views -- even if those views are white 
supremacist, for example, or offensive in some other way, FCC 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, although the proposals don't bar pirate radio operators --  
people who illegally operate stations without a license -- from 
getting a new low-powered license, the FCC's proposals indicate 
that pirates who refused to follow FCC orders and shut down their 
illegal stations could have a tough time getting a low powered 
license, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	New low-powered stations ``will likely cause devastating  
interference to existing broadcasters,'' said Edward Fritts, 
president of the National Association of Broadcasters, which 
opposes the FCC's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing those concerns, Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth  
dissented from the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, a strong supporter of the new licenses, countered these  
fears, saying his agency will protect existing radio services. 
``Will we create a class of new low-power stations that will wreak 
havoc in the FM band? Of course we won't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Low-powered stations are cheaper to build because the equipment  
isn't as expensive. In addition to avoiding the big expense of 
building a tower for antennas, stations likely will have an easier 
time getting zoning approval for smaller rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Costs can be as low as $2,500 for a 1-watt station to $100,000  
and up for a 1,000-watt station, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, depending on the height of the antenna and the terrain, a  
1-watt station typically serves an area with a diameter of about 
two miles -- and a 1,000-watt station an area with a diameter of up 
to 18 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This permits people who have felt abandoned by commercial  
broadcasting to use an inexpensive medium to create an audio soap 
box for discussion and debate,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, president 
of the Media Access Project, which supports the new service. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are subject to revision, public comment and  
another vote before they would take effect. The FCC is supposed to 
seek public comment on whether the stations should be 
noncommercial, commercial or a mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC postponed a vote to release an audit of the  
five Bell telephone companies showing that billions of dollars in 
equipment can't be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, however, agreed to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require that long-distance companies compensate pay phone  
owners 24 cents for each calling card or access code call. 
</P>
<P>
	--Release a report on availability of high-speed Internet and  
data connections.

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged With Making Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Minn. (AP) -- Police said the bad smell coming from the  
fish shack on Waverly Lake had nothing to do with what was being 
caught inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was with what was being made inside.  
</P>
<P>
	Three men, ages 18 to 21, were arrested last week and charged  
with using a fishing shack as a methamphetamine lab. A fourth man 
was charged with felony possession of the illegal stimulant, which 
is made using a stinky concoction of toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers responded to reports of trash around the ice-fishing  
house on the lake 25 miles west of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before they even opened the door, investigators could smell the  
chemicals inside. An officer was overcome by fumes and had to be 
treated at a hospital.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Edition of Super Bowl Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Muscular wrestlers and shapely lingerie models  
will share the spotlight with football during this Sunday's Super 
Bowl telecast in the year's biggest attraction for both the NFL and 
Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wrestling Federation and sexy fashion peddler  
Victoria's Secret are among about 30 advertisers who are paying Fox 
television $1.6 million on average for each half-minute Super Bowl 
commercial slot. 
</P>
<P>
	That amounts to an average of $53,333 per commercial second, up  
a hefty 23 percent from last year. This year's National Football 
League title game, being played in Miami, pits the Atlanta Falcons 
against the defending champion, the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is roughly three times the highest-rated TV series in  
prime time, but advertisers are getting a chance to show off before 
TV's biggest audience of the year on a day that resembles a 
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The research firm Eisner &AMP; Associates said its survey of 1,000  
adults last weekend indicates about 7 percent of the audience tunes 
in just to see the ads and more than one-third expect to discuss 
them Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the Super Bowl of football, it's the Super Bowl  
of advertising,'' said Jerry Solomon, who buys commercial time for 
clients of SFM Media. ``Everybody talks about the commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer Inc. will be back in the game for the first time  
in 14 years. The California company is widely credited for making 
the Super Bowl a commercial showcase with its 1984 ad that 
introduced the easy-to-use Macintosh computer to a public baffled 
by complicated machines from rivals. Apple also advertised the 
following year, but has been absent since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Its new ad features the talking computer HAL from ``2001: A  
Space Odyssey'' and is set some time in the future. HAL reminds a 
visitor named Dave that ``computers began to misbehave'' in the 
year 2000, creating a ``global economic disruption'' because they 
were not programmed to recognize the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	But HAL notes Macintosh models alone worked perfectly and asks,  
``You like your Macintosh better than me, don't you, Dave?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A first-time Super Bowl advertiser, the World Wrestling  
Federation, gives a look at a ``typical'' day at its offices. 
Executives pummel each other and bodies crash through glass 
partitions while WWF stars like the Undertaker, the Rock, Sable and 
Stone Cold Steve Austin coolly try to dispel ``misperceptions'' 
about the kind of entertainment WWF matches provide. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Super Bowl novice, Victoria's Secret invites viewers to  
tune in Wednesday for the first Internet telecast of its annual 
spring fashion show. Neither Super Bowl team will be there but 
``you won't care,'' the ad says before showing several models in 
revealing outfits from last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to get women to smile and men to take notice,'' said  
Ed Razek, chief marketing officer for Victoria's Secret, a division 
of Intimate Brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser's Louie the Lizard, the architect of a failed attempt  
to electrocute the Bud frogs on last year's Super Bowl telecast, 
gets a tongue-lashing from the frogs in one of nine ads from 
Anheuser-Busch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based brewer is the single largest advertiser on  
this year's Super Bowl at five minutes and 15 seconds. It 
reportedly paid as much as $2 million per half-minute and will be 
the only brewer on the telecast. The company has declined to reveal 
exactly what it paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Express has an ad that shows what can happen when you  
hire a rival courier -- it shows a hockey crowd screaming for the 
arrival of the Stanley Cup championship trophy only to get a box of 
donkey feed. The cup was shipped by mistake to a rural town in 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other regular advertisers, M&AMP;Ms will introduce a crispy  
variety of its famous candy and Frito-Lay will pitch Cracker Jack 
and new barbecued Doritos. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola has scaled back to two half-minute ads after running  
five last year. Spokesman Jon Harris said the company will debut a 
new theme for its flagship Pepsi brand closer to the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., the biggest soft drink company, is absent as are  
other veterans such as Nike Inc., IBM Corp. and McDonald's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rookies include two Internet job site operators,  
HotJobs.com. Ltd. and TMP Worldwide's Monster.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox is starting pre-game coverage more than seven hours ahead of  
the kickoff and expects to generate a total of $150 million in 
revenue.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses To Be Deposed on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Split along party lines, the  
Republican-controlled Senate voted to recess President Clinton's 
impeachment trial for a week while prosecutors and White House 
lawyers depose Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution adopted by a 54-44 margin late Thursday envisions  
a final vote on the impeachment articles by noon Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions will begin Monday, when House prosecutors and  
President Clinton's lawyers will question Ms. Lewinsky, with one 
senator from each party presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Tuesday and Wednesday, the managers and White House  
attorneys will question Vernon Jordan, a Washington power broker 
and confidant of Clinton, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
It was not immediately known which of the two men would go first. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 hours in advance of each deposition, the Republican  
House managers must provide the president's lawyers copies of all 
exhibits which would be entered into the record during the 
deposition. 
</P>

	The depositions will be videotaped and transcripts made. Those  
records will be confidential until and unless the Senate votes to 
make them public. 
</P>

<P>
	Any objections raised but not resolved during the depositions

<HEADLINE> Nets' Kittles, Seikaly Out 4 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets will be missing  
two key players -- guard Kerry Kittles and backup center Rony 
Seikaly -- when they open the NBA season next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles, the Nets' shooting guard who averaged 17.2 points per  
game last season, decided to rehabilitate his right knee rather 
than undergo surgery for torn cartilage. Coach John Calapari said 
Wednesday night he expected Kittles to be out about four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Kittles' injury was detected before Wednesday's exhibition game  
against the New York Knicks, when the guard complained about his 
knee while having an MRI for back spasms. Kittles had arthroscopic 
surgery on the same knee in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Seikaly, who averaged 13.3 points per game last season, has  
ligament damage in his left ankle and he's expected to be lost for 
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some holes,'' Calipari said Thursday. ``But let me  
tell you every team is the same way. What's good is we have more 
depth than most.''

	Economists Set Gloomy Scenario  
</P>
<P>
	DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Economists set a gloomy scenario of  
further financial turmoil ahead today as world business and 
political leaders began the World Economic Forum. Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology professor Rudiger Dornbusch, an economist 
who had long predicted this month's devaluation of the Brazilian 
real, said South Africa and Turkey could be in line for major 
currency declines. The six-day meeting got off to a faltering start 
after snowstorms delayed the arrivals of Vice President Al Gore, 
German President Roman Herzog and others.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 81.10  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose today as technology shares,  
which had threatened yesterday to end their spectacular run, 
bounced back on announcements of strong earnings, stock splits and 
a merger thrown in for good measure. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed up 81.10 at 9,281.33, failing to make back 
yesterday's 124-point loss. Advancing stocks barely led decliners 
on the NYSE. Still, advances in technology shares pushed broader 
indexes sharply higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 22.20 to 
1265.37, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 70.20 
to 2,477.34.

	Ford To Buy Volvo Division  
</P>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay $6.45 billion for  
Volvo AB's car division, speeding consolidation in the global auto 
industry and expanding Ford's premium brands. Built to last, Volvo 
cars represent safety to many Americans and Europeans. Under the 
agreement announced today, Volvo will retain its commercial truck 
and engine business. It is in talks to merge those operations with 
Sweden's Scania. Ford stock was up 1 15/16 at 62 1/4 today.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yahoo! Inc. is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58  
billion in stock, securing Yahoo!'s position among the dominant 
Internet search and directory services. Today's deal combines 
Yahoo!, the third-largest Internet destination, with No. 5 
GeoCities and could unseat America Online Inc. as the most popular 
starting point for information and services on the World Wide Web. 
Yahoo! stock closed up 31 7/8 at 367 3/4. GeoCities shares gained 42 1/4 to

that will make shares more affordable to investors. Intel, the 
world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales last 
year, said the split takes effect April 11. Intel stock gained 4

	Greenspan in Social Security Warning  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
today that any permanent solution to keep Social Security from 
going broke will almost certainly require increasing taxes or 
cutting benefits. In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, 
Greenspan also repeated his criticism of one element of Clinton's 
plan, having the government invest around $700 billion of Social 
Security money in the stock market. Greenspan said he doubted that 
investment decisions could be insulated from political pressure. On 
the subject of benefit cuts or tax increases, Greenspan said the 
demographics of a huge baby boom generation retiring and fewer 
workers left to support retirees present policy-makers with few 
choices. 

</P>
<P>
	Wages, Benefits Rise 3.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brisk economic growth in 1998 pushed up  
Americans' wages and benefits by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip in 
five years and a slight improvement over 1997. Wages and benefits 
rose 3.3 percent in 1997, 2.9 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 
1995. At the same time, inflation has been decreasing, so workers' 
purchasing power has shown significant gains. 

</P>
<P>
	Durable Goods Orders Rise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said orders to U.S.  
factories for big-ticket durable goods jumped 1.9 percent in 
December to a seasonally adjusted $193 billion, ending a weak year 
on a strong note. For the year, orders for durable goods -- items 
from air conditioners to aircraft expected to last three or more 
years -- rose just 3.5 percent, a marked deceleration from 1997's 
7.1 percent increase. 

</P>
<P>
	AOL Profits Almost Quadruple  
</P>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online stock was higher today  
following yesterday's announcement that quarterly profits nearly 
quadrupled. The nation's largest online service handily beat Wall 
Street expectations with its announcement yesterday that it earned 
$121 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 
6 cents per share, for the same quarter in 1997. AOL stock was up 
8 7/8 at 174 3/8. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical Earnings Down 60 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings  
tumbled 60 percent, hurt by restructuring costs and falling prices 
for chemicals and plastics. But the results came in just above Wall 
Street's expectations. The company reported today that it earned 
$144 million, or 65 cents per share, in the last three months of 
1998, down from $357 million, or $1.55 per share, in the same 
period last year. Sales dropped 8 percent to $4.44 billion from 
$4.80 billion. 

</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Earnings Down 66 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin's fourth-quarter earnings  
dropped 66 percent, the defense contractor reported today. It 
blamed a one-time expense from a subsidiary shutdown and weaker 
space and information technology sales. Net earnings were $125 
million, or 33 cents a share, compared with $371 million, or 91 
cents a share for the fourth quarter of 1997. Revenues fell 9 
percent to $7.18 billion from $7.88 billion.

<P>
	Judge Demands a Microsoft E-Mail  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge who will decide the Microsoft  
antitrust trial ordered the company today to surrender a contested 
e-mail that threatens to undermine one of its legal arguments. The 
internal e-mail from a software engineer in October 1998 explains 
in unprecedented detail some of the ways Microsoft combined its 
Internet browser software into its dominant Windows operating 
system. The government charges the combination amounts to illegal 
``tying'' under federal antitrust law.

<P>
	Hearst May Buy Into Talk Magazine  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hearst Corp., publisher of Good Housekeeping and  
Esquire, is close to becoming a part owner of Talk, the new 
magazine being developed by Miramax Films and former New Yorker 
editor Tina Brown, sources say. Talk's fall debut should generate 
enormous public interest given the celebrity of its founders. 
Hearst would provide expertise in publishing and distributing 
magazines, in addition to financial backing. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: $965M for Job Assistance  
</P>
<P>
	OAKTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton proposed nearly $1 billion  
in new and increased spending today to retrain dislocated workers, 
teach illiterate adults to read and increase job opportunities for 
disadvantaged youth. The president announced the details at a 
training facility jointly run by AT&AMP;T, Lucent Technologies, the 
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood 
of Electrical Workers. Clinton pictured a widening income gap as 
largely a skills gap that must be closed.

	Senate Still Torn Over Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders bargained on terms for the  
testimony of three witnesses in President Clinton's impeachment 
trial today, and Sen. Trent Lott said his aim was a deal that would 
have them questioned in depositions completed by Tuesday. But the 
majority leader said differences remain about what to do next, now 
that the Senate has ordered Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses 
be questioned by House prosecutors. One disagreement was over 
possible videotaping of the closed depositions that will begin the 
witness process. Democrats and the White House object to having 
them videotaped, possibly for replay in the Senate later in the 
trial.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a development that could undermine one of  
Microsoft's legal defenses in its antitrust case, a judge today

had originally been scheduled to die at the same time John Paul was 
visiting the state this week. ``In reaching this decision, I took 
into account the extraordinary circumstances of the pope's request 
and the historical significance of the papal visit to St. Louis and 
the state of Missouri,'' Carnahan, a Baptist, said.

officials said. Employers and the IG Metall union, Germany's 
largest, ended their latest round of contract negotiations today, 
hours before a midnight deadline lifting a no-strike pledge. The 
union is demanding a wage increase and union officials have called 
for ``warning strikes,'' walkouts lasting only a day or even a few 
hours. A deputy head of IG Metall said preparations are continuing 
for a full-scale strike by IG Metall's 2.7 million members.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 81.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock indexes climbed Thursday and the Nasdaq  
composite index set a new high, as strong earnings, stock splits 
and another high-profile Internet merger pulled technology shares 
out of the previous day's funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market is merger driven,'' said Ted Theodore, director of  
research at Avatar Associates, ``and you have this added feature of 
a very good earnings picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 81.10 to 9,281.33. The  
Nasdaq composite surged 70.20 to 2,477.34, beating the previous 
record of 2,433.41 set Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite 
added 22.20 to 1265.37. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow's gain left it 362 points below the record  
9,643.32 set Jan. 8, Wall Street's best-known indicator failed to 
make back Wednesday's 124-point loss. Market analysts also noted 
that advancers barely led decliners on the New York Stock Exchange 
and that Big Board volume, while heavy at 1.03 billion shares, was 
below Wednesday's level. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market leadership is almost entirely technology,'' said  
Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse 
First Boston. ``Market advances can't continue indefinitely when 
most of the strength is in one group. It either has to broaden out 
or step back and regroup, because the leadership is way too 
narrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, technology shares staged a ferocious recovery from  
Wednesday's swoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks led the charge, as Internet search service  
Yahoo! announced it is buying GeoCities Inc. for $5.02 billion in 
stock. Yahoo! shares soared 31 7/8 to 367 3/4, and GeoCities shares shot 
up 42 1/4 to 117 1/4, both in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, another Internet stock, rose 8 15/16 to 174 7/16  
in leading volume on the Big Board. The online service provider 
beat analysts' earnings estimates and announced a two-for-one stock 
split after the close of trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel rose 4 7/16 to 137 3/16 in leading Nasdaq volume, after  
the software company announced its own two-for-one split Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks also boosted the market. Eli Lilly shares rose 1 1/2 to  
92 1/4 after it announced strong earnings and authorized a $1 billion 
stock-repurchase program. And competitor Pfizer, capitalizing on 
the current craze for stock splits, advanced 5 5/8 to 127 9/16 after 
the company said its board would vote on a three-for-one stock 
split in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Ford Motor Co. said it will buy the  
automotive operations of Sweden's AB Volvo for $6.45 billion. 
Ford's shares rose 2 3/16 to 62 1/2. Volvo's American depositary 
receipts declined 13/16 to 26 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also helped higher by a recovery in bank stocks.  
Hit hard Wednesday by trouble in Brazil, they recovered Thursday as 
the Brazilian real and stock market stabilized. Citigroup rose 1 
11/16 to 55 1/2, and J.P. Morgan added 4 5/16 to 104 3/8. Both are Dow 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Labor Department reported that while  
Americans' wages and benefits rose last year by 3.4 percent, the 
fastest clip in five years, the growth in labor costs cooled in the 
fourth quarter. That was encouraging news for investors worried 
that wage pressures could prove inflationary and prompt the Federal 
Reserve to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Another positive was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's  
testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, in which he said 
that, for now, the United States is an ``oasis'' of prosperity in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan repeated his earlier criticism of President Clinton's  
proposal that the government invest some Social Security funds in 
stocks, saying such a move would subject the fund to political 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors hadn't made much of the proposal, announced  
earlier this month in Clinton's State of the Union address, and 
didn't have much reaction Thursday to Greenspan's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Wall Street action, the NYSE composite index rose 7.32  
to 595.40, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 
6.74 to 713.93. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose up 
2.85 to 423.97. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei index in Tokyo dropped 0.75  
percent. European stock markets were mixed, with the DAX index in 
Frankfurt ending up 1.49 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London off 0.16 
percent, and the CAC in Paris up 0.66 percent.

percent from the current 16.8 percent, Fuji spokesman Hiroshi 
Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes after Fuji, one of Japan's largest banks,  
teamed up with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank late last year to merge their 
trust banking operations, with plans to take over Yasuda Trust's 
asset management business. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuda Trust and Banking, Japan's fourth largest trust bank, has  
been struggling to write off a pile of bad debts incurred through 
the collapse of the speculative ``bubble economy'' of late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's move rounds out an elaborate rescue plan for the  
cash-strapped bank, which belongs to the Fuji Bank-led Fuyo 
business group. 
</P>
<P>
	To support its investment in Yasuda Trust, Fuji Bank is  
reportedly planning to up its request for government funds 
earmarked to strengthen the ailing financial system from 700 
billion ($6.1 billion) to 1 trillion yen ($8.8 billion).

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of the Pope's Homily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts of the prepared text of Pope John Paul II's homily  
Wednesday at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis, as provided by the 
Archdiocese of St. Louis: 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Three hundred years have passed since December 8, 1698, when  
the holy sacrifice of the Mass was offered for the first time in 
what is now the city of St. Louis. ... These three centuries have 
been a history of God's love poured out in this part of the United 
States, and a history of generous response to that love.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As the new evangelization unfolds, it must include a special  
emphasis on the family and the renewal of Christian marriage. In 
their primary mission of communicating love to each other, of being 
co-creators with God of human life, and of transmitting the love of 
God to their children, parents must know that they are fully 
supported by the Church and by society. ... As the family goes, so 
goes the nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As believers, how can we fail to see that abortion, euthanasia  
and assisted suicide are a terrible rejection of Gods gift of life 
and love? And as believers, how can we fail to feel the duty to 
surround the sick and those in distress with the warmth of our 
affection and the support that will help them always to embrace 
life?'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The new evangelization calls for followers of Christ who are  
unconditionally pro-life: who will proclaim, celebrate and serve 
the gospel of life in every situation. A sign of hope is the 
increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be 
taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. 
Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without 
definitively denying criminals the chance to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As the new millennium approaches, there remains another great  
challenge facing this community of St. Louis, east and west of the 
Mississippi, and not St. Louis alone, but the whole country: to put 
an end to every form of racism, a plague which your bishops have 
called one of the most persistent and destructive evils of the 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Christ is seeking you out and inviting you back to the  
community of faith. Is this not the moment for you to experience 
the joy of returning to the Father's house?''

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Vs. Jimmy Dean Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A man confronted by a shotgun-toting Jimmy  
Dean after pulling into his driveway to ask directions dropped a 
lawsuit against the sausage king. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Dean and Christopher J. Dallaglio requested Tuesday's  
dismissal of the $125,000 case. A trial last summer ended in a 
deadlocked jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic frivolous suit which should never have been  
brought to court, and it did so because I am a high-profile 
celebrity,'' Dean said in a statement released by his sausage 
company, Jimmy Dean Foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallaglio claimed that Dean, a country crooner, leveled a  
shotgun at him, told him it was loaded and ordered him to get off 
his property during a snowstorm in January 1996. Dean denied 
pointing the gun at Dallaglio.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Quotes from Super Bowl players and coaches  
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	``Shannon looks like a horse. I'll tell you, that's an ugly dude  
... You can't tell me he doesn't look like Mr. Ed.'' -- Falcons 
cornerback Ray Buchanan, firing the first salvo at Broncos tight 
end Shannon Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray said that? Well, I think he's ugly, but did I ever call  
him that? No. Tell Ray to put the eyeliner, the lipstick and the 
high heels away. I'm not saying he's a cross-dresser; that's just 
what I heard.'' -- Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at it as being stars. We look at it as having  
good football players who know how to win.'' -- Broncos fullback 
Howard Griffith on the team's image. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's awesome. He plays the game the way you want to  
play the game, and I'm talking about the dirty stuff, too. He's a 
throwback player. I'm sorry if some of the things he does or says 
offends people, but that's football. That's the kind of football I 
grew up watching. They don't help you up, they kick you.'' -- 
Falcons running back Jamal Anderson on Denver linebacker Bill 
Romanowski. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The silence was deafening. He comes in and I got a nervous  
stomach. You're nervous for him and shaky, and you know what he's 
been through. You look up to him all year. He's the rock the team 
has depended on. To see him so vulnerable like that, I was just 
proud of the way the team rallied around that.'' -- Falcons center 
Robbie Tobeck on coach Dan Reeves' return to the team from heart 
surgery in December. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be some struggles later on in life, but those  
are the choices I made. For me, this adversity and these injuries 
and the things that have happened to me have helped mold me into 
the person I am, the husband and the father I am. I wouldn't trade 
that for the world.'' -- Broncos guard Mark Schlereth on the 
injuries he's had, including 17 knee surgeries.

kind of scary sometimes.'' -- Broncos placekicker Jason Elam on his 
hobby and his job. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is so much bigger than me, as far as being a veteran  
player on this squad. This is about all the former players that 
played here in Atlanta, with all the support and all the calls I 
got from a lot of former players who never had an opportunity to 
experience this. This is for the city of Atlanta. They've been 
waiting so long for this.'' -- Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle on 
his Super Bowl mission. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	``All year long we played against teams who may not have won as  
many ballgames as us. But when we stepped on the field, we knew 
they had the potential to beat us.'' -- Broncos safety Steve Atwater 
on Atlanta being a seven-point underdog.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Finally Learn How To Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- What was the lowest point for the Atlanta Falcons  
on the road to the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the time they named Pat Peppler as interim coach,  
apparently overlooking one, minor point: He was a front-office type 
who really didn't know the first thing about coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had nine games left in the season, and you at least wanted  
a fair chance in the fight,'' recalled Tommy Nobis, a linebacker 
with that 1976 team. ``But we went to bat for those last nine games 
with an unloaded gun. It was a really disastrous time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But hardly unusual for the Falcons, who entered the league in  
1966 and spent more than three decades trying to find their wings. 
A more appropriate nickname would have been ``Vultures,'' since 
those ravenous creatures always seemed to be circling overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from Georgia, pretty much lived in Georgia my whole  
life,'' said Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe, reminiscing about his 
home-state team this week. ``I never liked the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was there to like about them? They lost all the time. If  
you had a pair of cleats when they were at Fulton County (Stadium), 
they'd put you in the ball game, they were getting beat so bad. For 
20 bucks, you could sit in the luxury box with the owner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team that will meet the Broncos in Sunday's Super Bowl had  
defied the odds during its 33-year history, somehow managing to 
avoid back-to-back winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	If Green Bay is Titletown USA, Atlanta has been the Comedy  
Central of the NFL landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after the Peppler fiasco, having learned absolutely  
nothing during the preceding years, the Falcons fired Dan Henning 
and discovered that no one else would deign to coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, since there's an unwritten rule that every team must have  
a coach, the Falcons turned the job over to Marion Campbell, 
probably adding a blindfold and cigarette as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, wasn't this the same guy who had been fired by the Falcons  
10 years earlier -- and replaced by Peppler! Well, yes, but it was 
hard to overlook Campbell's sterling record in his first stint with 
the Falcons: six wins, 19 losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell picked up his pace the second time around, winning 11  
of 43 games before deciding -- with three weeks left in the 1989 
season -- he'd rather go fishing than coach the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swamp Fox's retirement meant one less person in  
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for the final game that year. On a 
frosty Christmas Eve, 7,792 last-minute shoppers apparently got 
lost of their way to the mall, comprising the smallest crowd in 
team history. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Jessie Tuggle was on the field that day. The senior  
member of the Falcons with a dozen, mostly losing seasons, Tuggle 
was accustomed to being teased when he went to the mall, taunted 
when he stopped at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jessie, I can't believe you're still with the Falcons,'' they  
would say. ``Why don't you leave? You'd be such a great linebacker 
with anybody else. You'd be a household name if you played anywhere 
else. The Falcons are never going to do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For team president Taylor Smith, whose family has owned the  
franchise throughout its existence, the nadir came during a tragic, 
14-month period in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback David Croudip died from a cocaine overdose. Lineman  
Ralph Norwood and tight end Brad Beckman were killed in separate 
car wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like every week we were burying somebody,'' Smith  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few good times for the Falcons prior to this  
season. Under Leeman Bennett, they made the playoffs three times in 
five years, including their first NFC West championship in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that season is remembered for a crushing defeat. The  
Cowboys rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to 
stun the Falcons 30-27 in the divisional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a dream to win a championship, to be in a  
championship game,'' said Smith, who was 13 years old when the 
Falcons entered the league. ``Have there been times when I wondered 
if we'd ever make it. Yes, a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' fate might have been altered if Rankin Smith had  
landed his first choice for coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand he was real close to bringing Paul Brown in,''  
Taylor Smith said. ``From what I've heard, we were pretty much down 
the road to getting it done. What happened to that, I really don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Falcons wound up with the Curse of Norb Hecker, a  
totally forgettable first coach who didn't even make it through the 
third season, fading into obscurity with an un-Brown-like 4-26-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Hecker was followed by Norm Van Brocklin, Campbell, Peppler,  
Bennett, Henning, Campbell (again), Jim Hanifan, Jerry Glanville, 
June Jones and, finally, Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Bennett (46-41) and Reeves (21-9, plus 2-0 in this year's  
playoffs) have managed winning records in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves first talked with the Falcons about a head coaching job  
in 1977. He was only 33 years old, but still wise enough to be 
scared off by a team that practiced part time at a city park and 
had a weight room with a dirt floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, the Falcons finally landed their man, but  
only after he guided the Broncos to three Super Bowls. Who knows 
what might have been if he'd picked the Falcons in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously,'' Smith said, a tinge of sadness in his voice,  
``our history would have been a lot different, I'm sure.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Up; Corn Mixed; Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures advanced early today on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, while corn futures were mixed and soybeans 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures moved higher amid continued concern about warm,  
dry weather in some winter wheat growing regions. Such weather 
leaves crops emerging from winter dormancy vulnerable to a 
late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures retreated as beneficial rain continued to fall  
in competing South American growing regions and amid disappointing 
weekly export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures traded both sides, tugged higher by the strength in  
wheat and a lack of farmer selling of stored crops, but pressured 
by the beneficial weather in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.74 3/4 a bushel; March  
corn was unchanged at $2.15 1/2 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.06 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 3/4 cent to $5.12 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced, while pork was mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .18 cent to 62.15 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .10 cent to 72.75 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell .65 cent to 40.15 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
rose .23 cent to 54.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Boosts Military Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen,  
seeking to boost public support for the military and its 
turn-of-the-century missions, said today that Americans have a 
``moral obligation'' to make life better for the men and women in 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never pay them enough but we can pay them more,'' Cohen  
said in a speech to the Illinois House of Representatives, the 
first in a series of nontraditional audiences the defense secretary 
said he intends to address this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, Cohen thinks he needs to sell America on its  
military, which has shrunk by about one-third since the Cold War 
ended a decade ago. Yet, the force is feeling enormous strains from 
duties ranging from air patrols and occasional bombing in Iraq, to 
peacekeeping in Bosnia, humanitarian relief operations most 
recently in hurricane-ravaged Central America and normal training. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen urged support for President Clinton's proposed 4.4 percent  
across-the-board pay raise for military personnel as an expression 
of appreciation for the sacrifices they make. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to retain high-quality service members ...,'' Cohen  
said, ``we have got to give them a satisfactory quality of life. It 
is a moral obligation, but is no less a practical necessity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also spelled out the administration's rationale for asking  
Congress for a $112 billion increase in defense spending over the 
next six years, which he called the first sustained increase in 
military spending in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preserving our security tomorrow means we have to make some  
prudent investments today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the administration needs broad public support to push  
Congress to approve future rounds of military base closings. He 
said savings from two more rounds of base closings would reach $20 
billion -- money better spent on training and equipping troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides members of the General Assembly, invited to Cohen's  
address were military figures, including high-level officers from 
Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., and the Navy's 
basic training site at Great Lakes, Ill. Also appearing: the 
parents of Navy Lt. Katie Boyce, a Chatham, Ill., native who is a 
supply officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, which 
last week moved into the Adriatic Sea to put muscle behind NATO's 
threat to use force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With the private-sector economy booming and young Americans  
having less contact with a shrinking population of combat veterans, 
the military is having a hard time attracting -- and keeping -- 
qualified recruits with an interest in making a career of military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	A statistical yardstick the military uses in measuring young  
people's potential interest in serving -- known as ``propensity to 
join'' -- has declined through much of the 1990s. For the Army, it 
fell from about 17 percent in 1991 to 11 percent in 1997, and the 
Air Force saw a drop in that period from 16 percent to 12 percent. 
More than half of young people surveyed say they would never join 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Cohen is a little worried about the recruiting and  
retention trends,'' his spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Wednesday. 
One remedy Cohen sees is for him and other senior defense officials 
such as the civilian chiefs of the military services to spend more 
time talking to nontraditional audiences. Army Secretary Louis 
Caldera already has made that a staple of his domestic travel 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Under consideration are Cohen speeches to another state  
legislature and addresses to local civic groups or schools, Bacon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks all Americans ought to have a connection to the  
military'' -- if not by serving, then by recognizing what the 
military does for the United States at a time few people see 
dangers of war, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also is pitching the idea of closing more military bases  
that the Pentagon says are not needed and are a drain on its 
resources. Congress each of the past two years has rejected Cohen's 
plea to authorize more base closings; this time he plans a more 
aggressive approach to selling the idea, aides say. He is casting 
it as a way the Defense Department can economize, even as it spends 
more on troops.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There were moments of ecumenical goodwill during Pope John Paul  
II's pilgrimage to Mexico City and St. Louis. But he provoked 
Protestant dismay when the trip's major pronouncement addressed 
non-Catholic ``sects'' and the trouble they are causing. 
</P>
<P>
	To Protestants, especially in Latin America, ``sect'' is a  
four-letter word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say frankly, I wish he had not used the word,'' says  
the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus of First Things magazine, a Catholic 
who rarely finds flaws in the pope. In his new book ``Appointment 
in Rome,'' Neuhaus tells about lobbying against the S-word as a 
delegate at the pope's 1997 Synod of America. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pontiff's ``apostolic exhortation'' on synod themes,  
issued in Mexico, insists on the word and includes a significant 
four-paragraph section on ``the challenge of the sects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the pope has a mean bone in his body,'' said one  
Protestant, the Rev. Cecil Robeck, Jr., of California's Fuller 
Theological Seminary. ``But I fear, yes, fear, what this could 
mean.'' He thinks in Latin America the text could be applied 
indiscriminately against non-Catholics who are aggressive about 
evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America has seen severe localized conflicts between the  
recently arrived Pentecostal evangelists and the long-established 
Catholic Church, with accusations of misconduct on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Robeck was particularly concerned that the pope's thinking does  
not reflect a thoughtful accord on Protestant evangelism in 
Catholic countries, eight years in the making, which was issued 
last year by an international Catholic-Pentecostal dialogue group. 
Robeck is the Pentecostal co-chairman of those negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not John Paul's best statement,'' remarked the Rev.  
Gerald Anderson of the Overseas Mission Study Center in New Haven, 
Conn., a onetime Methodist missionary to a Catholic land, the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Timothy George, a seminary president in the Southern  
Baptist Convention, which sends missionaries across Latin America, 
insists that denominations like his that teach orthodox doctrine 
simply cannot be considered sects. ``We are part of the one, holy, 
catholic and apostolic church.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sect'' doesn't rank up there with ``cult'' as a religious  
slur, but it's unquestionably loaded. Partly this is a matter of 
size and status. Webster's says the word applies especially to ``a 
small group'' that breaks from ``an established church.'' 
Protestantism did break away, but centuries later is well 
established and no longer small. Not even in many Latin American 
lands -- which is why Latin American Catholics are so edgy. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, most Catholic  
leaders have been diplomatic in talking about Protestants. But 
Latin American Catholic bishops still speak of sects instead of 
Protestant churches, and the pope picked up their language. During 
a previous Latin American tour he characterized non-Catholic 
soul-hunters as ``ravenous wolves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protestant commentators say the pope's latest statement is  
confused. He speaks fondly of ``the sisters and brothers'' in 
separated churches that have ``true though imperfect communion'' 
with Rome. He also mentions ``new religious groups,'' which may or 
may not refer to non-Christians. So then, Anderson would like to 
know, ``Who are the sects? What defines a sect?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope seems to say that sects are those that practice  
``proselytism,'' which he defines as evangelism that is unfair, 
deceptive or coercive. But Robeck said he and other Pentecostals 
likewise denounce such tactics. George noted that the pope, who 
often champions religious freedom, avoided that principle when he 
talked about sectarian evangelists. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate arises at a problematic time for the Vatican's  
overall strategy toward other Christians. George Weigel, author of 
a forthcoming biography of Pope John Paul II, said there's no doubt 
the pontiff's biggest disappointment is the lack of progress toward 
unity with the Eastern Orthodox, especially their silence about the 
1995 papal encyclical on ecumenism, ``Et Unum Sint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To judge from the December assembly of the World Council of  
Churches, Rome's engagement with the moderate to liberal 
``Mainline'' Protestants and Anglicans is similarly dead in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the conservative Protestants usually known as  
Evangelicals, including Pentecostalists. Missionary statistician 
David Barrett of Richmond, Va., estimates that as a whole these 
groups now outnumber the Protestants in the World Council orbit. 
This fourth branch of Christianity, which energetically trolls for 
converts among nominal but inactive Catholics, is ecumenism's wild 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuhaus has devoted years to leading a U.S. ``Evangelicals and  
Catholics Together'' project alongside Charles Colson, the 
Watergate felon turned prison evangelist. Consequently, Neuhaus 
sees possibilities for Catholic-Evangelical concord where others 
see only obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	What strikes him about the pope's words in Mexico is this: ``He  
says the gist of the discussion is the failure of the Catholic 
Church. Why are these people susceptible? Why are these other 
churches growing and especially in Latin America? It's one thing to 
complain, often with justice, but the lesson to be drawn is that we 
have not done our job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pope declared that, among other things, Catholicism needs  
closer pastoral touch with its people (a tall order with Latin 
America's dire priest shortage), better sermons and its own 
evangelistic initiatives. He concluded with a plea to ``move from a 
faith of habit, sustained perhaps by social context alone, to a 
faith which is conscious and personally lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentecostalist Robeck, Methodist Anderson and Baptist George  
couldn't have agreed more.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Faces Close Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- On the eve of the Nagano Winter Olympics, Juan  
Antonio Samaranch bragged about the success and health of the 
Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something isn't broken, don't fix it,'' he said. ``The  
Olympic movement is in very good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Samaranch is besieged with calls for his  
resignation. Many blame him for the worst corruption scandal in 
Olympic history, which has prompted the expulsion or forced 
resignation of nine International Olympic Committee members 
implicated in misconduct in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard was appointed IOC president in 1980 and  
is the third longest-serving behind American Avery Brundage, who 
served from 1952-72, and Pierre de Coubertin, the French baron who 
founded the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	When Samaranch took over in 1980, the Olympic movement had been  
hit by terrorism, was facing bankruptcy and was brought to its 
knees by the catastrophic boycott of the 1980 Summer Games in 
Moscow by the United States, Canada and 52 other nations and 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
	A former diplomat, he used quiet diplomacy and his skills as a  
businessman to turn the Olympics into the most prestigious sporting 
event in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is credited with building the games into a  
multibillion-dollar industry, largely based on lucrative TV rights 
deals and the fierce competition among cities to land them. 
</P>
<P>
	With success has also come criticism about the rampant  
commercialism of the games. Samaranch has been characterized as a 
despot ruling over an inherently undemocratic, self-appointed body 
that lacks the normal financial controls of a multinational 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the IOC is incapable of policing itself, suggesting  
that Samaranch's greatest legacy to the Olympics would be his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not thinking of any kind of resignation,'' he has said,  
adding there wasn't ``a single'' call within the IOC for him to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to his authoritarian image, Samaranch describes himself  
as ``the conductor'' who delegates to the 11-member IOC executive 
board. ``I'm not the boss,'' he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is a small, shy man, visibly uncomfortable in the  
public spotlight. He's the IOC's first full-time executive and the 
first to live full time in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC's 
headquarters. He receives no salary, although he has said the next 
IOC president should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC pays the rent on a small hotel suite in Lausanne, which  
costs $220 a day when he's there and $72 when he's away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a rich man,'' Samaranch said. ``I am a normal man. My  
style of life is the same for many, many years. I have no yachts. I 
have no planes. I have no cars, luxury cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC executive board member Richard Pound described his lifestyle  
as ``practically monastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former boxer and roller hockey goalie who never competed for  
an Olympic medal, Samaranch grew up in Barcelona, Spain, as the son 
of a wealthy textile magnate. He still holds the honorary title of 
president of the Barcelona-based La Caixa, Spain's largest savings 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed an IOC member in 1966 and came to the  
presidency after three years as Spain's ambassador to the 
then-Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of his tenure came in 1992 when Barcelona played  
host to what's considered the most successful Summer Games of all 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	A low moment came earlier in the same year with the publication  
of the book ``The Lords of the Rings,'' which charged the Olympic 
movement with being corrupt, undemocratic and consumed by 
commercialism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
	The book recounted Samaranch's rise through Spain's political  
ranks during the 36-year rule of dictator Francisco Franco, and 
describes him as a ``dedicated Francoist'' who supported Franco's 
conglomeration of right-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch called the book full of ``lies'' and ``mistakes.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The people of Spain know very well that I was collaborating  
with the Franco regime, like many others,'' he added. ``We are very 
proud of what we did. We went from the Franco regime to a full 
democracy in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, said the book gave him a reason to run for another  
term. He was re-elected in 1993, and in 1995 IOC members raised the 
retirement age, which cleared the way for him to run again. He was 
re-elected in 1997 and has vowed to stay until his term ends in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	He has appointed 94 IOC members. The body had 115 members,  
including Samaranch, before the nine resigned or were expelled. Of 
the 14 implicated in the scandal, Samaranch appointed eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch will put his leadership to a vote of confidence at a  
special IOC session March 17-18. Only if he fails to get the 
members' endorsement will he resign, Samaranch said. The chances of 
that are remote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certain the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis  
stronger than ever,'' Samaranch said.

<HEADLINE>  Fourth IOC Member Quits in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- The IOC is down another member.  
</P>
<P>
	A fourth International Olympic Committee member implicated in  
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal resigned Wednesday, three days 
after he was accused of accepting payments arranged by the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya's Charles Mukora, one of six IOC members facing expulsion,  
proclaimed his innocence even as he quit. The IOC said Mukora, 64, 
received $34,650, but he said the cash was for ``sports development 
in Kenya'' and ``world youth sporting activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been party to any improper dealings in the last  
40 years I have been involved as a volunteer in Kenyan sports and 
sports management or as an IOC member,'' Mukora, an IOC member 
since 1990, said. ``The monies that I am alleged to have received 
as regards to Salt Lake City were monies paid towards the 
establishment of high altitude training camps in Nanyuki, and I 
have not used the monies for my personal use or personal purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was an innocent victim of circumstances. However, the  
president of the International Olympic Committee has advised us to 
tender our resignations before March 17-18 in order to put these 
allegations to rest. I have decided therefore to accept his advice 
on principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Sibandze of Swaziland, Libya's Bashir Mohammed Attarabulsi  
and Finland's Pirjo Haeggman had previously quit, and five others 
have been essentially ousted pending a formal IOC vote in 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	The others facing expulsion are Lamine Keita of Mali,  
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed 
Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador and Sergio 
Santander of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Santander said Wednesday he did nothing wrong and will not  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to resign as a member of the IOC,'' said  
Santander, who also is president of the Chilean Olympic Committee. 
``There are no cowards in my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands received a warning and  
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, Kim Un-Yong of South Korea 
and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia remain under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said president Juan Antonio Samaranch ``complimented Mr.  
Mukora for taking the honorable path'' and called for others ``to 
follow Mr. Mukora's lead and tender their resignations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation concluded Keita ``knowingly permitted''  
Salt Lake City bidders to make payments totaling more than $97,000 
from 1993-97 to support his son at the University of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a fighter by nature, not someone who resigns,'' Keita was  
quoted as telling the Swiss daily Le Matin. ``I'm going to defend 
myself. The statutes give us the right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze, who resigned Friday, said he believed there was  
nothing wrong with his son receiving $100,000 in scholarships and 
living expenses from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Universities in the United States give scholarships all the  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he also received numerous gifts, including  
paintings and sculptures, from the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee 
while it was wooing IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sibandze said he knew there was a $150 limit on the total amount  
of gifts an IOC member could receive from a city, but added: ``I 
never asked about the value of a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not my intent to let the IOC expel me,'' Sibandze said.  
``That's the manner in which the IOC has approached these problems. 
I resigned in the interests of my country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov maintained his innocence and said the scandal stemmed  
from increased commercialization of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more money is involved in big sports, the bigger is the  
temptation to touch them,'' the 63-year-old Russian said in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was asked by the  
investigators to explain his request for free medical treatment for 
former Soviet hockey star Alexander Ragulin and his receipt of a 
Browning rifle from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the IOC member from Ecuador facing expulsion, denied  
accepting bribes. He told the newspaper El Comercio it would be 
``cowardly'' to resign and it would be an ``admission that I had 
done something of which I am innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other Olympic developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Officials in Turin, Italy, and Zakopane, Poland, both trying to  
win the 2006 Winter Games, oppose the rule changes in bidding for 
future sites. The IOC recommends a ban on visits by IOC members and 
wants a 15-member panel to choose the host. The Turin and Zakopane 
groups say this puts first-time bidders at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--Organizers of the 2004 Athens Games said staging the Olympics  
permanently in Greece as a scandal-stopping move ``isn't the 
answer.'' Constantine Bakouris, managing director of the 2004 
Games, said it would be ``very difficult to deprive the other 
countries of organizing'' the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Federal investigators scrutinizing the scandal are searching  
for evidence to bring a case in which both bribers and recipients 
could be charged, federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors and agents are looking at mail and wire  
fraud and conspiracy statutes and a racketeering law to prosecute 
what they initially see as a case of commercial bribery, rather 
than the more familiar government variety, according to Justice 
Department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal inquiry is in a very early stage -- months from key  
decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. A Utah ethics panel also is not close to wrapping up its 
investigation, which has a self-imposed deadline of Feb. 11.

<HEADLINE> Amgen's 4Q Earnings Up 33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amgen's fourth-quarter earnings surged 33  
percent thanks to accelerating sales of its franchise anemia drug 
Epogen, helping the biotech giant beat Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousand Oaks, Calif. based-Amgen earned $239 million in the  
three months ended Dec. 31, or 90 cents per share, compared with 
earnings of $180 million, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of analysts by First Call Corp. had projected earnings  
of 84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter sales increased 23 percent to $695 million from  
$564 million a year ago -- in large part to the success of Epogen, 
which comprises half of Amgen's total sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Epogen sales rose 35 percent to $391 million in the quarter, and  
19 percent to $1.38 billion for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen, the nation's largest biotechnology company, also  
announced a two-for-one split of the company's common stock in the 
form of a 100 percent stock dividend. The dividend will be 
distributed on Feb. 26 to stockholders of record on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen's stock has risen steadily since mid-December when an  
arbitrator ruled the company owns the exclusive rights to its 
next-generation anemia drug to succeed Epogen, while rejecting 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson's demand that it be allowed marketing rights on 
the product that is expected to win U.S. approval in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Epogen was created by Amgen in the early 1980s and is now one of  
the top-selling drugs in the world. The drug fights anemia, a 
common and serious problem in patients with failing kidneys, cancer 
patients undergoing chemotherapy, and other surgical patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Amgen rose $3.68 3/4 to $119.56 1/4 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. Amgen released its earnings report after the market 
had closed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Amgen earned $863 million or $3.27 per share, compared  
to $644 million or $2.35 a share a year ago. Total sales for 1998 
were $2.5 billion, a 13 percent increase from the $2.2 billion in 
1997 sales.

<HEADLINE> Dan Reeves Is Home Town Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- Those perennial losers 115 miles to the  
north never drew much interest here, where folks didn't get excited 
about the Atlanta Falcons until their hometown hero became coach. 
</P>
<P>
	People in Americus, a town of 16,500 in the southwestern Georgia  
peanut belt, have followed Dan Reeves' career since he played 
quarterback at Americus High. They rooted for him as a player at 
South Carolina and with the Dallas Cowboys, then as coach with the 
Denver Broncos and New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	They were happy with his success before, but now that he has  
taken the home-state team to the Super Bowl, they are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``Falcon Fever'' banner hangs over the entrance to City Hall,  
and ``Dirty Bird'' merchandise is in nearly every store window. 
Municipal employees plan to wear Falcons T-shirts to work Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Denham, an Americus insurance agent, bought season tickets  
for the Falcons after Reeves took over the long-suffering team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't fathom the Falcons in the Super Bowl,'' Denham  
said. ``But he (Reeves) just instantly brought class and 
credibility to the whole organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve James, browsing in the Winn-Dixie supermarket that had a  
``Dan's the Man'' sign in the window, withstood years of Falcons 
ineptitude before Reeves became coach in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting all my life for this,'' said James, of  
nearby Ellaville. ``I watched them when they were down and out. 
When they got Dan Reeves, I told a friend, `Give him three years 
and he'll make something out of the Falcons.' It took only two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' 82-year-old mother, Ann, and some cousins still live in  
the area. Reeves, 54, hasn't lived here for years, but -- even when 
he was in New York -- he never lost the drawl or manners that he 
picked up in south Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	And many locals credit the area's strong tradition of youth  
football for the success of Reeves and another Americus native, 
Chan Gailey, who led the Cowboys into the playoffs this season in 
his first year as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey and Reeves both played quarterback for former Americus  
High coach Jimmy Hightower, 69, who said Reeves had a coach's 
attitude when he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a student of the game,'' Hightower said. ``He wanted to  
know why we did things. He studied the scouting reports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves married his high school sweetheart, Pam, who was a  
cheerleader when he was the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	At The Home Place, a furniture store and antique shop run by two  
of Reeves' cousins, Jo Evelyn Bone and Sue Brewer, well-wishers 
signed a banner that will be delivered to the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The cousins recalled that Reeves was even competitive as a child  
in family football games played in a cow pasture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loses his temper, but he's not a nasty competitor,'' Bone  
said . ``He's competitive where it comes to getting the job done, 
but he never expects more of others than he's willing to give 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people in town were disappointed when Reeves was fired by  
the Broncos in 1992, in part because of a feud with quarterback 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could go to Miami, I'd slap Elway's face,'' an elderly  
woman shopping at the furniture store said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hightower said Reeves has always had the ability to concentrate  
on the game, and not let off-the-field problems bother him. He 
believes it was Reeves' willpower that enabled him to return to the 
sidelines earlier this month, less than a month after undergoing 
heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The football game is the big thing for him,'' he said. ``Dan  
is a strong-willed person -- mentally and physically tough. He 
doesn't like to lose at anything. He's the toughest competitor in 
my 35 years of coaching.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Profits Up 367 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- Second-quarter earnings for America Online  
Inc. nearly quadrupled as the nation's largest online service 
handily beat Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL said Wednesday that it earned $121 million, or 22 cents per  
share, compared with $33 million, or 6 cents per share, for the 
same quarter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was up 62 percent to $960 million, compared with $592  
million last year. In the three-month period ended Dec. 31, AOL 
added 1.6 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock jumped 5 percent, and was up $8.31 1/4 at  
$173.81 1/4 a share in afternoon trading today on the New York Stock 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The net earnings figures include an accounting adjustment that  
allowed the company to deduct past losses from its tax bill, which 
raised net income. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including the adjustment, AOL earned $88 million, or 17  
cents per share. That was well above expectations of analysts 
surveyed by First Call Corp. who had predicted AOL would earn 14 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which has more than 15 million subscribers, plus 2 million  
with its subsidiary CompuServe, is planning to buy Netscape 
Communications Corp. for $4.2 billion in a deal expected to close 
this spring. The Netscape browser site draws 20 million visitors 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1998, the Internet truly came of age and became even more  
integral to people's everyday lives,'' said Steve Case, chairman 
and chief executive officer. ``We're excited about the 
opportunities presented by our pending combination with Netscape as 
well as our alliance with Sun Microsystems to drive the growth of 
this new medium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the quarter, the company launched AOL in Australia in a  
joint venture with Bertelsmann AG and announced a joint venture 
with the Cisneros Group to develop and market AOL services for 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from customers' online fees grew 61 percent to $779  
million. Revenues from advertising and online transactions rose 66 
percent to $181 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended Dec. 31, earnings rose 256 percent to  
$228 million, or 41 cents per share, from $64 million, or 13 cents 
per share, in the last half of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Wednesday a 2-for-1 stock split to  
take effect on Feb. 22. It is the sixth split since the company 
went public in March 1992. The most recent split was Nov. 17.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged in Pregnant Mom Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A woman accused of luring a pregnant  
mother to her death has been charged with two counts of murder, 
making her eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Josefina Sonia Saldana, 40, was the last person to see Margarita  
Flores alive in September, police said. She was arrested a week 
later on kidnapping charges after police learned she had brought a 
dead fetus to the hospital the day after Ms. Flores disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have not released the cause of death of the fetus,  
but tests showed it did not belong to Ms. Flores. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Saldana was scheduled to be arraigned today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Flores, a 40-year-old mother of five, was more than eight  
months pregnant when she was reported missing Sept. 14. Police said 
she left home with a woman posing as a charity worker who had 
promised free baby furniture and a year's worth of diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Serafin Rodarte, a farmworker who rented a backyard cottage from  
Ms. Saldana, reported seeing a body on her property. The body had 
vanished by the time police were informed and Rodarte hanged 
himself a few days after officers interviewed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month later, parts of Ms. Flores' body were found in  
the trash in Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-degree murder charges -- one for Ms. Flores, one for  
her 8-month-old fetus -- were filed Wednesday against Ms. Saldana. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge appointed her a new lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodarte left suicide notes that only declared his innocence and  
contained farewells to his family. Police were not sure how, if at 
all, he was connected to Ms. Flores' slaying.

<HEADLINE>  Steve DeBerg Just Keeps Going... </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Elway was a rookie when he first met Steve  
DeBerg, the player he would soon replace as Denver's starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was what, six or seven years in the league?'' said Elway,  
who at 38 is expected to retire after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was an ancient. Now I feel ancient.''  
</P>
<P>
	So who will be standing on the opposite side of the field when  
Elway and the Broncos take on Atlanta in Sunday's game? 
</P>
<P>
	None other than Steve DeBerg, who, at 45, is the backup  
quarterback for the Falcons as well as a quasi-coach, play-caller 
and instructor to Chris Chandler, the starting QB. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg is famous for being displaced by famous quarterbacks --  
Elway in Denver, Joe Montana in San Francisco and Kansas City, and 
Steve Young and Vinny Testaverde in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The first coach to start him, Bill Walsh, once said of him:  
``He's just good enough to get you beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, DeBerg is ninth on the all-time list for  
completions and on Oct. 25, 1998, became the oldest quarterback to 
start an NFL game when he replaced the injured Chandler against the 
New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, he lost, but so what? He's still in the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	His route here began last year in Tampa.  
</P>
<P>
	He had been retired for four years, two of them spent as  
quarterbacks coach for the New York Giants under Dan Reeves. When 
Reeves was fired, so was DeBerg. But when Reeves got the Atlanta 
job, he didn't take DeBerg along, opting for the more experienced 
Jack Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	So while DeBerg thought about his future, trying to decide  
whether to continue his coaching career, he whiled away the hours 
playing golf and football in a very relaxed coed touch football 
league. A friend saw him and invited him to move up to the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, that's when I decided I might try to give  
the NFL another shot,'' DeBerg said. ``I knew my arm strength was 
still there. I knew I was in pretty good shape, so I figured `why 
not?' I thought I could contribute as a backup quarterback without 
ever stepping on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally landed in Atlanta when Mark Rypien, whom the Falcons  
had signed as Chandler's backup, decided to take the year off to 
tend to his seriously ill wife and son. On Aug. 28, he went 
10-of-14 for 129 yards in an exhibition with Cincinnati to win the 
backup role ahead of second-year man Tony Graziani. 
</P>
<P>
	And just as he suspected, DeBerg turned out to be so much more  
than just a quarterback waiting for Chandler to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he will relay the play calls from the sideline to  
Chandler. He'll even call a few plays on his own -- a role he took 
over during the three weeks Reeves was away to undergo quadruple 
heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve's been around long enough to see things some of the  
coaches don't see,'' Reeves said. ``Things kind of evolved to where 
he got to call some of the plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That puts DeBerg close to the level of another quarterback with  
whom he's crossed paths -- Gary Kubiak, the Broncos' offensive 
coordinator, who joined the teams in 1983, the same year as Elway, 
and was DeBerg's roommate. He became Elway's backup, but retired 
after the 1991 season, a year after back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	At 37, he's eight years younger than DeBerg, and no, he hasn't  
considered returning to the field, even in an era when experience 
at that position is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like John,'' Kubiak said. ``I looked at Steve as an  
eight or 10-year guy, an old pro. Now he's still playing at an age 
I can't believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg actually began his pro career in 1977 with Dallas, which  
drafted him in the 10th round. He was awed by stepping on the same 
field with the likes of Roger Staubach and Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
	From there he went to San Francisco, where he became a starter  
under Bill Walsh two seasons later, then stepped aside two years 
later when Montana arrived. He and Chandler are the only 
quarterbacks to start games for six different teams. DeBerg has 
done it for the 49ers, Broncos, Bucs, Chiefs, Dolphins and Falcons; 
Chandler for the Colts, Bucs, Cardinals, Rams, Oilers and Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be the story of DeBerg's career. And despite  
Walsh's label, he was usually in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little too good to be a backup. So when a star came in  
and took my job, someone else always wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's perfect preparation for coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	Someone always wants him.  
</P>
<P>
	Then someone lets him go.

<HEADLINE> Golota Is Wary on Boxing Ferguson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A heavyweight boxer afraid of the  
Boogie Man? 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Golota may be just that.  
</P>
<P>
	The Polish heavyweight was to fight Jimmy Thunder in the  
co-feature of Saturday's Michael Grant-Ahmad Abdin heavyweight 
championship. But Thunder suffered a torn Achilles' tendon in his 
left foot Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse ``Boogie Man'' Ferguson, a 41-year-old former contender,  
agreed to step in but Golota balked -- initially. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that he didn't want it. He's a little concerned  
because he was training to fight for another style and he doesn't 
want to change now,'' promoter Dino Duva said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours later, Golota agreed to the new opponent for the  
co-feature of HBO's ``Boxing After Dark'' card Saturday at 
Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson, of Knightdale, N.C., has a 26-17 record and has fought  
many of the sport's biggest names, including Mike Tyson, Larry 
Holmes, Oliver McCall, Frank Bruno and Riddick Bowe. In his last 
fight, he won a 10-round decision over Obed Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Golota, 31, of Chicago, is choosing his opponents carefully in  
hopes of working his way back to the heavyweight division's top 
echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	He blew a chance at stardom by getting disqualified for low  
blows in consecutive 1996 fights against former champion Riddick 
Bowe, but he won all four of his 1998 bouts to boost his record to 
32-3. 
</P>
<P>
	His manager, Lou Duva, said Golota's not afraid of Ferguson, but  
that there were other considerations. ``Sometimes, fighters who 
fight him don't look good against him. That's my concern,'' said 
Duva, who also is the promoter's father. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential future opponent for Golota is Grant, an unbeaten  
6-foot-7, 250-pounder who holds the IBC heavyweight title and is 
considered by some to be the best young heavyweight in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, 26, of Norristown, Pa., hasn't fought since last May,  
when he stopped Sullivan in the ninth round of their scheduled 
12-rounder. He came down with hepatitis last summer and had to 
cancel a September fight as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Thursday he has recovered and is 100 percent ready for  
Abdin, a former sparring partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's real durable. He's got a chin and he's strong. That's all  
he needs to inspire him, to make him think he has a chance. He 
knows me. I just hope he doesn't run out of wind,'' said Grant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Syria-born Abdin, 26, who fights out of Houston, said he  
plans to stay close to the bigger Grant. Abdin is 6-3, 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go inside. He's never been tested inside, with body  
punches,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he knows Grant well from their sparring days, and that  
Grant never knocked him down or out then. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to make a name for himself,'' Grant said of Abdin.  
``I can't let that happen.''

<HEADLINE> Stranded Sailors Can Leave Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- After about two months anchored off the  
Texas coast, the first of 23 stranded Pakistani sailors aboard a 
crippled cargo ship have come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the Delta Pride had survived on donations of food,  
drinking water, medicine and other supplies before the Coast Guard 
on Wednesday permitted two of the sailors to step foot on Texas 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two men who were allowed to leave first were in bad  
condition,'' Capt. Maqsood Ahmed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sailors will be allowed ashore in the next several days.  
Several crew members, including the captain, will stay aboard to 
ensure the ship's safety while negotiations are under way on its 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two off the 740-foot ship were Ghulam Haider, a welder  
who suffered from a disease with symptoms like that of a stroke, 
and deck hand Ilyas Inapt. Inapt received word this week that two 
of his brothers in Karachi had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Before making its way to the Texas coast, the Delta Pride spent  
five months in Tampico, Mexico, after its owner, Tri-star Shipping 
Lines of Karachi, Pakistan, went bankrupt. Mexican officials seized 
the ship's documents and crew's passports because of a financial 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ship was stranded off Mexico, crew members drank  
rainwater they collected and ate fish they caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain said earlier that he was inspired to turn the vessel  
northward toward the United States after he found a $10 U.S. bill 
on board and read the words, ``In God We Trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship sailed into U.S. waters Nov. 24. But it was denied  
permission to enter the Port of Brownsville because it lacked a 
certificate of financial responsibility that guarantees the ship's 
owner pays if the vessel causes environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tops European Skating Event By COLLEEN BARRY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Alexei Yagudin didn't have to do a  
quad toe-loop. But he did. And the confidence-booster powered him 
through a cleverly choreographed, emotionally skated long program 
to defend his European Figure Skating title Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	When the music stopped on his ``Lawrence of Arabia'' program,  
and Yagudin had completed his seventh triple jump, there was little 
doubt that he had won. He punched the air with both fists, then 
glided around the rink in undisguised wonderment as the crowd rose 
to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was European champion for the second time,''  
Yagudin, 18, said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he tried to leave the ice, his coach, Tatiana Tarasova,  
motioned for him to take another bow. He returned the tribute, 
falling to his knees and gliding toward her with his arms 
outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin led a Russian sweep of the men's competition. But only  
the defending European and world champion's program was virtually 
error free, leaving Russian champion Yevgeny Plushenko in second 
and 1994 Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov in third. 
</P>
<P>
	A freak stumble by 16-year-old Plushenko going into a triple  
loop destroyed the spell cast by his opening jump, a rare 
quad-triple toe combination, the first of the European 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jinx was only temporary, lasting through a triple-axel  
touch down and a double lutz, then seemed to break under the 
exuberance of his fast-paced, rhythmic footwork. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he hit six more triples, including the lost loop and  
a triple lutz-triple toe combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't lose concentration after the quad, but after the fall  
my back hurt and it didn't work out as planned,'' Plushenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov couldn't hold it together after falling on a triple axel  
early in his ``Tango,'' losing momentum as the program wound to a 
close with a pair of double salchows, not a triple jump sequence 
he'd been practicing as a finale. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin was clearly feeling the pressure of defending his title  
during Monday's qualifying, when he fell on the first triple axel 
in the same ``Lawrence of Arabia'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	But a strong finish in his innovated ``Clown'' short program,  
which has strong dance influence from his new coach, restored his 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin's victory put Russia halfway to a sweep of the  
championships for the third straight year, and made Yagudin a 
favorite to defend his world title at Helsinki, Finland, March 
21-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian claimed the first title of the championships Wednesday  
night when Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov won the final free 
skate. Three Russian women lead the field going into the short 
program Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian ice dance pair, Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov, secured their lead over French couple Marina Anissina 
and Gwendal Peizerat during the original dance section Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian pair skated an exuberant waltz to music from La  
Traviata sung by Luciano Pavarotti, earning one 6.0 for 
presentation and first-places from six of the nine judges.

<HEADLINE> Oil Industry Wants Government Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil state senators and industry  
representatives called on the Clinton administration and Congress 
to intervene Thursday and help the oil industry survive the most 
severe economic downturn in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do nothing, things are going to get worse,'' Sen. Frank  
Murkowski, R-Alaska, declared at the opening of a hearing by his 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the oil industry's 
economic woes -- what some have called a severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee members expressed support for legislation that  
would give modest tax relief to small oil operators. Some witnesses 
at the hearing suggested the Energy Department should buy oil for 
its emergency reserve in hopes of giving prices a nudge upward. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation introduced Thursday by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson,  
R-Texas, would give a tax credit to operators of marginal oil wells 
and tax relief to those willing to restart some of the thousands of 
wells that have been shut down because they're not profitable with 
the currently depressed prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Murkowski and some industry witnesses chided the Clinton  
administration for not buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve at a time when prices are the lowest since 1986, and some 
say the lowest in 50 years, adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal oil purchases for the reserve likely would raise  
worldwide oil prices only slightly, said John Lichtblau, an analyst 
for the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains 563 million barrels,  
purchased over two decades for use in case of a sudden oil 
shortage. But no oil has been bought since 1993. While the Energy 
Department has acknowledged it might be prudent to buy oil for the 
reserve now that prices are the lowest in 12 years, no decision to 
do so has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry's problems, stemming from a 55 percent decline  
in crude prices over the last two years, have seen thousands of 
workers lose their jobs, with no improvement in sight. Small 
companies are threatened with bankruptcy, while larger ones such as 
Exxon and Mobil are pushing toward consolidation to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of a barrel of benchmark West Texas Intermediate was  
at just over $11 a barrel last month, compared to $25 a barrel in 
December, 1996. And some lesser grades have been sold for less than 
$6 a barrel, Jay hakes, head of the federal Energy Information 
Administration, told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he added, ``the recovery may take some time,'' with prices  
not likely to rebound to the $20 a barrel level until 2000 or 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Lichtblau attributed the collapse to an oversupply and  
unexpected drop in worldwide demand, largely because of the Asia 
economic crisis and warmer winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important reason was, and still is, the  
Asia-Pacific economic recession,'' said Lichtblau. This region had 
accounted for 80 percent of the annual growth in worldwide oil 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickels, R-Okla., said Iraq also was to blame for  
problems in America's oil patch. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's oil exports were allowed to increase from 700,000 barrels  
a day in late 1996 to 2.5 million barrels a day at the end of 1998 
under a U.N.-approved program, in which the country's oil revenue 
is used to pay for humanitarian assistance. The added supply 
increased the downward pressure on prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while the oil industry suffers, others are benefiting.  
</P>
<P>
	With gasoline prices dipping below a $1 a gallon in many places  
around the country, motorists are enjoying the lowest gasoline 
prices in inflation-adjusted terms since 1942, and possibly the 
lowest ever, according to government analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impact has been felt on the economy as a whole,  
contributing, economists say, to overall economic prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We estimated that some $40 billion of purchasing power was  
transferred from oil to other sectors of the economy last year as a 
result of the oil price decline,'' said Lichtblau. 
</P>
<P>
	Hake said that because of low oil prices, ``instead of inflation  
being about 2.3 percent in 1998, we only saw about a 1.6 percent 
increase.''

	Lewinsky To Testify in Senate Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate voted late  
Thursday to recess President Clinton's impeachment trial for a week 
while prosecutors and White House lawyers depose Monica Lewinsky 
and two other witnesses. The resolution, adopted by a 54-44 margin, 
envisions a final vote on the impeachment articles by noon Feb. 12. 
Depositions start Monday, when House prosecutors and President 
Clinton's lawyers will question Ms. Lewinsky. Tuesday and 
Wednesday, the managers and White House attorneys will question 
Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal.

	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of Colombian troops entered  
the earthquake zone Thursday and the president imposed a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew to tame the chaos that's taken over here, as

	$2.6 Trillion Gov't Surplus Projected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal surpluses will total $2.6 trillion  
over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office projected 
Thursday. The estimate is hundreds of billions of dollars more than 
was expected five months ago. Over the decade ending in 2009, CBO

come from the non-Social Security side of the budget.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee

buying the latest hot Internet stock to hitting a one-in-a-million 
jackpot in the lottery. Greenspan, who once sent stock prices 
plunging by worrying about investors' ``irrational exuberance,'' 
said that in the case of Internet stocks, the market was behaving 
in a time-honored fashion. He said the potential payoff for 
companies that succeed in the new Internet market is so huge that 
something he called the ``lottery principle'' was at work.

	Researcher Finds Ancient Chemicals  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Danish researcher analyzing rock formations  
from Greenland said he has found chemical evidence that suggests 
the presence of life 3.7 billion years ago, about 200 million years 
before the earliest known fossils. Minik T. Rosing of the Geologisk 
Museum in Denmark reports in Friday's edition of the journal 
Science that metamorphic rock in a well-preserved sedimentary 
deposit in western Greenland could have come from life forms that 
died and settled to the bottom some 200 million years before the 
first known fossils.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 58.96; Nasdaq Up 51.84 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose today as technology shares,  
which had threatened Wednesday to end their spectacular run, 
bounced back on strong earnings, a stock split and a merger 
announcement thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 58.96 at 9,259.19. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market is merger driven,'' said Ted Theodore, director of  
research at Avatar Associates, ``and you have this added feature of 
a very good earnings picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher, with the Nasdaq composite  
up 51.84 at 2,458.98, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite index 
up 18.07 at 1,261.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advancing issues were barely leading decliners on the Big  
Board, and volume was an unimpressivbe 674.91 million shares, down 
from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks led the charge, as Internet search service  
Yahoo! announced it is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58 billion in 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! shares were up 10 1/2 at 346 3/8. while GeoCities shares were  
soaring 36 at 111, both in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online shares were up 8 1/8 at 173 5/8 in leading volume on  
the Big Board, after the online service provider beat analysts' 
earnings estimates and announced a two-for-one stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Ford Motor Co. said it will buy the  
automotive operations of Sweden's AB Volvo for $6.45 billion. 
Ford's shares were up 2 1/16 at 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks, which were hit hard Wednesday in part because of  
concerns about Brazil's fragile economy, were recovering today as 
the Brazilian real and stock market stabilized. Dow component 
Citigroup was up 1 1/4 at 56 1/16, and J.P. Morgan, also a Dow 
component, was up 4 at 104 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly shares were up 1 1/16 at 91 13/16 after the drug maker  
announced strong earnings and authorized a $1 billion stock 
repurchase program. And competitor Pfizer, capitalizing on the 
current craze for stock splits, rose 1 15/16 at 123 7/8, after the 
company said it would consider a three-for-one stock split in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Labor Department reported that Americans'  
wages and benefits rose last year by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip 
in five years and a slight improvement over 1997. But labor costs 
cooled in the fourth quarter, good news for investors who are 
worried that wage pressures could prove inflationary and prompt the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the  
Senate Budget Committee this morning. He repeated his earlier 
criticism of a Clinton Administration plan to have the government 
invest around $700 billion of Social Security money in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Herculean efforts,'' Greenspan said, he doubted  
decisions on investing this money could be insulated from political 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors hadn't made much of the proposal, announced earlier  
this month in President Clinton's State of the Union address, and 
didn't have much reaction today to Greenspan's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Buy Volvo Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay $6.45 billion for  
Volvo AB's car division, speeding consolidation in the global auto 
industry and expanding Ford's premium brands. Built to last, Volvo 
cars represent safety to many Americans and Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Thursday is similar to last year's  
merger of Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG of Germany in that 
there is no overlap in both companies' car lines. It also gives 
Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, a larger share of the highly 
competitive European market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal is not as significant for the industry as the much  
larger DaimlerChrysler merger that closed in November, said Gregory 
Kagay of McDonald &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sort of like a whale swallowing a guppy,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Volvo will retain its commercial truck and engine business and  
is in talks to merge those operations with Sweden's Scania. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still must be approved by Volvo shareholders, which  
could pose a problem. Six years ago, an influential bloc of Volvo 
shareholders scuttled a proposed merger with France's Renault SA 
largely over fears that Volvo control and jobs would move outside 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensitive to such fears, Ford executives stressed at a news  
conference that Volvo's current management and factories would 
remain in place and that Volvo cars would retain their unique 
personality, style and reputation for quality and safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing that cannot change is their Swedishness,'' said Jac  
Nasser, Ford's new president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Ford a premium brand positioned above the most  
expensive Fords and well below its Jaguar line, and instantly adds 
nearly 2 percentage points to its European market share of 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, it brings a different type of customer to  
Ford than those who buy Lincolns and Jaguars. Volvo's U.S. buyers 
--mostly in the 34-53 age range -- include far more women. Most Jag 
and Lincoln buyers are 54 and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo would also add to Ford's effort to market itself as a  
leader in automotive safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volvo has a world-class reputation for safety, quality,  
durability and environmental responsibility -- all of which are 
attributes that are increasingly important to our customers,'' 
Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	While financially healthy, Volvo is among the smallest players  
in the world auto industry -- something that put its long-term 
survival in doubt as the business has become increasingly dominated 
by such global behemoths as General Motors Corp., Ford, Toyota 
Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's other automaker, Saab, is half-owned by General Motors,  
and it's widely expected that GM will take it over entirely by the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo sold nearly 400,000 cars worldwide last year, with one out  
of four sales in the United States. By comparison, Ford produced 
6.8 million vehicles worldwide last year, second only to GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's financial strength will allow the Volvo line to be  
broadened at a faster rate. Nasser said he sees ``huge potential'' 
to expand Volvo, though he declined to say if there may be Volvo 
sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups. The deal gives Ford 
the right to use the Volvo name on such products. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that made Ford an attractive suitor to Volvo was its  
experience turning around Jaguar Cars Ltd. of England. In 1989, 
Ford paid $2.5 billion for Jaguar and wound up pouring an 
additional $3.5 billion into updating Jaguar's plants and model 
lineup, returning the luxury automaker to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	``People will place a lot of importance on Volvo remaining  
Volvo,'' said Christer Karlsson, an analyst with the Stockholm 
Institute of Economics. ``One of the advantages with Ford is that 
they don't completely Americanize their (foreign) products, but let 
them retain their special qualities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jaguar, Ford also owns luxury automaker Aston  
Martin of England, the Lincoln and Mercury brands in North America, 
and one-third of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street reacted favorably to the deal. Ford shares closed up  
3.6 percent, rising $2.18 3/4 to close at $62.50 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. In Sweden, Volvo shares rose the equivalent of 
6.4 cents to close at $27.20, with gains held down by expectations 
that Volvo would use the proceeds of the deal to buy truckmaker 
Scania. Later on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Volvo's U.S. shares fell 
3 percent, or by 81 1/4 cents, to close at $26.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford's record is exemplary with this type of acquisition,''  
said analyst Greg Salchow of Roney &AMP; Co. ``At Jaguar, the cars are 
demonstrably better in every way but still retain their character 
that makes a Jaguar a Jaguar. I think we'll see that continue with 
Volvo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts, however, said Ford paid too much.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting acquisition but an over-the-top price,''  
said Nicholas J. Colas of Credit Suisse First Boston. Colas 
estimated the deal exceeds Volvo's value by $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford  
who recently was installed as chairman, defended the price as 
``very fair'' given Volvo's potential for growth worldwide. ``Our 
price was our price going in and we didn't get caught in a lot of 
last-minute bidding up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's VW and Fiat SpA of Italy also expressed interest in  
Volvo. Fiat reportedly offered $7 billion, but wanted its 
commercial vehicle operations as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Leif Johansson, president of Volvo, said his company will use  
the money to aggressively expand its commercial vehicle operations, 
which makes trucks and buses, construction equipment, marine and 
heavy-duty diesel engines, and aerospace equipment.

<HEADLINE> Super Singers Plan Halftime Gala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For Scotty Morris, the full realization of playing  
in the Super Bowl halftime show didn't sink in until he and his Big 
Bad Voodoo Daddy mates saw Stevie Wonder and Gloria Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honestly didn't believe it until we walked up on this  
stage,'' Morris said. ``We thought it was a really cool joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No joke. The hot swing band that two years ago was playing  
Hollywood's underground club scene will be performing for a 
worldwide audience of some 800 million on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a really long road,'' Morris said. ``We're very  
appreciative. It's something that's just hard to imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio City Music Hall, which is producing its sixth Super Bowl  
halftime, is promising a little something for everybody with its 
11-minute show titled ``Soul, Salsa and Swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great opportunity for me to sing with Stevie,'' said  
Estefan, who will make her second Super Bowl performance. ``It's 
something we've talked about a number of times. Now we finally get 
to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estefan also performed at halftime of the 1992 Super Bowl in  
Minneapolis, joining jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain as the only 
two-time halftime headliners. This one takes on special meaning, 
however, because she'll be performing in her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's significant because it's in Miami,'' said the versatile  
vocalist, answering questions in both English and Spanish. ``I did 
it in Minneapolis, and it was great. But here there's a lot of 
Latins, and I'm very appreciative of the honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder has won 15 Grammy awards during a career that has spanned  
four decades since he was discovered at age 11. His 1984 song ``I 
Just Called to Say I Love You'' earned an Academy Award and is 
Motown's all-time top selling single internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, he wasn't part of last year's Super Bowl halftime  
show in San Diego, a tribute to Motown's 40th anniversary, which 
featured Smokey Robinson, The Temptatiions and Boyz II Men. 
However, he said he didn't feel slighted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll celebrate anyone's celebration,'' he said. ``I was just  
excited to be at home, chilling and listening to the various 
artists. I was celebrating just knowing they were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 performers will share the field with the  
headliners. Producers spent a year planning the $2 million to $3 
million show, which will use theatrical lighting to transform the 
field into a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Ground crews have less than 5 minutes to roll a 32-ton stage  
onto the field in pieces and assemble it again. The extravaganza 
also will feature huge lighted balloon balls and mirrored disco 
balls, performers on stilts, lasers and various pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers also are promising a couple of surprises. Three years  
ago, a Radio City-produced show featured Diana Ross exiting the Sun 
Devil Stadium field via helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, Radio City knew we had to come up with something  
even hotter,'' said Eddie Micone, a Radio City senior vice 
president who is co-producing the show.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hoya Guilty in Thompson Stalking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Georgetown University basketball player  
Kevin Millen pleaded guilty on Thursday to stalking former coach 
John Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen also pleaded guilty to unlawful entry on the Georgetown  
campus, in an agreement between prosecutors and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. Superior Court Judge Anita Josey-Herring could sentence  
Millen to up to 18 months in jail, but attorneys in the case have 
agreed to recommend probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea agreement, Millen is barred from contacting  
Georgetown University, or its current or former staff during the 
length of his probation. He must also undergo whatever counseling 
is mandated. The agreement also bars Millen from returning to the 
District of Columbia area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want Kevin staying in D.C. any longer than he has  
to,'' said Celicia Hoover-Hankerson, pleading with the judge to 
allow her client to return to his home in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors were prepared to pursue more than a dozen charges  
against Millen who reportedly made 37 threatening phone calls to 
Georgetown between January and December of last year. ``He 
unlawfully engaged in behavior intended to cause emotional distress 
to John Thompson,'' said Asst. U.S. Attorney Rob Bowman, in 
explaining the scope of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Georgetown player has been in the city jail since  
Nov. 30, when he violated a judge's order barring him from the 
Georgetown campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Millen averaged 2 points in 121 games, including three starts,  
for the Hoyas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin loves that school, he truly does. He is proud of the  
fact that he is a Georgetown grad,'' said his attorney.

<HEADLINE> Caesarean Delivery Cuts AIDS Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The risk an HIV-infected woman will pass the virus  
to her baby during birth is nearly eliminated if she takes a 
standard AIDS drug and has a Caesarean delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits of the AIDS drug AZT have been known for five  
years. But the added advantage of a Caesarean was suspected but not 
proven until a large study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new data show that a Caesarean alone cuts the risk of AIDS  
transmission in half. An infected woman who has both a Caesarean 
and AZT treatment has only about a 2 percent chance of infecting 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
	``All infected women need to be told about this information,''  
said Dr. Lynne Mofenson, a co-author of the study at the National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is scheduled to be published in the March 31 issue of  
the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal posted the article 
early on the Internet because of its public health importance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, much of the information was released last summer at an  
AIDS meeting in Geneva, and as a result many obstetricians have 
already begun routinely scheduling Caesareans for their 
HIV-infected patients. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing is done, an HIV-infected woman has about a 1-in-4 or  
greater chance of passing the virus to her baby during or after 
birth. This risk has already been sharply reduced in the 
industrialized world by giving AZT to women during pregnancy and by 
discouraging breast feeding, which also helps spread the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS drugs, though, are too expensive in parts of Africa and  
Asia where the epidemic is raging, and about 1,600 babies are born 
each day with HIV infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest findings are unlikely to have much impact on this.  
Mofenson noted that in regions of the world with primitive medical 
conditions, the risks to the mother of Caesarean delivery can be 
much higher than vaginal birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest analysis was based on a compilation of 15 studies in  
North America and Europe involving 8,533 pairs of infected mothers 
and their children born between 1982 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the key findings:  
</P>
<P>
	-- With neither a Caesarean nor AZT treatment, 19 percent of  
babies were born infected. 
</P>
<P>
	-- If the mother got an elective Caesarean but no AZT, 10 percent  
were infected. 
</P>
<P>
	-- If she got AZT but no elective Caesarean, 7 percent were  
infected. 
</P>
<P>
	-- If she got both AZT and an elective Caesarean, 2 percent were  
infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe that earlier U.S. studies showed no  
benefit of Caesarean deliveries because they failed to distinguish 
between elective operations and those that were done after labor 
began. The new data show that for a Caesarean to reduce 
transmission, it must be performed before the mother's membranes 
rupture and she begins labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers believe that about 70 percent of AIDS  
transmission from mother to child occurs during the birth process, 
rather than while the fetus is still in the womb. They theorize 
that Caesareans protect babies two ways: 
</P>
<P>
	--The child is shielded from HIV-laden blood and secretions in  
the birth canal. During vaginal birth, the baby's skin and mucous 
membranes are covered with these fluids, and the baby may also 
swallow them. 
</P>
<P>
	--During uterine contractions of labor, a small amount of blood  
is transferred from the mother's circulation to the baby's, and 
this too is avoided by an elective Caesarean. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the babies in the study were born before highly potent  
combination therapy became available for AIDS. These treatments 
reduce HIV in the blood to undetectable levels. Some small, still 
unpublished studies suggest infected women getting these medicines 
have less than a 5 percent risk of transmitting the virus to their 
babies, even without Caesareans.

<HEADLINE> Charges Possible in Olympic Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the evidence supports their current theory  
of the Salt Lake City Olympic scandal, federal investigators could 
charge both bribers and recipients of under-the-table payments, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that might be used to prosecute 
what federal investigators initially see as a case of commercial 
bribery, rather than the more familiar government variety, the 
Justice Department officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the Justice Department lets private parties resolve  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits rather than 
bringing federal criminal charges. The exception is when a federal 
interest is involved, such as the integrity of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe givers and takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under study are tax, currency transfer and foreign bribery  
statutes that might provide additional charges, according to these 
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal probe is in a very early stage, months from  
major decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents are still trying to understand the records  
subpoenaed from Salt Lake City's Olympic bid committee. Stephanie 
Pate, one-time secretary of former bid committee head Tom Welch, 
has been meeting with agents this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, four members of the International Olympic Committee  
have resigned over the scandal. One of them, Kenya's Charles 
Mukora, who resigned Wednesday, was among six members the IOC said 
Sunday it would expel next month. Others are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic case under investigation is whether Salt Lake's  
committee bribed IOC members to win the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
Federal mail and wire fraud charges could be brought if someone 
used the mail or telephones to ``defraud the International Olympic 
Committee of the honest services of its members,'' a Justice 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Olympic decision-maker who took a bribe also could be  
vulnerable to mail or wire fraud charges for defrauding the 
international panel of his or her honest service -- honest service 
meaning a vote for a site based on its merits rather than on 
under-the-table payments, this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	If more than one person were involved, then prosecutors could  
charge a conspiracy to defraud the Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	If evidence showed illicit payments began with and were the  
product of pressure on Salt Lake representatives from the Olympic 
decision-makers, then the recipients could be charged with 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported today that the Justice Department is trying  
to determine whether a Salt Lake Olympic official carried about 
$50,000 to Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 when the 2002 Winter Games 
were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said FBI agents interviewed former Salt Lake City  
Councilman Tom Godfrey, who has said the official was a staff 
member of the Salt Lake Olympic bid committee. Godfrey was a member 
of the delegation that traveled to Budapest in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also are looking into whether the Salt Lake panel  
violated its tax-exempt status or if any recipients failed to 
report payments on which U.S. taxes were due. 
</P>
<P>
	But such charges are considered longer shots at this point.  
``It's hard to make cases of violating an organization's tax-exempt 
status, and it's very hard to show that foreigners were aware they 
would owe U.S. taxes on things like scholarships for their kids,'' 
said one former Justice official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax charges would likely be added to other federal counts ``only  
if they are necessary to clearly demonstrate what happened -- that 
tax-exempt dollars were misused or personal gain was involved,'' 
said this former official. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury agents are focusing on whether Olympic Committee  
members violated requirements to report carrying cash out of the 
country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt  
Practices Act are still being briefed on the evidence gathered, but 
that act applies only to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign 
officials to influence actions of their government. Some foreign 
officials serve on the Olympic Committee, but it is a private 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, would reach the 
largest number of potentially guilty parties and would provide the 
most appropriate penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, The New York Times reported today that  
the United States Olympic Committee is exploring ideas about the 
restructuring of the IOC, including recommendations for term limits 
and democratic elections by outsiders.

<HEADLINE> For Some, Senate Votes Mean No End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To Randy Boone, the Senate's vote not to dismiss charges against  
President Clinton means more than a continuation of the trial -- it 
means international humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the general sentiment of the American people is, let's  
stop this because we're almost the laughing stock of the world,'' 
said Boone, 31, a credit underwriter from Sykesville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans asked about two key Senate votes Wednesday -- not  
to dismiss the case and to call witnesses -- expressed frustration 
that an opportunity to end the 13-month-old ordeal had slipped 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disgusted. If I had my way, both the House and the Senate  
would be impeached,'' said Theresa Gilmore, 30, of Columbus, Ohio. 
``What else are they going to get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That question was echoed from coast to coast.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody already knows what's already been said. I feel  
they're just wasting taxpayer dollars,'' said Tracie Dawson, 26, an 
assistant video store manager in Oakland, Md. ``I think they should 
just drop the whole thing. And I'm a Republican.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others took comfort in the motions, saying the trial shouldn't  
be limited or cut short simply to satisfy a restless public. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what I've taken away from this is that it's reinforced  
my faith in the American political system,'' said Helena Wolin, a 
19-year-old sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia. ``It shows that the government is strong enough to 
check a president who has abused his powers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 56-44 along nearly unanimous party lines  
Wednesday to summon Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. The 
same senators voted not to dismiss the charges against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., voted with Republicans on both  
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``He obviously made his decision so he could get more  
information before he can vote on impeachment,'' said Dennis Dums, 
a member of a private utility watchdog group from Madison, Wis. 
``I've trusted his past decisions and I trust this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were angry that he had broken ranks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised why he voted against his own party,'' said  
Raymond Kowalski, 60, of Mosinee, Wis. ``I don't understand what he 
is going to gain by it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some were puzzled by the same question that prompted Sen. Robert  
Byrd, D-W.Va., to submit the failed motion to dismiss: What's the 
point of continuing when it's already clear Republicans don't have 
the two-thirds majority needed to convict? 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to have enough votes in the end, and they  
already know that, so it is kind of a waste of taxpayer time and 
money,'' said Jeff Sharratt, 31, as he shopped at a book store in 
Minneapolis. ``People are tired of the whole impeachment trial and 
I think it should be done away with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Robert Bell, 60, a British knight who has lived in the  
United States for 20 years, said it's the Democrats who ``are 
making a fool of themselves.'' He said he was pleased the charges 
weren't dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least the Republicans are putting the Constitution to the  
test,'' said Bell, who lives in Greensboro, N.C. ``It's not a 
matter of whether he's booted out of office or not, it's a matter 
of how the judicial system works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll shows that 53 percent of Americans oppose having the  
Senate call witnesses. Sixty-three percent said the president 
should not be removed from office and 67 percent said they don't 
expect the Senate to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center for People and the Press poll, which was  
released Tuesday, questioned 1,500 adults by telephone. The margin 
of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe into Clinton ``should have been stopped a couple of  
million dollars ago,'' said Dina Owens, an investment banker from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He smoked weed, we voted him in. He dodged the draft, we voted  
him in. His moral character was in question a long time ago,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holly Stephens, a 19-year-old sophomore at East Tennessee State  
in Johnson City, said she wasn't following the votes and changes 
the channel on her television or radio whenever the topic comes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> NASD Names Market Regulator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASD Regulation has named one of its vice  
presidents, Stephen Luparello, senior vice president of market 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Luparello will be responsible for surveillance of trading on the  
electronic Nasdaq Stock Market, which is operated by the National 
Association of Securities Dealers. The market regulation department 
also works against fraud, insider trading and stock manipulation by 
brokerage firms or brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	NASD Regulation, the self-policing arm of the NASD, announced  
the appointment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came a day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange  
Commission announced that its director of market regulation, 
Richard Lindsey, was leaving to join a major Wall Street firm. A 
successor hasn't yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
	Luparello came to NASD Regulation as a vice president in 1996 to

<HEADLINE> Mannerly Senate Turns Partisan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They're usually polite in the Senate, often  
more mannerly than that other, blue-collar branch of Congress, but 
a party-line vote there is no less a partisan verdict than in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what it was when the Republican Senate voted  
Wednesday to keep President Clinton on impeachment trial for his 
job, in a test that showed Democrats had more than enough votes to 
acquit him. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat voted with the unanimous Republicans, against  
dismissing the charges and for summoning Monica Lewinsky and two 
other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	All the talk of Senate bipartisanship doesn't change numbers --  
56, enough to keep Clinton on trial, 11 too few to convict him. 
That would take two-thirds of the 100 senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four Democrats voted to dismiss the case. ``The president  
will not be removed from office,'' Sen. Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota, the Democratic leader, said after the votes against ending 
the trial and for witness depositions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impeachment process has been abused by a partisan effort  
and we should bring it now to a close,'' Daschle said. But 
Democrats can't, and Republicans won't, at least until House 
prosecutors get their chance to question the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, as Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead prosecutor, says,  
Republican votes against Clinton are no more partisan than 
Democratic votes for him. It was Hyde who called his House the 
blue-collar branch, when he was complaining that his prosecutors 
weren't getting proper respect from the haughty Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Party lines have hardened in the year-plus since the Lewinsky  
sex scandal began and Clinton lied about his affair with the former 
White House intern --not under oath, he's always insisted, in 
defense against the perjury and obstruction of justice accusations 
on which the House impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Every impeachment step in Hyde's House Judiciary Committee was  
on straight party lines. The House impeachment votes were close to 
it, five Democrats and five Republicans crossing over on the 
perjury article, five Democrats voting for the obstruction of 
justice charge, which wouldn't have passed without them, while 12 
Republicans voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that happened after bitterly partisan House debate.  
</P>
<P>
	That sent the case to the Senate, which styles itself the  
calmer, more reflective body, a club of 100 members. Mount Olympus, 
Hyde called it. There were admonitions from Senate elders to avoid 
the raucous partisanship of the House. Since senators can't speak 
at trial, and have held their impeachment debates behind closed 
doors, there wasn't a Senate forum for it, anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has sullied itself,'' Sen. Robert Byrd of West  
Virginia, the senior Democrat, said at an extraordinary, bipartisan 
caucus in the antique old Senate chamber, a setting to remind them 
all of history. ``The House has fallen into the black pit of 
partisan self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink of 
that same black pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that caucus nearly three weeks ago, the Senate settled on a  
plan to open the trial with arguments by both sides, to be followed 
by the dismissal and witness votes. It was unanimous, as bipartisan 
as the House had been riven, they boasted. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was about trial procedures, and when time came to act  
on dismissal and witnesses, there was nothing bipartisan about it. 
Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin was the only Democrat to vote 
against ending the trial and for summoning witnesses to it, siding 
with the 55 Republicans now, but saying he hadn't decided how he 
will vote on acquittal or conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an unfortunate and crystal-clear reality that the votes  
today were almost totally along partisan lines, which a lot of us 
had hoped would not happen, if at all, until the very end,'' said 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. His Sept. 3 rebuke of 
Clinton's conduct in the Senate was the first by a Democrat after 
the president admitted the Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called the trial a travesty and  
the vote to continue it with witnesses a major blunder. ``Not only 
the president is on trial but the Senate's on trial,'' he said. 
``And I think all of us want this not to be a spectacle and want to 
maintain at least the dignity of the United States Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we start hollering at each other and sounding partisan then  
that will make it so,'' said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, leader 
of the Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't, so far.

<HEADLINE> IOC Inquiry Leader Will Pick Spots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The head of the IOC investigation of Olympics  
corruption said Thursday he might consider stepping aside on cases 
of bid cities that could present at least the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, said the  
situation had not been formally discussed since International 
Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samranch broadened an 
ethics investigation last week to include bids for all games from 
the 1996 Summer Olympics onward. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound said he might choose not to take part in reviewing  
bids from Toronto and Quebec if a worldwide sweep for evidence of 
wrongdoing in host-city voting turns up anything involving those 
two cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The matter, he said, would be discussed at an IOC executive  
board meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suppose if any of the Canadian cities comes up with the sort  
of information that we feel needs further investigation, it may be 
best for me to say, `You guys go on without me,' '' Pound said in a 
telephone interview from his Montreal law office. 
</P>
<P>
	He said another member of the inquiry commission, Thomas Bach of  
Germany, could face a similar situation with Berlin's failed bid 
for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound said he was less certain about dealing with evidence  
that may come from Atlanta, which staged the Centennial Games in 
1996. Pound was head of the IOC's coordination commission for those 
Olympics and became embroiled with city officials during the games 
when his wife was arrested on a highly publicized jaywalking 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that with the many bright and shining lights on  
possible conflict of interest, the bigger question may become 
whether anyone with a connection to any city in a particular bid 
year should step away from investigation of any city in that 
year,'' he said. ``We'll have to think about that.''

	Toronto was an unsuccessful bidder for the 1996 Games, while  
Quebec lost to Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Games. It was 
evidence of corruption in Salt Lake's victory that sparked what has 
become the biggest scandal in Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's inquiry initially covered only Salt Lake, and last  
Sunday the IOC expelled six members for taking more than $440,000 
in cash, medical and travel expenses and lavish gifts from Utah 
bidders.

<HEADLINE> Intel Splits Stock 2-for-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. announced a 2-for-1 stock  
split today, the latest big-name company to divide its shares to 
make them more affordable to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, the world's largest computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion  
in sales last year, said the split takes effect April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors greeted the news by bidding Intel up $4.44 at $137.19  
in early Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The split would be the 12th since Intel went public 26 years  
ago. The last split, also 2-for-1, was in June 1997. The company 
has 1.67 billion shares of stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stock split, a company increases the number of shares  
outstanding without increasing its total market value. A share 
valued at $100, for example, might be exchanged for two shares 
valued at $50, or three shares worth $33.33 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	A split is usually interpreted as a sign that a company expects  
its stock to continue to climb. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other high tech companies have announced stock splits  
this month, including Microsoft Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., eBay 
Inc. and Yahoo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel makes about 85 percent of the world's computer processors,  
and manufactures memory chips plus hardware for computer networks, 
communications and graphics.

<HEADLINE> NFL Salary Cap To Go Up About $5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The NFL's salary cap is expected to go up about $5  
million next season to $57.5 million per team, according to an 
estimate Thursday by Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL 
Players Association. 
</P>
<P>
	This season's salary cap is $52.388 million, about $10 million  
more than it was in 1997. The increase was due to the $18 billion, 
eight-year television contract that took effect at the beginning of 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw stressed that his figure, which league officials agree  
were accurate, was an estimate, as are all salary cap figures at 
this time of year. The final figure usually isn't set until league 
and union officials sit down to work out final details. 
</P>
<P>
	Upshaw noted that the small increase is due to two factors -- the  
expansion that will add Cleveland as the NFL's 31st team, and the 
relatively small increase in the television contract, which will go 
much higher after next season, when the cap figure is expected to 
go way up. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we signed our deal, we wanted to ensure that there was  
additional money at the end of the contract as well as at the 
beginning,'' Upshaw said.

<HEADLINE> Steve DeBerg Just Keeps Going... </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- John Elway was a rookie when he first met Steve  
DeBerg, the player he would soon replace as Denver's starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was what, six or seven years in the league?'' said Elway,  
who at 38 is expected to retire after the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was an ancient. Now I feel ancient.''  
</P>
<P>
	So who will be standing on the opposite side of the field when  
Elway and the Broncos take on Atlanta in Sunday's game? 
</P>
<P>
	None other than Steve DeBerg, who, at 45, is the backup  
quarterback for the Falcons as well as a quasi-coach, play-caller 
and instructor to Chris Chandler, the starting QB. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg is famous for being displaced by famous quarterbacks --  
Elway in Denver, Joe Montana in San Francisco and Kansas City, and 
Steve Young and Vinny Testaverde in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The first coach to start him, Bill Walsh, once said of him:  
``He's just good enough to get you beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, DeBerg is ninth on the all-time list for  
completions and on Oct. 25, 1998, became the oldest quarterback to 
start an NFL game when he replaced the injured Chandler against the 
New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, he lost, but so what? He's still in the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	His route here began last year in Tampa.  
</P>
<P>
	He had been retired for four years, two of them spent as  
quarterbacks coach for the New York Giants under Dan Reeves. When 
Reeves was fired, so was DeBerg. But when Reeves got the Atlanta 
job, he didn't take DeBerg along, opting for the more experienced 
Jack Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	So while DeBerg thought about his future, trying to decide  
whether to continue his coaching career, he whiled away the hours 
playing golf and football in a very relaxed coed touch football 
league. A friend saw him and invited him to move up to the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, that's when I decided I might try to give  
the NFL another shot,'' DeBerg said. ``I knew my arm strength was 
still there. I knew I was in pretty good shape, so I figured `why 
not?' I thought I could contribute as a backup quarterback without 
ever stepping on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	He finally landed in Atlanta when Mark Rypien, whom the Falcons  
had signed as Chandler's backup, decided to take the year off to 
tend to his seriously ill wife and son. On Aug. 28, he went 
10-of-14 for 129 yards in an exhibition with Cincinnati to win the 
backup role ahead of second-year man Tony Graziani. 
</P>
<P>
	And just as he suspected, DeBerg turned out to be so much more  
than just a quarterback waiting for Chandler to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he will relay the play calls from the sideline to  
Chandler. He'll even call a few plays on his own -- a role he took 
over during the three weeks Reeves was away to undergo quadruple 
heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve's been around long enough to see things some of the  
coaches don't see,'' Reeves said. ``Things kind of evolved to where 
he got to call some of the plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That puts DeBerg close to the level of another quarterback with  
whom he's crossed paths -- Gary Kubiak, the Broncos' offensive 
coordinator, who joined the teams in 1983, the same year as Elway, 
and was DeBerg's roommate. He became Elway's backup, but retired 
after the 1991 season, a year after back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	At 37, he's eight years younger than DeBerg, and no, he hasn't  
considered returning to the field, even in an era when experience 
at that position is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like John,'' Kubiak said. ``I looked at Steve as an  
eight or 10-year guy, an old pro. Now he's still playing at an age 
I can't believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg actually began his pro career in 1977 with Dallas, which  
drafted him in the 10th round. He was awed by stepping on the same 
field with the likes of Roger Staubach and Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
	From there he went to San Francisco, where he became a starter  
under Bill Walsh two seasons later, then stepped aside two years 
later when Montana arrived. He and Chandler are the only 
quarterbacks to start games for six different teams. DeBerg has 
done it for the 49ers, Broncos, Bucs, Chiefs, Dolphins and Falcons; 
Chandler for the Colts, Bucs, Cardinals, Rams, Oilers and Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	That turned out to be the story of DeBerg's career. And despite  
Walsh's label, he was usually in demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little too good to be a backup. So when a star came in  
and took my job, someone else always wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's perfect preparation for coaching.  
</P>
<P>
	Someone always wants him.  
</P>
<P>
	Then someone lets him go.

<HEADLINE> Judge Clears Way for ABL Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge terminated the contracts  
of players from the defunct American Basketball League on 
Wednesday, freeing up those players to resume their careers 
overseas or in the rival WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ABL folded three days before Christmas and sought  
bankruptcy protection, player and coach contracts were frozen. That 
prevented them from pursuing deals with teams in women's pro 
leagues around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Marilyn Morgan approved a motion  
filed Jan. 19 by the ABL seeking to immediately terminate all 
players' and coaches' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have moved as quickly as possible within the legal  
constraints of bankruptcy to allow our players and coaches to find 
other jobs,'' ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli said. ``With today's 
ruling, all ABL players and coaches now are free to obtain other 
basketball-related employment in this country or overseas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also approved a loan allowing the ABL to give priority  
to paying its former employees. Former ABL employees, including 
players and coaches, will receive their December salaries through 
Dec. 24, as well as some accrued vacation, up to a maximum of 
$4,300 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments are expected to be made within two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Cavalli said the league is in the process of liquidating assets  
so it can reimburse ticket holders and pay creditors.

<HEADLINE> TV Execs Buoyed by Midseason Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may have been a little too early to declare  
the television season a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected string of midseason success stories has buoyed the  
spirits of broadcasters. The latest was the debut of ``Dilbert,'' 
which on Monday night achieved the highest ratings for a comedy in 
UPN's four-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's uplifting ``Providence'' is off to a faster start than any  
NBC drama since ``ER,'' Fox is pleased with its animated comedy 
``The PJs,'' and CBS has so far successfully cloned ``60 Minutes'' 
on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quieted, at least for now, all the talk about the exodus of  
viewers that had grown louder with a lackluster fall season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shows that launched this midseason all have one thing in  
common: Generally speaking, they're excellent shows,'' said UPN 
programming chief Tom Nunan. ``These shows all have an original 
voice to them and they're of unusual quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the initial success may also force executives to rethink the  
wisdom of launching dozens of new shows each September, 
overwhelming viewers with options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew they were coming,'' said Sandy Grushow,  
president of Twentieth Century Fox Television. ``Why did everybody 
know they were coming? Well, they weren't competing with 50 other 
shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A midseason start enables networks to promote the shows one at a  
time, which Nunan said particularly helped ``Dilbert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	January is truly prime time: Winter forces more viewers indoors  
and light post-holiday advertising gives networks extra time to 
tout their own programs, said Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, an 
advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood's tradition of starting most shows in the fall is  
largely dictated by advertisers. TV executives announce a fall 
schedule in May so advertisers can buy commercial time on what they 
think will be hot shows. 
</P>
<P>
	None of last September's shows can be called hits, despite  
critical praise for ``Sportsnight,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and 
``Cupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all to some extent a prisoner of the system that has  
been in place for so long,'' said Lloyd Braun, chairman of Buena 
Vista Television Production. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately that tradition has eroded. ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``King  
of the Hill'' are two shows that successfully launched the last few 
winters. CBS's ``Becker'' was an early-season replacement that last 
week made Nielsen Media Research's top 10 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's lesson may mean fewer new shows next fall, Nunan  
said. His worry is that January will eventually become as crowded 
as September. 
</P>
<P>
	Midseason starts don't guarantee success. NBC's ``Lateline''  
failed last winter and failed again when it came back this month. 
CBS's ``Turks'' hasn't broken any records. 
</P>
<P>
	The real test for the new hotshots will be if people come back  
after the initial curiosity fades, said Preston Beckman, NBC's 
executive vice president of program planning and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's encouraging that networks can still collect a large  
number of people to watch our shows, I think it will be hard on us 
if we convince ourselves that there's something about midseason,'' 
Beckman said. ``I think there's something about great shows.''

<HEADLINE> Horses Also Involved in Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The wooing of an international Olympic  
official at a New South Wales zoo reportedly resulted in Australia 
spending nearly $150,000 transporting seven rare Mongolian horses 
to the Gobi Desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission, touted by the state government as an environmental  
``gift to the world,'' stemmed from a promise from the Sydney bid 
team to Mongolian International Olympic Committee member Shagdarjav 
Magvan, The Australian newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the undertaking was made in 1993 during  
Magvan's tour of the city's Olympic facilities, which included a 
trip to the Western Plains Zoo at Dubbo. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo director Ian Denney said Magvan was surprised during his  
visit that the zoo was successfully breeding takhi horses -- 
Mongolia's national symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Bid organizers contacted the federal government to seal the  
deal, which was announced two months before the IOC voted to choose 
the host of the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Denney said the cost of the project, initially estimated at less  
than $60,000, rose when Mongolia was unable to pick up the horses 
from Singapore as originally planned, and Australia had to ship 
them the rest of the way.

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers are making  
progress as the delayed start of the NBA season approaches. Coach 
Del Harris just isn't sure how much progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he's never been in this position before.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're doing all right,'' Harris said after a scrimmage  
Wednesday night. ``I like the guys' attitudes. We've got work to 
do. I'm counting on guys really applying themselves these last 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played a little better, a little less sloppy  
(than in Monday night's scrimmage at UC Santa Barbara). But we 
still obviously need all the time we have allotted to us to smooth 
our game out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were making their first appearance at the Forum in  
eight months -- since they were swept by Utah in the Western 
Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17,505-seat arena was about half full. The fans were quite  
receptive and pretty boisterous throughout the scrimmage, which 
lasted a little over two hours. Tickets were distributed free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The scrimmage consisted of five periods, with players being used  
on both the Gold and Purple teams and the score reverting to 0-0 at 
the beginning of each period. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal's first shot was blocked from the side by  
6-foot-6 rookie Ruben Patterson, drawing oohs and aahs from the 
crowd. Shortly thereafter, the fans groaned when O'Neal missed his 
first two foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were two of the few he missed, though. O'Neal led all  
scorers with 31 points including 9-of-14 from the foul line. Rick 
Fox scored 26 points, Bryant had 23, and Patterson and Travis 
Knight added 20 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Sam Jacobson missed most of the scrimmage after suffering  
a strained hip flexor. He's listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who practiced formally for the first time at UC  
Santa Barbara last Thursday, face the Los Angeles Clippers in 
exhibition games Friday and Saturday nights, and open the 
abbreviated season Feb. 5 against the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the scrimmage, 12-year-old actress Lindsay Ridgeway sang  
``The Star Spangled Banner,'' and longtime announcer Chick Hearn, 
who hasn't missed a Lakers broadcast in over 34 years, introduced 
Harris and the team's 14 players. 
</P>
<P>
	It was almost as if the lockout had never occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to see you back,'' Hearn told the cheering fans.  
``And this is only the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things were handled quite informally. Harris and each player  
spoke briefly to the crowd from midcourt before the scrimmage 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	The warmest receptions went to Hearn, O'Neal, Bryant and Eddie  
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the LA fans -- the best fans in the world,'' O'Neal  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player heard some boos mixed in with the cheers --  
backup forward/center Elden Campbell, the subject of preseason 
trade rumors but apparently about to start his ninth year with the 
team.

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Corn Up; Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn futures advanced Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans continued their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose amid concern that above-normal temperatures  
and dry weather in winter wheat growing regions would leave crops 
emerging from dormancy vulnerable to a late-season cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures traded both sides, tugged higher by the strength in  
wheat and a lack of farmer selling of stored crops, but pressured 
by beneficial weather in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also advanced amid ideas that U.S. farmers would plant  
fewer acres to corn and wheat crops this spring because of better 
asking prices for soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans slumped to their lowest since mid-1987 as rains  
returned to growing regions in Argentina and Brazil, putting 
farmers there on track toward bumper harvests. That would come at a 
time when U.S. exports are lagging because of economic turmoil 
across the globe, particularly in the key Asian buying region. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.73 1/4 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.16 a bushel; March oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.06 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 2 3/4 cents to $5.10 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures advanced on Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .20 cent to 62.17 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose .27 cent to 72.92 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose 1.15 cents t o 41.95 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
rose 1.58 cents to 55.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> White House May Skip Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are struggling to reach a bipartisan  
timetable for the remainder of President Clinton's impeachment 
trial as the White House signals it may forgo defense witnesses if 
there's no new damaging testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republican leader Trent Lott and Democratic leader Tom  
Daschle expressed hope they could present a proposal today to 
conclude the trial by Feb. 12 or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement approved in party meetings would be presented for  
approval in today's impeachment trial session. If a negotiated 
settlement for the rest of the trial eludes senators, they still 
would need to approve procedures for depositions of Monica 
Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide 
Sidney Blumenthal. These issues are expected to be the only 
business in the proceeding today. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers, meanwhile, let Daschle know their views on  
the possibility of forgoing witnesses, according to senior 
presidential advisers who would not be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense team said, first, that there would have to be no new  
damaging information from the three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House also wants the Senate to decide against live  
testimony and opposes a Republican idea that Clinton could be found 
guilty but not removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, one legal adviser said the White House  
was comfortable to just argue the facts ``and bring this to a 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday morning, Lott had said he was seeking a conclusion of  
the perjury and obstruction-of-justice case by Feb. 6, but he 
backed off that date when negotiations picked up in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the proposal and the negotiations, the Senate took  
back-to-back votes that demonstrated that Democrats have the muscle 
to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to convict Clinton and 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	First, senators defeated a motion by Democrat Robert Byrd of  
West Virginia to dismiss the case. With only 34 votes needed to 
block conviction, the Democrats produced 44 votes for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Democrat, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, voted ``no''  
along with 55 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, senators cast their votes in favor of deposing  
Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal. With Feingold again joining 
Republicans for a 56-44 margin, Democrats demonstrated a second 
time that the 67 votes for conviction are not there. 
</P>
<P>
	A USA Today-CNN-Gallup poll released today found that 44 percent  
of the 645 adults surveyed approve of calling witnesses and 54 
percent disapprove. The poll had a margine of error of 4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	After the back-to-back votes Wednesday, Republicans and  
Democrats turned to working separately on proposals, including 
different approaches to possible resolutions condemning Clinton's 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats worked on language that would condemn Clinton's  
extramarital affair with Ms. Lewinsky, but without a finding of 
guilt. Republicans discussed a finding that Clinton committed 
perjury and obstruction but separate that issue from a vote to 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a widespread feeling on both sides of the  
aisle that some expression of the inappropriateness of the behavior 
is a good idea,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters Wednesday that ``right now, everybody  
understands that we're going to the subpoenas and the depositions 
of these three witnesses. We'll need to see what that reveals. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then everybody will have a chance to read it and decide  
what they want to do at that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said Democrats were ``very opposed'' to any proposal  
that would include a finding of guilt against Clinton that was 
separate from a vote on the actual articles of impeachment. Such a 
finding would only need a majority of 51 senators, a vote 
Republicans could win at the cost of ending the case with partisan 
rancor.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Feel Loyalty, Unease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan is a country that fashions itself as  
a lonely oasis of calm in a brawling region. But even Jordanians 
can't help but be unsettled by their king's relapse of cancer just 
days after he named a new -- and inexperienced -- heir. 
</P>
<P>
	Respect for King Hussein -- and his move to depose his brother,  
Prince Hassan, in favor of his oldest son -- remains genuine, and 
his popularity has mounted during his six-month battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But that devotion is tinged with unease at the prospect of an  
untested future king and the suddenness of his decision to dismiss 
a brother groomed for 34 years to rule the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a shock when we heard the news, and we feel very  
sorry about that,'' said Walid Ishaq, a 42-year-old unemployed 
Jordanian sitting at a crowded, smoky cafe in downtown Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people are familiar with Prince Hassan, but now he has  
become nothing. This is unbelievable,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the country was flush with optimism when King  
Hussein returned aboard a plane he piloted himself after treatment 
in the United States for non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	His homecoming, though, soon took on the appearance of a last  
will and testament. He dismissed Hassan in an angry letter that 
spoke of ``gossip and lies'' about the king's wife and children. He 
then named his 36-year-old son, Prince Abdullah, as heir to the 
throne. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the king, leaning on a cane, returned to the Mayo  
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to treat a relapse of his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's private physician, Lt. Gen. Dr. Samir Farraj, said  
Thursday that the king was feeling better after undergoing 
chemotherapy as part of a 10-day treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
	``His majesty's general health is stable and he's feeling better  
than yesterday,'' he said in a statement issued through the Mayo 
Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``God willing, he'll get his health back. We hope so,'' said  
Khaled al-Nadi, an employee at the Palestine Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	He said twice as many Jordanians as usual had come to the  
exchange over the past week to change their dinars into dollars -- a 
poignant sign of unease over the kingdom's future. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market, too, has dropped this week amid the anxiety.  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the economy seems to be on the mind of many Jordanians.  
Unemployment stands at 15 percent officially -- as high as 28 
percent unofficially -- in a country where the average family 
numbers seven. The government is also struggling with $6.1 billion 
in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see all the people here -- without jobs, without  
anything,'' said Mahmoud Suleiman, another customer at the Salah 
el-Din Cafe. ``My neck is under the foot of the rich people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economic expertise was where Hassan had gained his renown. He  
pushed privatization and an export-oriented policy and often 
sounded the theme of Jordan's need to modernize for the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	As an academic whose prose tended toward the turgid -- in stark  
contrast to his charismatic brother -- Hassan had little heartfelt 
support among Jordanians, many of whom viewed him as remote. 
</P>
<P>
	But Western-educated economists and businessmen who stood to  
gain from the privatization allied themselves with him. Many 
question the political skills of Abdullah, a product of the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears are sometimes heard in the cafes and shops of Amman,  
where the once-common pictures of Hassan have been hastily removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray to God to give the king more life so that he has time  
to give his son experience,'' said Hassan Mahmoud, who runs a store 
overflowing with peanuts, pistachios and pumpkin seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	For a second day, tribesmen in red-checkered headscarves,  
Christian clerics in black robes and even a famous Jordanian singer 
poured into a hilltop palace in Amman to offer gifts and recite 
poetry in a sign of devotion to the new crown prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers were filled with ads and statements of congratulation  
from Jordanians as well as Arab and Western leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the king decides, we have to abide by because he's the  
decision-maker,'' Mahmoud said. ``We have to follow him.''

<HEADLINE> Census Plan Still in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the 2000 census plans still in dispute, a  
leading House Republican on the issue said Wednesday the government 
should spend more money and hire at least 100,000 more people next 
year to count Americans one by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Miller of Florida said the administration will be  
challenged in Congress and in court if it tries to go ahead with 
partial use of the statistical sampling system the Supreme Court 
ruled out for purposes of reapportioning House seats among the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the constitutional purpose of the census every 10th  
year. But the numbers also are used to redistrict House, 
legislative and other constituencies within the states and for 
apportionment of about $182 billion a year in federal aid among 
cities and states. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and the Census Bureau say they plan to go ahead with  
the sampling process, a sort of gigantic poll, to cover people in 
poor and minority neighborhoods hardest to reach by mailed surveys 
and follow-up head counts. 
</P>
<P>
	That would produce one count for reapportionment, a second for  
the other purposes. ``It's absolutely going to be a disaster if we 
have a two-number census,'' Miller, chairman of the House 
Government Reform census subcommittee, told the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, the panel's ranking  
Democrat, said sampling should be used to obtain the most accurate 
count possible for federal aid and redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said an attempt to do that for redistricting would be  
contested in court, but he suggested possible room for compromise 
on federal aid apportionment. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney said if the Republican-controlled Congress seeks to  
block all use of sampling when it votes to renew money allocations 
for the census, which are due to expire June 15, President Clinton 
would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The counting system has been in political dispute because the  
people and areas most likely to be undercounted involve those who 
tend to vote Democratic. The use of sampling to add them could put 
Republicans at a disadvantage in elections after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	They contend that sampling would invite rigging.  
</P>
<P>
	``You won on the issue of reapportionment,'' Detroit Mayor  
Dennis Archer told Miller. ``But at least make sure that the men 
and women and children who live in our cities are treated fairly.'' 
He said the way to do that is with sampling-adjusted figures for 
federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 census missed an estimated 1.4 percent of the  
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller announced a plan he said would ``ensure an accurate,  
reliable and honest head count'' using traditional mail and 
door-to-door census taking. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his proposals:  
</P>
<P>
	--A minimum 100,000 additional census takers to work exclusively  
in areas most difficult to count. 
</P>
<P>
	--Additional funds including $300 million more to advertise the  
census. 
</P>
<P>
	--A system in which mayors and other local officials review and  
check census numbers before they are final.

<HEADLINE> Key U.S. Soccer Stars Change Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three of the biggest names in American soccer  
found new teams Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Alexi Lalas were traded from  
the New York/New Jersey MetroStars for midfielder Mark Chung and 
goalkeeper Mike Ammann. D.C. United midfielder John Harkes was 
loaned to last-place Nottingham Forest through the conclusion of 
England's Premier League season, which ends in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, D.C. United acquired Diego Sonora, a midfielder and  
defender from Argentina who played for the MetroStars, in a 
three-way deal that sent D.C. United's first-round 1999 college 
draft pick (the 11th overall) and its second-round selection to San 
Jose. The MetroStars get United's second- and third-round picks in 
2000 and San Jose's third-round pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars' deal was designed to free up room under the  
salary cap to obtain a scorer, perhaps San Jose's Eric Wynalda, who 
is on loan to Leon in Mexico's first division until May. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, 29, has just started to resurrect his international  
career under Bruce Arena, his former coach at the University of 
Virginia and the new coach of the U.S. national team. Meola was in 
goal for Sunday's scoreless tie in an exhibition game at Bolivia, 
his 88nd international appearance but his first since July 4, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the starter during the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and has  
28 shutouts in his international career. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes, 31, played for the United States in the 1990 and 1994  
World Cups and was captain of the team when he was unexpectedly 
dropped last spring by coach Steve Sampson, who quit after the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining D.C. United, Harkes played in England with  
Sheffield Wednesday, Derby and West Ham. He will remain with 
Nottingham Forest until after the English season, which ends in 
May. He may appear Saturday against Everton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad it's all sorted out,'' Nottingham Forest coach Ron  
Atkinson said. ``John will prove to be a worthwhile acquisition and 
will more than likely play some part on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes, who has six goals in 90 international appearances,  
played under Atkinson at Sheffield Wednesday. He became the first 
American to collect a winners' medal at Wembley when Wednesday beat 
Manchester United in the 1991 League Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Lalas, 28, started in the 1994 tournament, has 96 international  
appearances and was one of the loudest voices against Sampson, who 
limited the playing time of many veterans last summer in France, 
where the Americans went 0-3 and finished last in the 32-nation 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a 28-year-old who has made 24 international appearances,  
had 20 goals in 93 regular-season games with Kansas City the past 
three years and one goal in seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Amman, 27, spent two seasons with Charlton Athletic in England's  
first division and played in 60 regular-season and two postseason 
games with Kansas City the past three years, getting 10 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonora, 29, played for Dallas in its first two MLS seasons, then  
joined the MetroStars last season.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Protect Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, while  
praising President Clinton's plan to use budget surpluses to shore 
up Social Security, said Thursday that any permanent solution will 
almost certainly require either benefit cuts or higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, meanwhile, were even more pointed in their  
criticism of the plan Clinton unveiled in last week's State of the 
Union address. They charged that on closer examination, the 
administration is relying on funny bookkeeping to dodge the tough 
choices needed to provide retirement benefits for 75 million baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici called Clinton's  
program an ``elaborate shell game'' to make the Social Security and 
Medicare programs appear to be in better shape than they are. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were quick to defend their accounting  
methods. But the rising volume of GOP criticism underscored the 
hurdles Clinton faces in trying to win congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's plan, $2.7 trillion of $4.4 trillion in  
projected government surpluses over the next 15 years would be 
devoted to bolstering the Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would use another $700 billion of the surpluses to put  
more resources into Medicare, the health system for the elderly and 
disabled. The remaining $1 trillion would be split equally between 
new spending and the creation of new, private retirement savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan called Clinton's effort to reserve the surpluses ``a  
major step in the right direction.'' But he repeated his concerns 
raised last week about one element of the program, Clinton's 
proposal to invest $700 billion directly in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with Herculean efforts,'' Greenspan said, he doubted that  
such huge amounts of money could be insulated from political 
pressures to influence where the investments go. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told lawmakers they should also understand that  
Clinton's program isn't a total solution for the shortfall Social 
Security will face as the baby boomers retire in coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Social Security payroll taxes total 12.4 percent of  
workers' wages, split evenly and paid by employees and employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all likelihood these taxes will have to be raised, or  
benefits cut, given that the system as a whole is still 
significantly underfunded,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan chaired the blue ribbon commission that 16 years ago  
recommended a combination of benefit cuts and higher taxes to meet 
an earlier Social Security funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify what actions should be taken this time  
around. The most obvious, he noted, are raising the retirement age 
further or lowering the annual cost-of-living increase in Social 
Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	But raising taxes for Social Security could well prove ``too  
burdensome'' given that the government's giant Medicare program 
will also need bolstering in coming decades, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart called  
Greenspan's support for reserving the surpluses and paying down the 
national debt a ``very important validation of this program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the issue of possible tax increases or benefit cuts, Lockhart  
said, ``We could not agree with him more on the fact that we need 
to do more. The president has made clear that he needs to work with 
Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans accused Clinton of using surpluses to dodge the  
tough choices that ultimately will be needed to rescue Social 
Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, the administration is pre-committing the government  
to pay for an additional $3.5 trillion in Social Security and 
Medicare benefits instead of making the difficult choices that are 
necessary to really keep these programs solvent,'' said Domenici, 
R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said, ``The president extends the  
lifespan of Social Security by double-counting the projected 
surplus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Social Security is collecting $100 billion more than  
it needs each year to pay out current benefits. An IOU for that 
amount is deposited in the Social Security trust fund and the money 
is spent on other government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's new proposal would continue to employ this system --  
but it would also deposit in the trust fund a second IOU 
representing the amount that growing surpluses will allow the 
government to pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials concede that the bookkeeping appears  
complex. But they say the bottom line is that Clinton's approach 
would reduce the national debt and put the government's books in 
better shape to deal with future retirement payments.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Sailors Can Leave Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- The first of 23 stranded Pakistani  
sailors aboard a crippled cargo ship have come ashore after 
spending two months anchored off the Texas coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the Delta Pride had survived on donations of food,  
drinking water, medicine and other supplies before the Coast Guard 
on Wednesday permitted two of the sailors to step foot on Texas 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two men who were allowed to leave first were in bad  
condition,'' Capt. Maqsood Ahmed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sailors will be allowed ashore in the next several days.  
Several crew members, including the captain, will stay aboard to 
ensure the ship's safety while negotiations are under way on its 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two off the 740-foot ship were Ghulam Haider, a welder  
who suffered from a disease with symptoms like that of a stroke, 
and deck hand Ilyas Inapt. Inapt received word this week that two 
of his brothers in Karachi, Pakistan, had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Before making its way to the Texas coast, the Delta Pride spent  
five months in Tampico, Mexico, after its owner, Tri-star Shipping 
Lines of Karachi, went bankrupt. Mexican officials seized the 
ship's documents and crew's passports because of a financial 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ship was stranded off Mexico, crew members drank  
rainwater they collected and ate fish they caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain said earlier that he was inspired to turn the vessel  
northward toward the United States after he found a $10 U.S. bill 
on board and read the words, ``In God We Trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ship sailed into U.S. waters Nov. 24. But it was denied  
permission to enter the Port of Brownsville because it lacked a 
certificate of financial responsibility that guarantees the ship's 
owner pays if the vessel causes environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks Acquire Marha From Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Blackhawks acquired center Josef  
Marha on Thursday from the Anaheim Mighty Ducks for future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Marha played in 10 games this season for Anaheim, recording one  
assist. He also played three games with Cincinnati's AHL team, 
scoring one goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marha has played for Anaheim and Colorado in his four seasons in  
the NHL, scoring 21 career points (nine goals, 12 assists) in 41 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 205-pound native of the Czech Republic was picked  
35th overall by Quebec in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. After three 
years of playing in the Czech Republic, he came to North America in 
1995 and played for Cornwall of the AHL. In 74 games, he scored 48 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The next season, Marha helped the Hershey Bears to the 1997  
Calder Cup Championship, leading the AHL in playoff assists (16) 
and points (22) in 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He split time between Hershey and the Colorado Avalanche last  
season before being traded to Anaheim in March.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Bryant Nears Pact Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant has said he hopes to be a Laker  
for life. He's about to take a significant step closer to that 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed Thursday the  
team is on the verge of signing Bryant to a long-term contract 
extension, reportedly a six-year deal worth about $70 million -- 
believed to be close to the maximum he can earn under the new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to get a contract extension signed tomorrow,'' Black  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About to start his third NBA season although he won't turn 21  
until next August, Bryant made it clear at the team's media day 
Wednesday he has never thought about changing teams, even though he 
would have had that option when his three-year rookie contract 
expires at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going anywhere,'' he said. ``It was kind of funny  
(during the offseason and lockout) sitting back, listening to what 
people were saying, where I was going to go. I wasn't going 
anywhere. I definitely want to play here.

	``Picture yourself being a kid, watching Magic (Johnson) and  
(James) Worthy, being a huge Laker fan. It's a dream. I don't want 
to go anywhere, it's never been on my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has given teams a seven-week window which opened Jan. 21  
to use the so-called ``Bird rights'' to extend the contracts of 
second-year players for any salary up to the maximum, regardless of 
salary-cap limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim -- two other prominent  
players who began their NBA careers the same time as Bryant, have 
both signed six-year contracts worth nearly $71 million this week 
with the Philadelphia 76ers and Vancouver Grizzlies, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant's new deal is believed to be very similar to the  
contracts signed by Iverson and Abdur-Rahim. The contract for 
Bryant, as with Iverson, is believed to have an ``out'' clause 
after five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant was scheduled to make $1.3 million this season before the  
lockout. The extension starts with next season, and runs through 
the 2004-2005 season. Bryant will reportedly earn $14.62 million in 
the final year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant was the 13th player selected in the 1996 NBA draft, being  
taken at age 17 by the Charlotte Hornets after attending Lower 
Merion, Pa., High School. He was then traded to the Lakers for 
center Vlade Divac, who is now with the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant averaged 7.6 points in 71 games for the Lakers as a  
rookie, and 15.4 points in 79 games last season, when he became the 
youngest player in league history to start an All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar continued rising against the Japanese  
yen Thursday, as a rallying stock market and another batch of 
robust economic reports contrasted sharply with Japan's ongoing 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the euro as enthusiasm for the new  
currency continued to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has made up its mind, and the dollar is being  
bought across the board,'' said Jesper Dannesboe, a Treasury bond 
economist at ABN-AMRO in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.1410 in late New York trading, falling  
from $1.1430 late Wednesday. The dollar was trading at 116.40 yen, 
up from 115.82 on Wednesday and 113.82 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors bought dollars as a raft of positive economic news  
underpinned advances in the markets. Wages and benefits rose 3.4 
percent in 1998, marking the third consecutive year of improvement 
in the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, first-time unemployment applications dropped sharply last  
week for the second consecutive week and durable goods orders 
jumped 1.9 percent in December to $193 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks helped pump up investor courage Thursday, as the  
Nasdaq Stock Market hit record territory and the Dow Jones 
industrial average rose 81.10 points, to 9,281.33.U.S. Treasury 
bond prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has been very resilient in the face of the Brazil  
situation,'' where the government devalued its currency and its 
markets have been foundering, said Elena Shperling, chief currency 
trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York. ``That, of course, helps 
the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a top official at the Moody's credit rating agency  
warned that Japan's public sector debt was rising to unprecedented 
proportions and that the country risked further degradation of its 
rating within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Moody's lowered its rating of all securities issued  
or guaranteed by the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
	This added to Japan's continuing problems as it suffers its  
worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With the U.S. economy continuing to evince strength, and as  
inflation remains low, analysts said it is likely the Federal 
Reserve is going to hold interest rates steady. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, ``people are expecting a rate cut as early as  
next week'' at the new European Central Bank as Europe fights off 
its economic problems, Shperling said, adding that investors were 
shifting to dollars to take advantage of the interest rate 
differential. The euro suffered by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4103 Swiss francs, up from 1.4100,  
and 1.5183 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5203. The British pound 
rose to $1.6493 from $1.6458. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7141 German 
marks, up from 1.7112; 5.7504 French francs, up from 5.7405; and 
1,697.79 Italian lire, up from 1,694.92.

<P>
	EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- Two military fighter jets  
collided Thursday afternoon and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. 
Both pilots ejected and apparently suffered no major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-15 Eagle fighters from the 53rd Wing, which tests  
operational weapons and electronic warfare equipment at Elgin Air 
Force Base in the Florida Panhandle, were on a training mission 
when they collided, the Air Force said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Curt Rackley and Maj. Joe Hruska were in formation  
about 75 miles south of Eglin over the Gulf of Mexico practicing 
air-to-air combat against three F-16s when their jets collided, 
said Col. Doug Richardson, the 53rd Wing commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots were rescued within two hours and taken to a base  
hospital, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force assigned a team of officers to investigate the  
accident. No details on the jets' speed or altitude were 
immediately released.

<HEADLINE> Treasure Chest Might Not Be So Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A trunk purportedly  
found in the desert stuffed with relics of a tragic Gold Rush 
expedition contained materials that weren't made until years if not 
decades later, the National Park Service says. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert analysis released Wednesday found that some artifacts  
in the chest were made much later than 1850, the date of a manifest 
that an amateur archaeologist claims was tucked in with the 
treasures when he found them in a cave here. 
</P>
<P>
	The amateur, Jerry Freeman, touted the chest full of gold coins  
and other items as a relic of the ``Lost Pioneers'' of 1849, a 
group that got stuck in Death Valley while hunting for a shortcut 
to the Mother Lode. He said Wednesday he stands by his story. 
</P>
<P>
	Glue used in three items contained a 20th century polymer, said  
park Superintendent Richard Martin, who brought in an archaeologist 
to study the find. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, two tintype photographs were developed with a  
process that wasn't patented until 1856, and a porcelain bowl had a 
1914 manufacturer's mark. 
</P>
<P>
	A Park Service announcement of the findings laid out the dates,  
but stopped short of calling the trunk a fake, or casting blame on 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure people are going to say the Park Service says its a  
hoax,'' supervisory Ranger Terry Baldino told The Daily News of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't say that. All we can say is this can't be associated  
with the original '49ers.'' He said authorities may never figure 
out the chest's origins. 
</P>
<P>
	The trunk held gold and silver coins dating from 1849 and  
earlier, old baby shoes, a holstered pistol, a wooden powder horn, 
a locket adorned with pearls and china bowls. There was also a 
letter purportedly by '49er William Robinson, one of the members of 
the ill-fated group, who died in January 1850. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, a 56-year-old semi-retired substitute high school  
teacher, says he found the chest in a cave on Nov. 22 while 
retracing the path of the ill-fated expedition. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman says he took the chest home -- though it's illegal to  
remove such artifacts from a national park. On Wednesday, he said 
he regretted removing the chest because that made it harder to 
authenticate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had I acted less as a wide-eyed Indiana Jones and more as the  
professional anthropologist I profess to be, there might have been 
a different resolution to the park's findings,'' he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman called a news conference early this year to announce  
he'd found the chest. Amid a flurry of news reports, he promised to 
turn the chest over the Park Service, and led rangers to a cave 
where he said he found it. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests were conducted by conservators from the Smithsonian  
Institution in Washington, D.C., and Gretchen Voeks, a metals 
expert and curator at the Western Archaeological and Conservation 
Center in Tucson, Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Store Lets HIV-Positive Boy Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- An HIV-positive boy barred from a Kroger  
store play area now is welcome under new health guidelines 
announced Thursday by the nation's largest grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger was accused of discrimination for refusing to let Georgio  
Lee Chacon, now 7, play in a PePe's Playhouse in August 1997. 
Kroger denied the allegation and said it also had turned away 
children with chickenpox and other contagious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new guidelines, children with infectious conditions --  
including HIV -- will be allowed in the play areas so long as 
parents fill out a health checklist and the children do not display 
symptoms such as fever, vomiting, pinkeye and mouth sores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will provide play area attendants more  
education on infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that they need to protect people, but they should have  
found out before that he wasn't a risk,'' said Barb Cordle, 
Georgio's legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cordle, a nurse who operates a group home for AIDS and HIV  
patients, brought Georgio back to the store and play area Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati-based Kroger operates about 110 of the play areas in  
the chain's approximately 1,400 grocery stores in 24 states.

</P>
<P>
	Russell Hiatt has toiled over hair tonics and straight razors at

<HEADLINE> Wages, Benefits Rise 3.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brisk economic growth in 1998 pushed up  
Americans' wages and benefits by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip in 
five years and a slight improvement over 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain reported today by the Labor Department in its  
Employment Cost Index marked the third consecutive year of 
improvement. Wages and benefits rose 3.3 percent in 1997, 2.9 
percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, inflation has been decreasing, so workers'  
purchasing power has shown significant gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``American workers have taken full advantage of their increased  
spending power. Taking their fat wallets to the malls, they have 
propelled the economy forward,'' said economist Oscar Gonzalez of 
John Hancock in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the same numbers that cheer employees have raised  
concern at the inflation-wary Federal Reserve and among businesses, 
particularly manufacturers, who face a profit crunch as they 
attempt to compete against firms operating in Asian and Latin 
American countries with devalued currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, wage and benefit growth was more subdued in  
manufacturing, 2.7 percent, and in transportation and material 
moving, 1.4 percent. It was minuscule in health services, 0.9 
percent, compared with annual rates pushing 7 percent in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation increased strongly at public utilities, 5 percent,  
reflecting deregulation, particularly of telephone companies, and 
in finance, insurance and real estate, up 5.9 percent, reflecting 
record home sales and an expanding mutual-fund industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The increases also varied considerably by region. Compensation  
increased 4.9 percent in the West, helped by strong growth in the 
high-tech sector, but just 2.6 percent in the South, where the 
textile and apparel industry has been hurt by imports. Compensation 
increased 3.3 percent in both the Northeast and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Labor Department said seasonally adjusted  
first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped sharply 
last week for the second week in a row after shooting up during 
late December and early January. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-week low of 301,000 claims were filed, down from 316,000  
the week before and 360,000 the week before that. A department 
analyst said the total appears to have returned to a level closer 
to the longer-term trend after some difficulty adjusting the 
statistics for seasonal fluctuation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories for  
big-ticket durable goods jumped 1.9 percent in December to a 
seasonally adjusted $193 billion, ending the weakest year since the 
last recession on a strong note. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, orders for durable goods -- items from air  
conditioners to aircraft expected to last three or more years -- 
rose just 3.5 percent, the smallest gain since orders fell in 1991 
and a marked deceleration from 1997's 7.1 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers, who meet next week on whether or  
not to change interest rates, are sorting through conflicting 
trends in the economy, including strong labor demand, which pushed 
the 1998 unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.5 percent, and 
weakness from overseas, which is hurting manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Low interest rates, along with the strong wage and benefit  
increases, have fueled robust consumer spending, more than 
compensating for waning demand abroad. But, many economists are 
looking for more moderate economic growth this year and, thus, 
believe compensation costs will not accelerate further. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in just wages and salaries, excluding benefits such  
as health insurance, actually slowed slightly in 1998, to 3.7 
percent, compared with 3.8 percent in 1997. Benefit costs, however, 
increased 2.6 percent, up from 2.1 percent in 1997 and the 
strongest pace in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter alone, wage and benefit costs rose 0.7  
percent, compared with 1 percent in the July-September quarter. 
Wages and salaries were up 0.7 percent and benefits, 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ind. Official An Alleged Embezzler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- As supervisor of Indiana's child support  
program, David Scott was paid $26,287 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say he collected far more than that -- at least  
$680,000 -- during an eight-year scheme in which he created phony 
child support cases to finance sexual relationships with three 
women. They say it is the worst case of embezzlement in state 
government history. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who is a married father of two, was charged Wednesday  
with five counts of forgery and one count each of corrupt business 
influence, theft, computer tampering and official misconduct. Four 
women were also arrested in connection with the alleged scam, three 
women with whom he allegedly had affairs, and the 21-year-old 
daughter of one of the three. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am dismayed that there weren't in place the kind of  
accounting controls that could have prevented this,'' said Marion 
County prosecutor Scott Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, 36, resigned Nov. 18 as agency officials prepared to fire  
him. He turned himself in at police headquarters Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Family and Social Services Administration is Indiana's  
largest state government agency, controlling about a third of the 
$9 billion annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was one of only three employees with full access to  
computerized records of the approximately 300,000 active child 
support cases. Officials say he was able to create bogus accounts 
because no one was looking over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``David Scott was a supervisor within that area. He had many  
clearances that other employees do not have,'' said Venita J. 
Moore, acting FSSA secretary. ``Our system just did not keep up 
with his will to steal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said Scott allegedly issued 360 false checks totaling  
$684,516 to himself and four women acquaintances starting in 
January 1991, then erased the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The money came from an account that holds child support payments  
for people who can't be found or those tied up in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money allegedly was used to pay off personal debts  
and to buy a fur coat, a car and furniture. An exotic dancer used 
some of the money to buy breast implants, Newman said, and money 
was used by some of the women to buy crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators uncovered the scheme after the mother of an exotic  
dancer with whom Scott allegedly had a relationship asked 
authorities to check on her daughter, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dancer, Gina Calabris, told investigators she had been  
receiving phony child-support checks from Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Calabris, 29, was charged with theft and forgery, along with  
Brenda Mayfield, 41, a former FSSA employee, Melanie Abney, 37, and 
Abney's daughter, Ericka Norton, 21.

<HEADLINE> Senators Disagree Over Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate ran into political snags today over  
terms for taking depositions from three witnesses in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats objected to any plan that 
would include public showing of videotaped testimony from Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other Republicans said the  
possible videotape was the major disagreement, but Democrats said 
the dispute was much wider. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats said the Republicans refused to agree to a firm  
closing date for the trial. Many Republicans also were pressing to 
allow the Senate to conclude that Clinton committed offenses 
without removing him from office. And Republicans wouldn't rule out 
calling additional witnesses beyond the three already approved, 
Democrats complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told the Senate at midafternoon he still hoped for an  
agreement setting out arrangements to finish the depositions by 
next Tuesday and then wrap up the trial with closing debate and the 
votes on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there still were questions and differences about  
what to do next, now that the Senate has ordered Ms Lewinsky and 
two other witnesses questioned by House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been making progress,'' he said. Lott said the  
bargaining is complicated because it involves the House 
prosecutors, Clinton's defense team, lawyers for the witnesses, and 
the Senate, which will decide what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the floor, Lott said it was legalistic bargaining with  
lawyers on both sides trying to take ``a fair advantage'' in the 
witness questioning ordered by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses summoned by the Senate are Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton's  
friend Vernon Jordan, and White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	A public opinion poll published today showed that 57 percent of  
Americans disapprove of the Senate decision to continue the trial. 
The votes to do so and to call witnesses were identical, 56 to 44 
on Wednesday, majorities 11 votes short of the two-thirds it would 
take to convict Clinton and dismiss him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and some Democrats also argued strenuously  
against a GOP proposal that would let the Senate conclude Clinton 
committed some or all of the alleged offenses -- but would not 
remove him from office. The ``finding of fact'' would be by 
majority vote, while impeachment conviction and removal needs 
two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be able to do by majority vote what the  
Constitution contemplates by a two-thirds vote,'' said Sen. Richard 
Bryan, D-Nev. ``It would be constitutionally fraught with ... 
peril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, defended the proposal, saying the  
finding would be simply ``an expression of opinion of Congress'' 
and therefore could pass constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, press secretary Joe Lockhart renewed the White House  
appeal for a quick end to the trial, saying it was the Republicans 
who ``have made the choice that they want to keep this around for a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself was on Capitol Hill for a memorial service for  
Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles, who also was a former senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House on Wednesday signaled that it might skip asking  
for defense witnesses if no new significant information turned up 
in the depositions and other conditions were met. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle had expressed hope  
they could present a proposal today to conclude the trial by Feb. 
12 or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Any agreement approved in party meetings would be presented for  
approval in today's impeachment trial session. If a negotiated 
settlement for the rest of the trial eludes senators, they still 
would need to approve procedures for depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney 
Blumenthal. These issues are expected to be the only business in 
the proceeding today. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers, meanwhile, let Daschle know their views on  
the possibility of forgoing witnesses, according to senior 
presidential advisers who would not be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense team said, first, that there would have to be no new  
damaging information from the three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House also wants the Senate to decide against live  
testimony and opposes a Republican idea that Clinton could be found 
guilty but not removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, one legal adviser said the White House  
was comfortable to just argue the facts ``and bring this to a 
vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Senate took back-to-back votes that  
demonstrated that Democrats have the muscle to prevent the 
two-thirds majority needed to convict Clinton and remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	First, senators defeated a motion by Democrat Robert Byrd of  
West Virginia to dismiss the case. With only 34 votes needed to 
block conviction, the Democrats produced 44 votes for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Democrat, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, voted ``no''  
along with 55 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, senators cast their votes in favor of deposing  
Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal. With Feingold again joining 
Republicans for a 56-44 margin.

<HEADLINE> L.T. Is Michael Jordan of Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Super Bowl Special    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Taylor once described  
himself as a wild man in a wild game. 
</P>
<P>
	Many former teammates, opponents and football analysts simply  
call Taylor the greatest linebacker ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Michael Jordan of football,'' former New York Giants  
teammate and defensive end George Martin said earlier this week. 
``There is just that dominance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People describe Taylor as intense, passionate, determined,  
ferocious, powerful, fast, a raw talent. And, of course, there's 
the dark side. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was all of that off the field, too. He had  
well-publicized problems with substance abuse, money, temper, taxes 
and marriage both during his career and since his retirement after 
the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Taylor is considered for the Pro Football Hall of Fame  
on Saturday in Miami by a 36-man panel on the eve of the Super 
Bowl, that might be the one thing that keeps him from enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my mind, (he's) the best defensive player in the last 20  
years,'' Fox Sports analyst John Madden said in Miami. ``If that is 
the criteria to get in the Hall of Fame, he should be in the Hall 
of Fame. Now if they consider some of the other stuff off the 
field, then I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the rules are. But if it's what the guy did  
on the field, he sure should be in the Hall of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a 13-year career with the Giants that was highlighted by  
two Super Bowl championships and 10 straight Pro Bowl berths, 
Taylor forced offenses to change. 
</P>
<P>
	When a quarterback got to the line of scrimmage, he had to know  
where No. 56 was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Pass plays that were supposed to be a simple as 1-2-3 were  
foiled when Taylor got to the quarterback on two with a hit usually 
preceded by a karate chop across the arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Running away from Taylor was just as problematic. He would run  
from sideline to sideline and stop backs for 2-yard gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could have played in any decade and been outstanding in any  
decade,'' former Giants general manager and current NFL executive 
George Young said. ``The distinction that sets him apart is his 
ability to maintain his intensity over the longest period of time 
in a game and a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Countless times, Young has told the story of how he went to a  
North Carolina game to scout someone else and ended up focusing on 
Taylor play after play. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken by the lowly Giants with the No. 2 pick in the 1981 draft,  
Taylor turned them around in a season, leading New York to its 
first playoff berth in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone seems to have a favorite Taylor story.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw only played against  
Taylor once, in an '81 exhibition game. He remembers, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dang-near killed me,'' Bradshaw said. ``I just kept saying,  
`Who is this guy?' He kept coming from my blind side and just 
ripped my ribs to pieces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells, who coached Taylor most of his career, was the  
Giants' defensive coordinator that season, and he recalled a game 
against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was supposed to drop off in coverage on a play. Instead,  
he rushed in and sacked the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	When he got to the sideline, Parcells said, ``Lawrence, what are  
you doing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, yeah, I forgot, I was supposed to drop back.''  
</P>
<P>
	Later in the game, in the same situation, he was supposed to be  
in coverage. Instead, he blitzed, got another sack, and forced a 
fumble. Martin picked it up and ran for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	At the sidelines, L.T. was mobbed, but Parcells wasn't in the  
celebration. He stared at Taylor from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Their eyes met and Taylor slapped himself in the head and said,  
again, `Oh, I forgot again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said, ``Lawrence, we don't have what you're doing in  
the play book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, coach, maybe we should put it in.''  
</P>
<P>
	The next day, it was in the game plan. And it stayed there.  
</P>
<P>
	Former Washington offensive tackle Mark May said then-coach Joe  
Gibbs started putting in special sliding defenses for Taylor, 
although Gibbs never called them ``Giants defenses.'' It was the 
``blue package,'' although part of the terminology was ``56 is the 
rover, find the rover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Taylor moved from side to side as a linebacker who was  
more a defensive end, May was assigned to block him at times. His 
solution was to get dirty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew if he got a sack or a hurry on my side he would stay  
over there, so after the play I would hit him in the knee, in the 
groin and the stomach so he wouldn't want to stay over there,'' May 
said. ``I didn't care if I took a personal foul. If he stayed 
there, I was going to have a long day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since one blocker was never enough, most teams doubled Taylor  
and even had a running back block him for a little extra help. 
</P>
<P>
	It rarely helped, though. Taylor finished his career with 132 1/2  
sacks, which didn't count 9 1/2 as a rookie because sacks weren't an 
official stat until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor always downplayed his numbers. The only things that  
mattered was winning, golf and probably himself. He once claimed to 
rehab himself on the links. 
</P>
<P>
	He hated to lose and he found ways to put the Giants over the  
top, be it the late interception against Detroit one Thanksgiving 
or the forced turnover or big tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who can make tackles, but I always  
seemed to look for the big play,'' Taylor said Monday. ``The big 
play got noticed, the big play was the one that changed the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``... I have always wanted to be the one who made those plays.''  
</P>
<P>
	Phil McConkey said the scary part about Taylor was he never  
seemed to work during the week. During their five years as 
teammates, the receiver never once saw L.T. do a toe touch or a 
situp or even lift a weight. He just showed up on Sundays and 
created havoc for opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pure, raw physical talent,'' McConkey said. ``Michael  
Jordan worked. He worked hard at his craft. L.T. didn't work. To 
think of him being one of the greatest athletes of all time, one of 
the greatest football players of all time and he didn't work at it, 
unless he did it in secret somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor credited Parcells with knowing how to use him.  
</P>
<P>
	Parcells was smart enough to have different rules for L.T. and  
everyone else, and the players accepted that. Some even donated 
urine samples so Taylor could pass league-mandated drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the consequences for my choices are not being in the Hall  
of Fame, you guys decide that,'' Taylor told the media Monday. 
``...I'm not losing sleep on whether I made it or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would love to be in there. I expect to be in there. I  
think I have worked hard enough to be in there. But yes, I have had 
problems in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said those problems should not bar Taylor from the Hall  
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there has been an easier vote in the history of  
the game,'' Martin said. ``I dare anyone to challenge me. There 
hasn't been an easier vote for the Hall of Fame than Lawrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``The game has changed so much. They want everything lily-white  
and players to be pure and clean,'' said May, now an analyst for 
CBS Sports. ``That's not the way football is meant to be. It 
doesn't mean everyone has to be a choir boy.''

<HEADLINE> Designers Plan Okla. City Memorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The office background noise is dull.  
Suddenly, a roaring, rippling noise spreads with sounds of panic 
and commotion. The room grows dark and quiet before 168 victims' 
faces flash rapidly around the room. The lights come up and the 
exit door opens. 
</P>
<P>
	The experience is just one of the multimedia events planned by a  
design team selected for the Oklahoma City National Memorial 
Center. The center is a part of the Oklahoma City National Memorial 
for victims of the April 19, 1995, bombing of a federal building 
that killed 168. 
</P>
<P>
	Work already is under way on the outside portion of the memorial  
on the site where the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Douglas/Gallagher, Hillmann &AMP; Carr and C.H. Guernsey  
&AMP; Co. was named Thursday to design the 24,000-square-foot center to 
be housed in a portion of the Journal Record Building. The building 
was heavily damaged by the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will put together the chapters that tell a complete  
storyline of what happened April 19, 1995,'' said Bob Johnson, 
chairman of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors will have access to interactive stations where they can  
view news coverage and listen to stories from people who survived 
and those who responded to the emergency. Projection monitors will 
show a variety of funeral services, and a memorial registry will 
allow visitors to leave a message for the people of Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is not only to create a story about contemporary  
history, but also a story about something that is very alive today 
and that is the issue of how a community came together,'' said 
Patrick Gallagher, president of Douglas/Gallagher.

	Greenspan in Social Security Warning  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  
today what President Clinton and most other politicians have 
avoided saying: Any permanent solution to keep Social Security from 
going broke will almost certainly require increasing taxes or 
cutting benefits. In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, 
Greenspan also repeated his criticism of one element of Clinton's 
plan, having the government invest around $700 billion of Social 
Security money in the stock market. He said he doubted that 
investment decisions could be insulated from political pressure. On 
the subject of benefit cuts or tax increases, Greenspan said the 
demographics of a huge baby boom generation retiring and fewer 
workers left to support retirees present policy-makers with few 
choices. 

</P>
<P>
	Wages, Benefits Rise 3.4 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brisk economic growth in 1998 pushed up  
Americans' wages and benefits by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip in 
five years and a slight improvement over 1997. The gain reported 
today by the Labor Department in its Employment Cost Index marked 
the third consecutive year of improvement. Wages and benefits rose 
3.3 percent in 1997, 2.9 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1995. 
At the same time, inflation has been decreasing, so workers' 
purchasing power has shown significant gains. 

</P>
<P>
	Durable Goods Orders Rise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department said orders to U.S.  
factories for big-ticket durable goods jumped 1.9 percent in 
December to a seasonally adjusted $193 billion, ending a weak year 
on a strong note. For the year, orders for durable goods -- items 
from air conditioners to aircraft expected to last three or more 
years -- rose just 3.5 percent, a marked deceleration from 1997's 
7.1 percent increase. 

</P>
<P>
	Jobless Claims Fall by 15,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department said today that  
seasonally adjusted first-time applications for unemployment 
benefits dropped sharply last week for the second week in a row 
after shooting up during late December and early January. A 
five-week low of 301,000 claims were filed, down from 316,000 the 
week before and 360,000 the week before that. A department analyst 
said the total appears to have returned to a level closer to the 
longer-term trend after some difficulty adjusting the statistics 
for seasonal fluctuation.

split today, the latest big-name company to divide its shares to 
make them more affordable to investors. Intel, the world's largest 
computer chipmaker with $26.2 billion in sales last year, said the 
split takes effect April 11. The split would be the 12th since 
Intel went public 26 years ago. The last split, also 2-for-1, was

GeoCities' current market valuation of about $3.02 billion 
including outstanding stock options. The deal would give Yahoo! 
another powerful brand name while helping GeoCities reach more Web

save heavy-volume callers money. The payment system unveiled 
yesterday, the first of its kind from a major telephone company,

<HEADLINE> Democrats Capitalize on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic Party took in more than $2  
million this month with a fund-raising letter designed to 
capitalize on anti-impeachment sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Incoming Democratic National Chairman Joe Andrew said the party  
raised twice as much as expected through the fund-raising letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the letter does not contain the word ``impeachment,''  
Andrew said that was the underlying message of the fund-raising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only politics that people are seeing,'' Andrew  
said. ``They're sending $20 because they're upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick  
criticized the fund-raising tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have always viewed the impeachment of the  
president as a constitutional issue and a matter of the rule of 
law, not a political issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House Republicans prosecuting the impeachment case,  
Rep. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, raised the impeachment issue 
in a fund-raising letter just a few days before addressing the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' fund-raising letter asks for money to help  
President Clinton fight for his proposals on issues such as Social 
Security, education and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans -- who are clearly more interested in putting  
partisanship before progress -- will resume their political 
grandstanding in an effort to cripple the Democratic Party and 
derail President Clinton's common sense legislative agenda for 
America,'' said the letter, signed by General Chairman Roy Romer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Democratic National Committee sent out a  
fund-raising letter over James Carville's signature that called 
independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr ``as objective as the Spanish 
Inquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzpatrick said RNC fund-raising for January also was higher  
than expected. Direct mail brought in $2.9 million this month for 
the national party, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican donors are very energized by our new leadership  
team in the House and the aggressive agenda of issues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> $100M Sought for Child Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration wants to spend more  
than $100 million helping children's hospitals and fighting 
childhood asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Both initiatives will be included in the budget President  
Clinton submits to Congress next week for the fiscal year starting 
Oct. 1, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The $68 million asthma plan, which first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton is announcing this afternoon at the White House, was billed 
as the ``first-ever comprehensive, administration-wide strategy'' 
to fight the disease. Most of the money -- $50 million -- would be 
used for competitive state grants to identify and treat poor 
children served by Medicaid who have asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	And this morning, Mrs. Clinton unveiled proposed new subsidies  
for training pediatricians in speech at the National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The funding for those who work with children and are being  
trained to work with children is grossly disproportionate to the 
need,'' the first lady said at an awards ceremony for scientists 
whose work is being funded by the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now helps pay for training doctors by reimbursing  
hospitals through the Medicare program for the elderly. But that 
system is based on the number of Medicare patients a hospital sees, 
which creates a disadvantage for hospitals that treat mainly 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's hospitals lose money each year, more than other  
teaching hospitals, partly because of this inequity, the 
administration contends. The $40 million would come through an 
existing grant programs and amount to about $9,380 per resident. 
The average hospital would see $689,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The asthma initiative would help schools educate children and  
parents on how to avoid attacks, support research into 
environmental hazards and pay for a public information campaign. It 
would be administered by the Department of Health and Human 
Services and the Environmental Protection Agency and was developed 
in part by Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 15 years, the number of children with asthma has  
doubled to about 6 million, with an even steeper increase -- about 
160 percent -- among children under age 5. More than 100,000 
children are hospitalized with the ailment each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Black children suffer the most. Their risk of contracting the  
disease is only slightly higher than it is for other children, but 
they are more than four times as likely to die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative would provide:  
</P>
<P>
	--$8.4 million for schools to teach parents and children the  
importance of asthma medication and how to identify and avoid 
materials that trigger attacks. The administration estimates this 
initiative will reach more than 2 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 million for new research into the role chemicals, pesticides  
and cigarette smoke play in the onset of asthma. Another $1 million 
would be used by EPA to monitor air pollution in two communities to 
examine its relation to asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5.2 million for a public information campaign, including  
posters, flyers and brochures, to reduce children's exposure to 
tobacco smoke and other asthma triggers.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Exec Happy Jordan Left on Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf says he did not  
want to see Michael Jordan retire and the rest of the team split up 
any more than Chicago fans did. 
</P>
<P>
	But if it had to happen -- and it did -- he wanted them to leave  
as winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fan, you really have to like that Michael retired as the  
equivalent of the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world,'' 
Reinsdorf told the Chicago Tribune on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By retiring, the legend grows and grows, and people will say  
we could have won nine, 10 championships in a row if he'd stayed,'' 
Reinsdorf said. ``And the fact is we wouldn't have. The dynasty 
would have ended someday with somebody defeating us. Now we can say 
the dynasty ended because we were done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's retirement was the key to whether the Bulls stayed  
together or broke up. If he decided to play for another year, 
Reinsdorf said he would have been willing to give Scottie Pippen, 
Dennis Rodman and Luc Longley large one-year contracts so they 
could try for a seventh championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But without Jordan, Reinsdorf said it didn't make sense to sign  
the aging veterans to long-term contracts when it would only have 
delayed the inevitable rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone thinks this team could have won for more  
than one more year,'' Reinsdorf said. ``I don't know that it could 
have won another year, though Michael thought so. But that would 
have been the limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls reached sign-and-trade deals for Pippen (Houston),  
Longley (Phoenix) and Steve Kerr (San Antonio). By gutting the 
team, the Bulls will have about $20 million in salary cap room this 
summer to make a run at one or two big-name free agents. Chicago 
also got additional draft picks in 2000 and 2001 in the 
sign-and-trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	With only five players back from last year's playoff roster,  
Reinsdorf acknowledges the Bulls probably won't make the playoffs 
this year. But by restocking through free agency and youth, he 
hopes Chicago can be back in the Eastern Conference Finals within 
two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ideally, we'll get two quality free agents and a high  
first-round draft choice, and the following summers we'll use the 
draft choices we accumulated and maybe bring in some players from 
Europe we have the rights to,'' he said. ``We feel this (next) team 
will be built around depth and versatility, and hopefully three 
quality first-line players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls general manager Jerry Krause has made no secret over the  
past few seasons that he didn't want the Bulls to get caught short 
when it came time to rebuild, like the post-Larry Bird Boston 
Celtics. But that didn't mean he and Krause wanted Jordan to leave, 
Reinsdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question Jerry wants to win without Michael. But he  
wanted to win as many with Michael as he could,'' Reinsdorf said. 
``There's never been any thought to encourage him to retire or that 
we couldn't wait so we could do it without him. That's silly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you like winning, it's a lot easier with Michael, and  
that's why you're in this, to win.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Coroner Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For three decades, his mouth got him in  
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Medical Examiner Thomas Noguchi, the ``coroner to the  
stars'' and the model for TV's ``Quincy,'' told the world in 1981 
that actors Natalie Wood and William Holden were drunk when they 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	He disputed 75 witnesses to the 1968 assassination of Robert F.  
Kennedy, who said Sirhan Sirhan fired repeatedly, standing directly 
in front of the senator. Noguchi said one of the bullets entered 
just behind Kennedy's ear, fired so close that there were powder 
burns on the slain man's hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and Hollywood didn't take kindly to his style.  
</P>
<P>
	By 1982, county officials accused Noguchi of mismanagement,  
making improper public statements and using company time for 
personal business. He was demoted to staff pathologist and 
relegated to the basement of Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen years after being exiled and 38 years after entering  
the county morgue, Noguchi retired this month at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	And he doesn't regret a word.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no qualms about anything I said during that period.  
What do I care?'' Noguchi said this week. ``I don't need to adjust 
the facts for some political reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city's doctor of the dead, whose colleagues were throwing  
him a retirement party tonight, had many legendary cases. 
</P>
<P>
	He determined heroin killed Janis Joplin, that an injection of  
heroin and cocaine snuffed the life of John Belushi and that 
Marilyn Monroe swallowed 40 to 50 Nembutal capsules. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not go quietly when the county Board of Supervisors  
demoted him. He sued the county over his demotion, pursuing his 
case to the state Supreme Court, which refused to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt terrible,'' Noguchi said. ``But I am not a quitter. I  
would never quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former coroner-to-the-stars wants to be a witness-for-hire  
in civil trials. Or a television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
	Noguchi, who was divorced the year he was demoted and never  
remarried, says he isn't keen on retiring, but his civil servant 
pension is fully vested -- he can collect his full salary without 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a character,'' he said. ``I'll be just fine.''

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence Nixed on Pope Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gov. Mel Carnahan today commuted the  
death sentence of a convicted murderer to life without parole, 
citing a personal pleas by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reaching this decision, I took into account the  
extraordinary circumstances of the pope's request and the 
historical significance of the papal visit to St. Louis and the 
state of Missouri,'' Carnahan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continue to support capital punishment, but after careful  
consideration of his direct and personal appeal and because of a 
deep and abiding respect for the Pontioff and all he represents, I 
decided last night to grant his request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Mease, convicted of murdering a drug partner and two  
others in southwest Missouri in 1988, had been scheduled to die 
Wednesday. His execution was postponed in December by the Missouri 
Supreme Court, apparently because of the pope's visit to St. Louis, 
which ended Wednesday. The execution had been rescheduled for Feb. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mass on Wednesday morning at the Trans World Dome, the pope  
had made his strongest statement yet against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a  
consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and 
unnecessary,'' the pope said in his 30-minute homily. 
</P>
<P>
	He said human life must not be taken away ``even in case of  
someone who has done great evil.'' The pontiff added that society 
could protect itself against criminals without ``definitively 
denying criminals the chance to reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes after the Mass ended, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the  
Vatican's secretary of state, invited Carnahan to the home of 
Archbishop Justin F. Rigali to discuss Mease's execution.

<HEADLINE> SAG Rejects Proposed Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Screen Actors Guild on Thursday rejected  
a proposed merger with a rival union that represents television 
broadcasters and voice-over artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 46 percent of the SAG members who voted in the referendum  
favored merging with the American Federation of Television &AMP; Radio 
Artists -- far below the 60 percent required for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 percent of SAG's 98,375 members voted in the  
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	AFTRA said Wednesday that 68 percent of its members who  
participated in the referendum favored the merger. The union has 
71,437 members, and about 40 percent of AFTRA's members returned 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor organizers had hoped the combined union would have ended  
clashes on which group has the right to regulate actors appearing 
on videotapes, high definition television and digital recording 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	SAG traditionally controls film jobs, and contends jobs created  
by new technology fall into the film category. AFTRA traditionally 
has represented the nonfilm jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger would have swept these conflicts aside,'' SAG  
president Richard Masur said. ``I consider this to be a real 
loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After SAG announced the results of its member referendum, AFTRA  
president Shelby Scott was conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we regret the results on the SAG side, we are committed  
to work on new ways to cooperate with the Guild for the protection 
and benefit of our members,'' Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
	SAG national director Ken Orsatti said many members feared the  
added competition of an increased number of Guild members chasing 
an unchanged number of jobs.

<HEADLINE> IOC Drug Chief Wants Selective Bans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Olympics' drug chief proposed  
selective bans Thursday to keep doping cheats out of certain -- but 
not all -- major events. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International  
Olympic Committee's medical commission, also said the IOC will seek 
a compromise on its proposal for a two-year minimum ban for major 
drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to keep athletes from successfully challenging  
sanctions in court, de Merode said the IOC will seek to impose bans 
that keep athletes out of some of the biggest competitions while 
allowing them to stay active in the sport to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a financial and moral punishment, and it will be  
severe, but it will not rob him of his work,'' de Merode said in an 
interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments came just days ahead of next week's world  
conference on doping in sport at Lausanne, Switzerland. Nations 
from around the globe and sporting federations will seek to 
dovetail drug policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has threatened to expel sports from the Olympics if they  
do not back a minimum two-year ban on major drug abusers. But after 
soccer, cycling and tennis objected, de Merode promised he would 
seek a compromise at next week's meeting, inserting language that 
will allow penalties to be reduced in exceptional cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``At that point FIFA can be satisfied, and tennis and cycling  
would be able to accept such a text,'' de Merode said. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA medical chief Michel D'Hooghe said earlier in the week the  
soccer federation ``would never bow'' to a two-year rule and would 
rather risk Olympic expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan for selective bans could ease some legal concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``When someone must judge a doping case, he must be able to  
compare it to current legal practice,'' de Merode said. 
</P>
<P>
	De Merode said next week's meeting would likely agree on a list  
of banned substances, including marijuana.

<HEADLINE> TRW To Acquire LucasVarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Inc. today agreed to acquire LucasVarity  
PLC for $7 billion, but a rival automotive supplier, Federal-Mogul 
Corp., said it might raise its earlier bid. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity, a London-based maker of auto brake systems,  
aerospace and missile equipment, this week rejected a $6.5 billion 
cash-and-stock offer from Federal-Mogul. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW, based in Cleveland, called its deal the largest cash  
transaction in the automotive supply industry. The offer amounts to 
about $47.35 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW said the combined company will have annual revenues of  
nearly $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW, based in Cleveland, makes automobile airbags, seat belts  
and other car parts, defense and aerospace equipment and 
information technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Gorman, TRW's chairman and chief executive officer,  
called the deal ``a great fit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Specifically, it enables the integration of TRW's steering and  
suspension business with LucasVarity's braking business into the 
next generation of vehicle control systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Rice, chief executive officer of LucasVarity, will be  
named vice chairman of TRW and will direct the combined automotive 
operations of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of the two companies' complementary products and  
services are reflected in the full and fair price we have received 
for LucasVarity,'' he said. 
</P>

	Earlier this week, LucasVarity rebuffed Federal-Mogul's offer  
and disclosed it was holding ``advanced discussions with a third 
party'' on an all-cash bid. It didn't disclose the suitor, but 
speculation centered on TRW. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity also had been negotiating with Tenneco Inc., and  
prospects of a bidding war have sent LucasVarity shares soaring 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies have approved the deal, but  
shareholders have not voted. Federal-Mogul today urged LucasVarity 
shareholders to take no action on the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal-Mogul, based in Southfield, Mich., has been on an  
acquisition spree for years and is so burdened with debt that it 
could not afford an all-cash offer, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of  
LucasVarity were at $47.93 3/4, up $1.25, or 3 percent. TRW rose 
$1.06 1/4, or 2 percent, to $52.18 3/4. Shares of Federal-Mogul slipped 
68 3/4 cents, or 1 percent, to $59.50.

<HEADLINE> Impact of NAFTA Eyed After 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after the United States, Canada and  
Mexico entered into a new trade alliance, whether the North 
American Free Trade Agreement is a boon or a burden generally 
depends on who's evaluating it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration lobbied furiously to secure  
congressional passage of the trade pact in 1993. Not surprisingly, 
it views NAFTA as a net positive -- particularly in light of the 
current Asian economic downturn and Mexico's 1994 peso crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's been a very successful enterprise,'' David  
Aaron, Commerce undersecretary for international trade, said in a 
recent interview. ``There are still problems. It's still a work in 
progress, and there are more things we need to do to improve it 
..., but I think we can take significant satisfaction in the fact 
our exports to NAFTA in the five years have risen more than 67 
percent -- almost double the rest-of-world exports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, the critics: NAFTA is to blame for job flight  
to Mexico, lowered labor and environmental standards and a host of 
other ills in all three partner countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over NAFTA's impact on the U.S. economy is certain to  
be among the central issues Congress will examine this year as it 
considers President Clinton's request to renew the negotiating 
authority he needs to strike new trade agreements, including the 
suggestion in his State of the Union address for a round of talks 
involving the 133 nations of the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Determined opposition from labor and environmental groups has  
blocked Clinton for four years from obtaining the trade authority, 
known as fast track. Opponents argue that NAFTA did not provide 
enough safeguards to ensure that U.S. companies setting up 
operations in Mexico did not exploit workers' rights or the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious NAFTA has failed to produce the benefits its  
boosters promised,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public 
Citizen's Global Trade Watch, which battled to keep the pact from 
being enacted. ``But NAFTA also fails a more lenient `do no harm' 
test. In key areas NAFTA affects, things are worse than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its recently issued NAFTA report card, Global Trade Watch  
gives failing grades on everything from agriculture to highway 
safety, public health and national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	NAFTA has cost Americans hundreds of thousands of jobs,  
depressed wages in some sectors and transformed the $1.7 billion 
trade surplus with Mexico in 1993 to an $11.5 billion deficit by 
fall 1998, Global Trade Watch says. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration retains a far more positive view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the whole spectrum of issues -- trade, the environment,  
labor conditions, cooperation with Mexico in law enforcement. 
Whatever the issue, there is not one area where we would be better 
off today if the NAFTA were not in place,'' said Jay Ziegler, a 
spokesman for the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade with Canada and Mexico supports 2.6 million U.S. jobs,  
Aaron said, an increase of 655,000 over 1993. As to the job loss 
claim, he said: ``It's quite clear that most of the job dislocation 
that has taken place in the United States is not due to trade, let 
alone trade with NAFTA. Most of it is due to technological 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the United States is enjoying its lowest unemployment  
rates in three decades, averaging 4.5 percent last year, Aaron 
said, ``You can hardly say (NAFTA) has precipitated some kind of 
jobs crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NAFTA is scored, however, as having cost the jobs of 209,000  
Americans. That is the number of workers certified under a federal 
program designed to help people who lose work because of shifting 
trade patterns with Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials rush to say it's far easier to quantify  
jobs lost under NAFTA than those created. They also say the 209,000 
figure is an inaccurate reflection of job loss because, although 
entire work forces are certified as NAFTA losses, many displaced 
workers immediately go to new jobs or choose to retire. Some also 
may be reported under different federal trade assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Beale, acting director of the Labor Department's Office of  
Trade Adjustment Assistance, said his staff often is asked how many 
jobs have been lost to NAFTA, ``to which we give a hearty `We don't 
have the slightest idea,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The states with the most certifications of NAFTA job loss are  
North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The sectors with the most certifications are the apparel  
industry, with 55,000; electrical and electronic equipment, 26,600; 
and transportation equipment, 14,600.

<HEADLINE> Scandal Disappoints Oldest Olympian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) -- The oldest living Olympic champion is  
``appalled'' by the Olympic bribery scandal, but is confidence that 
the spirit of the games will be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Stukelj, who turned 100 in November, said Thursday the  
blame falls on IOC members involved in the bribery allegations but 
not the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samaranch has no right to vote, and he cannot know if any of  
the committee members were bribed,'' Stukelj said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only if Samaranch were tainted by the scandal, should he step  
down, Stukelj said, adding that he ``cannot believe'' Samaranch was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's as disappointed by this as I am,'' Stukelj said  
of Samaranch, who invited him to the Atlanta Games and also 
participated at Stukelj's birthday celebration last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stukelj won two gold medals in gymnastics at the 1924 Paris  
Games, one gold and two bronzes at Amsterdam in 1928 and one silver 
at Berlin in 1936.

<HEADLINE>  Red Wings Return to White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings are becoming regulars at  
1600 Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton congratulated the Red Wings on their second  
straight Stanley Cup championship, joking that they were returning 
to the White House often enough to establish an annual ceremony for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is becoming such a regular thing ... We should just have  
Michigan Day at the White House,'' Clinton said Thursday evening, 
standing near the 3 1/2-foot, 35-pound Stanley Cup in the East Room. 
</P>
<P>
	During the generally light-hearted celebration, there was an  
emotional moment when Clinton acknowledged former defenseman 
Vladimir Konstantinov and former team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, 
both in wheelchairs. They have been recovering for the past 19 
months from disabling injuries suffered in a limousine accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams win, whole teams, in the arena, and on the sidelines,  
and we're glad to see the whole team here, including Vladimir, 
Sergei,'' he said, nearly bringing Mnatsakanov to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings swept the Washington Capitals in four games for  
their second Stanley Cup championship in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Red Wings overcame the Capitals -- our hometown team, but  
we still are impressed with what you did -- in four decisive games, 
with grit, determination and teamwork,'' Clinton said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Steve Yzerman joked with Clinton that during the  
playoff games, ``I'm sure you were in your ... room with your Red 
Wings jersey on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Yzerman gave Clinton a Red Wings jersey. This year,  
he added to his collection by giving him an away-game jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton responded: ``I started wearing it around the house and  
Hillary pointed out I wasn't as broad-shouldered as she thought I 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``One (person) in my office today said, you know, they'll  
probably give you a jersey, but I wish they'd give you one of those 
sticks. You could really put it to good use around here,'' Clinton 
jested. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Scotty Bowman presented Clinton with a miniature replica  
of the Stanley Cup. ``You know, Mr. President, how difficult it is 
to win the first one, and how challenging it is to repeat a second 
time,'' Bowman said as Clinton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	One star player, center Sergei Fedorov, was visiting the White  
House for the first time, having missed last year's visit because 
he had no new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very new to me. I'm very excited,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Chris Osgood agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It never gets old, all the things that come with winning the  
Stanley Cup,'' he said. ``It's a great thrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Konstantinov, who suffered serious head injuries, traveled on  
the Red Wings' plane with his teammates for the first time since 
the accident. Konstantinov's wife, Irina, said he was aware during 
the day that he was meeting with the president, and with some 
prompting he remembered last year's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's much more aware this year,'' she said. ``He's enjoying  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Konstantinov stole the show as he gave President  
Clinton a thumbs-up while sitting back in his wheelchair. Clinton 
returned the sign.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco Profits Fall in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., owner of the  
nation's second-biggest cigarette company, posted a wider loss in 
the fourth quarter due mainly to the costs of settling claims by 
states for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	But if unusual expenses, such as the tobacco settlements, are  
excluded, the company's results announced Thursday beat Wall Street 
expectations. Domestic tobacco operating earnings were swelled by a 
record cigarette price increase in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that produces Winston and Camel cigarettes and has a  
controlling stake in the Nabisco food business lost $585 million, 
or $1.83 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 
a loss of $197 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter fell 2 percent to $4.47 billion from  
$4.58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results were depressed by a $632 million charge  
resulting from its tobacco unit's participation in a settlement of 
suits by 46 states seeking recovery of health costs for treating 
smoking-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement calls for the four major tobacco makers to pay  
$206 billion over 25 years to 46 states, and is in addition to 
earlier deals under which the tobacco companies agreed to pay $40 
billion over 25 years to four states. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR's results were also reduced by $148 million in the quarter  
for restructuring expenses in its international tobacco business 
and at Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the charges, RJR earnings were down 12 percent to $195  
million, or 58 cents a share, from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	That beat the 51 cents a share average expected by analysts  
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR shares were unchanged, closing at $27 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco profits were up 11 percent worlwide to $505 million in  
the quarter as sales revenue rose 5 percent despite a 9 percent 
drop in cigarettes sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales revenue was up because R.J. Reynolds and other tobacco  
companies boosted prices by a record 45 cents a pack in the U.S. 
after the November settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits were up 25 percent in the fourth  
quarter due mainly to the price increases as revenue climbed 15 
percent even as the number of cigarettes shipped to distributors 
fell 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	John C. Maxwell, tobacco analyst for Davenport &AMP; Co., estimated  
the company lost market share as industry shipments were off only 7 
percent in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are still not looking for a very good year this year,''  
he said, noting the price hike could accelerate the decline in 
cigarette consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Another tobacco analyst, Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith Barney,  
estimated Reynold's share of the U.S. market slipped to 25.2 
percent in 1998 from 25.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	International tobacco profits fell 39 percent in the quarter as  
sales fell 9 percent in terms of revenue and cigarettes sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven F. Goldstone, chairman and chief executive, said the  
international business was hurt by economic turmoil in many 
developing markets in Russia, other former Soviet states and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see better comparisons in the second half of 1999  
for those markets as well as continued improving trends in many of 
the established markets of Western Europe and Canada,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials told analysts they are still examining the  
possibility of striking an alliance in international tobacco or 
possibly selling the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR owns an 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco Holdings Corp., which  
reported a day earlier that its earnings fell 87 percent in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Goldstone said Nabisco is starting to show improvement from  
recent efforts to cut costs, market core brands more aggressively 
and revitalize its North American work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Nabisco's brands are Ritz crackers and Oreo and  
SnackWell's cookies. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, RJR lost $577 million, or $1.91 a share, in  
contrast to a profit of $381 million, or $1.03 a share, for 1997. 
Revenue slipped to $17.04 billion vs. $17.06 billion.

<HEADLINE> Outlook Uncertain for Soybean Crops / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- The hog market is in crisis. Beef is not  
faring much better. Wheat prices remain low. Now farmers have 
another worry: an uncertain outlook for soybean crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's economic problems and its sudden currency devaluation --  
coupled with an Agriculture Department crop report in January 
showing the U.S. soybean crop was the largest in history -- are bad 
news for the nation's soybean growers, said Bill Tierney, a grain 
market analyst at Kansas State University. 
</P>
<P>
	After the USDA reported in January a record 2.76 billion bushels  
in U.S. soybean production for 1998, the market set new lows for 
both July and November soybean futures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt, much of the market's reaction was the result  
of the Brazilians' cheaper real -- which is their equivalent of our 
dollar,'' Tierney said. ``The market actually was expecting an even 
bigger U.S. crop. But Brazil is a major world competitor in 
soybeans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil always prices its exports just under the U.S. price.  
Because world soybean trade is quoted in U.S. dollars, Brazil's 
exporters have no reason to lower their asking price just because 
the equivalent in devalued currency sounds like so much more, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But news of Brazil's economic problems, and the timing of the  
USDA crop report, still shook soybean markets. Another factor is 
the South American soybean crop, which could come in at record or 
near-record yields later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of what is going on in soybean prices is an exaggerated  
pessimism,'' Tierney said. ``Part of the pessimism in the 
marketplace is the markets' near certainty of a significant 
increase in acreage next year, and that has got a lot of people 
very pessimistic about soybean prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is in spite of the fact that record amounts of the crop are  
being consumed. Soybean exports are now down only slightly after a 
record year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few years, farmers have been planting more  
soybeans. The crop has rewarded them so far with better returns 
than more traditional crops such as wheat, corn and sorghum at a 
time when all commodity prices are down. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans require less fertilizer, insecticides and herbicides.  
Seed costs are lower, and the plant needs much less water to thrive 
than corn. All that has given farmers the best return among the 
crops, said Dennis Morrice, spokesman for the Kansas Soybean 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have responded accordingly: Soybean crops have gone from  
1.8 million acres in 1994 to 2.5 million acres last year in Kansas. 
Even more acres are expected to be devoted this year to soybeans 
when farmers start planting them in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrice said problems in the hog industry could spill over to  
soybean growers because 40 percent of the soybean crop is used as 
soymeal to feed livestock, with pigs comprising a significant 
amount of that market. If pig numbers fall sharply in the coming 
months, so too will the demand for soymeal to feed them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not appear to have happened yet.  
</P>
<P>
	``Soymeal prices have been extremely low long before this hog  
issue hit,'' Tierney said. ``I'm sure that is part of the 
contributing factor but that has been a phenomena at work for a 
long time already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, soymeal production has equaled or neared last year's  
record, he said.

<HEADLINE> Split Verdict Not in Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The idea of a split verdict in an impeachment  
trial -- separate findings on wrongdoing and on removing a president 
from office -- is not spelled out in the Constitution, but legal 
scholars say the Senate probably can do it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is the highest court in the land when it comes to  
impeachment,'' University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar 
said Thursday. ``It can do pretty much what it wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican proposal in President Clinton's impeachment trial  
would let the Senate decide he committed wrongdoing in covering up 
his affair with Monica Lewinsky but vote separately not to remove 
him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans believe a simple vote of acquittal would imply  
Clinton had been exonerated on charges of perjury and obstruction 
of justice. The White House wants to avoid a Senate statement of 
presidential misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Utah law professor Michael McConnell said he  
believed the Constitution allows the Senate to make findings of 
wrongdoing although they would be ``legally and constitutionally 
meaningless.'' The only significant action would be the vote on 
removal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no precedent for handling an impeachment verdict this  
way, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California 
law professor. ``I think this is not constitutional, but if they 
want to do it there's nothing to stop them,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's handling of impeachment cases is almost always not  
reviewable in court because the Constitution gives the Senate the 
``sole power'' to try impeachments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution says presidents and other federal officials can  
be removed from office on conviction of high crimes or 
misdemeanors, and that judgment in impeachment cases ``shall not 
extend further'' than removal and disqualification from holding 
future federal offices. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate finding that Clinton committed certain misdeeds could  
be considered similar to a censure -- an alternative pushed by 
Democrats but opposed by many Republicans because it, too, is not 
mentioned in the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Many legal scholars say a censure is perfectly lawful as long as  
it involves only words and has no legal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress can pass whatever resolutions it wants,'' McConnell  
said. ``It can declare National Pickle Week and it can censure the 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judges often spell out their factual findings to help explain  
why they make a certain ruling, noted law professor Robert Nagel of 
the University of Colorado. But he said doing so as part of an 
impeachment vote could create a clear precedent that certain acts 
are not enough to remove a president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor, said it  
also could create a poor precedent because ``the impeachment 
mechanism would no longer be a basis for removal from office, but 
an incentive for politically driven impeachments, which is what the 
framers were trying to prevent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal scholars would draw the line at a Senate declaration  
that Clinton was actually guilty of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate is not in the business of adjudicating guilt or  
innocence of crimes, except for high crimes and misdemeanors,'' 
said New York University law professor Burt Neuborne. That's up to 
the courts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, a Senate finding that Clinton committed a crime could  
not be used against him in court if he were charged after leaving 
office, several law professors said. Such a Senate finding would be 
considered an opinion and not evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress have suggested a deal involving a  
censure plus an agreement by Clinton to pay a fine or admit 
wrongdoing. Such a fine or admission could be imposed only with the 
president's agreement because the Constitution bars Congress from 
imposing punishment on someone without a trial in court. 
</P>
<P>
	A censure alone would not require Clinton's agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a statement with political and historical effect  
but may have no more legal effect than an editorial,'' said Yale 
law professor Akhil Reed Amar.

<HEADLINE> Light Linked to Gamma Ray Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Astronomers have recorded visible light from  
the source of a gamma ray burst for the first time, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected at 4:47 a.m. EST Saturday and  
was detected by two orbiting observatories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts happen several times a week, but they come and  
go so fast astronomers have never before been able to link optical 
observations with the gamma ray detection. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the stellar eruption originated about 10 billion  
light years away but was so powerful in visible light that it could 
have been sighted from the ground with binoculars if someone 
happened to be looking at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the burst had occurred somewhere in our galactic  
neighborhood, it would have been so bright that night would've 
turned into day,'' said Chryssa Kouveliotou of the Universities 
Space Research Association, a contract science group at the 
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said that the burst appeared to originate from near the  
constellation Corona Borealis, visible in the predawn northern sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst phenomenon was discovered in 1967, but the  
bursts remain mysterious. They occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, with the peak of each burst lasting 
from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Astronomers do not know 
their origin or precise cause. Some speculate that bursts originate 
from black holes. Since gamma rays are invisible to the eye, the 
eruptions were unknown until the development of gamma ray 
detectors.

<HEADLINE> TV Execs Buoyed by Midseason Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It may have been a little too early to declare  
the television season a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	An unexpected string of midseason success stories has buoyed the  
spirits of broadcasters. The latest was the debut of ``Dilbert,'' 
which on Monday night achieved the highest ratings for a comedy in 
UPN's four-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's uplifting ``Providence'' is off to a faster start than any  
NBC drama since ``ER,'' Fox is pleased with its animated comedy 
``The PJs,'' and CBS has so far successfully cloned ``60 Minutes'' 
on Wednesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quieted, at least for now, all the talk about the exodus of  
viewers that had grown louder with a lackluster fall season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shows that launched this midseason all have one thing in  
common: Generally speaking, they're excellent shows,'' said UPN 
programming chief Tom Nunan. ``These shows all have an original 
voice to them and they're of unusual quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the initial success may also force executives to rethink the  
wisdom of launching dozens of new shows each September, 
overwhelming viewers with options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew they were coming,'' said Sandy Grushow,  
president of Twentieth Century Fox Television. ``Why did everybody 
know they were coming? Well, they weren't competing with 50 other 
shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A midseason start enables networks to promote the shows one at a  
time, which Nunan said particularly helped ``Dilbert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	January is truly prime time: Winter forces more viewers indoors  
and light post-holiday advertising gives networks extra time to 
tout their own programs, said Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, an 
advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood's tradition of starting most shows in the fall is  
largely dictated by advertisers. TV executives announce a fall 
schedule in May so advertisers can buy commercial time on what they 
think will be hot shows. 
</P>
<P>
	None of last September's shows can be called hits, despite  
critical praise for ``Sportsnight,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and 
``Cupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all to some extent a prisoner of the system that has  
been in place for so long,'' said Lloyd Braun, chairman of Buena 
Vista Television Production. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately that tradition has eroded. ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``King  
of the Hill'' are two shows that successfully launched the last few 
winters. CBS's ``Becker'' was an early-season replacement that last 
week made Nielsen Media Research's top 10 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's lesson may mean fewer new shows next fall, Nunan  
said. His worry is that January will eventually become as crowded 
as September. 
</P>
<P>
	Midseason starts don't guarantee success. NBC's ``Lateline''  
failed last winter and failed again when it came back this month. 
CBS's ``Turks'' hasn't broken any records. 
</P>
<P>
	The real test for the new hotshots will be if people come back  
after the initial curiosity fades, said Preston Beckman, NBC's 
executive vice president of program planning and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it's encouraging that networks can still collect a large  
number of people to watch our shows, I think it will be hard on us 
if we convince ourselves that there's something about midseason,'' 
Beckman said. ``I think there's something about great shows.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 81.10 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose today as technology shares,  
which had threatened Wednesday to end their spectacular run, 
bounced back on announcements of strong earnings, stock splits and 
a merger thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 81.10 at 9,281.33. 
</P>
<P>
	But the blue-chip index failed to make back Wednesday's  
124-point loss, and market analysts were downbeat about the fact 
that advancers were barely leading decliners on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Volume was moderately heavy, with around 700 million 
shares having changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market leadership is almost entirely technology,'' said  
Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse 
First Boston. ``Market advances can't continue indefinitely when 
most of the strength is in one group. It either has to broaden out 
or step back and regroup, because the leadership is way too 
narrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advances in technology shares pushed broader indexes  
sharply higher. The Nasdaq was in record territory late in the day, 
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite was up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 22.20 to 1265.37, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 70.20 to 2,477.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,558 to 1,454 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 534 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 846.62 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
888.91 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 7.32 to 595.40, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.74 to 713.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose up 2.85 to  
423.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks led the charge, as Internet search service  
Yahoo! announced it is buying GeoCities Inc. for $4.58 billion in 
stock. Yahoo! shares were up sharply, and GeoCities shares soared, 
both in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, another Internet stock, posted a strong gain in  
leading volume on the Big Board. The online service provider beat 
analysts' earnings estimates and announced a two-for-one stock 
split. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market is merger driven,'' said Ted Theodore, director of  
research at Avatar Associates, ``and you have this added feature of 
a very good earnings picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was sharply higher in Nasdaq trading after it announced  
its own two-for-one split. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly shares rose after the drug maker announced strong  
earnings and authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program. And 
competitor Pfizer, capitalizing on the current craze for stock 
splits, rose after the company said it would consider a 
three-for-one stock split in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In other merger news, Ford Motor Co. said it will buy the  
automotive operations of Sweden's AB Volvo for $6.45 billion. 
Ford's shares rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was helped higher by a recovery in bank stocks. Hit  
hard Wednesday by trouble in Brazil, they recovered today as the 
Brazilian real and stock market stabilized. Dow components 
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In economic news, the Labor Department reported that Americans'  
wages and benefits rose last year by 3.4 percent, the fastest clip 
in five years and a slight improvement over 1997. But labor costs 
cooled in the fourth quarter, good news for investors who are 
worried that wage pressures could prove inflationary and prompt the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Another positive was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's  
testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, in which he said 
that, for now, the United States is an ``oasis'' of prosperity in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan repeated his earlier criticism of a Clinton  
Administration plan to have the government invest around $700 
billion of Social Security money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move ``would arguably put at risk the efficiency of our  
capital markets and thus, our economy,'' Greenspan said. ``Even 
with Herculean efforts, I doubt if it would be feasible to 
insulate, over the long run, the trust funds from political 
pressures--direct and indirect--to allocate capital to less than 
its most productive use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors hadn't made much of the proposal, announced earlier  
this month in President Clinton's State of the Union address, and 
didn't have much reaction today to Greenspan's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mingles With Senators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- His grand jury had met anonymously behind  
courthouse doors. But this is the Senate -- an uncommon jury, an 
exclusive club -- and when President Clinton's senator-jurors 
convened Thursday, he walked glad-handingly among them, greeting 
them by first name. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard to tell there was anything amiss as the president  
and senators gathered in the Russell Senate Caucus Room for an 
80-minute Capitol Hill memorial for Lawton Chiles, Florida's 
governor and a former senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a mingling of jurors and the accused would be unheard of in  
any normal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, Clinton's impeachment and Senate trial had already  
logged so many bizarre and unprecedented moments that members of 
Congress only shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Domenici, one in the Republican majority that refused to  
drop the impeachment case just a day earlier, turned to Clinton 
with a nod and small smile. ``Mr. President, it's good to be with 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chiles, who died last month at 68, probably ``would be touched  
by the show of friendship and support,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, 
R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., welcomed the occasion as one that  
``brought us, in these days of turmoil, an hour of calm.'' To 
reporters afterward, he called Clinton's behavior in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal ``repugnant'' but not impeachable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of talk about the Senate being a club,'' said  
Domenici, R-N.M. ``We're the strangest example of a club I've ever 
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Say that again, said Sen. Richard Lugar.  
</P>
<P>
	His memorial program still in hand, Lugar walked straight from  
the Russell building to the Senate chamber, where Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist banged the gavel: ``The Senate will convene as a 
court of impeachment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are difficult days,'' said Lugar, R-Ind. ``Again and  
again, these activities are juxtaposed. ... But he has to deal with 
us and we have to deal with him. He's the president and life goes 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Framed by garnet damask drapes and an even dozen stone pillars,  
Clinton saluted Chiles with words that echoed almost verbatim his 
own refusal to resign: ``He lived to the last hour of the last day 
thinking about tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking easily and off the cuff from a lectern naked of his  
presidential seal, Clinton talked about ``one of the most humbling 
nights of my life'' -- not his admission of an improper relationship 
with a former White House intern, not his impeachment, but a 
governors' conference get-together with Chiles and Ann Richards of 
Texas when he realized he wasn't the best storyteller around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I knew every phrase that had ever been coined. I  
listened to them talk about how a stuck pig squealed, how a cut dog 
barks ... I lost that night. I never forgot it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Chiles' legacy was the lesson that ``our job is not  
to posture but to produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tandy Chiles Barrett, the governor's daughter, turned to the  
front five rows reserved for VIPs. She thanked the president for 
his public service, and the first lady for her ``example of grace 
and composure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing senators and what she called ``the House  
management,'' Barrett admonished: ``Sow mercy so that God can then 
bestow upon you his harvest of mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton later offered her a handshake and quiet, ``Thank you.''  
</P>
<P>
	Did he feel like Daniel in the lion's den, a reporter asked.  
``No. ... They asked me to come and I was very gratified. There was 
not a great deal of political content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife nodded along as the Washington D.C. Church of  
Christ Choir belted out ``Amazing Grace.'' Former Sen. Bob 
Packwood, R-Ore., driven from the Senate by his own sex scandal, 
wiped his eyes. Rep. Bill McCollum, one of 13 House managers 
prosecuting Clinton, sat transfixed two rows behind the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum, R-Fla., later bee-lined to a news camera in the  
hallway. A few words about Chiles, and then a rundown of the 
impeachment trial's next steps. 
</P>
<P>
	McCollum said he was helping Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., prepare  
for questioning Monica Lewinsky. What about the exhortation to sow 
mercy? ``I'm not responding or commenting. I don't think it's 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Packwood said it was ``too touching a ceremony'' to think about  
Clinton walking among his jurors. But should the Senate offer 
mercy? ``No comment,'' he grinned.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Still Champion at the Gate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson is still knocking them over at the  
box office. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion continues to be boxing's biggest  
attraction, despite a 19-month layoff from the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	If any evidence was needed, figures released Wednesday by Nevada  
boxing officials that showed Tyson's comeback fight against 
Francois Botha to be the sixth biggest live gate in state boxing 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nevada Athletic Commission said 10,221 people paid full  
ticket prices to get into the fight at the MGM Grand hotel-casino. 
The fight grossed $7,051,800 for the live gate, dashing predictions 
by many before the bout that ticket sales would be underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	The live gate trailed only four other Tyson fights and the first  
Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez fight for total money brought 
in at the gate. The biggest grossing fight in Nevada history was 
Tyson's infamous biting of Evander Holyfield, which had a live gate 
of $14,277,200. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you compare him to anybody else, it's unbelievable,''  
said commission executive director Marc Ratner. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's ability to draw fans to his fifth-round knockout of  
Botha was even more impressive because the Jan. 16 date was 
sandwiched in between two big Las Vegas weekends and the fight 
promotion was hastily put together. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 750,000 people paid an average of $45 to buy the  
pay-per-view of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With a live gate tax of 4 percent and a television tax of  
$50,000, Nevada earned about $330,000 in taxes on the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a promoter or a fighter in the world that wouldn't  
love to have those type of numbers,'' promoter Dan Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the reason for Tyson's live gate success was due to high  
ticket prices, which ranged from $200 in the upper balcony of the 
hotel's arena to $1,200 at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the crowd in an arena that seats about 15,000 was far  
above what some writers had predicted when only a few thousand 
seats were sold the week before the fight. The announced attendance 
at the fight was 12,519, with the remainder getting in on reduced 
or complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reports just weren't accurate leading up to the fight,''  
Goossen said. ``I'm not pointing fingers at the media, but they end 
up looking at the glass half empty rather than half full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is scheduled to fight again April 24 at the MGM Grand  
against one of a handful of different opponents his promoters say 
they are still negotiating with.

<HEADLINE> Ill Falcons WR Tim Dwight Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Tim Dwight, Atlanta's rookie wide  
receiver-kick returner, practiced Thursday despite a stomach virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight made it through the entire 2-hour, 15-minute session.  
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't miss anything,'' coach Dan Reeves said, ``but he  
didn't practice with his usual spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also participating in the entire workout were defensive end  
Lester Archambeau and fullback-tight end Brian Kozlowski. 
Archambeau is bothered by an ankle injury and Kozlowski has had a 
foot problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ankle is still sore. There's no doubt about that,''  
Archambeau said. ``That's the bad thing about these high ankle 
sprains. It takes a long time to heal. But I am able to move around 
pretty well and it's not any more sore today than it was 
yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also piped in crowd music to simulate what Sunday's  
noise level might be at Pro Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we want to have some practice in case there is some  
noise,'' Reeves said. ``You go in anticipating you won't have a 
problem, but I certainly don't want to go in without practicing.''

<HEADLINE> Store Lets HIV-Positive Boy Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Nearly 18 months after an HIV-positive boy  
was barred from a play area at a Kroger store, he returned to 
PePe's Playhouse with a smile -- and Kroger's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm freezing,'' Georgio Lee Chacon, 7, said Thursday night as  
he prepared to enter the store in Columbus. ``I'm freezing. Let's 
go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger, the nation's largest grocery chain, was accused of  
discrimination for refusing to let Georgio play in the play area in 
August 1997. Kroger denied the allegation and said it also had 
turned away children with chickenpox and other contagious 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the guidelines released Thursday, children with infectious  
conditions -- including HIV -- will be allowed in the play areas so 
long as parents fill out a health checklist and the children do not 
display symptoms such as fever, vomiting, pinkeye and mouth sores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will provide play area attendants more  
education on infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree that they need to protect people, but they should have  
found out before that he wasn't a risk,'' said Barb Cordle, 
Georgio's legal guardian and a nurse who operates a group home for 
AIDS and HIV patients. She brought Georgio back to the store and 
play area Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cordle welcomed Kroger's change of heart. But she said she  
had been forced to tell Georgio about his condition when he kept 
asking why he wasn't allowed at the playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ruined a year and a half of his life and I think they  
should have to compensate him,'' she said. ``Emotionally it's just 
been very hard because we had to explain this disease to him. It's 
pretty big news for a little boy to handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati-based Kroger operates about 110 of the play areas in  
the chain's approximately 1,400 grocery stores in 24 states.

	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Friday  
morning, following its strength earlier in New York. Japanese 
stocks rebounded sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 116.27 yen in midday trading, up 0.81 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its level of 116.40 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 180.01 points, or 1.26 percent, to  
14,522.32 points to finish the morning session. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 107.74 points, or 0.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's relative weakness from its  
New York levels came after Japanese exporters and U.S. funds locked 
in profits, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. hedge funds were stepping in to buy the dollar, lifting  
it above its levels earlier in Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the dollar reached an intraday high of  
116.85 yen, its strongest level this year, after the release of 
robust U.S. economic data showing a stronger-than-expected rise in 
durable goods sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was a 3.4 percent rise in wages and  
benefits in the United States last year, marking the third 
consecutive year of improvement in the U.S. Labor Department's 
Unemployment Cost Index. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 132.70 yen, up from  
132.10 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started sharply higher as a  
weaker yen and a rise on Wall Street boosted shares in blue-chip 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	A lower yen makes Japanese exports cheaper abroad, and thus more  
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 13.13 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,123.35 
points. The TOPIX closed down 5.15 points, or 0.46 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.915  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.865 percent, driving its price 
down to 99.08 yen from 99.48 yen.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Burundi Kills 178 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- At least 178 civilians were killed in  
southern Burundi by Hutu rebels or during clashes between rebels 
and government troops in the past two weeks, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in this Central African nation's Makamba province,  
speaking on condition of anonymity, said rebels based in 
neighboring Tanzania attacked the town of Makamba on Jan. 19, 
killing 59 civilians. Another 76 civilians were killed the same 
evening on the nearby Muresi Hill, one mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the mostly Hutu residents were shot or hacked to death  
in their homes by rebels with machetes. Others burned to death when 
rebels set fire to houses, residents said. Most of the dead were 
women and children and some were killed in the crossfire when 
government troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels also killed 23 people in a Jan. 4 attack in Maganda  
and another 20 people in Kibago on the same day, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutu rebels in Burundi are fighting to overthrow the Tutsi  
government of President Pierre Buyoya, a retired general who took 
power in a bloodless coup in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyoya claims he can halt the bloodshed between rebels of the  
majority Hutus, who make up 85 percent of the country, and the 
Tutsi military. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200,000 people have died in attacks and fighting since  
Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically 
elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, in October 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks aimed at ending the conflict entered their fourth  
round last week in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, regional leaders suspended sanctions imposed on  
Burundi after Buyoya seized power in order to give impetus to the 
talks.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Central Bank Owes Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- For the first time ever, Japan's central bank has  
been ordered to pay additional taxes after failing to properly 
report some taxable items, a bank spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Taxation Bureau on Monday ordered the Bank of Japan to  
pay about $237,000, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The order marks the first time in the 117 years since its  
founding that the central bank has been asked to pay additional 
taxes, said the spokesman, on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxation bureau found that the central bank had failed to  
deduct a total of $215,000 in income taxes from its employees over 
the past five years, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional taxes ordered also included a penalty tax imposed  
because of the bank's failure to withhold taxes at the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Also judged to be taxable were travel coupons presented as a  
gift to those working with the bank for 25 years or longer, foreign 
income of bank staff returning home from overseas assignments and 
payments to guest researchers invited from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The order to pay the taxes is the latest blow to the bank's  
image. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Japan's financial world was shaken when a corruption  
probe into the country's powerful bureaucracy reached the central 
bank. A BOJ official was arrested for allegedly receiving bribes 
from financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ, known in Japan as the ``bank of banks,'' had long been  
considered immune to scandal and had never come under criminal 
investigation. Former central bank Governor Yasuo Matsushita 
resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ, set up in 1882, has about 5,700 employees.

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Thursday -- with Hong  
Kong taking the biggest hit -- as investors across the region staged 
a massive sell-off in reaction to Wall Street's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 358.70 points, or 3.7  
percent, to close at 9,360.96 -- the lowest finish since Oct. 15. On 
Wednesday, the Hang Seng had risen 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors -- particularly futures players -- took their cue from  
the 1.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in New 
York on Wednesday, said Robert Rowntree, chief of research at 
Prudential-Bache Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, blue chips snapped a recent winning streak that had  
pushed the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average up by 8.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell 107.74 points, or 0.75 percent, to end at  
14,342.32. On Tuesday, the average had risen 68.05 points, or 0.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares were up for most of the session as the U.S. dollar's  
gains against the Japanese yen encouraged buying of export-oriented 
high-technology issues, but they slipped late in the day. A 
stronger dollar boosts the value of earnings repatriated by 
Japanese exporters, while making their products cheaper in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.46 yen, up 1.64 yen from its level late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 115.82 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>

The Composite Index dropped 9.73 points, or 1.6 percent, to close 
at 595.45.

corporate earnings reports. The All Ordinaries Index rose 25.80

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Charges Possible in Olympic Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If the evidence supports their current theory  
of the Salt Lake City Olympic scandal, federal investigators could 
charge both bribers and recipients of under-the-table payments, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that might be used to prosecute 
what federal investigators initially see as a case of commercial 
bribery, rather than the more familiar government variety, the 
Justice Department officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the Justice Department lets private parties resolve  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits rather than 
bringing federal criminal charges. The exception is when a federal 
interest is involved, such as the integrity of the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe givers and takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under study are tax, currency transfer and foreign bribery  
statutes that might provide additional charges, according to these 
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the federal probe is in a very early stage, months from  
major decisions about what charges to bring or even whether to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents are still trying to understand the records  
subpoenaed from Salt Lake City's Olympic bid committee. Stephanie 
Pate, one-time secretary of former bid committee head Tom Welch, 
has been meeting with agents this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, four members of the International Olympic Committee  
have resigned over the scandal. One of them, Kenya's Charles 
Mukora, who resigned Wednesday, was among six members the IOC said 
Sunday it would expel next month. Others are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent $800,000  
on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses, scholarships for 
their children and cash payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The basic case under investigation is whether Salt Lake's  
committee bribed IOC members to win the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
Federal mail and wire fraud charges could be brought if someone 
used the mail or telephones to ``defraud the International Olympic 
Committee of the honest services of its members,'' a Justice 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Olympic decision-maker who took a bribe also could be  
vulnerable to mail or wire fraud charges for defrauding the 
international panel of his or her honest service -- honest service 
meaning a vote for a site based on its merits rather than on 
under-the-table payments, this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	If more than one person were involved, then prosecutors could  
charge a conspiracy to defraud the Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	If evidence showed illicit payments began with and were the  
product of pressure on Salt Lake representatives from the Olympic 
decision-makers, then the recipients could be charged with 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported today that the Justice Department is trying  
to determine whether a Salt Lake Olympic official carried about 
$50,000 to Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 when the 2002 Winter Games 
were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said FBI agents interviewed former Salt Lake City  
Councilman Tom Godfrey, who has said the official was a staff 
member of the Salt Lake Olympic bid committee. Godfrey was a member 
of the delegation that traveled to Budapest in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also are looking into whether the Salt Lake panel  
violated its tax-exempt status or if any recipients failed to 
report payments on which U.S. taxes were due. 
</P>
<P>
	But such charges are considered longer shots at this point.  
``It's hard to make cases of violating an organization's tax-exempt 
status, and it's very hard to show that foreigners were aware they 
would owe U.S. taxes on things like scholarships for their kids,'' 
said one former Justice official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax charges would likely be added to other federal counts ``only  
if they are necessary to clearly demonstrate what happened -- that 
tax-exempt dollars were misused or personal gain was involved,'' 
said this former official. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury agents are focusing on whether Olympic Committee  
members violated requirements to report carrying cash out of the 
country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt  
Practices Act are still being briefed on the evidence gathered, but 
that act applies only to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign 
officials to influence actions of their government. Some foreign 
officials serve on the Olympic Committee, but it is a private 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, would reach the 
largest number of potentially guilty parties and would provide the 
most appropriate penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, The New York Times reported today that  
the United States Olympic Committee is exploring ideas about the 
restructuring of the IOC, including recommendations for term limits 
and democratic elections by outsiders.

<HEADLINE> Friends Mourn Murdered American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANSFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Julie Scully was desperately seeking  
love, and the sultry model thought she had found it in a shipboard 
romance with a young Greek cruise officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She divorced her American husband late last year and moved to  
Greece last month to marry her new love, but her heart ached for 
her 3-year-old daughter, Katie. Ms. Scully told her family she 
wanted to come home. She never made it back. 
</P>
<P>
	Her charred, headless body was found stuffed inside a suitcase  
in a swamp Wednesday, and her seaman boyfriend -- George 
Skiadopoulos, who is charged with murder -- led police to her 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Scully said she tried to warn her only daughter about  
Skiadopoulos, a man she believed all along was only after her 
daughter's money. Mrs. Scully said he wanted to be a ``big shot'' 
in Greece and was pressuring Julie to buy a taxi business for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She claimed she loved him. I told her, `This kind of loving is  
sick,''' a tearful Mrs. Scully said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skiadopoulos, 24, showed police how he allegedly strangled the  
31-year-old Ms. Scully before hurling her nude body into a swamp in 
Kavala in northern Greece, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he doused his lover's body with gasoline and set her  
afire, then packed the former model's corpse into a suitcase, using 
a hacksaw to cut off her head so the body would fit inside. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a heavily guarded Skiadopoulos led police to the  
place where he dumped her remains. A police diver found the 
suitcase in 5 feet of water, and divers combed a nearby beach where 
Skiadopoulos told police he had thrown her head. 
</P>
<P>
	Athens police say Skiadopoulos -- ``blinded by his passion'' --  
strangled Ms. Scully in a jealous rage Jan. 8. He was about to be 
drafted into the Greek army, and she had told her family two days 
earlier that she wanted to come home to Mansfield, 10 miles south 
of Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece authorities denounced it as ``one of the most horrible  
crimes ever committed in our country.'' Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., 
called for swift justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Skiadopoulos could face life in prison without parole if  
convicted. He was arraigned today on charges of murder, lying under 
oath and abuse of a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret this,'' he said after leaving the offices of  
prosecutor Dimitris Papageorgiou. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scully was known in Trenton for her 10 appearances as a  
``Page 6 Girl,'' posing in a bikini in the Trentonian newspaper. 
She appeared on the show ``Hard Copy'' in 1992 in a story about the 
Trentonian. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends were at a loss to explain what attracted Ms. Scully -- a  
stunning, outgoing brunette -- to Skiadopoulos, a balding 
maintenance man who had quit his job as a petty officer on a 
Caribbean cruise ship and was living off her $600,000 divorce 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he showed so much love for her that it overwhelmed  
her,'' said Tracey Allen, a close friend. ``She was just so 
needy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others saw the relationship as a star-crossed mismatch between a  
fun-loving young woman and a jealous manipulator. They said Ms. 
Scully would only call home when Skiadopoulos was away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Julie at the end,'' said Susan White. ``He pulled  
her away from a lot of her friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scully met Skiadopoulos in November 1997 while vacationing  
with her then-husband, Tim Nist. After her cruise, Skiadopoulos 
began calling her and faxing messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Several months later, she and Nist took another cruise and again  
saw Skiadopoulos. While still married, she began having a 
relationship with him in February 1998. In November, she divorced 
her husband, and in December she moved to Greece to marry 
Skiadopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mansfield, her family struggled to cope with the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just kind of numb,'' said Nist, who plans to travel to  
Greece to bring his ex-wife's body home this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Scully remembers Skiadopoulos as ``a violent man.'' He was  
charged with assault and allowed to return to Greece after 
allegedly choking Mrs. Scully during an argument last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, he was just evil. I tried to tell her,'' Mrs. Scully  
said. ``She said to me, `Mom, you read too many novels. I'm going 
to be around forever.'''

<HEADLINE>  Most Asian Stock Markets Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets fell Thursday -- with Hong  
Kong taking the biggest hit -- as investors across the region staged 
a massive sell-off in reaction to Wall Street's losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 358.70 points, or 3.7  
percent, to close at 9,360.96 -- the lowest finish since Oct. 15. On 
Wednesday, the Hang Seng had risen 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors -- particularly futures players -- took their cue from  
the 1.3 percent fall by the Dow Jones industrial average in New 
York on Wednesday, said Robert Rowntree, chief of research at 
Prudential-Bache Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, blue chips snapped a recent winning streak that had  
pushed the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average up by 8.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei fell 107.74 points, or 0.75 percent, to end at  
14,342.32. On Tuesday, the average had risen 68.05 points, or 0.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares were up for most of the session as the U.S. dollar's  
gains against the Japanese yen encouraged buying of export-oriented 
high-technology issues, but they slipped late in the day. A 
stronger dollar boosts the value of earnings repatriated by 
Japanese exporters, while making their products cheaper in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 115.46 yen, up 1.64 yen from its level late  
Wednesday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 115.82 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares fell, snapping a two-day rally. The SET index  
lost 7.09 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 366.16. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Prices rose despite a weaker peso and Wall Street's  
losses. The PSE climbed 4.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,998.81. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors sold on market gains,  
particularly in banking issues. The JSX Composite Index fell 2.979 
points, or 0.72 percent, to close at 407.271. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares joined the regional trend and fall sharply.  
The Composite Index dropped 9.73 points, or 1.6 percent, to close 
at 595.45. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares fell on continued pessimism over an early  
economic recovery. The Weighted Price Index fell 75.46 points, or 
1.2 percent, to close at 6,063.41. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares rose on a continuing rebound from recent sharp  
losses. The KOSPI index rose 6.27 points, or 1.1 percent, to close 
at 571.47. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares fell following Wall Street's losses. The STI  
fell 31.42 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 1,426.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares rose as investors scooped up blue chips on upbeat  
corporate earnings reports. The All Ordinaries Index rose 25.80 
points, or 0.90 percent, to close at 2,877.20. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares fell, although late afternoon buying held  
back further losses. The NZSE-40 index fell 3.46 points, or 0.15 
percent, to close 2,162.12.

<HEADLINE> Key U.S. Soccer Stars Change Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three of the biggest names in American soccer  
found new teams Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Alexi Lalas were traded from  
the New York/New Jersey MetroStars to Kansas City for midfielder 
Mark Chung and goalkeeper Mike Ammann. D.C. United midfielder John 
Harkes was loaned to last-place Nottingham Forest through the 
conclusion of England's Premier League season, which ends in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, D.C. United acquired Diego Sonora, a midfielder and  
defender from Argentina who played for the MetroStars, in a 
three-way deal that sent D.C. United's first-round 1999 college 
draft pick (the 11th overall) and its second-round selection to San 
Jose. The MetroStars get United's second- and third-round picks in 
2000 and San Jose's third-round pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars' deal was designed to free up room under the  
salary cap to obtain a scorer, perhaps San Jose's Eric Wynalda, who 
is on loan to Leon in Mexico's first division until May. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, 29, has just started to resurrect his international  
career under Bruce Arena, his former coach at the University of 
Virginia and the new coach of the U.S. national team. Meola was in 
goal for Sunday's scoreless tie in an exhibition game at Bolivia, 
his 88nd international appearance but his first since July 4, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the starter during the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and has  
28 shutouts in his international career. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes, 31, played for the United States in the 1990 and 1994  
World Cups and was captain of the team when he was unexpectedly 
dropped last spring by coach Steve Sampson, who quit after the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining D.C. United, Harkes played in England with  
Sheffield Wednesday, Derby and West Ham. He will remain with 
Nottingham Forest until after the English season, which ends in 
May. He may appear Saturday against Everton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am glad it's all sorted out,'' Nottingham Forest coach Ron  
Atkinson said. ``John will prove to be a worthwhile acquisition and 
will more than likely play some part on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harkes, who has six goals in 90 international appearances,  
played under Atkinson at Sheffield Wednesday. He became the first 
American to collect a winners' medal at Wembley when Wednesday beat 
Manchester United in the 1991 League Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Lalas, 28, started in the 1994 tournament, has 96 international  
appearances and was one of the loudest voices against Sampson, who 
limited the playing time of many veterans last summer in France, 
where the Americans went 0-3 and finished last in the 32-nation 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung, a 28-year-old who has made 24 international appearances,  
had 20 goals in 93 regular-season games with Kansas City the past 
three years and one goal in seven playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Amman, 27, spent two seasons with Charlton Athletic in England's  
first division and played in 60 regular-season and two postseason 
games with Kansas City the past three years, getting 10 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonora, 29, played for Dallas in its first two MLS seasons, then  
joined the MetroStars last season.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Master P Tries Out for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) -- Millionaire rapper Percy Miller says he's  
got game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Shaq (Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal) can play basketball and  
rap, I can rap and play basketball,'' says Miller, an NBA wannabe 
who is more famous as rap artist Master P. 
</P>
<P>
	While not everyone in the Charlotte Hornets camp agrees with  
him, no one is questioning his heart or his drive. But can a 
28-year-old street ball player with a net worth of $56 million make 
the long leap from the Continental Basketball Association to the 
NBA? 
</P>
<P>
	``Just say it's a long, long, long shot,'' said Charlotte  
general manager Bob Bass as the time drew closer to the Hornets' 
first preseason game tonight against the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Point guard David Wesley didn't want to make any predictions on  
Miller's chances of making the club. He was added to the Hornets' 
training camp roster last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an icon around here,'' Wesley said with a smile, glancing  
over at Miller, who was being interviewed by a local TV reporter 
following the Hornets' practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller shrugs off all the skepticism with a smile featuring a  
mouth full of gold teeth with diamond inlays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be here if I wasn't hungry,'' he said after a  
two-hour workout with better-known Hornet players like Wesley, 
center Derrick Coleman and power forward Anthony Mason. ``I'm ready 
to show the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, Miller has shown he can play with the best. He was  
a big hit when he made his first appearance with the Hornets in a 
free scrimmage at the Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity helped draw more than 15,000 fans. With some of  
his fans showing up at 7 a.m., the Hornets were forced to open the 
gates 30 minutes early. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller got a loud ovation when he was introduced. When his  
3-pointer swished through the net, the fans cheered as if it came 
in the final seconds of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a guard, finished with nine points on 3-of-6 shooting  
and handed out four assists to offset his one turnover. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign in the stands read: ``Goodbye MJ, Hello Master P.''  
</P>
<P>
	To that, he replied: ``Michael Jordan always had the fans'  
attention. Why can't Master P get the fans' attention now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Miller picked up most of his basketball skills from street  
ball, he also played at Warren Easton High School in New Orleans 
and briefly at the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, he was with the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury. He was  
invited to the Hornets camp after Tyree Davis, father of Hornets 
rookie Ricky Davis, talked to Bass and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	While his chances of making the team are slim at best, he can  
teach his other teammates a thing or two about winning in the 
business world. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his own record company, No Limit, and has turned it  
into a multifaceted, music-production sports agency business, 
grossing $56 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	As an agent, he represents Ricky Davis and NBA players Ron  
Mercer and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that Saturday's scrimmage was the first time  
Coleman had appeared in public as a member of the Hornets, Miller 
had the largest crowd of autograph seekers surrounding him after 
the workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can play,'' said Hornets coach Dave Cowens. ``It's always  
good when someone gets the fans to pay attention.''

<HEADLINE> GTE's 4th Q Profits Rise 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- GTE Corp.'s profits rose 22 percent in the  
fourth quarter, meeting Wall Street expectations, on growing 
revenue from local and long-distance calling, as well as wireless 
and data services. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE reported Thursday it earned $855 million, or 88 cents per  
share, in the last three months of 1998, up from $702 million, or 
73 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 8 percent to $6.83 billion from $6.35 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The recent quarter's results included costs of $90 million to  
cover previously announced investments in new data services. The 
profits matched Wall Street's projections, according to First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE stock was up $1.75 at $67.93 3/4 per share in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment marked by regulatory uncertainty and  
increasing competition, we continue to meet our objectives for 
profitable growth,'' said GTE chairman and chief executive Charles 
Lee, who is working to complete the company's merger with Bell 
Atlantic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, GTE earned $2.17 billion, or $2.24 per share,  
down from $2.79 billion, or $2.90 per share, in the same period 
last year. The 1998 results were reduced by $802 million for 
various charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the year rose to $25.47 billion from $23.26 billion.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Salt Lake City Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Justice Department is trying to  
determine whether a Salt Lake Olympic official carried $50,000 to 
Budapest, Hungary, in 1995 just before the 2002 Winter Games were 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Godfrey, a former city councilman, said he was contacted by  
the FBI on Wednesday and met with agents that evening to discuss 
what he had told reporters earlier in the week: that a bid 
committee staff member had told him of carrying $50,000 in cash to 
Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey said Thursday he promised the FBI agents he would not  
disclose what he told them. 
</P>
<P>
	But he recounted the conversation he said occurred in the summer  
of 1996, when he and the other man were reminiscing about what they 
had been doing the year before. Godfrey, who was a councilman at 
the time and traveled to Budapest, declined in an interview to name 
the man. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was saying that his trip to Budapest was a bit  
uncomfortable because he had to carry $50,000 in cash. So it wasn't 
a pleasant flight for him,'' Godfrey said. ``He didn't say what it 
was for. He said he gave it to another staff member for expenses 
and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Godfrey said he didn't press the man for details.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that time, we had won the bid. I really didn't want to hear  
anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After this winter's revelations that Salt Lake's Olympic bid  
committee lavishly courted International Olympic Committee members 
before the IOC vote, the information seemed more interesting, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Justice Department, an ethics panel for the Salt  
Lake Organizing Committee and the United States Olympic Committee 
are investigating the extravagant payments, gifts, free medical 
care and scholarships for IOC relatives. The SLOC ethics probe is 
due by Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC during the weekend said its investigation had found Salt  
Lake's bid committee spent more than $800,000, including cash 
payments, on 14 specific IOC members. Utah's attorney general has 
promised an investigation into whether state laws were broken after 
the Justice Department and SLOC probes are finished. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the bid committee staff, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said he took no large sums of cash to Budapest. But the 
financial people on the bid may have carried cash to pay hotel and 
food expenses for some of the 300 people who made up Salt Lake's 
delegation, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Peterson, a former city official, handled finances for the  
bid committee after he joined up in 1990 and continued in that job 
after the city won its bid and formed the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, J.J. Bullock, said Thursday afternoon that  
Peterson was interviewed by the Justice Department on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock declined to say whether Peterson was questioned about  
$50,000 carried to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson has been mum about his role in the bid committee, in  
part because when he was forced out of SLOC in 1996, he signed a 
contract that demanded his silence about Olympic matters.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Expect Olowokandi on Fri. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON, Calif. (AP) -- Center Michael Olowokandi, the first  
selection in last summer's NBA draft, is expected to arrive in Los 
Angeles late Friday and sign a contract with the Clippers over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't take any time, to sign a contract,'' Clippers  
vice president of basketball operations Elgin Baylor said Thursday 
at the team's media day. 
</P>
<P>
	As last year's No. 1 draft pick, Olowokandi is expected to sign  
a three-year deal for $10,368,840 and an additional $4,662,472 if 
the Clippers exercise the fourth-year option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're anxiously awaiting his arrival,'' first-year coach Chris  
Ford said. ``I think it's just red tape. He's got some catching up 
to do. We'll bring him along gradually, we'll see what kind of 
shape he's in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Michael is going to be a fine young player. He's a big  
young man who has some good offensive skills, is able to block some 
shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi was released from his contract by Kinder Bologna of  
the Italian League on Monday. Originally, he was bound to that team 
until Feb. 15 -- 10 days after the abbreviated NBA season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is he's willing to listen and to  
learn,'' Ford said. ``Those are important assets right now. It's 
going to be a learning process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clippers said an MRI examination on forward  
Rodney Rogers' right knee showed no damage, and Rogers returned to 
practice Thursday after sitting out a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	However, forward Maurice Taylor, who has a strained quadriceps  
in his right leg, didn't practice and probably won't play in 
exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday and 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's day-to-day,'' Taylor said. ``You've got to let it heal.  
It's not something that's going to keep me out too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor injured himself early in training camp but continued to  
practice. He was told by team doctors to take a few days off and 
has done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers and Taylor both reported to training camp a few pounds  
over their playing weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not in great physical shape, you're more vulnerable  
to injuries,'' Ford said.

<HEADLINE> Lilly Profits Up 24 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sales of Prozac and the antipsychosis agent  
Zyprexa fueled a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings at Eli 
Lilly and Co., the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis-based drug maker said profits during the  
October-December period rose to $567.3 million, or 51 cents a 
share, compared with $457.5 million, or 41 cents per share, during 
the fourth quarter of 1997. Results matched analysts' expectations, 
according to a survey by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $2.64 billion, led by  
an 8 percent rise in Prozac sales to $744.5 million and a 62 
percent rise in sales of Zyprexa to $432.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual sales of Prozac, the world's bestselling antidepressant,  
rose 10 percent to $2.81 billion. The drug makes up 30 percent of 
Lilly's overall sales. On Monday, Lilly agreed to pay $4 million to 
three generic drugmakers to partially settle a challenge to its 
Prozac patents, the last of which expires in 2003. However, another 
part of the patent challenge will move forward on federal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also has high hopes for the osteoporosis treatment  
Evista, but its sales remain disappointing, reaching $62.8 million 
during the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter, Lilly said it completed a $2 billion  
share repurchase program first announced in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Lilly earned $2.18 billion, or $1.94 per share,  
a 23 percent increase over $1.77 billion, or $1.57 per share in 
1997, excluding one-time items in both years. Annual sales 
increased 16 percent to $9.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lilly rose 87 1/2 cents to $91.62 1/2 in morning trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia OKs Political Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Indonesian Parliament, once a  
rubberstamp for former authoritarian President Suharto, passed 
political reforms on Thursday for what is expected to be the most 
open election in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of negotiations and last minute deal-making, the  
legislature unanimously passed three bills that will largely 
dismantle the tightly controlled political system that had backed 
Suharto since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreed,'' shouted legislators after Lt. Gen. Hari Subarno,  
deputy speaker of Parliament and head of its armed forces faction, 
asked them if they approved the bills. Many stood and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to restate the government's promise to organize a fair  
and open election at whatever cost because this is the only way to 
create a credible government,'' said army Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid, 
who is the home affairs minister. 
</P>
<P>
	President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto after riots and  
protests last May, has scheduled parliamentary elections on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the changes, which reduce but don't abolish a  
political role for the powerful military, don't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The military, which now holds 75 non-elected seats in the  
Parliament, will have its representation slashed to 38. Under 
Indonesian law, members of the military are prohibited from voting 
in elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesians resent the military, which is trying to revamp  
its tarnished image as a human rights violator and is struggling to 
contain a wave of riots and protests that has hit Indonesia in the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Once elected, the Parliament along with 200 government  
appointees will form a People's Consultative Assembly. As the 
nation's highest legislative body, the assembly will vote for a 
president later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new laws, elections will be open up to a wide range of  
groups as long as they don't promote racial or religious problems 
and conform to list of other broad requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4 million state employees, whom Suharto forced to vote  
for his ruling Golkar Party, will be banned from membership in 
political parties. Habibie has said political neutrality is 
essential in the state bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> Hometown Setting Works for Estefan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A Super Bowl halftime performance in Minneapolis is  
about as incongruous as Frosty the Snowman shooting off fireworks 
on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, the setting for Gloria Estefan couldn't be  
more perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll take the field for Sunday's halftime show less than a  
half-hour from her Miami Beach home, performing her Latin-driven 
dance music in front of a fan base that has followed her from the 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's significant because it's in Miami,'' Estefan said  
Thursday. ``I did it in Minneapolis, and it was great. But here 
there's a lot of Latins, and I'm very appreciative of the honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-winning diva provides one-third of the headline act  
in the 11-minute show titled ``Soul, Salsa and Swing.'' She will be 
joined by Motown mainstay Stevie Wonder and swing band Big Bad 
Voodoo Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be joined by more than 1,000 other performers, some  
dancing on stilts, along with huge lighted balloon balls, disco 
balls, lazers and pyrotechnics shooting from 30 different locations 
at Pro Player Stadium. Producers from Radio City Music Hall also 
promise some surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, Radio City knew we had to come up with something  
even hotter,'' said Eddie Micone, a Radio City senior vice 
president who is co-producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl halftime annually is the most-watched live  
performance in music, with more than 75,000 in attendance and 
another 800 million watching on television in 180 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep throwing that number at me, and I tell them to  
stop,'' said Estefan, who answered questions in English and 
Spanish. ``I don't think it's intimidating as long as you enjoy 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estefan joins jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain as the Super Bowl's  
only two-time halftime headliners. 
</P>
<P>
	Wonder has won 15 Grammy awards during a career that has spanned  
four decades since he was discovered at age 11. His 1984 song ``I 
Just Called to Say I Love You'' earned an Academy Award and is 
Motown's all-time top selling single internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exciting,'' the multitalented performer said. ``We've  
been close, but this is the first time we've been part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surprisingly, he wasn't part of last year's Super Bowl halftime  
show in San Diego, a tribute to Motown's 40th anniversary featuring 
Smokey Robinson, The Temptations and Boyz II Men. However, he said 
he didn't feel slighted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll celebrate anyone's celebration,'' he said. ``I was just  
excited to be at home, chilling and listening to the various 
artists. I was celebrating just knowing they were there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amidst the established performers comes Big Bad Voodoo Daddy,  
only two years removed from playing Hollywood's underground club 
scene. The group's performance in the film ``Swingers'' helped 
launch a nationwide swing music revival. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very appreciative,'' said Scotty Morris, the band's  
leader and vocalist. ``It's something that's just hard to 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Morris said the full realization of playing the Super  
Bowl didn't sink in until they met Wonder and Estefan backstage on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honestly didn't believe it until we walked up on this  
stage,'' Morris said. ``We thought it was a really cool joke.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Accused of HIV Misdiagnosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An Ohio man is suing his former doctor for  
allegedly misdiagnosing him with HIV and then prescribing a potent 
drug that had to be taken each day for more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Savage contends he was never even tested for HIV by Dr.  
David Blatt and his colleagues at Illinois Masonic Medical Center 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage, a 43-year-old flight attendant who has since moved from  
Chicago to Dayton, Ohio, did not return a telephone message 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit says he was diagnosed with the AIDS virus in July  
1990 and treated with AZT and other AIDS-fighting drugs through 
1996. In addition to ``extreme mental pain and suffering,'' 
Savage's lawsuit says he experienced such AZT-induced side effects 
as tingling hands, vision and bowel problems, and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Savage's Ohio doctor questioned his lack of symptoms  
and ordered tests that determined he was not carrying the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so ecstatic and relieved,'' said Savage's attorney,  
Valerie Leopold. ``It really gave him a new lease on life. Then 
after that began wearing off, questions developed and anger 
developed. ... And then concern developed about, `Gosh, am I the 
only one?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court, seeks  
more than $50,000 in damages each from Illinois Masonic, Blatt and 
Triad Health Practices, his clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	A receptionist at Triad referred calls to Illinois Masonic,  
where spokeswoman Carmeline Esposito said lawyers were still 
reviewing the case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were many tests performed on this patient,'' Esposito  
said. When asked if those included HIV tests, she said, ``I would 
assume so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Catherine Creticos, a Chicago-based infectious disease  
specialist, said it is standard procedure to do several tests to 
determine if a patient is HIV-positive. However, in 1990 some tests 
used today didn't exist, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another test available at the time -- the standard HIV antibody  
test -- can turn from positive to negative but only in rare cases in 
the last stages of the disease, when the body is no longer able to 
produce antibodies to fight off the virus, she said.

<HEADLINE> On Stage: Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hal Prince sees musicals where others can't even  
imagine a song. 
</P>
<P>
	In his more than four decades of directing and producing on  
Broadway, Prince has made theater magic out of the most unlikely 
material. 
</P>
<P>
	As far back as 1957, he had people scratching their heads when  
he decided to co-produce a modern version of ``Romeo and Juliet'' 
set among New York street gangs. The result: ``West Side Story.'' 
And who wanted to see a musical about Nazis? ``Cabaret'' made the 
answer seem obvious. Then there was the macabre tale of a London 
barber who slices throats while giving close shaves. It became 
``Sweeney Todd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do a lot of analyzing of why I do something,'' Prince  
said the other day in his Rockefeller Center office, filled with 
posters and Tony Awards for many of the shows he has worked on. 
``It's all instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season he has focused his energy on another controversial  
project, ``Parade,'' adapted from a true story that took place in 
Atlanta before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical concerns Leo Frank, a Northerner and a Jew, accused  
of murdering a young girl who worked in the pencil factory he 
managed. The man is tried and convicted of murder, has his death 
sentence commuted to life in prison but then is lynched by a mob. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank's life interested playwright Alfred Uhry, who had used  
much of his own Atlanta upbringing in two other stage successes, 
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uhry told Prince he was thinking of telling Frank's story as a  
play or musical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `It's a musical. The one I'm looking for,''' Prince  
recalls. ``And that was that. Why do I think things are musicals? I 
don't know. It's easy with hindsight to say, `I know why.' But it 
seemed like material that invited musical form. I think we have 
proven our point. Jason is an extraordinary composer-lyricist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason is Jason Robert Brown, a 28-year-old songwriter who was  
discovered playing in a piano bar by Prince's daughter, Daisy. She 
later directed an off-Broadway revue of Brown's songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding new writing talent is not unusual for Prince. He  
produced John Kander and Fred Ebb's first collaboration, ``Flora, 
the Red Menace,'' starring Liza Minnelli. The show was not a hit, 
but their next -- ``Cabaret'' -- was. He did Jerry Bock and Sheldon 
Harnick's first success, ``Fiorello,'' as well as their biggest, 
``Fiddler on the Roof.'' And Prince was there early in Stephen 
Sondheim's career with ``West Side Story'' and the golden period of 
``Company,'' ``A Little Night Music'' and ``Follies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Parade'' interested Prince for two reasons. One was the  
political subject: how scapegoats are chosen and what was behind 
the whole injustice of Frank's lynching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was because the South lost the Civil War and they  
reasoned that a little girl would not have been raped and murdered 
in a factory because there would have been no factory,'' Prince 
says. ``She would have been on a farm -- and the existence of the 
factory was a result of losing the Civil War, which had only been 
within 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the guy who ran the factory was a Northerner. I think it  
was less about his being Jewish, much less than it was about his 
being a Northerner and the incident happening in a factory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second was its story of two people, Leo and Lucille Frank,  
whose relationship gets stronger as their lives get more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a rather antiseptic, energyless, polite marriage and  
because of adversity, because of the trauma, reinvent themselves, 
become heroic and fall madly in love,'' Prince says. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's obviously the subject that makes the other one OK in  
the theater because the one story alone wouldn't give the audience 
the emotional connection to the show that the love story does. I 
can hear it every night in the theater. The audience is utterly 
connected to those two people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It helps that Prince has impeccably cast the production, too,  
particularly the beleaguered husband and wife. They are played by 
Brent Carver, who starred in Prince's production of ``Kiss of the 
Spider Woman,'' and Carolee Carmello, in her first major role. 
</P>
<P>
	Through two readings (one in Philadelphia and one in New York)  
to a workshop production that played four performances in Toronto 
to the start of rehearsals last September, Prince has carefully 
supervised every aspect of the show's extensive birthing process. 
Many of his collaborators were old friends and colleagues, 
including choreographer Patricia Birch. 
</P>
<P>
	When ``Parade'' finally opened at Lincoln Center's Vivian  
Beaumont Theater in December, some of its performers had been with 
the musical for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's loyalty to the material,'' Prince says. ``Actors are  
hungry to do challenging work and the opportunities aren't that 
frequent. So they will wait. It is called being idealistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In those two years, Prince said, the show deepened and became  
more detailed. Yet the workshop process is a far cry from when 
Prince started producing shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Harold Prince in Manhattan on Jan. 30, 1928, his first  
production was ``The Pajama Game'' in 1954. Shows would try out of 
town for four weeks -- one in New Haven and then three more in 
either Boston or Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``But remember, shows were much less complicated. You couldn't  
go out-of-town with this show or `Phantom of the Opera' or `Kiss of 
the Spider Woman.' You can't move these shows, for numerous 
reasons, that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything has gotten more complicated and more sophisticated  
-- the way you move scenery; the speed with which you want things to 
happen; the intensity and artistry of the lighting. In many 
instances, it looks like minimalism. But the fact is, although the 
secret is to make it look like there is not much there, you know 
how complicated it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the theater has rewarded Prince very well. If his early  
shows made him successful, ``The Phantom of the Opera'' -- which he 
directed in all its incarnations -- made him very rich. 
</P>
<P>
	But only rarely has he taken on an idea just for the money, he  
says, and they ``probably were bad ideas in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theater is not about that. It is about creating something. The  
fact that some of my shows have done so well is sheer luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says he has always told his investors not to come aboard to  
make money, but to ``be part of somebody's adventure and be proud 
to say, `I had money in a show like ``Pacific Overtures.'' It lost 
everything, but boy, what an amazing and valiant artistic journey 
that was.'''

<HEADLINE>  Feds, Disabled Sue Yankee Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The House that Ruth built should be renovated to  
better handle disabled people, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White says. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials on Thursday joined a lawsuit against the New  
York Yankees, and added New York City as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- filed in December on behalf of three New Jersey  
citizens and a Manhattan man, all wheelchair users -- claims the 
area of Yankee Stadium set aside for them has restricted views. It 
also says they must pay nearly 100 percent more for their tickets 
and can only get them by calling the stadium during certain hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball is the national pastime and Yankee Stadium is home to  
its most storied franchise,'' White said. ``This lawsuit seeks to 
ensure that people with disabilities will have an equal opportunity 
to experience the thrill of the game in this historic place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said the organization does not  
comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and calls on the court to  
make the Yankees fix the stadium so its more accessible to 
wheelchair users. The 75-year-old ballpark reserves 64 wheelchair 
spaces and 24 accompanying seats for each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Joseph Reilly, of Tenafly, N.J., said he stopped going  
to Yankees games in 1977 because he couldn't see anything from the 
section set aside for wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said one area for wheelchair users behind the main  
box level has no seats for companions and costs twice as much as 
most stadium seats. The other area, located on the field box level, 
limits wheelchair users to one companion and costs up to three 
times as much as general stadium seating, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yankees have always been famous for hitting home runs,''  
Reilly, 56, said during a telephone interview. ``What's the point 
in going if you can't see one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiff Theresa Murphy, of Middletown, N.J., said she tried to  
get two Yankees tickets for one of the playoff games last September 
with the Cleveland Indians as an early birthday present for her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	After calling a ticket agent and being told he could not help  
her, she called the Yankee Clubhouse store in Manhattan, which told 
her to call the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I called the stadium, I reached a man who told me he  
couldn't help me because the woman who handles such tickets was out 
to lunch,'' she said. ``So I hung up and wrote a letter to Mr. 
(George) Steinbrenner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I phrased it very nicely, saying all I was asking for is help  
in getting the tickets. I was happy to pay for them,'' Mrs. Murphy 
said. ``I got no response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other plaintiffs -- James Pascuiti of Mountainside, N.J., and  
Walter Rynasko of Manhattan -- did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Blue Cross-Blue Shield of N.H. Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Health insurer Anthem Inc. expanded its  
Northeast presence Thursday by purchasing Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of New Hampshire for $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would transform New Hampshire's largest insurer from a  
nonprofit into a mutual company, which is essentially owned by its 
policyholders. The acquisition must be approved by state 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthem, a mutual insurance company with 5 million customers,  
manages Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Connecticut, Indiana, 
Kentucky and Ohio. Anthem earned $172 million on revenues of $5.9 
billion last year, according to the company's unaudited figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have been  
consolidating for years, hoping to become more efficient and more 
competitive against national managed care plans such as Aetna Inc. 
and United HealthCare. A decade ago more than 100 Blues plans were 
in operation; Thursday's action brings the number of plans down to 
54. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Cross of New Hampshire, which insures about 350,000  
residents in that state, faced trouble competing with regional and 
national health insurers. Chairman William Hart said the deal made 
good financial sense for his company, which lost $20 million on 
revenues of $600 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision assures that (Blue Cross) will have access to  
sufficient financial resources to protect our members in a very 
volatile marketplace,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the $120 million in proceeds, Blue Cross must pay off its  
debts, including $30 million it borrowed from other Blue Cross 
plans to acquire the Matthew Thornton health maintenance 
organization in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $70 million to $80 million would go to establish a  
nonprofit charitable trust benefiting health care programs in New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been building a New England regional presence since  
our affiliation with Connecticut in 1997,'' said L. Ben Lytle, 
Anthem's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia ``Sam'' Mekrut, executive director of the New Hampshire  
Citizens Alliance, which has an agreement with Blue Cross to 
represent consumer interests in any deal, questioned whether $80 
million was a realistic amount for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she also is concerned about Anthem's commitment to keep  
Blue Cross involved in the community.

<HEADLINE> Paris, Zurich Exchanges Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Paris and Zurich stock exchanges announced an  
alliance today, adding a new twist to efforts to create a 
pan-European stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement seems aimed at giving the Paris exchange more  
leverage in talks with seven other European markets over what the 
new regional bourse should look like. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight exchanges involved in the talks are now aligned in  
three blocs: London-Frankfurt-Madrid; Amsterdam-Brussels and 
Paris-Zurich. The Italian market is the only one with no 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris exchange stepped up efforts to find a partner after  
the London and Frankfurt exchanges announced plans for a common 
trading platform last July. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the agreement with the Zurich market, Paris Bourse  
president Jean-Francois Theodore addressed one of the key issues 
that will have to be worked out for the pan-European market to get 
off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He said medium-size companies should have access to the  
electronic platform that will serve as the foundation of the new 
exchange. Frankfurt and London want to grant access only to blue 
chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of Thursday's agreement, members of the Swiss  
exchange will become members of the Paris exchange and vice versa 
by the end of the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Rise in HUD Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's new budget seeks a $2.5  
billion spending increase in Department of Housing and Urban 
Development programs, according to a draft proposal prepared by the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to make public the budget request and his  
proposals for fighting crime, homelessness, and other urban woes 
during a White House meeting today with the nation's mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is going to talk to the mayors about his agenda  
for urban America. From housing to education, from fighting crime 
to fighting homelessness, and from economic empowerment to making 
our urban areas more livable,'' said White House spokesman Barry 
Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget request would bring HUD's budget to $28 billion in  
fiscal 2000. It would include funding to increase affordable 
housing, housing vouchers for needy residents in distressed areas, 
and $150 million for newly designated economic empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of the plans Clinton was set to detail for the  
mayors was the initiative he announced earlier this month to 
encourage Wall Street to invest in underserved inner city and rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan includes a $1 billion tax credit designed to spur $6  
billion in new equity capital for investment in the targeted 
markets and the creation of new private investment partnerships to 
be known as America's Private Investment Companies, patterned after 
the Overseas Private Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also planned to ask for support for continued  
funding for community policing, a ``zero tolerance'' program to 
keep criminals from falling back on drugs and reduce recidivism, 
and for requiring gun manufacturers to install child safety locks 
on handguns.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Sues U.S. Tobacco Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Venezuela has become the latest Latin American  
nation to file suit in a U.S. court in a bid to recover millions of 
dollars from tobacco companies for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court,  
Venezuela's government seeks billions of dollars in damages it 
claims it suffered in health care costs and losses from the 
decreased productivity of its labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Tobacco's conduct has caused an incalculable loss of life,  
disease, disability, pain, suffering, illness and economic loss to 
the users of Big Tobacco's products,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit ``mirrors the state and federal claims that were filed  
against the tobacco companies,'' said Steven Marks, a lawyer for 
Venezuela. ``Venezuelan lives are worth just as much as American 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, Guatemala became the first country to sue U.S.  
cigarette makers to recover damages for treating sick smokers. 
Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Panama have since followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies say the international claims filed in the  
United States are an attempt to cash in on large settlements states 
have received. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central and South American cases copycat the state  
attorneys general lawsuits in the United States,'' said Mark Smith, 
spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. ``They represent a 
cynical attempt on the part of foreign government officials to 
hijack the U.S. legal system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As well as Brown &AMP; Williamson, the suit names as defendants  
British American Tobacco Co., Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc. and several 
industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	British American Tobacco Co. controls about 76 percent of the  
Venezuelan market. Philip Morris Inc. controls most of the 
remaining market. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Little, associate general counsel for Philip Morris, added  
that the lawsuit was filed ``by the wrong party, in the wrong 
place, for the wrong reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in Miami because one of the defendants,  
the Brooke Group Ltd., is based here. Miami is also better suited 
to hear a case involving a Spanish-speaking country, Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco giants settled in November with 46 states, agreeing  
to pay $206 billion over 25 years. They had previously settled with 
four states for about $40 billion over 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, President Clinton said the federal government would  
follow with its own lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> TRW Offers $7B for LucasVarity PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Inc. offered $7 billion in cash Thursday  
for LucasVarity PLC, a highly coveted British maker of auto brake 
systems and aerospace equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	While LucasVarity officials indicated they will accept TRW's  
offer, a rival suitor, Federal-Mogul Corp., said it may sweeten the 
$6.5 billion cash-and-stock offer that TRW rejected earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	LucasVarity officials said the TRW offer has the support of the  
company's board, and there was no indication that support would 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Victor Rice, LucasVarity chief executive officer, said his  
company would be ``appropriately accommodating when and if 
Federal-Mogul makes an appropriate offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The automotive supply industry has been consolidating rapidly.  
The combination of TRW and Federal-Mogul would be the fifth 
industry merger in 1999, according to Securities Data Co. There 
were 80 combinations in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Gorman, TRW's chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company doesn't want to be left out of the consolidation trend 
in the automotive industry, pointing out the deal came on the same 
day Ford Motor Co. agreed to buy the passenger car division of 
Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman said that as the world's major automakers continue to  
expand and combine, they will be most interested in working with 
two or three major suppliers with a proven track record. ``Size 
does matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman and Rice said the auto industry is demanding that its  
suppliers provide increasingly complex systems that can more easily 
fit right into a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``TRW's steering and suspension and LucasVarity's brakes and  
antilock brake systems are a wonderful fit in terms of what you can 
offer for the customer,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, as many as three companies indicated an interest  
in LucasVarity. The directors of both companies have approved the 
deal, but shareholders have not voted. Federal-Mogul Thursday urged 
LucasVarity shareholders to take no action on the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rice didn't rule out further talks with Federal-Mogul, he  
said, ``I would add that the synergies that exist (with 
Federal-Mogul) are dramatically less than with TRW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efraim Levy, auto industry analyst for Standard and Poor's in  
New York, said he believes that TRW will be able to top any further 
offer from Federal-Mogul. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close in this year's second quarter.  
Rice will be named vice chairman of TRW and will direct the 
combined automotive operations from the TRW headquarters. TRW said 
it will not change its name but will find a way to benefit from the 
LucasVarity name recognition in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman and Rice said they expect cost savings of about $200  
million, and eventual job growth, although they said it is too soon 
to say whether jobs will be lost initially. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schmall, managing partner of The Planning Edge, an  
automotive industry analysis and consulting firm in Troy, Mich., 
said the combination could eventually lead to a spinoff company 
focused on the automotive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, shares of LucasVarity rose $1.25, or 3  
percent, to $47.93 3/4. TRW shares slipped 87 1/2 cents, or 2 percent, to 
$50.25. Federal-Mogul shares fell $1.18 3/4, or 2 percent, to close at 
$59 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lost Battle, But Won War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate clerk intoned the vote: 56 to 44,  
the Democrats lost. But in losing, they seemed to prove they have 
the strength to save Bill Clinton's presidency. ``Home free,'' one 
historian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans won Wednesday's battle of two test votes. There  
was only one Democratic defector, Wisconsin's Russ Feingold. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in defeat, the Democrats seemed to win the war.  
</P>
<P>
	They demonstrated they do not believe the evidence warrants  
Clinton's removal and do not intend to help Republicans achieve the 
67 votes required to send the president packing. 
</P>
<P>
	The real suspense now -- absent any bombshells -- is how both  
sides can find a quick way out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me Clinton is home free,'' said Columbia  
University historian Henry Graff. ``I gather there is a movement to 
say some nasty things and then vote him not guilty. There may be 
something like a sense of the Senate resolution which says, `We 
don't like what you've done.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans know that Americans are sick of the year-long soap  
opera and want to move on to other matters. But the GOP also 
recognizes that its conservative base wants Clinton chased out of 
town or at least humiliated as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for Republicans is to try to satisfy the base  
without incurring the wrath of the public. Some analysts think that 
is an impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans seem to be following a strategy of getting out  
as fast as they can but doing it in a respectable way,'' said 
Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	If the process drags on, ``It can ring the death knell of  
Republican control in the Senate,'' said presidential historian and 
biographer Robert Dallek of Boston University, ``I think they have 
already lost the House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To hasten the end, Republican prosecutors shaved their witness  
list to just three people -- a ``pitiful three,'' in the words of 
lead prosecutor Henry Hyde, R-Ill. -- although the GOP had hoped 
once to call as many as 15. 
</P>
<P>
	They also promised not to ask Monica Lewinsky -- either in  
depositions or in live testimony in the Senate -- about ``her 
explicit sexual relations with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans recognize they can't win unless they can shake up  
the case somehow and change a lot of minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting the best interpretation on Wednesday's vote, GOP  
prosecutor Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said, ``It most likely 
indicates that at the present time there are not the two-thirds 
votes necessary. But I think it shows that on both sides they're 
looking at the facts ... We'll just have to wait to see what those 
facts show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats saw the vote as the handwriting on the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	``The president will not be removed from office,'' Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle declared. ``It is time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The public's view of the case was summed up by Jeff Sharratt,  
31, as he browsed a book shop in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are tired of the whole impeachment trial and I  
think it should be done away with,'' said Sharratt, a flight 
attendant for Continental Airlines. ``They're not going to have the 
votes in the end, and they already know that, so it is kind of a 
waste of taxpayer time and money.''

<HEADLINE> Dummies Dropped From Seat Belt Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They've become popular figures in shopping  
malls and inspired the name of a rock band, but the crash test 
dummies made famous in seat belt ads are taking a back seat to a 
new set of more shocking TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has decided  
that ads featuring the dummies affectionately known as Vince and 
Larry will be replaced next month with a pair of graphic ads aimed 
at breaking through the recent plateau in seat belt usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of seeing lifelike dummies dust themselves off after a  
crash, viewers will see human actors engaged in common moments that 
are cut short by an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In one spot, titled ``Ice Cream,'' a husband out buying ice  
cream to satisfy his pregnant wife's midnight craving has his car 
hit head-on as he pulls out of the driveway. In a second ad, titled 
``Cruising,'' teen-agers in two cars cruising down a street giggle 
until one of the cars is smashed by a speeding van. 
</P>
<P>
	After each scene, the caption on the screen asks, ``Didn't see  
that coming? No one ever does. Buckle up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea behind the campaign was to really take a bold step  
and change our direction to reach those users who are taking short 
trips but not wearing their seat belts,'' said Ken Ulmer, spokesman 
for the Advertising Council. It is marketing the spots, made by the 
Chicago ad agency Leo Burnett, for the traffic safety 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not reaching part-time users, people who take trips to  
the store or out to pick up their kids. The statistics show they 
are at risk, too,'' Ulmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vince and Larry have been successful seat belt salesmen for 15  
years. With their gray jumpsuits and revolving heads, they have an 
appeal similar to that of the hapless but durable ``Star Wars'' tin 
man, C-3PO. The pair is mobbed at mall appearances and have had 
their name reach into the music industry thanks to the band, 
``Crash Test Dummies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond their public appeal, Vince and Larry have gotten results.  
In 1985, about 21 percent of the driving population wore seat 
belts; in 1996, the figure was up to 68 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That, however, is about where it has stayed.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has announced a goal of getting seat belt  
usage up to 85 percent by the end of the year, but traffic safety 
experts concede there are some high-risk drivers who will never 
wear seat belts. The new campaign is focusing on the casual wearer 
-- someone who is not against buckling up, but who does not do so on 
every trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ricardo Martinez, head of the National Highway Traffic  
Safety Administrator and a former emergency room physician, pushed 
for the new advertising approach after watching a series of 
gruesome traffic commercials aired in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for the U.S. ad makers was to walk the fine line  
between spurring people to action and repulsing them into 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will inhibit people is if they say, `Yes, but that's not  
really me,''' said Emily Soell, a member of the Advertising 
Council's advertising review committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was most important was the line afterwards, because that  
implies that the people survived and gets people to say, `Yes, with 
an accident, you never see it coming, so I better buckle up.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Ulmer, the Advertising Council spokesman, said the crash test  
dummies are in ``semi-retirement.'' He expects them to be used 
again in children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Soell, meanwhile, said Vince and Larry are victims of their own  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while, even the best advertising begins to blur itself  
because people have seen it so much that they no longer listen,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People found it so entertaining they end up paying attention  
more to the entertainment value: `Oh, I wonder what the seat belt 
dummy is going to do now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Advertising Council, a nonprofit group that works to gain  
free air time and print space for public service announcements, 
will begin showing the commercials in all major advertising markets 
by mid-February.

<HEADLINE> Urmanov Against the Odds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Against all odds -- almost against  
all logic -- Alexei Urmanov returns to a major championship and 
picks up where he left off in the final of the men's free skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic champion, leads going into today's  
session at the European Figure Skating Championships, just ahead of 
his younger teammates, who filled the void when he left the skating 
ranks for a season to heal an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexei Yagudin won the European title in 1998 as Urmanov was  
unable to defend. 
</P>
<P>
	And Evgeny Pluschenko took over from Urmanov as the Russian quad  
master, something Urmanov was doing with astonishing ease in the 
early 1990s before he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	His short program Tuesday gave him a slight lead entering  
today's final free program. He was in the same position at the 1997 
world championships, leading Yagudin and another Russian of note, 
future Olympic champion Ilya Kulik, before Urmanov withdrew minutes 
before the final free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Urmanov has been waiting almost two years to perform in a major  
championship and polish the luster that was lost along with his 
Olympic and European titles -- neither of which he was able to 
defend. 
</P>
<P>
	Whichever Russian wins the men's event, it will keep alive a  
remarkable streak. Russians have won every European title since 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak was thought to be ended in the pairs event final when  
defending champions and heavy favorites Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton 
Sikhardulidze had to drop out when Berezhnaya came down with the 
flu. Russian hopes were left with Maria Petrova and Alexei 
Tikhonov, skating together less than a year and buried in fifth 
place following the short program. 
</P>
<P>
	However Petrova and Tikhonov won the free skate portion of the  
competition and jumped into first to keep the streak alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very lucky and fortune smiled on us,'' Tikhonov said.  
</P>
<P>
	Poland's Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek were second with  
Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis of France third. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians are well placed to win the two other events.  
</P>
<P>
	Maria Butyrskaya began defense of her European title with the  
top performance in qualifying, despite skating well before noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know where I was, if I was in a dream,'' Butyrskaya  
said. ``All of it felt like practice. ``It didn't feel like a 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Viktoria Volchkova was second in that group and Julia  
Soldatova won the other group easily. 
</P>
<P>
	World champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov lead the  
ice dance event. 
</P>
<P>
	The original dance to the waltz rhythm is today with the free  
dance on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Sex May Be Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Some gay men might be complacent about protecting  
themselves during sex because medical advances and better HIV drugs 
have led to a decline in AIDS deaths, federal health officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the  
number of gay men in San Francisco who reported having unprotected 
anal sex increased to 39.2 percent in 1997, from 30.4 percent in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who said they had unprotected sex with multiple partners  
grew to 33 percent in 1997, up from 23.6 percent in 1994, the CDC 
said. Males 25 and younger accounted for the largest increase in 
that group. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said there is mounting evidence that young gay and  
bisexual men are less likely to engage in safe sex than older 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The younger group hasn't grown up watching their partners and  
friends die of this disease,'' said Dr. Richard Steketee of the 
CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sign of the rise in unsafe sex is the rate of reported  
cases of rectal gonorrhea among men. The disease declined in San 
Francisco in the early 1990s but increased from 21 per 100,000 in 
1994 to 38 per 100,000 in 1997, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Zingale, executive director of the advocacy group AIDS  
Action in Washington, said the government was partially to blame 
because of a lack of national prevention initiatives to slow the 
spread of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Japan Probes Nagano Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nagano's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Games is  
the latest focus of investigation in the growing Olympics 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese Olympic Committee on Thursday appointed a  
seven-member panel to look into the Nagano efforts after Mayor 
Tasuku Tsukada said there may have been ``excesses'' in the city's 
dealings with IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by JOC secretary general Yushiro Yagi, was the  
sixth Olympic investigation to get under way and the first 
officially aimed at a city other than Salt Lake, which Nagano 
defeated by four votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games, on  
its fifth try, has been the subject of inquiries by the Justice 
Department, the International and U.S. Olympic committees, an 
ethics panel of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and the Utah 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, the IOC expelled six members for taking more than  
$440,000 in cash, medical and travel expenses and lavish gifts from 
Salt Lake bidders. There have been four resignations and three 
other members remain under investigation in an unprecedented purge 
of IOC ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the committee has asked all bid cities from the  
1996 Summer Games onward to detail conduct of members or bid 
officials that might have broken the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	And -- while it is not considered a formal investigation -- the  
IOC has announced plans to send two top officials to Sydney, where 
the president of the Australia Olympic Committee said last week 
that he offered $70,000 in inducements to two African members the 
night before Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes over Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Nagano officials have disclosed how some IOC  
officials were wooed during the city's bid, including 
all-expenses-paid trips to Kyoto, a tourist spot 150 miles from 
Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC officials also were entertained by geisha, and IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch received an expensive painting and 
Japanese sword. 
</P>
<P>
	JOC executive board member Chiharu Igaya, who also is an IOC  
member, has defended the lavish entertainment as ``normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada, the Nagano mayor who also was one of the top officials  
of the bidding committee, on Monday acknowledged ``excesses'' in 
his city's bid. Nagano bid officials have said they wined and dined 
the 62 visiting IOC officials, spending about $18,000 on each IOC 
official, including air fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano's bidding expense records are missing, which could  
complicate the investigation. A bid official said recently he had 
the books burned in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a group of Nagano residents filed a civil lawsuit  
demanding that the state and city of Nagano, as well as two other 
towns that were the sites for the 1998 Games, return about $7 
million in taxpayer money that allegedly went into the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said he had no  
plans to discuss possible changes in the IOC at a USOC executive 
committee meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a New York Times article that the USOC was  
exploring ideas about restructuring the international committee, 
including term limits and outside elections, Hybl said any action 
by the American panel would have to wait until the completion of a 
report on Salt Lake by its ethics commission, led by former Senate 
Majority leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl also contradicted a Times report that he wanted IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to resign. ``That is not an area 
we have speculated on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A senior IOC official said the bribery scandal had been blown  
out of proportion and there was no reason for Samaranch to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical  
commission, also suggested the ``underlying'' reason for the 
controversy was a plot to oust Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Justice Department was trying to tell whether a Salt Lake  
Olympic official carried about $50,000 to Budapest, Hungary, in 
1995 when the 2002 Winter Games were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents interviewed former Salt Lake City Councilman Tom  
Godfrey, who has said the official was a staff member of the Salt 
Lake Olympic bid committee. Godfrey was a member of the delegation 
that traveled to Budapest in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A senior Chinese Olympic official called for stripping Sydney  
of the 2000 Games. Chinese Olympic Committee honorary president He 
Zhenliang was quoted as saying he was ``extremely furious'' over 
the $70,000 inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The head of the IOC investigation of Olympics corruption said  
he might consider stepping aside on cases of bid cities that could 
present at least the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, said he might  
choose not be take part in reviewing bids from Toronto and Quebec 
if a worldwide sweep for evidence of wrongdoing in host-city voting 
turns up anything involving those two cities. The matter, he said, 
would be discussed at an IOC executive board meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Portuguese IOC member Fernando Belo said the system of  
selecting host countries for the Olympics encourages corruption. 
``We ought to be prohibited from accepting gifts,'' Belo said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The oldest living Olympic champion said he was ``appalled'' by  
the scandal, but has confidence the spirit of the games will be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Leon Stukelj, who turned 100 in November, said the blame falls  
on IOC members involved in the bribery allegations.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Limits Gun Buying to 1 a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new city ordinance will limit people to one  
handgun purchase a month, the latest step in a nationwide effort by 
government officials to keep weapons away from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles City Council voted 13-0 on Wednesday to prohibit  
legitimate gun dealers from selling more than one handgun to a 
single buyer within a 30-day period. It is modeled after laws in 
Virginia, Maryland and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important stride in preventing gun violence,'' said  
Councilman Mike Feuer, who sponsored the measure. ``We'll take 
whatever steps we need to take locally. It's the real key to 
preventing violent crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most guns recovered by police are bought by individuals from  
legitimate dealers in multiple transactions, according to law 
enforcement officials. Later, they are illegally resold on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick O'Malley, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association  
in Washington, D.C., said the ordinance is another knee-jerk 
reaction to a recent decision by the state Supreme Court regarding 
West Hollywood's ban on cheap handguns, known as Saturday night 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's ruling last month essentially gives local  
governments the power to ban gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many cities are racing around furiously trying to pass  
whatever gun control measure is fashionable at the moment,'' 
O'Malley said. ``I consider it a symbolic gesture on the part of 
the City Council.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no limit in California on the number of handguns that  
may be sold to a single buyer. But a bill based on the gun-a-month 
concept was introduced last week in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has agreed to help Los  
Angeles enforce the law through the use of the state's computer 
database. The Los Angeles ordinance will take effect in 90 days.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Outfielder Orlando Merced, who played for  
Minnesota, Boston and the Chicago Cubs last season, agreed Thursday 
to a minor league contract with the Montreal Expos.

<HEADLINE> TRW To Pay $7B for LucasVarity PLC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- TRW Inc. has an agreement to acquire  
LucasVarity PLC, a highly coveted British maker of automotive 
brakes, for $7 billion in cash and executives of the two companies 
are said to be looking for acquisitions, with Tenneco Co. among 
their top targets. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bidding for LucasVarity may not be over.  
</P>
<P>
	While LucasVarity accepted TRW's offer Thursday, a rival suitor,  
Federal-Mogul Corp., said it may sweeten the $6.5 billion 
cash-and-stock offer that LucasVarity rejected earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW and LucasVarity, meantime, already are looking for other  
auto parts and aerospace companies to buy, and Tenneco is a prime 
candidate in the automotive sector, according to an industry 
analyst who met with the companies' executives Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still another acquisition to come for TRW and  
LucasVarity, and I guess the first one they had in mind is 
Tenneco,'' said John Daviduk, an analyst with Credit Suisse First 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	That would make sense, he said, because Tenneco was also  
involved in negotiations with LucasVarity before the deal with TRW 
was announced. Both TRW and LucasVarity also make aerospace 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls seeking comment from Tenneco were not immediately returned  
Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The automotive supply industry has been consolidating rapidly.  
The combination of TRW and LucasVarity would be the fifth industry 
merger in 1999, according to Securities Data Co. There were 80 
combinations in 1998 for a total value of $11.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Gorman, TRW's chairman and chief executive officer, said  
the company doesn't want to be left out of the consolidation trend 
in the automotive industry, pointing out the deal came on the same 
day Ford Motor Co. agreed to buy the passenger car division of 
Sweden's Volvo AB for $6.45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman said that as the world's major automakers continue to  
expand and combine, they will be most interested in working with 
two or three major suppliers with a proven track record. ``Size 
does matter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman and Rice said the auto industry is demanding that its  
suppliers provide increasingly complex systems that can more easily 
fit right into a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``TRW's steering and suspension and LucasVarity's brakes and  
antilock brake systems are a wonderful fit in terms of what you can 
offer for the customer,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, as many as three companies indicated an interest  
in LucasVarity. The directors of both companies have approved the 
deal, but shareholders have not voted. Federal-Mogul Thursday urged 
LucasVarity shareholders to take no action on the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	While Rice didn't rule out further talks with Federal-Mogul, he  
said, ``I would add that the synergies that exist (with 
Federal-Mogul) are dramatically less than with TRW.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Efraim Levy, auto industry analyst for Standard and Poor's in  
New York, said he believes that TRW will be able to top any further 
offer from Federal-Mogul. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to close in this year's second quarter.  
Rice will be named vice chairman of TRW and will direct the 
combined automotive operations from the TRW headquarters. TRW said 
it will not change its name but will find a way to benefit from the 
LucasVarity name recognition in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorman and Rice said they expect cost savings of about $200  
million, and eventual job growth, although they said it is too soon 
to say whether jobs will be lost initially. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schmall, managing partner of The Planning Edge, an  
automotive industry analysis and consulting firm in Troy, Mich., 
said the combination could eventually lead to a spinoff company 
focused on the automotive industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, shares of LucasVarity rose $1.25, or 3  
percent, to $47.93 3/4. TRW shares slipped 87 1/2 cents, or 2 percent, to 
$50.25. Federal-Mogul shares fell $1.18 3/4, or 2 percent, to close at 
$59 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Backs Clinton Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- In the unusual setting of a statehouse  
chamber, Defense Secretary William Cohen promoted the Clinton 
administration's defense priorities for the new century Thursday. 
He said America has a ``moral obligation'' to treat its military 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen spelled out the administration's rationale for a proposed  
$12 billion increase in the fiscal 2000 defense budget, to include 
a 4.4 percent across-the-board pay raise for the military, improved 
retirement benefits and more money for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most highly skilled and best-trained people in the  
world,'' Cohen said in a 30-minute address in the House chamber. 
``But they will not remain so without significant attention to 
their quality of life and training,'' which he said had been 
degraded by years of spending cuts and added duties overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The key to attracting and keeping high-quality sailors,  
soldiers, airmen and Marines is making life easier for them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to give them a satisfactory quality of life. It is a  
moral obligation, but is no less a practical necessity,'' he told 
an audience that included active duty and retired military members, 
including Medal of Honor winner Hal Fritz of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's appearance before the Illinois General Assembly marked  
the start of a campaign to take his message to nontraditional 
audiences. Cohen worries that too much of the public is out of 
touch with the military, and vice versa, and that the disconnect in 
the long run will sap the strength of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	He told reporters traveling with him from Washington that he  
hopes to speak before 10 or 12 state legislatures across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we want to do is reconnect America to its military,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In that vein, Cohen plans to travel to Redmond, Wash., next  
month to speak to employees of computer software giant Microsoft 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with a local success story, Cohen also renewed his call  
for Congress to authorize two more rounds of military base 
closings. He said the community of Rantoul, Ill., home of the 
now-closed Chanute Air Force Base, had shown that such a loss can 
be overcome by finding ways to convert property to commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Rantoul, Joseph Brown, was in Cohen's audience.  
</P>
<P>
	``The hard truth is that we must have more base closures,''  
Cohen said, while conceding that it is ``the most politically 
difficult'' part of the administration's plan for reforming the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should offend us that serious needs for our troops remain  
unmet while we squander money on facilities we no longer need,'' he 
said. Up to $20 billion could be saved with more base closings, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Far more popular is Clinton's call for pay raises. Although the  
president has not yet submitted his 2000 budget to Congress, the 
Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday voted to raise 
military pay by 4.8 percent, topping Clinton's bid for increases of 
4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters if he would support the 4.8 percent figure,  
Cohen cautioned that he did not want to get into a ``bidding war'' 
but could go along with 4.8 percent if the rest of the 
administration's package of financial incentives -- including 
improved retirement benefits -- were preserved in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech Cohen called Clinton's proposal the largest  
increase in military pay and benefits since the early 1980s. The 
concern for pay levels arises from the military's difficulty 
recruiting and keeping people at a time of economic boom in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never pay them enough, but we can pay them more,''  
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statistical yardstick the military uses in measuring young  
people's potential interest in serving -- known as ``propensity to 
join'' -- has declined through much of the 1990s. For the Army, it 
fell from about 17 percent in 1991 to 11 percent in 1997, and the 
Air Force saw a drop in that period from 16 percent to 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-Cold War world where most Americans see no immediate  
military threat to their security, it would be wrong to assume that 
the United States can rely on its European and Asian allies to 
devote the resources it takes to maintain world stability, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way we can return to our shores, slip into a  
continental cocoon and watch events unfold on CNN, nursing the 
delusion that we are insulated and secure from the consequences,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Official Indicted in Extortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Federal officials say city Treasurer Miriam  
Santos was so hungry for campaign funds when she ran for Illinois 
attorney general that she blacklisted companies that refused to 
contribute money. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago lost about $16,000 in interest because Santos cut off  
the seven companies from city business, a federal indictment 
charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Santos is charged with making decisions about ... the  
investment of city funds based upon the impact of those decisions 
on her campaign for attorney general,'' U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos has denied the charges. Illinois Attorney General Jim  
Ryan, a Republican running for re-election, thumped Santos in the 
contest, winning more than 60 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassar said that Santos pressured the companies for money ``with  
the understanding that if they did not contribute, they would lose 
their business with the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-count indictment charged Santos, 43, with putting undue  
pressure on companies to contribute, prodding them to exceed the 
city's $1,500 campaign contribution limit and forcing treasurer's 
office employees to work in her attorney general campaign while on 
the city payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos, who is running for re-election as treasurer in the Feb.  
23 city election, said she was innocent of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of this indictment only weeks before the election  
is not only unjust, it is patently unfair,'' Santos said.

<HEADLINE> UNLV Assistant Coach Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- An assistant UNLV women's basketball coach was  
fired after a player claimed she attacked her in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Rathbun was relieved of her coaching duties but was  
retained in some undecided capacity in the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Rathbun was accused by senior forward Amy Wunderlich of  
scratching the player's face, kicking her and tearing her jersey at 
practice Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Regina Miller investigated and decided to dismiss Rathbun.  
The athletic department is looking into new duties for the 
assistant coach, but will not renew her contract after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rathbun has not spoken publicly about the situation,  
she retained an attorney and said she wanted to issue a statement 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	This was Rathbun's first year on the Lady Rebels' staff after  
serving as an assistant at Cleveland State for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, she was an assistant at Buffalo from 1994-95 and  
Brigham Young from 1992-94. Rathbun played for BYU, where she was 
an All-Western Athletic Conference selection.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Better known for its theme parks and  
hotels, this city is becoming home to a growing number of Christian 
institutions: international ministries, one of the world's largest 
Bible translators, even a Christian-oriented mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
	Why Orlando? For many of the same reasons that attract other  
businesses: good airline connections and cheap air fares, important 
to missionaries who travel the world; affordable land; worldwide 
name recognition; warm weather and a squeaky-clean image developed 
by the family-oriented entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A large population of retirees provides a steady flow of  
financial dollars to the ministries. And central Florida, a 
Republican bastion, has a tradition of conservatism that's 
appealing to the Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming a magnet for a lot of ministries,'' said Art  
Ally, president of the Timothy Plan, a mutual fund company based in 
suburban Winter Park that targets religious investors. The $27 
million fund with 3,500 investors shuns companies that promote or 
support abortion, alcohol, gambling, homosexuality, pornography or 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian migration to Orlando continues despite a warning  
last June from religious broadcaster Pat Robertson after officials 
allowed gay-pride flags to fly from city lampposts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some  
serious hurricanes, and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in 
God's face if I were you,'' Robertson said on ``The 700 Club,'' his 
Christian Broadcasting Network talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robertson's words aren't deterring groups like Wycliffe  
Bible Translators USA, which has translated the New Testament into 
432 languages for 30 million people around the world. In July, the 
ministry plans to move its national headquarters here from 
Huntington Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Some religious leaders compare the Orlando area to other major  
U.S. centers for Christian groups, such as Wheaton, Ill., home of 
Christianity Today magazine, and Colorado Springs, Colo., home of 
Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic development officials welcome the Christian groups but  
have done little to track or recruit them, though they have brought 
thousands of jobs to central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds to the whole diversity mix, whether it's diversity of  
business or culture,'' said Jackie Kelvington, a spokeswoman for 
the Metro Orlando Economic Development Commission of Mid-Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim DeSimone, director of communications for Orlando Mayor  
Glenda Hood, said, ``We promote Orlando as a family-friendly city, 
and an increasing number of Christian groups here underscores that 
fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The area is home to the Campus Crusade for Christ, one of the  
world's largest evangelical organizations with 281,000 trained 
volunteers around the world, and Liberty Counsel, a legal advocacy 
group for Christian causes. More than a dozen international 
ministries, evangelical organizations and seminary branches have 
set up shop in the Orlando area this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the Christian schools.  
</P>
<P>
	Geneva College, a Pittsburgh-based school affiliated with the  
Reformed Presbyterian Church, recently opened a branch in Orlando, 
and Wilmore, Ky.-based Asbury Theological Seminary is scheduled to 
start classes later this year. A Miami area Catholic school, Barry 
University, is opening a branch here soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Orlando, one of the fastest growing communities in the  
nation with about 1.4 million people, is expected to increase by a 
half-million by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	And that burgeoning population is what attracted Jackson,  
Miss.-based Reformed Theological Seminary in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have an area that grows like this, new subdivisions  
go in, new communities are developed, and in those communities 
there is a need for churches,'' said Lyn Perez, executive vice 
president of the evangelical seminary. ``Our graduates get out and 
establish these new ministries and grow the communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the appeal are the estimated 40 million tourists and  
the large number of conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have a visitors' center so people can learn about  
Bible translations,'' said Arthur Lightbody, an official with 
Wycliffe. ``We would develop a facility for conferences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One institution attracts another. Geneva College opened its  
branch in Orlando after officials at the Reform Theological 
Seminary said they needed a Christian college to help feed 
prospective seminarians into their program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe God has directed us to be in central Florida,''  
said Dr. John White, the college president.

	Lewinsky To Testify in Senate Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Split along party lines, the  
Republican-controlled Senate voted late today to recess President 
Clinton's impeachment trial for a week while prosecutors and White 
House lawyers depose Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. The 
resolution, adopted by a 54-44 margin, envisions a final vote on 
the impeachment articles by noon Feb. 12. Depositions start Monday, 
when House prosecutors and President Clinton's lawyers will 
question Ms. Lewinsky. Tuesday and Wednesday, the managers and 
White House attorneys will question Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan 
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.

<P>
	ARMENIA, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of Colombian troops entered  
the earthquake zone today and the president imposed a dusk-to-dawn 
curfew to tame the chaos that's taken over here, as the death toll 
from Monday's disaster reached 881. According to Red Cross 
officials, more than 3,540 are injured and 200,000 homeless.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles made  
their first public appearance together tonight, at last giving 
Britain's photographers the picture they've been seeking for years. 
The two arrived separately at the Ritz Hotel in central London for 
a birthday party, after days of speculation that this would be the 
night they went public as a couple. They left the function 
together.

	$2.6 Trillion Gov't Surplus Projected  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal surpluses will total $2.6 trillion  
over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office projected 
today. The estimate is hundreds of billions of dollars more than 
was expected five months ago. Over the decade ending in 2009, CBO 
said nearly one-third of the $2.6 trillion -- $787 billion -- would 
come from the non-Social Security side of the budget.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee  
today, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan compared buying the 
latest hot Internet stock to hitting a one-in-a-million jackpot in 
the lottery. Greenspan, who once sent stock prices plunging by 
worrying about investors' ``irrational exuberance,'' said that in 
the case of Internet stocks, the market was behaving in a 
time-honored fashion. He said the potential payoff for companies 
that succeed in the new Internet market is so huge that something 
he called the ``lottery principle'' was at work.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO issued a solemn warning today to  
both sides in the Kosovo crisis: Negotiate a political settlement 
now or else. NATO's military firepower is cruising the Adriatic Sea 
and ready at allied airfields in Italy, with dozens of ships and 
planes prepared to rain havoc upon recalcitrant Serbs. Tomorrow, 
the United States, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Italy, will 
meet in London to launch a new political initiative to bring peace

a cricket match. For the first time in 12 years, the Pakistani and 
Indian cricket teams are playing two sets of matches in India. 
Passions run so high during games between India and Pakistan --

	Researcher Finds Ancient Chemicals  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Danish researcher analyzing rock formations  
from Greenland said he has found chemical evidence that suggests 
the presence of life 3.7 billion years ago, about 200 million years 
before the earliest known fossils. Minik T. Rosing of the Geologisk 
Museum in Denmark reports in tomorrow's edition of the journal 
Science that metamorphic rock in a well-preserved sedimentary 
deposit in western Greenland could have come from life forms that 
died and settled to the bottom some 200 million years before the 
first known fossils.

<HEADLINE> Bronx Memories Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifty years ago, the dozen or so Bronx guys who  
call themselves the Holland Avenue Boys were kids sipping ice cream 
sodas at the neighborhood candy store and playing stickball on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they're grown men nearing retirement and pondering the  
things that have sustained them over nearly six decades of living -- 
family, friends, career, relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Through marriages, divorces and children, over all the years of  
ups and downs, the friends say their ties to one another have 
stayed solid. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I call up Jack (Jack Abrams, an oncologist living in San  
Diego) and I say `Jack, I need this,' he just does it,'' said 
Howard Fischer, a member of the group who was so touched by the 
strength of the men's friendships that he made a television 
documentary about them. ``He doesn't ask any questions. ... It's 
reassuring. You know that if you need something, you can call 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer's one-hour paean to the lifelong love, camaraderie and  
trust that can spring from childhood ties has aired on public 
television stations across the country. He thinks the story has 
meaning even for viewers far from the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was telling me, this is a local, personal film,'' he  
said. ``I didn't think so. ... Most success stories you see are 
about wealth or fame. This is about personal growth, satisfying 
careers, comfortable lifestyles and rewarding relationships. That's 
what most people strive for in their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer, 59, a Manhattan lawyer who's had previous careers  
running a jazz museum and publishing a newsletter on antiques, 
proposed the video project to the other members of the Holland 
Avenue group at a reunion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His friends gave him the go-ahead and kicked in some money, and  
Fischer bought a movie-making book, signed up for a class and hired 
a part-time cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
	His documentary, ``The Holland Avenue Boys: A Success Story,''  
is an unpolished but touching look at where the boys' lives have 
taken them since they left the Pelham Parkway neighborhood and the 
elevated subway line that still clatters nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Most have done well professionally -- the group includes a  
chemist, an engineer and businessmen in a variety of industries. In 
Fischer's documentary, though, they say their greatest achievements 
have been close to home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked the question 'What was your biggest success?'  
most people said, 'My family, my kids,'' said Edward Kleiman, 60, a 
semiretired garment executive now living in Hackensack, N.J. 
``That's what you strive for, and I think that's what we carried 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In individual interviews, the men reflect on divorces, health  
troubles, business success and setbacks and their relationships 
with their wives and children. Parents of the two deceased Holland 
Avenue boys appear on tape to discuss their sons' lives and 
friendships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys don't say these things in normal conversation to each  
other,'' Fischer said. ``They trusted me with the film and their 
emotions, and it was raw emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The corner of Holland and Astor avenues in the Pelham Parkway  
section of the Bronx is just a quick drive up the West Side Highway 
from Fischer's Manhattan home. The 20-minute trip brings him and 
Kleiman back 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiff's candy store, where the boys used to gather on weekend  
mornings and after school, is now a take-out Chinese restaurant. 
The mostly Jewish, working-class neighborhood they remember is 
still neat and well-kept, but it's populated now by immigrants from 
Asia, Latin America and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	When the boys were growing up in the 1940s and '50s, vendors  
selling milk, fish and watermelon plied their wares from wagons in 
the street, and a man who bought and sold old clothing used to walk 
down Astor carrying the garments on his back, Kleiman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Goats grazed at a working farm just across from the candy shop,  
and on hot summer nights, men from the neighborhood would set up 
tables, string up light bulbs and sit in front of their apartment 
buildings playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were never alone,'' Kleiman said. ``I'd get up early in  
the morning and I'd walk over here to see who was here. ... We 
would play football right in the streets, stickball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an adult, he said, he and his wife moved to the suburbs.  
``You think it's a better life, but I think I had a better 
childhood than my kids did. Now it's friendship by appointment. ... 
You have your neighbors, but it's not like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distance has made it a little harder for some of the friends to  
keep up with one another -- six or seven of the group still live in 
the New York area and get together regularly, but others are 
scattered as far away as Georgia, Florida and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Biannual reunions give the whole gang a chance to get together  
and relive the old Bronx memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell the same stories over and over,'' Kleiman said. ``Maybe  
it keeps you young still. You talk about it and you still feel 
you're a kid. ... I know I can't run as fast, but I don't feel 
older. Fifty years go by in a blink.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Cooly Swallows GeoCities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Yahoo! art director Ford Minton keeps  
his pillow and a pad under his desk for those long nights when he 
never leaves the office. In the morning, there's usually a line at 
the shower. 
</P>
<P>
	Creative director Dan Sroka remembers fondly the New Year's Eve  
he spent frantically broadcasting the first live New York Times 
Square ball dropping over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great time,'' said Sroka. ``We Yahoos are always  
having a great time here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly seemed to be the case Thursday as news spread  
through the Santa Clara-based World Wide Web search engine company 
that it would buy GeoCities Inc., in a $5.02 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! Inc. was the third-most visited Web destination last  
month, attracting 27 million Internet users, according to 
researcher Media Metrix Inc. It is known as a ``portal'' because it 
gives users a gateway to other services including stock quotes, 
news, and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities, based in Los Angeles, is the No. 5 Web destination  
and has been used by more than 3 million people to set up home 
pages where they can publish their writings, post their family 
photos or try to sell things. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! executives said the acquisition could make them into the  
most visited spot on the World Wide Web. It could also make Yahoo! 
even more attractive to major corporations shopping for a portal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally I hope we keep on swallowing rather than getting  
swallowed,'' said Jennifer Price, Yahoo! senior marketing maven. 
</P>
<P>
	Maven?  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, we can kind of make up our own titles here,'' she said.  
``That's one of those Yahoo! things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! things. Like shouting over cubicle walls to make crucial  
business decisions. Or fiercely competing in the cafeteria's 
Foosball league. Or purple and yellow, the company colors that 
bounce off the walls in every corner of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Started in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo! began as a way to keep track of their 
personal interests on the Internet. That name is supposed to stand 
for ``Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,'' but chief yahoos 
Filo and Yang insist the name reflects their culture. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a growing culture.  
</P>
<P>
	During the past 18 months, the company has acquired seven  
smaller companies. The deal with GeoCities was by far the largest, 
raising questions about whether the company is getting too big to 
act like an adolescent any more. 
</P>
<P>
	GeoCities president Tom Evans, who spent Thursday morning doing  
the Yahoo! thing in Santa Clara, said there's ``no chance of us 
becoming the General Motors of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost embedded in this company to be creative, fun and  
innovative,'' he said, stepping into an airport-bound taxi. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! is already a bit of an Internet standout in the Silicon  
Valley because instead of being bought, it seems to be buying. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home Corp. agreed last week to buy Yahoo! competitor Excite  
Inc. in a deal valued Thursday at $6.55 billion. America Online 
Inc. agreed last fall to buy Netscape Communications Corp. valued 
Thursday at $7.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal -- initially valued at $4.58 billion but which  
increased after shares of Yahoo! soared Thursday -- Yahoo! will 
exchange about 10.6 million shares of its stock for the 31.4 
million shares of GeoCities common stock. In addition, Yahoo! will 
convert about 8.9 million GeoCities stock options into about 3 
million Yahoo! stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Koogle, Yahoo!'s chief executive officer known locally as  
``TK,'' told reporters standing on the manicured lawn in front of 
his offices Thursday that Yahoo! ``is not going to let the grass 
grow under our feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company is planning additional acquisitions, and  
will resist being bought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very serious about growing our global position,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Does that mean Yahoo! would turn down a good offer?  
</P>
<P>
	``You never say never in life,'' said Koogle. ``But we are very  
serious about our independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind him, employees walking back into the Yahoo! headquarters  
took up a quiet hoot: ``Yahoooooooo!''

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership Sets Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's home ownership rate slipped a bit  
with the onset of colder weather during the final three months of 
last year, but the annual 1998 rate set a record. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 69.1 million families -- 66.3 percent of American  
households -- owned their homes during 1998, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development said Wednesday. That's up from 65.7 
percent in 1997 and 64 percent five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	However, following the usual seasonal pattern, the quarterly  
rate slipped from a record 66.8 percent in the July-September 
period to 66.4 percent in October-December. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the figures, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo noted that  
home ownership among blacks and Hispanics is starting to close the 
gap with the rate for whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for whites last year was 72.6 percent, up from 72  
percent in 1997 and 70.2 percent in 1993. For blacks, it was 46.1 
percent, up from 45.4 percent and 42 percent. And for Hispanics, it 
was 44.7 percent, up from 43.3 percent and 39.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, for the first time, the home ownership rate in central  
cities hit 50 percent, up from 49.9 percent the year before. In the 
suburbs, the rate rose to 73.6 percent, from 72.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to shrink the vast home ownership gap dividing  
minorities from whites and dividing cities from their surrounding 
communities,'' Cuomo said. ``Home ownership isn't a special 
privilege reserved for white suburbanites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By region, home ownership rates rose from 62.4 percent to 62.6  
percent in the Northeast, from 70.5 percent to 71.1 percent in the 
Midwest, from 68 percent to 68.6 percent in the South and from 59.6 
percent to 60.5 percent in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists cite last year's strong economic growth, which  
brought the unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.5 percent, and 
low interest rates -- under 7 percent since mid-June for fixed-rate, 
30-year mortgages -- as the forces propelling the increase in home 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said Clinton administration programs, including Federal  
Housing Administration mortgage insurance, have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday announced the distribution  
of $21 million in grants to 74 local public-private partnerships 
working to help families in economically distressed communities buy 
their first homes.

<HEADLINE> German Industrial Workers To Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- More than 100,000 German industrial workers  
will walk off their jobs Friday in a pay dispute that has been 
building for weeks, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers and the IG Metall union, Germany's largest, ended  
their latest round of regional contract negotiations Thursday, 
hours before a midnight deadline lifting a no-strike pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials have called for ``warning strikes,'' walkouts  
lasting only a day or even a few hours. But Juergen Peters, deputy 
head of IG Metall, said preparations are continuing for a 
full-scale strike by IG Metall's 2.7 million members if talks, due 
to resume next week, continue to stall. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is demanding a 6.5 percent wage increase for 1998;  
employers have offered 2 percent and a one-time payment of 0.5 
percent of annual wages, dependent on each company's financial 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	The old contract, which expired Dec. 31, required both sides to  
negotiate for four weeks before unions could call warning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said warning strikes and rallies were planned  
for at least nine of Germany's 16 states Friday, with the focus on 
the north and southwest of the country.

<HEADLINE> City Keeps Controversial Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- The City Council reversed course and  
decided to keep John A. Sutter's name on a cul-de-sac, despite 
critics who consider the California pioneer an immoral man who 
enslaved Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The council in this politically correct college town voted 3-2  
on Wednesday night to keep Sutter Place, a month after tentatively 
deciding to turn it into Shasta Way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't defend the man,'' Councilwoman Sheryl Freeman said,  
``but the fact is we've got names all over town. If we start down 
this path, we just don't know where it can end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change of heart prompted several complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	``Davis will be a little less for it, as we all will, because we  
all lose when we don't face up to the truth,'' said resident Susan 
Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss-born Sutter owned and managed vast holdings and  
developed a reputation as a ruthless businessman. Every child in 
California is taught Sutter's story and how gold was found at his 
sawmill in 1848, sparking the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Jack Forbes, who favors changing the street's name,  
told the council that Sutter was an ``immoral man, a sexual 
predator, a rapist and an enslaver of native Californians.''

<HEADLINE> Witnesses To Be Deposed on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Split along party lines, the  
Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday to recess President 
Clinton's impeachment trial for a week while prosecutors and White 
House lawyers depose Monica Lewinsky and two other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution adopted by a 54-44 margin late Thursday envisions  
a final vote on the impeachment articles by noon Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions will begin Monday, when House prosecutors and  
President Clinton's lawyers will question Ms. Lewinsky, with one 
senator from each party presiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday and Wednesday, the managers and White House attorneys  
will question Vernon Jordan, a Washington power broker and 
confidant of Clinton, and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. It 
wasn't immediately known which of the two men would go first. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 hours in advance of each deposition, the Republican  
House managers must provide the president's lawyers copies of all 
exhibits which would be entered into the record during the 
deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositions will be videotaped and transcripts made. Those  
records will be confidential until and unless the Senate votes to 
make them public. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions limited to matters already on record in the articles  
of impeachment. House managers will not be allowed to ask, for 
example, about any women besides Ms. Lewinsky and Paula Jones with 
whom Clinton has been linked. 
</P>
<P>
	Any objections raised but not resolved during the depositions  
would be referred to the full Senate when the trial resumes at 1 
p.m. EST next Thursday. Any requests for additional witnesses or 
discovery would require the agreement of the Senate Republican and 
Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Once those issues are resolved the Senate would act on any  
motions to call witnesses to testify in the Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers then would have 24 hours to ask for  
additional witnesses and discovery.

<HEADLINE> Government Faces Drug Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A company's campaign to get a new medicine  
approved has given the government a tough choice: The drug might 
help some patients with one disease, multiple sclerosis. But 
approving it could discourage companies from spending the millions 
it takes to develop new drugs for dozens of other rare diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Serono Laboratories is urging MS patients, doctors and members  
of Congress to plead with the Food and Drug Administration to 
approve its drug, Rebif. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rebif has the same chemical already sold under another brand  
name, Avonex. So some doctors fear that if the FDA approves 
Serono's competing version, it would gut a law that gives makers of 
``orphan drugs'' for rare diseases a big financial incentive: seven 
years of marketing protection against similar competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real dilemma,'' said Dr. Stephen Reingold of the  
National Multiple Sclerosis Society. ``We'd like to see all these 
drugs on the market. We also don't want to see people with MS lose 
the support that the Orphan (Drug) Act has provided to drug 
development for their disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To further complicate matters, the FDA is investigating whether  
Serono illegally touted Rebif. 
</P>
<P>
	Serono says Rebif is a vital alternative for MS patients because  
it comes in a higher dose than Avonex. In a European study, Rebif 
slowed the crippling neurological disease in patients with slightly 
more advanced multiple sclerosis than have been studied using 
competing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get hung up on an orphan drug (question) ... you will be  
committing a larger number of patients in the U.S. to 
wheelchairs,'' said Dr. Hisham Samra, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
	But independent doctors say no one has ever directly compared  
the two drugs, which both consist of the immune system protein 
interferon beta-1a, to prove if one works better. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a higher interferon dose, patients can buy a very similar  
drug called Betaseron, or interferon beta-1b, said Dr. Henry 
McFarland, neuroimmunology chief at the National Institutes of 
Health. ``I don't think there is any compelling evidence there is a 
major difference'' between the three drugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Avonex maker Biogen Inc. complains that ``patients and  
doctors have been misled ... by Serono to expect a new MS drug,'' 
said company vice president Burt Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a big-dollar conflict for the companies, one the FDA is  
expected to decide by March. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, competing versions of the same drug aren't a problem --  
the competition sometimes drives down prices. But the orphan drug 
law sets different rules for rare-disease treatments: Rebif could 
not sell for several more years unless it offers a significant 
advantage over its competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has allowed such exceptions when the new orphan  
drug proves safer than the original. In fact, that's why Avonex 
sells -- it had fewer side effects than the first MS drug, 
Betaseron. 
</P>
<P>
	Serono contends Rebif's advantage is the higher dose.  
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors agree. ``The full range of doses is quite  
important,'' said Dr. Kenneth Johnson of the University of 
Maryland, who was hired by Serono to study the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Others call Rebif's advantage an easier-to-use syringe.  
</P>
<P>
	Still others argue those differences are so slight that Rebif's  
approval would essentially overturn the Orphan Drug Act and 
discourage companies from spending the millions required to create 
new therapies for rare diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult'' to oppose any new therapy, said  
Georgetown University neurologist Dr. John Richert. But ``if it 
inhibits companies from deciding to produce drugs for diseases like 
MS ... it's going to hurt our patients in the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Serono's side are about 300 letters mailed to the FDA since  
August. They include copies of ``sample letters'' that Serono 
drafted for patients and doctors. ``Until there's a cure, I know 
that many patients, including myself, will benefit from this 
drug,'' says one. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, an ad calls Rebif the only drug ``demonstrated to  
slow disease progression in both mild and high-risk'' patients and 
urges doctors to ``demand Rebif.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are allowed to lobby for drugs, but they forbidden  
from declaring a still-experimental drug safe and effective, said 
an FDA official investigating whether the campaign crossed that 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	How will the FDA sort out the science amid the controversy,  
wonders Abbey Meyers of the National Organization for Rare 
Disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worrisome that this is an omen for the future,'' said  
Meyers. ``How many other companies are going to try the same 
tactics?''

<HEADLINE> La Tech Coach To Be Bears Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTON, La. (AP) -- Louisiana Tech coach Gary Crowton resigned on  
Thursday to accept the offensive coordinator position with the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the best thing for me and my family is to move  
forward at this time in my coaching career,'' Crowton said. ``This 
is a dream I had as a youngster, to make it one day to the NFL. 
It's the highest level of football and it's where I always wanted 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton, who joined Louisiana Tech in 1995 as the offensive  
coordinator, became coach prior to the 1996 season. Crowton had a 
21-13 record at Tech, including a 6-6 record in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech gained national attention during Crowton's tenure. The  
Bulldogs were 9-2 in 1997 behind the record-setting offense 
directed by quarterback Tim Rattay and wide receiver Troy Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton, who spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Chicago, arrived at  
Thursday's news conference wearing a Tech baseball hat. He choked 
up as he removed it and announced his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've changed my mind 11 times since I got back from Chicago,''  
Crowton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Jackson, the assistant head coach and linebacker coach under  
Crowton, became the interim coach. Athletic director Jim Oakes said 
a search for a fulltime coach was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they will miss Gary Crowton at Louisiana Tech  
because of the reputation they've built and the national caliber 
the program built and will continue to build,'' Crowton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton, who made $100,000 a year at Tech, would reportedly earn  
$300,000 annually working for Bears news coach Dick Jauron.

<HEADLINE> Park Service: Treasure Chest Fake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A trunk purported to be a 149-year-old relic  
belonging to a band of Gold Rush settlers is a fake and contains 
glue from the 20th century, the National Park Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher Jerry Freeman became an instant celebrity this month by  
announcing the discovery of the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers and television programs across the country featured  
his find -- a wooden chest containing perfectly preserved shoes, 
pottery bowls and a letter bearing the name William Robinson, a 
pioneer who died after crossing Death Valley in the great 
California Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service, after bringing in archaeologists and curators  
from the Smithsonian Institution, announced Wednesday the letter 
was a fake and that some of the trunk's contents, most notably glue 
containing polymers, were from the 20th century. The service would 
not say which items contained the glue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't call it a hoax,'' Park Service spokesman Tim Stone  
said Thursday. ``At this point we know that the chest isn't from 
the '49ers era. And whoever wrote that letter, we know it's not 
real. 
</P>
<P>
	``At present, we have no idea whether (Freeman) put it there or  
not. We're continuing to follow up,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service was not pleased to read a Jan. 1 news story  
about a man who said he had removed an archaeological artifact from 
Death Valley National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called Mr. Freeman and requested that he return it to the  
park,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman did.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always intended to give it to the Park Service,'' Freeman  
said Thursday. He said he thought the trunk should be displayed at 
the Park Service's museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said Freeman presently faces no criminal charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Before giving it back, Freeman held a press conference  
announcing his discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, a substitute teacher who majored in archaeology and has  
traced the party's route since 1985, insists he did not plant the 
chest. He said he discovered the trunk in November in a rock cave. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I did was find the box,'' he said. ``My reputation is in  
ruin. All I can do is fade away here. ... But hey, I'm 56, I have 
grandkids, a loving wife and I can go on.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Border Clash Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fighting broke out along Kosovo's  
southwestern border today even as NATO reinforced its threat to use 
force to halt the year-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav troops battled a large group of ethnic Albanian Kosovo  
Liberation Army rebels caught trying to smuggle weapons from 
neighboring Albania, said Serb sources in Pristina, the provincial 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting began about 8 a.m. southwest of Djakovica and  
continued several hours later, the sources said. International 
monitors of the cease-fire in the Serb province were looking into 
the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest violence comes with international leaders pushing to  
bring Serbs and Albanians to the negotiating table, alarmed by the 
rapid erosion of the October truce. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its NATO allies are pessimistic about the  
prospects for peace if the warring sides don't begin talks 
immediately to resolve the province's political status. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinforcing NATO's threat of military action to back up the  
diplomatic initative, Secretary-General Javier Solana warned after 
a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels today that the warring 
parties must start negotiating now or face the alliance's might. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO stands ready to act and rules out no option,'' Solana  
said, calling this ``a critical turning point in the Kosovo 
crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO diplomats who declined to be named said the six-nation  
Contact Group, which meets Friday in London, would call on the 
parties to respond to the political initiative within four days. 
The NATO Council then is to meet Saturday to back up that 
initiative with a military ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA rejects the idea of a peace conference unless it leads  
to full independence. The United States is pushing a plan for 
self-rule that falls short of that demand. Under the plan, Kosovo 
would remain part of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government also is resisting the proposal for an  
international conference. A spokesman for President Slobodan 
Milosevic's ruling Socialists rejected the plan today and ruled out 
talks with ethnic Albanian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivica Dacic said ``state bodies never have and never will talk  
to the representatives of the Albanian terrorists,'' the Beta news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	As diplomats deliberated their next moves, hundreds of new  
refugees were shivering today in the snow-covered mountains of 
northern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	They had fled the fighting Wednesday around Podujevo, where  
government forces backed by tanks sought to press the rebels back 
from the main road linking Kosovo with the Yugoslav capital 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Zhegrova, an isolated hamlet in a narrow valley 9 miles north  
of Pristina, about 150 refugees -- mostly women and children -- were 
crowded into private homes with little food, no electricity and no 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers said they found the refugees wandering in the wooded  
hills Wednesday as they were escaping from a village close to the 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where my husband is,'' wailed one of the women,  
Hajric Dedad, seated on the floor of a two-room cottage shared by 
about 50 other refugees. ``Who knows what happened to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another woman, Hanifeh Dedijaj, said she had abandoned her  
elderly mother-in-law in the forests Wednesday because she was too 
weak to climb the ridge. She feared the woman had died of exposure 
in the overnight snow. 
</P>
<P>
	No major fighting was reported in the Podujevo area today  
although sporadic explosions could be heard. Bands of rebels 
patrolled the ridges, some carrying rifles and others armed with 
grenade-launchers and sniper rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hundred yards away, Yugoslav army tanks and armored  
personnel carriers were deployed in a deserted village. 
</P>
<P>
	At the KLA area headquarters in Lapastica, a rebel spokesman who  
identified himself by the codename Defender said the guerrillas 
expected further attacks. He said two KLA troops were wounded in 
Wednesday's fighting and one was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	He scoffed at suggestions that diplomacy could bring an end to  
the bitter conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday we had an example of talks,'' the rebel spokesman  
said, noting that the Wednesday fighting occurred while U.S. and 
European envoys were negotiating with the two sides in Dragobilje. 
``The Serbs were talking and they were attacking us here.''

<HEADLINE> Korda Seeks To Block ITF Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A British judge will rule Friday on whether Petr  
Korda can block the International Tennis Federation from appealing 
a decision that allowed him to avoid punishment for using steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda's lawyer argued before the High Court on Thursday that the  
Czech star should not have to face ``another trial'' by the ITF. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by pressure from players and sports organizations, the  
ITF wants to overturn an appeals body's decision not to suspend 
Korda, who tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, an independent appeal committee appointed by the ITF  
said Korda was guilty of a drug offense but said he should not be 
suspended due to ``exceptional circumstances.'' Korda has 
maintained he does not know how the steroid got into his system. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the tennis federation wants the Court of Arbitration for  
Sport in Switzerland to allow it to impose a suspension, and Korda 
went to the High Court to try and block the move. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Official: Scandal Is Exaggerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- A senior IOC official said Thursday  
that the bribery scandal rocking the Olympics had been blown out of 
proportion and there was no reason for IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical  
commission, also suggested the ``underlying'' reason for the 
controversy was a plot to oust Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The scandal) was given too much importance,'' de Merode, a  
former IOC vice president, said in an interview with The Associated 
Press. ``There was the impression that the IOC looked like the 
worst gang of thieves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described the affair as ``very much exaggerated'' and said  
political motives might be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps there were other underlying reasons, that people  
wanted to see (Samaranch) leave,'' de Merode said. ``There are 
candidates for his position and not a few. There can also be 
political movements that think the IOC has taken a real and 
financial power which is abnormal and out of the control of 
politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	Elected in 1980, Samaranch has rejected calls outside the  
organization for his resignation. He said he intends to retire 
after completing his final term in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A bribery scandal centering on the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Games  
has plunged the International Olympic Committee into the worst 
crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have so far resigned or been ousted in  
connection with some $800,000 in payments, gifts and other favors 
connected with the Salt Lake bid. Three others remain under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Samaranch apologized to the world for the scandals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It should not have happened,'' he said. ``I am sorry.''  
</P>
<P>
	De Merode said the apology was unnecessary.  
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is -- I don't like apologies because there was no  
reason for real apologies because it was not serious enough,'' he 
said. ``If one said, `members sold votes for $500,000, for $100,000 
or $1 million,' I would be flabbergasted. Then we would be just 
like everybody else. For the moment it is not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Australian Olympics chief John Coates disclosed that  
he offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members the 
night before Sydney defeated Beijing by two votes for the 2000 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to now, I have not seen important corruption. I see errors  
in judgment,'' de Merode said. ``Small services were provided. A 
candidate city wants to be friends with the members. You vote for 
your friends, not for disagreeable people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members should have understood they could not accept this,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's at this level, not at the level of manifest corruption,''  
de Merode said.
