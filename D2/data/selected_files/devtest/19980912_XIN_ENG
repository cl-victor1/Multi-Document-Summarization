<HEADLINE> Duma Confirms Primakov as Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, on Friday endorsed Yevgeny Primakov's
nomination as prime minister by an overwhelmingly majority.
</P>
<P>
The Duma, voted 317-63 to confirm Primakov, in a major show of
support for the new government that ended a political standoff
between President Boris Yeltsin and the opposition-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the voting in the State Duma, Primakov said
that he would appoint communist Yury Maslyukov as first deputy
prime minister in his coming government.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to deputies to ratify the much-delayed START II
nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States, saying he
would not back down on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he did not have an economic program because he
had only been nominated the day before, but economic reform would
continue.
</P>
<P>
"Reform are necessary. The present situation cannot be overcome
without reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a strong state role in regulating the economy.
"The government should intervene into the economic affairs and
regulate them. This is not a return to the administrative and
command system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he wanted his cabinet members to put aside party
interests.
</P>
<P>
"Representatives of all parties should join the Cabinet as
professionals and work as members of a single team. And there
should be no orders from the organization they belong to," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign policy, Primakov said there would be no
confrontation with other countries. But it was vital to defend
Russia's national interests.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need confrontation, a return to the Cold War. And
that will not happen," he said. "But at the same time we will
strictly defend the interests of the state."
</P>
<P>
Saying that he was not yet well prepared for the job, Primakov
warned deputies against expecting quick results from his incoming
government as it strove to pull the country out of its acute
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He asked deputies to give his government up to a year before
deciding if it was succeeding or not.
</P>
<P>
"Without the decisive support of the Duma, and I want to
emphasize the word decisive, the government won't be able to
work," Primakov told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
"We need unity to come out of this very grave crisis," he
said. "Do not expect to continue political confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin nominated Primakov for premier on Thursday after the
Duma rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin twice for the prime minister's
post.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier on Friday that Russia is at a crucial moment
and that it is necessary to urgently lower prices, fill the shops
with goods again, restore the banking system, and guarantee the
safety of bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed those issues can be solved by the new
government under the leadership of Primakov with the support of
both the president and the parliament.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair will go ahead with his scheduled meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton during a visit to New York later this month,
according to Downing Street sources.
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is a close friend of Clinton, is now under

early Friday Blair is still planning to stick to his original
plans of attending the meeting.

"Clearly, what's going on in Washington right now is a matter
for the American people, and the American Congress. However, the
president (Clinton) has been a good friend and ally to this
country," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a close relationship with the United States and it's
important for this country to continue to have a close
relationship with the United States," he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Envoy On Question of Taiwan's UN Reentry  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The raising of the
question of so-called "Taiwan's representation at the United
Nations" is a brazen attempt to challenge General Assembly
Resolution 2758 (XXVI), China stressed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly, Qin Huasen, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said at the instigation of the Taiwan
authorities and in disregard of the U.N. Charter, the General
Assembly Resolution, principles of international law and the
decision of the General Committee in the past five years, this
year a handful of countries had once again raised the question of
so-called "Taiwan's representation at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said the proposal, in essence, is part of the
activities to split a sovereign state and create "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan " at the solemn organization of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qin said such an illegal act constitutes a grave encroachment
on China's sovereignty and brutal interference in China's internal
affairs, and it has trampled wantonly on the U.N. Charter, General
Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) and Principles of international
law.
</P>
<P>
Qin aid the Chinese Government and people express strong
indignation at and condemnation to such act, and China is strongly
opposed to inscribing item 166 of the draft agenda in the agenda
of the 53rd session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Qin Expressed the hope that the General Committee will continue
to uphold justice, safeguard the purposes and principles of the
U.N. Charter, General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI) as well as
the principles of international law, and support the position of
the Chinese delegation.

<HEADLINE> Italian Nun Still in Hands of Abductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian nun Sister Marsa
is still in the hands of her abductors Friday as the
SOS-Mogadishu hospital remains closed for the second day.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the abductors, Sister Marsa is
in good health and fed well.
</P>
<P>
The nun who had been working in the main maternity and child
health care hospital of the capital was abducted Thursday morning
by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Sister Marsa is being kept by a third group of gunmen after
she was transferred twice. The abductors do not want to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed sources said the gunmen are demanding a ransom of
240,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, elders from the clan of those who kidnaped Sister
Marsa are trying their best to secure a safe release of the nun.
They hoped that she will be released very soon.
</P>
<P>
Sister Marsa is a well known nun especially in Mogadishu for
her long-term humanitarian activities in the SOS maternity
hospital during the years of the civil war.
M14-91NBB186i0911ql00:2800:280829
</P>
<P>
The abduction of Sister Marsa is believed to have been
prompted by the misunderstanding between the regional
headquarters of the SOS-International in Nairobi and the former
finance administrator of SOS in Mogadishu, Abdullahi Erro, who
was subsequently been replaced.
</P>
<P>
This misunderstanding has been further complicated by no
salary paid for the local staff of SOS in Mogadishu last month.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted on Friday morning to release a prosecutor's
report that accuses President Clinton of perjury and obstruction
of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair, the first act in a
threatening impeachment.

<P>
The House voted 363-63 to release the 445-page report later in

ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic
Taliban Friday claimed they had seized seven villages in the
central province of Bamyan following the defection of an
opposition commander and his troops, reports monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia advanced into villages in the districts of
Kohmard and Saighon as part of a fierce drive to take Bamyan,
stronghold of the anti-Taliban Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat, the reports
quoted the militia's mouthpiece Radio Kabul as saying.

<P>
However, Haji Mohammed Moahqaq, a top leader of the
anti-Taliban northern alliance, denied that the Taliban had seized
the villages or his side's troops had joined the Taliban ranks.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, which groups forces loyal to
Uzbek-ethnic warlord Rashid Dostum, Afghanistan's former military
chief Ahmad Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat, has suffered a
serious setback after the Taliban forces overran its headquarters
of Mazar-e-Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Russian Sailor Threatens to Blow up Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A sailor who killed seven
fellow servicemen on a submarine in Severomorsk, Murmansk region
in northern Russia early Friday, is now threatening to blow up
the submarine, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Kuzminykh refused to surrender despite words that his
parents were on their way to the site, Northern Fleet Prosecutor
Igor Yefremov said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman for the Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB), said the submarine is not carrying nuclear
ammunition, adding that an FSB anti-terrorist unit is now at the
site of the incident and ready to deal with the actions of the
sailor inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
Force may have to be used, Interfax quoted Zdanovich as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kuzminykh is believed to be psychologically normal. He has
never sought psychiatric help.
</P>
<P>
He is now in the submarine's arms compartment, which contains
torpedoes and boxes with explosive substances, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, Kuzminykh left the sub and went to the
mooring, where he seriously wounded a sentinel and seized his
automatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
He also wounded an officer who tried to stop him.
</P>
<P>
Kuzminykh then returned to the submarine and killed five
sleeping fellow sailors. He took two other sailors hostage and
killed them later.
</P>
<P>
The submarine, one of the Northern Fleet's eight "Akula" type
vessels, joined the fleet in 1984.
</P>
<P>
A source in the fleet's headquarters earlier told Interfax that
these submarines are fitted with one nuclear plant and may also be
equipped with Shkval missiles or torpedoes with nuclear warheads.

UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has been an
inalienable part of China since ancient times, China stressed here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd Session of the
General Assembly, Qin Huasen, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the
1945 Potsdam Proclamation reaffirmed China's sovereignty over
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said to date, 162 countries have diplomatic
relations with China and they all recognize that there is but one
China in the world, the Government of the People's republic of
China is the sole legal government representing China in its
entirety and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the People's
republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Qin said over the period of nearly five decades since the
founding of the People's Republic of China, great changes have
taken place both in the world situation and in China which
includes Taiwan, in the social, economic, political and other
aspects.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that however, no such changes can alter the fact
that Taiwan is a province of China and that China exercises
sovereignty over Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> SADC Ministers Urged to Observe U.N. Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have agreed to
tighten the control of airports and airspace in a bid to
implement the U.N. sanctions on Angola's opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement follows a recommendation from the ministers of
transport and communications who attended the two-day SADC
Council of Ministers meeting here in the north of Mauritius,
Alfred Nzo, South African Foreign Minister and chairman of the
Council said here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers will urge SADC heads of state and government who
will meet Sunday and Monday to endorse the decision and take
necessary measures to ensure compliance with the decisions
through SADC, the Organization of African Unity and the U. N. on
this matter, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation Security Council enforced its sanctions on
the opposition National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) earlier this year in the wake of the former rebel
movement's failure to comply fully with the Lusaka Protocol
signed in 1994 with the government.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Council meeting which will end Saturday also
decided to create a legal sector whose main objective would be to
provide guidance and coordination of policies, programs and
projects as well as advice Council on legal matters arising from
SADC activities, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
The SADC cooperation with the United States and European Union
were also discussed by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
All 14 SADC members states were present at the Council meeting
Friday including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the
Seychelles, two new members which entered into the regional block
last year.
</P>
<P>
But Congo (K) was not represented by its senior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende told the press
the Congolese Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo will head Congo's
ministerial delegation to attend the Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Kongolo has not come due to security situation in his
country, said an official close to the Congolese delegation.

<HEADLINE> (URGENT) White House Sends Counter-Report to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House made a
dramatic effort Friday attempted to preempt Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's allegations, sending Congress its own report
declaring that the president did not commit perjury, obstruct
justice, tamper with witnesses or abuse the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
"Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity. Even to
discuss it is to discuss overturning the electoral will of the
people," President Bill Clinton's personal and White House lawyers
wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the OIC (Office of Independent Counsel) can
identify any conduct remotely approaching" the impeachment
standard, said the 73-page rebuttal written by attorney David
Kendall and White House Counsel Charles Ruff and their associates.
</P>
<P>
"Instead from press reports, if true, it appears that the OIC
has dangerously overreached to describe in the most dramatic of
terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper
and lawful," they added.

<HEADLINE> Tension Remains High in Lesotho: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tension rose to new
heights in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, Friday when several
army officers in the Lesotho Defense Force were arrested in a
swoop, a report reaching here quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The army officers were driven to the maximum security section
of the central prison in Maseru in army vehicles, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The number of officers arrested was not immediately known and
there has been no official comment on the surprise move.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the officers followed weeks of speculation that
there were two opposing factions in the Lesotho army who took
different positions over the defiance by a large group of
protesters in the grounds of the Royal Palace in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The political situation in the land-locked country has been
simmering because of alleged electoral fraud over the past six
weeks as the opposition supporters first squatted at the gates of
the Royal Palace and later moved inside the palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that those arrested Friday were against
government orders to remove the protesters from the palace
grounds.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were a lot of troops movement in
Maseru Friday afternoon. South African Press Association quoted
South African High Commissioner to Lesotho Japhet Ndhlovu as
saying that he was unable to confirm reports of an attempted
coup.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know really what is happening. We can't tell what is
happening," Ndhlovu said.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu said he was trying to contact several Lesotho cabinet
ministers, but they were unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Strengthen Agricultural Partnership with Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is to strengthen
agricultural partnership with Mexico in order to ferment trade
with its southern neighbor within the framework of North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
A Canadian agriculture trade delegation to Latin America,
including Canada's Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Good, Lyle
Vlief, five provincial agriculture ministers and a group of
Canadian business leaders arrived here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A local paper quoted Vanclief as saying that the mutual trade
volume between Canada and Mexico already stands at over 800
million U.S. dollars and is steadily increasing.
</P>
<P>
Vanclief is to meet Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Romarico
Arroyo Marroquin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector rakes in over 22
billion dollars annually, making up just under 9 percent of
Canada's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Canada companies are putting increasing emphasis on the
international partnership with other countries, said Vanclief.
</P>
<P>
"Canada understands the benefits of partnering -- greater export
sales, cost savings, control of quality and enhanced economic
benefits for both partners," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> White House Rebuts Starr's Report on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House sent
Congress its own report, defending President Bill Clinton
immediately after the House of Representatives voted on Friday
morning to release a prosecutor's report that accuses President
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The White House report, attempting to preempt Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's allegations, declaring that the president
did not commit perjury, obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses or
abuse the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
"Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity. Even to

"Instead from press reports, if true, it appears that the OIC
has dangerously overreached to describe in the most dramatic of
terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper
and lawful," the White House report said.
</P>
<P>
The House in the morning voted 363-63 to release the 445-page
report later in the day via the Internet despite the objections of
some Democrats who argued it was unfair that Clinton didn't get a
chance to see it first.
</P>
<P>
Majority Republicans insisted they followed the letter of the
law and didn't see any reason to give White House "spinmeisters" a
chance to mount an advance public assault on the report's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"Due process, fundamental fairness, will be observed," said
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. "This whole
proceeding will fall on its face if it's not perceived by the
American people to be fair."

Despite the flareup of partisan tension, members of both
parties acknowledged the somber and historic nature of the day's
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Recalls Ambassador to Libya in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has recalled its
ambassador to Libya to protest Tripoli's support for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the Anatolia News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Mufit Ozdes has been recalled for "consultations for
an indefinite period" to protest Libya's permission to a PKK group
to attend a parade on September 1, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Necati Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Libya has also withdrawn its ambassador to
Ankara, the semi-official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
A number of PKK members in their national dress and carrying
PKK flags and pictures of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan marched in a
ceremony marking the anniversary of the Revolution that brought
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to power.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will not tolerate Libya's public support for its
outlawed guerrilla group, Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast of Turkey. More than 35,000 people have
been killed in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Libya, among other countries, of supporting
the PKK. Reports said that some 400 PKK members are believed based
in the North African country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Says to Have Done Well in Reviving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said Friday his government has made significant progress in
efforts to revive the battled economy but still needs urgent and
sustained action to fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We have made considerable progress on many of the issues"
troubling the Kenyan economy since this year, Moi said at the
one-day second Economic Consultative Meeting attended mainly by
cabinet ministers and other senior Kenyan officials. The first
was held in May.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit, domestic debt and interest rates went down as
revenue collection rose, privatization moved forward and the
rehabilitation of infrastructure extensively damaged by the El
Nino rains is being undertaken, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
The May meeting resolved that the key means to revamp economy
are to cut public expenditure and re-build roads and other
collapsing infrastructure, partly in a bid to save tourism,
Kenya's No. 1 foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the budget deficit for the financial year 1997/98
(July/June) reduced marginally to 2.4 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) from 2.5 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection increased to over 168 billion Shillings (60
Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar). The stock of domestic debt
has also been reduced to 145.5 billion Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in the eastern African country declined to 22.9
percent earlier this month from 27 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has also concluded credit agreements
with the World Bank and the African Development Bank for the
rehabilitation of infrastructure and has approved the setting-up
of the Kenya National Roads Board.
</P>
<P>
The country has also made gains in the privatization of the
telecommunication, ports, railway and energy sectors, Moi
announced.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization process for Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya
Railways has been approved by my government," said Moi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan parliament has also passed a bill to split the
Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation into three
sr organizations.
</P>
<P>
Power purchase agreements have been concluded by the
government with a number of independent power producers.
</P>
<P>
"Civil service reforms, recruitment in the civil and teaching
services has been deferred and a freeze on increases of salaries
and allowances has been effected," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed deep concern about rampant corruption
which has hurting Kenya's economy for years.
</P>
<P>
"One area in which corruption is most rampant as well as
destructive to the economy is in revenue collection," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moi said the government now is taking further measures to
fight against the evasion of duty and the dumping of cheap
imports, especially on sugar importing, into the country.
</P>
<P>
The final resolution of Friday's meeting is expected to come
out Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says 2 Diplomats Escape Taliban Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh said on Friday that two of the 11
Iranian diplomats succeeded in escaping the massacres of the
Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh told the official news agency IRNA that the two
diplomats found a chance to flee the Taliban's killing after the
group captured Mazari Sherif in the north of Afghanistan last
month.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of them was wounded but able to leave the city
with the help of a friend.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official did not mention the whereabouts of the two
diplomats. But he said the case is under a detailed scrutiny and
the results of the investigation would be published later.
</P>
<P>
Iran has accused the Taliban of abducting 11 diplomats and an
IRNA reporter. Earlier reports have said the Iranians have been
killed. The Afghan group denied any knowledge of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman said on Thursday that the bodies of nine of
the Iranian diplomats have been found on the outskirts of Mazari
Sherif.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Amend Former Presidents Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Christon Tembo
introduced to parliament Friday a bill on amendment of Zambia's
Benefits of Former Presidents Act aimed at streamlining the
provisions relating to former presidents when they retire.
</P>
<P>
Once passed, the bill will enable former presidents when they
retire to live in houses and places of their choice not more than
two years after retirement.
</P>
<P>
The existing act will in particular be amended by the
insertion in the appropriate place of the definition of "active
politics" as:
</P>
<P>
"The doing of any act indicating a person's intention to hold
elective or appointive office; or the holding of elective office
or appointive office in a political party or in an organization
whose main aim is the furtherance of political objectives."
</P>
<P>
In the principle act which was read together with the bill,
Zambia's former presidents are deemed not to have retired if
still in active politics.
</P>
<P>
This bill came three months after Kenneth Kaunda, the land's
only former president and now leader of the country's largest
opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP),
declared last June after his release from five-month detention
that he would retire from "active party politics".
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was detained last December allegedly in connection with
the foiled military coup on October 28, 1997. He was charged with
misprisionment of treason which was denied by the former
president.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the state withdrew the charges against Kaunda and
he was released. Local reports said his release was part of a
political deal brokered by South African President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government, under the deal, agreed to withdraw all
the charges on condition that Kaunda, who was defeated by
President Frederick Chiluba in the 1991 multi-party elections
after 27 years' rule, retired from active party politics.
</P>
<P>
State House spokesman Richard Cakala said two weeks ago that
the government had offered Kaunda a house as part of his
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, Kaunda has been living in a house rented by
the Zambian government but the rentals amounting to about two
billion Kwacha or one million U.S. Dollars have never been paid.

<HEADLINE> China's Envoy on Question of Taiwan's UN Reentry (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) --In its resolution 2758
(XXVI) adopted in 1971 at its 26th session by an overwhelming
majority, the General assembly reaffirmed the "one China "
principle in an exact and holistic matter, China said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd Session of the
General Assembly, Qin Huasen, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said the General Assembly in the resolution
clearly and unequivocally recognized "that the representatives of
the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only
lawful representative of China to the United Nations and that the
People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent
representatives of the Security Council " and decided to restore
all rights of the People's Republic of China at the United Nations
and to expel immediately the representatives of Taiwan "from the
place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in
all the organizations related to it."
</P>
<P>
Qin said to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of
China at the United Nations and to expel the Taiwan authorities
from the United Nations are two indivisible aspects of one
question, and without expelling the Taiwan authorities from the
United Nations, it would have been impossible to resolve properly
China's representation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said only in this way could the resolution give,
as it did perfectly, concrete expression to the "one China"
principle and the Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has settled once and for
all and in a just and Comprehensive manner the question of China's
representation at the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- "The United Nations is
an intergovernmental organization composed of sovereign states,"
but "Taiwan, as a province of China, is in no position to join the
United Nations," a senior Chinese diplomat said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement at the General Assembly of the 53rd
Session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is an intergovernmental organization
composed of sovereign states. Article 4 of the Charter of the
United Nations stipulates expressly that only sovereign states are
entitled to membership in the United Nations," Qin said. "Taiwan,
as a province of China, is in no position to join the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to principles of the international law,
the sovereignty of a State is indivisible, Qin said, "The
Government of the People's Republic of China naturally represents,
in the United Nations and its agencies, the Chinese people as a
whole, including the Taiwan compatriots."
</P>
<P>
"There dose not exist the so-called question of 'Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Taiwan, by nature, bears no analogy to the
cases of Germany and Korea resulting from the international
agreements following the end of World War II," he said, adding
that "Therefore, the so-called principle of parallel
representation can not apply to Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) conforms to the Charter
of the United Nations and the principles of international law and
above all, reflects the actual situation in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In their attempt to challenge the resolution, the handful of
countries have naturally met with strong opposition from the vast
number of justice-upholding Member States of the United Nations,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israeli Soldiers Clash After Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians clashed Friday
with Israeli troops in protest against the killing of two Hamas
members by Israeli soldiers, leaving several Palestinians wounded,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank town of Ramallah when they marched toward a nearby
Jewish settlement to protest the shooting of Imad Awadallah and
his brother who used to live near the city.
</P>
<P>
The protesters threw bottles and firebombs at the Israeli
troops guarding the settlement, who fired rubber bullets in
return, wounding a number of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in other West Bank cities and Gaza also held
demonstrations after Israel sealed off the Palestinian self-rule
areas in the morning following the killing of the Awadallah
brothers, both Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
Awadallah and his brother were shot dead in an exchange of fire
with Israeli troops Thursday night in Hebron. Imad was suspected
of masterminding two suicide bombings in Jerusalem last year
killing dozens of Israelis.
</P>

He escaped from a Palestinian jail in Hebron last month, where
he was imprisoned on charges of killing Hamas main bomb-maker Muhi

Hamas officials vowed Friday that they would take revenge on
the killing of the Awadallah brothers, saying Israel would pay
high price for the act, Israel Radio reported.

To ward off possible Hamas revenge, the Israeli army, on extra
high alert, announced late Thursday night that the West Bank and
Gaza would be sealed since early Friday, barring Palestinians from
entering Israel.

Israel declared the closure at a time when the United States
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is visiting Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas in a bid to bridge the gaps over the overdue
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.

<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Ross in the
afternoon. Details of the talks have yet to be disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy on Question of "Taiwan's UN Reentry" (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- "The question of
Taiwan is purely an internal matter of China and a matter for the
Chinese people themselves that brooks no interference by any
country or individual in any way under whatever pretext," a senior
Chinese envoy said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement at the General Committee of the 53rd
Session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the question of Taiwan and the reunification
of the motherland are the solemn and lofty missions of all the
Chinese people, including those on Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
As early as over a decade ago, on behalf of the Chinese
Government, Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader, proposed the
fundamental policy of "peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems" for the settlement of the Taiwan question, he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 last year, the concept of "one country, two systems"
first materialized in Hong Kong and tremendous success has been
achieved ever since, he said, adding that on December 20, 1999,
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan question will be also resolved," he said, "it is
DPB288NBB200I11TSQL01:5501:565133
only a matter of when, and it will not drag on for too long."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the joint efforts of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, marked progress has been made in the
people-to-people exchanges between the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indirect trade has been growing rapidly every year and the
investment in the mainland by Taiwan business people has increased
steadily, he said, adding that the exchange of personnel visits
between the two sides has surpassed 12 million persons/times in
total.
</P>
<P>
The contacts and exchanges in the cultural, academic, sports,
VHK226NBB200I11TSQL01:5501:565138
scientific and technological, and journalistic fields have been
expanding vigorously, he said, adding that progress has also been
made in the postal and transport services between people on the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The economic, trade and cultural exchanges between people on
the two sides of the Strait are closer than ever, which have
greatly deepened their mutual understanding and fraternal feeling,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Raising the question of the so-called "Taiwan's membership at
the United Nations" under such circumstances, the handful of
countries are only moving to severely sabotage the process of the
peaceful reunification of China, he added.

<HEADLINE> White House Rebuts Starr's Report on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House Friday
tried to preempt Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's allegations,
sending its own report to Congress declaring that President Bill
Clinton did not commit perjury, obstruct justice, tamper with
witnesses or abuse the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
The report said Clinton had acknowledged having an improper
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, adding, "the disclosure
of lurid and salacious allegations can only be intended to
humiliate the president and force him from office."
</P>
<P>
"Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity. Even to
discuss it is to discuss overturning the electoral will of the
people," Clinton's personal and White House lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe the OIC (Office of Independent Counsel) can
identify any conduct remotely approaching" the impeachment
standard, said the 73-page rebuttal written by attorney David
Kendall and White House Counsel Charles Ruff and their associates.
</P>
<P>
"Instead from press reports, if true, it appears that the OIC
has dangerously overreached to describe in the most dramatic of
terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper
and lawful," they added.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the White House less than an hour
after lawmakers voted to make public a report by Starr that is
expected to accuse him of 11 impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton rebuttal was believed to be part of a massive
counteroffensive, carefully planned in secret over the last few
days by the president's top troubleshooters.
</P>
<P>
The White House report was sent to leaders of the House
Judiciary Committee, Speaker Newt Gingrich, Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt and House Oversight Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, a
White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The document offered a point-by-point rebuttal of allegations
expected to be contained in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
The White House rebuttal said that Clinton had acknowledged "a
serious mistake" in his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable
action," the report said. It went on to say that Starr's report
was based "entirely on allegations obtained by the grand jury" and
said that grand juries "are not designed to search for the truth."
</P>
<P>
The report denies all alleged criminal misconduct, asserting,
"This means that the OIC report is left with nothing but the
details of a private sexual relationship, told in graphic details
with the intent to embarrass."
</P>
<P>
The report dismissed as "meritless" Starr's "attempts to evoke
images of Watergate by charging that the president has abused the
powers of his office."
</P>
<P>
The report rebutted allegations that Clinton perjured himself
in January when he denied in a deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit that he had had sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"In a civil deposition he gave narrow answers to ambiguous
questions," the attorneys said. "As a matter of law, those answers
could not give rise to a criminal charge of perjury. In the face
of the president's admission of his relationship, the disclosure
of lurid and salacious allegations can only be intended to
humiliate the president and force him from office."
</P>
<P>
The report said, "Given the flimsy and unsubstantiated basis
for the accusations, there is a complete lack of credible evidence
to initiate an impeachment inquiry concerning the president. And
the principal purpose of the investigation, and the OIC's report,
is to embarrass the president and titillate the public by
producing a document that is little more than an unreliable,
one-sided account of sexual behavior."
</P>
<P>
The White House report said that Clinton "did not commit
perjury. Most of the illegal leaks suggesting his testimony was
perjurious falsely describe his testimony."
</P>
<P>
It also said there was no obstruction of justice. "The
president never asked Ms. Lewinsky to get rid of the gifts (that
he had given her) and he never asked (personal secretary Betty)
Currie to get them. We believe that Ms. Currie's testimony
supports the president's."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs are the important basis for
state-to-state relations and cooperation and part and parcel of
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
a senior Chinese envoy said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement at the General Committee of the 53rd
Session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches importance to developing relations with all
Member States of the United Nations, including those that do not
have diplomatic relations with China, and is ready to work for
friendly relations and cooperation with all countries in the world
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no conflicting fundamental interests between China
and countries raising the so-called 'Taiwan's representation at
the United Nations', and China has never done anything detrimental
to the interests of those countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Those countries, however, have severely damaged China's
fundamental interest and hurt the feeling of the 1.2 billion
Chinese people by supporting the splittist activities of the
Taiwan authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that they will no longer be taken advantage of by the
Taiwan authorities and will stop supporting the Taiwan
authorities' activities of creating 'two Chinas' or 'one China,
one Taiwan'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope they will withdraw their proposal and return to the
principles of the UN Charter and relevant General Assembly
resolution," he said, adding that "We hope they will get back on
the basis for normal relations between UN Member States and join
the overwhelming majority of Member States in safeguarding the
authority of the UN Charter, relevant General Assembly resolution
and norms of international law."
</P>
<P>
"This is an incumbent responsibility for all UN Member States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The firm position of the Chinese Government and people to
safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity has the
support of vast majority of countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee has, for five years in a roll since 1993,
refused to put the so-called question of "Taiwan's representation
at the United Nations" in the agenda of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"This has fully safeguard the authority of the Charter and
General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI)," he said, "the Chinese
Government and people wish to express their sincere thanks and pay
tribute to those justice-upholding countries."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the General Committee of the 53rd Session of
the General Assembly will do the same and refuse in no ambiguous
language to inscribe the so-called question of 'Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations' in the agenda of the General
Assembly," Qin added.

UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) --In its resolution 2758
(XXVI) adopted in 1971 at its 26th session by an overwhelming
majority, the General assembly reaffirmed the "one China "
principle in an exact and holistic manner, China said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd Session of the
General Assembly, Qin Huasen, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, said the General Assembly in the resolution
clearly and unequivocally recognized "that the representatives of
the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only
lawful representative of China to the United Nations and that the
People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent
representatives of the Security Council " and decided to restore
all rights of the People's Republic of China at the United Nations
and to expel immediately the representatives of Taiwan "from the
place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in
all the organizations related to it."
</P>
<P>
Qin said to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of
China at the United Nations and to expel the Taiwan authorities
from the United Nations are two indivisible aspects of one
question, and without expelling the Taiwan authorities from the
United Nations, it would have been impossible to resolve properly
China's representation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin said only in this way could the resolution give,
as it did perfectly, concrete expression to the "one China"
principle and the Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has settled once and for

<HEADLINE> Rebels Ready for Long-Term Guerilla War Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) is ready to wage long-term guerilla war
against President Laurent Kabila, a senior rebel leader said.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview by the Maputo-based Metical
newspaper, Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese
Democratic Coalition, said in Goma in eastern Congo (k) that they
are ready to fight a long-term war against Kabila as what the
Angolan and Mozambican peoples did during their struggle against
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Wambo said that any attempt for an end of conflict in DRC
without the involvement of his Movement would mean to delay the
solution of the crisis, the Mozambican News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The question of Congo, Wambo said, should be solved by the
Congolese people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is unrealistic to reach a real cease-fire
agreement at the Addis Ababa defence ministers meeting without
the involvement of the major players, adding that the major
players are the Congolese Democratic coalition, Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He did not list Kabila as a major player, "as he does not have
his own army."
</P>
<P>
The Congolese Democratic Coalition was kept outside the
seven-nation peace summit held in Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Victoria Falls peace summit, Wambo said that they were
invited to the meeting, but it turned out that they were treated
like prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish that the summit could have accepted
them. " Whatever the situation, leaders at the summit have to
accepted the existence of rebels," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in power, we only hope to clear our
country of the obstacles in building a democratic government," he
said, "We do not wish to have disaster, corruption and racial
genocide."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said that his movement has not any direct
contact with Mozambican President oaquim Chissano, but he said
they would like to contact him.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that President Chissano could use his influence to
let his colleagues know that to support Kabila means to support
the continuation of genocide, and the destabilization in southern
Africa," Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, the Vice-Chairman of Southern African Development
Community (SADC), advocates to solve the DRC crisis through
talks.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Chief Confirmed by Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma
confirmed Viktor Gerashchenko as Chairman of the Central Bank with
273 voting for and 65 against, while two abstaining, on Friday
evening, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Yeltsin accepted the resignation tendered by
former head of Central Bank Sergei Dubinin and named Gerashchenko
as head of the CB.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting on his nomination Gerashchenko said at the
State Duma that the situation in the banking system is very
complicated, but it reflects the poorly-considered economic policy
which did not aim at the development of the national production.
</P>
<P>
He requested the State Duma to dismiss the current members of
the Central Bank Board and immediately decide on the membership of
the Bank board.
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko warned that "a full collapse of the banking system
will occur next Tuesday if the State Duma does not take a
decision on the membership of the Central Bank Board today."
</P>
<P>
At his request the State Duma dismissed on Friday the Central
Bank's Board of directors. Now a draft resolution on the new Board
will be prepared on Monday after consultations at the Duma budget
committee. It will be discussed at a Duma plenary meeting on
Wednesday, September 16.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Central Bank Board are nominated by the State

VHK234NBB211I11TSQL02:5102:511446
Duma for a period of four years on the presentation of the Central
Bank Chairman coordinated with the president.
</P>
<P>
In Gerashchenko's opinion, a reason for the financial crisis is
the economic policy; the statement of the government and the
Central Bank of August 17 averted investors from Russia.
</P>
<P>
He favors a close contact between the Central Bank and the
government and the Duma control over the activity of the Central
Bank.

five permanent representatives of the Security Council."
</P>

however, is to see the matter resolved quickly within a highly
possible time framework which will be beneficial to the Chinese
people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Report Released, Clinton Rebuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday approved to release a prosecutor's report
that accuses President Bill Clinton of perjury and obstruction of
justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair, but the White House
immediately rebutted it and denied almost all alleged grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 363-63 to release the 445-page report via the
Internet in the same day despite the objections of some Democrats
who argued it was unfair that Clinton didn't get a chance to see
it first.
</P>
<P>
Starr's report accused Clinton of repeatedly lying under oath,
witness tampering, obstructing justice and abusing his
presidential power in a damning report on his affair with Monica
Lewinsky made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, following
his eight-month investigation into Clinton's relationship with
Lewinsky and whether he tried to cover it up, contained
allegations of 11 potentially impeachable offenses and graphic
descriptions of their sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
The report alleged five counts of lying under oath, four counts
of obstructing justice, one count of tampering with a witness and
one count of abusing his constitutional authority by "lying to the
public and the Congress in January 1998 about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
Starr's report specified sexual acts between Clinton and
Lewinsky that the prosecutor said were included under the legal
definition of sexual relations and that meant Clinton lied about
it.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation and release of his report has thrown
Clinton's presidency into crisis and threatened to lead to the
first impeachment proceedings against a president since Richard
Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Within an hour after the House approval, Clinton's lawyers sent
Congress a rebuttal saying the president had done nothing that
warranted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"The president has acknowledged a serious mistake -- an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.... This private
mistake does not amount to an impeachable action," Clinton's
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton denied for seven months that he had a sexual affair
with Lewinsky but after testifying under oath to Starr's grand
jury in August he admitted having an "improper relationship" with
her.
</P>
<P>
The House action came hours after Clinton told religious
leaders at a White House prayer breakfast that he had sinned, and
asked the nation, his family and Lewinsky for forgiveness. It was
the first time Clinton asked for forgiveness from Lewinsky,
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said that he would defend against any impeachment
efforts and would remain on the job and said he had instructed his
lawyers "to mount a vigorous defense using all available,
appropriate arguments."
</P>
<P>
Most opinion polls indicated the American people did not want
the country put through presidential impeachment or resignation. A
new CBS poll conducted over the past three days showed 58 percent
of the 1,132 polled wanted the whole matter dropped.

<HEADLINE> Private Power Plant Begins Operation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The first private power plant
in Bangladesh, the 110-megawatt Khulna Barge-Mounted Power Plant,
started operation in the southwestern part of the country
Saturday, thus putting an end to state monopoly on power
generation.
</P>
<P>
"With this power plant, a new dimension has been added to
private-sector investment in the era of free market economy,"
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said while inaugurating the plant,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
All power-sector operations, including billing and
distribution, would be gradually privatized, she said.
</P>
<P>
Work has begun for separating production, transmission and
distribution to improve power management in the country, with the
formation of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh for this
purpose, Hasina was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 103 million-U.S. dollar power plant, owned by the Khulna
Power Company, would provide relief to the power crisis-ridden
Khulna zone, and the company would sell electricity to the
National Power Development Board under a 15-year term, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The country's average daily electricity demand is 2,300 mw
against an output of about 2,000 mw. As a result, loadshedding is
very common across the country, particularly during the summer
season from March to June.
</P>
<P>
Hasina took over the Energy Ministry early this year after
dismissing Energy Minister Nooruddin Khan for failing to reduce
the frequency of loadshedding and improve the country's overall
power supply.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Peace, Prerequisite for SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 12 (Xinhua) -- When leaders
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries
discuss ways to achieve economic integration here, they will have
to sort out the pressing peace crises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its founding in 1980, this regional organization
has been working hard toward coordinating and developing the
economy in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
During its summit last year in Malawi, SADC leaders resolved
to achieve regional economic integration in the region by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the armed revolt in Democratic Congo against Laurent
Kabila's 15-month old government, which has sucked in nearly half
of the 14 members of the regional grouping, and the crippli~?peace process in An
gola in the past year, has certainly become
two of the urgent issues for the heads of state and government
during their meeting here in Mauritius on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The former Zaire is the largest country in central Africa,
with rich mineral resources coveted by many. Its entrance into
SADC, the most influential sub-regional organization, adds power
to the country's aim for high economic advancement.
</P>
<P>
But this move war"cut short when ethnic Tutsi rebels in Congo
(K) accused Kabila of corruption and nepotism for which they
started the armed revolt on August 2.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion, prompted by Kabila's order for the Rwandan
Troops which had helped him to assume power, to leave his country
on July 27, has soon spread from the east to the west of the
country. At one stage, the rebels even claimed to have
controlled one-third of Congo, Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
From the regional prospective, the Congo crisis has disturbed
the balance both inside the country and in the central and
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the rebellion started in the east of Congo, Kabila
has accused Rwanda and Uganda, two former allies which assisted
him last year in ousting late dictator Mobuto Sese Seko, of
invading to back the Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Congo crisis has also divided the SADC members, with
countries led by South African President Nelson Mandela
advocating diplomatic settlement, whereas Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia have been favoring direct military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The latter have sent troops and weapons to the war-torn
country to prop up Kabila's government and turned the tide in
favor of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Congo has now turned for the better, with the
government army and its allied troops routing the rebel soldiers
in the west of the country, forcing them to retreat to their
eastern strongholds.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said Congo (K) will remain divided and
this poses threats to regional stability if the warring sides
cannot sit down for negotiations on a cease-fire, the withdrawal
of foreign troops and the possibility of transition to democracy
with a broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries have been mediating the crisis in Congo
since the fighting broke out in early August, with many urgent
mini-summits called.
</P>
<P>
The peace summit at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe ended without
an agreement on cease-fire, because President Kabila and his
backers did not recognize the rebel delegation and had
face-to-face talks with it.
</P>
<P>
Early this month another summit was called during the
Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, with a
consensus reached on cease-fire and a peaceful settlement of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Again, a defense ministers meeting in Ethiopia this week
failed to achieve a breakthrough because Kabila and his allies
refused to deal directly with the rebels, and this caused Rwandan
and Ugandan delegates to walk out of the meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
Despite Mandela's public announcement of his understanding of
military intervention on the part of Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia, differences remain among SADC countries with regard to
approaches to the situation in Congo.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate these differences and restore peace is no doubt
the key and prerequisite for the region to concentrate its energy
back on economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Angola, a strife-torn country in the southern African
region, is another problem which has been calling for attention.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the country's independence from Portugal in 1975,
clashes between fighters of the People's Liberation Movement of
Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) have been routine reports, until Lusaka Protocol
was signed in November, 1994 which initiated the protracted
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
What's sad is that despite efforts made by the United Nations
and the SADC countries, the opposition UNITA has failed to comply
fully with the Protocol in terms of disarmament, handing over
strategic cities it occupied to the government and shifting its
headquarters to the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The government hence suspended the function of UNITA members
in the national unity and reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNITA announced severance of its cooperation
with Russia, Portugal and the United States, the troika observer
missions on the Angolan peace process, and resumed fighting and
raids on government areas, and this has thrown the peace process
in the country into another crisis.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the continuing clashes in Congo (K) and
Angola will surely affect the overall economic development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
To restore peace in the two countries is therefore a matter of
urgency for the SADC before it can tackle with economic problems
important for achieving regional integration.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on South Asian Gender Issues Ends in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting on gender
mainstreaming in the South Asian region ended here Saturday after
agreeing to strengthen what the countries have been doing and
share expertise.
</P>
<P>
Chandni Joshi, regional program advisor of the U.N. Development
Fund for Women (UNIFEM), described the meeting, the first of its
kind in the region, as very positive because there had been a very
sound work plan to be followed.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that every country felt that the exercises they
have done on gender mainstreaming especially at the planning level
need to be extended.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that there should be more sharing in
information and expertise in the region, she added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized jointly by the Nepali government and
UNIFEM, was building on the second South Asian regional meeting
held here on September 9 and 10 to commemorate the Fourth World
Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at the Beijing conference that gender
mainstreaming, which refers to a strategy for making gender
considerations an integral dimension in the design,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs
in political, economic and societal spheres, is one of the
fundamental strategies to achieve gender equality.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was represented by Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all member countries of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Joshi said there was a proposal that this kind of meeting be
held every two years to review what has been achieved in building
gender issues into development plans.
</P>
<P>

children demonstrated Saturday in front of the SOS Hospital in
by gunmen in the Somali capital Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tension Mounts in West Bank After Killing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 Palestinians
were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers on Saturday as
tension has mounted in the West Bank following the killing of two
Palestinians on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said 10 Palestinians injured in Ramallah
and three in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio reported that an explosive device went
off near an army vehicle Friday night, but it did not give further
details.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers shot dead Imad Awadallah and his brother in
Hebron. Israeli Defense Ministry said the two were on their way to
a major attack against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said Awadallah brothers were leaders of a
military wing of Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, and
were behind two deadly suicide bombings in west Jerusalem last
year which killed dozens of Israelis and injured hundreds of
others.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin reportedly
convened a meeting of Hamas leaders Saturday. Yassin has vowed to
revenge for the shooting of Awadallah brothers, saying Israel
would pay high for the act.
</P>
<P>
Put on high alert, Israeli army declared a closure of the areas
and Gaza beginning early Friday morning, barring all Palestinians
from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 2,000 Palestinian students demonstrated in
the Palestinian-ruled West Bank city of Nablus, calling for a
revenge for the killing of Awadallah brothers and a halt to the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has denounced the killing
of two Palestinians, saying there is no hope for progress in the
peace process if Israel continues with such policies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is in Nablus Saturday
for the second meeting with PNA President Yasser Arafat. The two
met for the first time Wednesday night, several hours after Ross
arrived in the region on a mission to narrow the gaps between
Israel and the Palestinians over the overdue Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to report to Arafat about his two rounds
of talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held on
Thursday and Friday, during which no progress has been reported.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- There has been no progress
reported in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process after
U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy Dennis Ross concluded on Saturday
his second rounds of mediation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Ross met again with Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank
city of Nablus on Saturday. But they did not speak to reporters
about their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Ross will continue to make efforts to
narrow gaps between Israel and the Palestinians over the Israeli
troops' second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for the third time on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report of local daily Haaretz said that hammering
out a mutually acceptable security memorandum of understanding
between Israel and PNA has become central to the U.S. diplomat's
current mission to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ross will try to win Palestinian acceptance to modifications
to the draft that won the acceptance of security officials from
all sides last December. Netanyahu scuttled the draft, objecting
to reference that required equal enforcement against extremism on
both Israeli and Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to achieve this goal, Ross also met with Israeli
security cabinet members during the second round talks with
Netanyahu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian peace process has been stalled for
months over the scope of next Israeli pullback in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. plan reportedly called on Israel to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank in the next withdrawal in return for the
fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
PNA has formally accepted the plan, while Israel insists that
it would consider the plan only after the PNA ensured the security
of the Jewish country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Saturday dismissed reports of an attempted
coup in Lesotho as unfounded, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was just some problems in the army itself, it's not a coup
as such. We think the situation is not as bad as earlier
reported," said Nzo, who has been in Mauritius attending a
two-day meeting of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC)'s council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Lesotho Defense Force, Makhula Mosakheng,
resigned on Friday night and brigadier-commander Thibeli had
taken over the running of the army.
</P>
<P>
He also announced on Radio Lesotho the dismissal of 26 senior
officers citing the reason of "the public interest".
</P>
<P>
The sudden resignation followed a day of dramatic events
during which junior officers arrested some senior officers of the
defense force.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said a report into alleged electoral fraud in Lesotho
would be discussed at the SADC annual summit which gets underway
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the report, which was compiled by a three-nation
commission led by South Africa, had not yet been handed to South
African President Nelson Mandela.

WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starrr's report confronts
members of Congress with the daunting task of analyzing difficult
questions of criminal law, vaguely defined constitutional
standards for impeachment and the largely unchartered interplay
between the two realms.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke to be
the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has derailed at least
for this year by a Justice Department investigation into
Holbrooke's activities after he left his previous diplomatic
assignment, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House released a scathing report by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, who accused President
Clinton of violating his constitutional duty to faithfully execute
the law by committing such crimes as perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats alike said that while there was no
single stunning revelation in the Starr report, they were deeply
distressed by its graphic and extensive details.
</P>
<P>
-- A government survey said that addicts who underwent
treatment were considerably less likely to consume drugs or commit
crimes to support their use, even after five years.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Forestry
Administration has urged that rampant logging be strictly banned
to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Li Changjian, deputy director of the administration, told a
national conference on protecting forests here today that the work
is arduous and the situation is severe.
</P>
<P>
Every year, some 6.6 million mu (440,000 hectares) of forests
are cut down. Last year, 600,000 cases relating to illegal logging
were reported, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official announced that the administration will launch a
crackdown on illegal logging with police and law enforcement
officers from several central departments.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the farmland reclaimed since 1994, which was
previously woodland, must be used for re-planting trees before
2000.
</P>
<P>
Rampant logging has caused massive soil erosion along the
Yangtze River and other major rivers, which was a key factor that
triggered the deluge this summer.

<P>
KUNMING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, concluded a
10-day tour today in Southwest China's Yunnan Province to inspect
the enforcement of agricultural law.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the law-making body, joined the tour.
</P>
<P>
According to the inspection team, local governments and farmers
have benefited a great deal from enacting the Agriculture Law and
the Law on Spreading Agricultural Technologies.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have abolished 1,500 illegal projects
that over-burdened farmers economically in accordance with the
law, the team said.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team also noted that, by ensuring investments
provided for by the law, the province has improved its
agricultural infrastructure, benefited from good harvests for 10
consecutive years, and increased farmers' income accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province's grain output exceeded 12
million tons in 1997, 18.9 percent more than five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, the team told the provincial government that more
efforts are needed to modernize and industrialize its farming
business to bring prosperity to underdeveloped areas in the
province, while close attention should be paid to the environment

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch Massive Military Maneuver Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Following its threat to take
revenge on the Afghan Taliban militia, Iran announced Saturday to
launch its biggest military maneuver involving 200,000 troops near
its eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, the army's commander of
land forces Abdolali Pourshasb said that 40 percent of the three
divisions have been deployed along the border during the past
month under the command of supreme leader and Commander-in-Chief
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops would remain in the border areas after the
week-long maneuver, which would be carried out in an area of 5,000
square kilometers in the northeastern province of Khorasan and the
southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
He said the maneuver, code-named Zoulfaqar 2, would start at
the end of September. The participating troops which include the
elite forces, armored, mechanized and artillery units would stage
the exercises with the support of the air force.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second massive maneuver that Iran has staged
since early August when tensions erupted between Iran and the
Afghan Taliban militia over the fate of 11 Iranian diplomats
missing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran recently announced that nine of the Iranian diplomats who
worked in the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif in northern
Afghanistan were killed when Taliban took over the city on August
8. It added that two of the diplomats escaped the Taliban killing,
but Taliban said all the Iranian diplomats were dead.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps held a
maneuver with the participation of 70,000 troops in Khorasan
province and then deployed the troops in the area to build up
pressure on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Pourshasb termed the Zoulfaqar 2 maneuver as a "routine
military exercise" without any intention to pose threat to any
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of the maneuver was to guarantee
security and stability in the border areas and defend the
country's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Pourshasb ruled out any possible conflict with the Taliban
during the maneuver. But he warned that if Iran feels any threat,
the army would give strong response to it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Iranian army would carry out any order
issued by the country's leaders.

<HEADLINE> International Leprosy Congress Closes in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the 15th
International Leprosy Congress in Beijing were urged today to work
together to eliminate leprosy in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The goal of creating a world without leprosy is unlikely in the
foreseeable future, but experts and social workers all over the
world should plan realistic actions which could solve problems
related to leprosy, both medical and social, said Yo Yuasa,
president of the International Leprosy Association at today's
closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"With the first congress in Berlin in 1897, the modern fight
against leprosy had started and made noteworthy progress, bringing
us to where we stand now," Yuasa said. "With this 15th congress in
Beijing we are starting the second century of our fight which
should hopefully take us to our stated goal."
</P>
<P>
He said this congress is "forward-looking" and
"action-oriented." In addition to academic exchanges on the
control and treatment of leprosy, the congress highlighted social
aspects of the disease, aiming to eliminate discrimination against
people affected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
More than 730 foreign and nearly 400 Chinese delegates,
including more than 100 victims of leprosy who have recovered,
attended the six-day congress. The next congress will be held in
Brazil in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the closing ceremony 124 institutions, hospitals and
clinics and more than 200 individuals specializing in leprosy
control were honored by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, about 85 percent of Chinese counties and
cities have lowered the prevalent rate of leprosy below 0.1 per
10,000, and 13 percent of counties and cities were near the
standard, said Cao Ronggui, vice minister of health.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, about 2,000 new leprosy patients were detected
in China per year, and about 200,000 who recovered from the
disease are living in China at present, according to Cao.

<HEADLINE> S. African FM Dismisses Coup Reports in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo Saturday dismissed reports of an attempted
coup in Lesotho as unfounded, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
"It was just some problems in the army itself, it's not a coup
as such. We think the situation is not as bad as earlier
reported," said Nzo, who has been in Mauritius attending a
two-day meeting of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC)'s council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Lesotho Defense Force, Makhula Mosakheng,
resigned on Friday night and brigadier-commander Thibeli had
taken over the running of the army.
</P>
<P>
He also announced on Radio Lesotho the dismissal of 26 senior
officers citing the reason of "the public interest".
</P>
<P>
The sudden resignation followed a day of dramatic events
during which junior officers arrested some senior officers of the
defense force.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said a report into alleged electoral fraud in Lesotho
would be discussed at the SADC annual summit which gets underway
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the report, which was compiled by a three-nation
commission led by South Africa, had not yet been handed to South
African President Nelson Mandela.

CHONGQING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of

environment.
</P>
<P>
The program will use 640 million yuan (80 million U.S. million

Chongqing, with a population of 30 million, is the largest

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updated with casualties hke --Three Wounded by Gunfire in Cambodia Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 12 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
wounded by gunfire as Cambodian government supporters and
opposition protesters clashed Saturday just off Phnom Penh's main
business street, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
A boy and a man in his twenties were wounded in their legs by
gun shots, while another man was bleeding from a chest wound,
after a volley of shots fired by the pro-government demonstrators
near the city's Monivong Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian opposition parties had earlier called off a planned
Sunday protest rally after 5,000 supporters of the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) demonstrated on Saturday, bringing the
worsened tension between the government and opposition into the
sixth day.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's supporters marched through streets in Phnom Penh by
dozens of trucks and held rally in front of the Royal Palace.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who carried sticks and stones and waved
placards supporting the results of the July 26 elections, demanded
the arrest of the two opposition political leaders of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who complained about election
fraud.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh called the demonstration a habitual practice
of Hun Sen's men.
</P>
<P>
"If the government dares arrest me, the bloodshed will continue
and it will be impossible to form a new Assembly and government,"
the prince warned.
</P>
<P>
The prince also said that the opposition has agreed to cancel
its planned mass rally of 20,000 supporters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ease the tension of bloodshed in the capital, we
have decided to postpone our mass demonstration tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats in the
Election, short of the two-thirds required to form a government
alone.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen offered to form a coalition government with FUNCINPEC
and the Sam Rainsy Party, but the offer was turned down by the
opposition. The tension between the two camps badly worsened on
Monday, when riot police dispersed demonstrators by force.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans without national
identity cards will not be employed in any public office across
the country under a new citizenship and immigration control bill
now before Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The bill tabled by Minister of Internal Affairs Tom Butime
this week requires every Ugandan to register with the national
citizenship and immigration board to be issued with an identity
card, the New Vision paper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, any Ugandan citizen who fails to get such a
card without reasonable reasons will be prone to a fine up to
200,000 Shillings (160 U.S. Dollars) or three-month imprisonment
or both.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, did not mention the reasons for issuing
such identity cards.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for acquisition of citizenship, compulsory
registration of all Ugandans, issuance of national identification
numbers and cards to citizens.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said security is one of the main reasons for this
move.

bilateral economic cooperation, especially China's exports to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China has expressed a deep concern
about the regulations signed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture
on Friday, and reserves the right to further reactions.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China opposes trade protectionism of various
forms, the spokesman expressed hope that the United States would
consider the regulations prudently, and that quarantine
departments and experts of both sides would conduct sincere and
effective cooperation in seeking a proper settlement to safeguard
the general situation of the development of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Sino-U.S. trade in recent years has
grown rapidly and the two countries have become important trade
partners.
</P>
<P>
A new development momentum has emerged in bilateral economic
and trade relations, especially after heads of state of the two
countries exchanged visits, the spokesman said, adding that the
maintenance and development of such momentum requires efforts from
both sides.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Extends Voter Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Electoral Commission
has declared that the voter registration period for the
forthcoming local government elections will be extended for
another week due to voter apathy throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with stake-holders in the electoral process in
Lusaka, commission chair-an Bobby Bwalya announced Friday that the
voter registration period which was supposed to end Sunday has
been extended to September 20, government-owned Times of Zambia
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The extension was necessary because of the poor turnout which
has seen only 59,000 people throughout Zambia compared to the
targeted 1.5 million eligible voters, according to Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
He told the gathering that the commission was concerned with
the poor turnout of those registering and implored political
parties, non-governmental organizations and other pressure groups
to go flat out to educate the people on the importance of voting.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya said according to the 1996 register, the country had
2.2 million registered voters and that additional 1.5 million
voters are expected to be registered this year, bringing the
total to 3.7 million out of the country's 4.3 million eligible
voters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the opposition parties including the United National
Independence Party (UNIP) welcomed the extension of the voter
registration period and have pledged to step up civic campaigns
to educate members on the importance of registration.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia Democratic Congress, one of the main
opposition parties, did not attend the meeting and said Friday
that it would not participate in any election organized by the
ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy govmrnment.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Massing Troops to Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has denied massing
troops to the disputed Bakassi Peninsula on its border with
Cameroun, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters said in a statement in Lagos Friday
that reports to the effect was "misleading and untrue", adding
that Nigeria was still resolved to settle the dispute through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby state categorically that Nigeria has not sent any
fresh troops to Bakassi of recent. We stand by our statement last
Tuesday that we will not do anything to escalate tension in
Bakassi, and will continue to seek peaceful means to resolve the
Bakassi issue," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that "Nigeria will maintain this position because we
believe that with Cameroun's cooperation, the situation could be
settled peacefully."
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters in a statement Tuesday accused
Cameroun of producing tension in the disputed area by deploying
more troops last week.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun, however, has denied the accusation and affirmed its
commitment to peaceful co-existence with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed for several times in the
last few years over the sovereignty of the oil-rich peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was filed to the International Court of Justice at
Hague by Cameroun in 1994, to the objection of Nigeria. The court
ruled in June 1998 that it has the jurisdiction over the case and
requested Nigeria to file its defense by March 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Cancels Rice Order From Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has canceled an
order for 400,000 tons of rice from Thailand, citing high price as
the reason, a source at Thailand's Rice Exporters' Association
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will call a bid instead on Monday and Tuesday for
600,000 tons of rice from international sources.
</P>
<P>
Thailand might yet win the deal because supplies from other
countries are limited, said the source, who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that up to 77 rice exporters from China,
Vietnam, India and Thailand were expected to enter the bid. About
10 Thai rice companies were expected to bid for the deal.
</P>
<P>
The source said he was confident that for such a large amount,
Thai exporters would have an edge over most potential sellers who
had limited supply. Vietnam last month announced controls on rice
exports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Ministry of Food and Horticulture had signed a
memorandum of understanding last month to purchase a total of
500,000 tons of rice from Thailand. Of the total, 400,000 tons
worth more than 5 billion baht (125 million U.S. dollars) would be
paid for in cash. The remaining 100,000 tons would be paid for
over three years. However, a contract was signed later only for
the 100,000 ton portion of the order.
</P>
<P>
The source said he did not believe the price the Thai
government had quoted to Indonesia, about 280 dollars per ton, was
too high. He said Indonesia might seek credit terms.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Indonesia might not get its rice any cheaper
next week, as the rice was trading at 285-287 dollars per ton.

LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- English premier league club
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has revealed he has major concerns
about the possibility of new owners taking control of the team.
</P>
<P>
London-based media company Carlton have been linked with a 275
million pounds buy-out of the Highbury giants.
</P>
<P>
But Wenger, who has yet to sign a two-year extension to his
contract, is worried that business-oriented directors are
"impatient" and can interfere with the playing side of the club.
</P>
<P>
And he hinted he might even quit the Gunners if a new board
made his job more difficult, according to local reports on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If you are having problems you must have patience," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's not easy if you don't know football.
</P>
<P>
"The impatience has grown already and people coming in might
become even more impatient, " he added.

<HEADLINE> High Tide in Bay of Bengal Slows Recession of Waters: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- An unusually high tide in the
Bay of Bengal, whipped up by a low, has held back floods in
Bangladesh from receding, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The high tides have slowed recession of floods in the country
despite falling trend in some rivers contributing to the deluge,
the Daily Star Saturday quoted Sharif Rafiqul Islam, executive
engineer of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Since the full moon occurred on September 5, the sea has been
experiencing an unusual surge which provided a sort of barrier to
the flood water rolling into the Bay," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the tide ebbs in two or three days after the full
noon, but "we are surprised at the exception," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tide height was measured at Changpur, where the Ganges and
the Brahmaputra (rivers) join the Meghna river before going down
to the Bay.
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday (September 10), the high tide was measured at a
record of 5.52 meters above the mean sea level and the low tide
was 4.72 meters, slightly less the highest ever recorded level of
4.86 meters during the 1998 floods," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What caused the sea to behave unusually still remained
unknown," he said. "This is under investigation...but we seem to
be nowhere near a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
The high tide could been triggered by the "low" which formed
over the Bay of Bengal on September 8, reactivating the monsoon
before moving towards the northwestern Indian state of Uttar
Pradesh, a senior meteorologist stated.
</P>
<P>
"It (the low) triggered heavy pressure on the tide level
inundating low areas on the coasts which were not flooded," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But this is not uncommon," he said, adding that the country
experienced a similar situation during the monsoon in 1995 when
heavy wind and high tide pushed surges further inland of Chandpur
for three days.
</P>
<P>
Barring heavy rainfall, the situation would improve gradually,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Normally it takes for usual monsoon floods up to 20 days to
recede, going down the Meghna estuary into the Bay," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Everything depends on the rains. If there is no further
rainfall in the upper catchment areas of the Ganges and the
Brahmaputra, both of which flow from India, the floods would start
receding from the next cycle of moon, some 20 days from now,"
another flood expert said.
</P>
<P>
The tide situation was also influenced by the rush of water
from the major rivers, keeping the water stagnant," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Supporters Hold Mass Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian opposition
parties have called off a planned Sunday protest rally after 5,000
supporters of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) demonstrated on
Saturday, bringing the worsened tension between the government and
opposition into the sixth day.
</P>
<P>
The Hun Sen supporters marched through streets in Phnom Penh by
several dozens of trucks and held rally in front of the Royal
Palace.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who carried sticks and stones and waved
placards supporting the results of the July 26 elections, demanded
the arrest of the two opposition political leaders of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who complained about election
fraud.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh called the demonstration a habitual practice
of Hun Sen's men.
</P>
<P>
"If the government dares arrest me, the bloodshed will continue
and it will be impossible to form a new Assembly and government,"
the prince warned.
</P>
<P>
The prince also said that the opposition has agreed to cancel
its planned mass rally of 20,000 supporters on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ease the tension of bloodshed in the capital, we
have decided to postpone our mass demonstration tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won 64 of the 122 National Assembly seats in the
Election, short of the two-thirds required to form a government
alone.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen offered to form a coalition government with FUNCINPEC
and the Sam Rainsy Party, but the offer was turned down by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two camps badly worsened on Monday,
when riot police dispersed demonstrators by force. One was killed
and several wounded in the conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and India
formed a joint technical committee Saturday to identify and
implement science and technology projects that could benefit both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up immediately after the two countries
signed an agreement on cooperation in science and technology,
marking the first formal cooperation in the area.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by Malaysian Science, Technology
and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding and Indian Human Resource
Development and Science and Technology Minister Murali Manohar
Joshi.
</P>
<P>
Law said the committee comprising officials from both countries
would focus on cooperation in implementing projects related to
weather forecasting, space technology, medicinal plant and
traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
"India has very advanced technology in weather monitoring and
aerospace that we can learn from," he told reporters after the
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said India is also keen to join Malaysia in developing the
information technology sector and participate in the Multimedia
Super Corridor.
</P>
<P>
Joshi said India would also cooperate with Malaysia in finding
the best ways to safeguard gene materials found in the diverse
animal and plant species in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue is very crucial because some of the valuable
plant and animal parts and extracts have been patented by
foreigners under their country's legislation.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Growth Goes Down in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- After an increase of 5.4
percent from April to June, the first quarter of India's fiscal
year 1998-99, the country's industrial growth fell sharply in July
to 1.7 percent from 8.2 percent the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Data released Friday by the Central Statistical Organization
(CSO) showed that industrial growth in the first four months from
April to July of the current year has slipped to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which accounts for three-fourths of
the latest estimate of the Index of Industrial Production, grew by
3.7 percent during the April to July period as compared to a 5.6
percent growth achieved a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The sector only increased by 1.2 percent in July against 8.5
percent in the same month last year while it grew by 5.5 percent
in the first quarter of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
CSO said the slump in the manufacturing sector in July could be
attributed to the negative growth in consumer goods as well as the
lower rate of growth in basic and intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
The growth of electricity, which had recorded a low 6.2 percent
cumulative growth a year ago, fell to 9.9 percent in the first
four months compared to 10.2 percent in the April-June period this
year.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector reversed the negative 0.3 percent growth in
the first quarter by posting a 2.9 percent growth in July, thereby
taking the cumulative growth in April-July to 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The all-important capital goods sector grew by 6.8 percent in
July to post a cumulative growth of 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods recorded a negative growth of 0.5 percent in the
month due mainly to a 4.7 percent fall in consumer durables
segment, popularly known as the white goods sector.
</P>
<P>
Non-durable consumer goods grew by a marginal 0.7 percent
during the month, posting a cumulative growth of 2.5 percent in
April-July period against a negative 1.5 percent growth in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among industry groups, metal products and parts went up by 24.8
percent followed by paper and paper products with 14.2 percent.
The worst performer was cotton textiles with a negative growth
rate of 14.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Prisoners Make Furniture, Crafts With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Inmates in a Ugandan prison
has made furniture, arts and crafts out of water hyacinth which
has been a big hazard to transportation, fishing activities and
power generation.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-U.S.-Dollar water hyacinth utilization project,
which is located in Luzira Maximum Security Prison near Kampala,
was funded by the Global Environment Facility through the United
Nations Development Program, the Monitor daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners there reportedly scoop the weed from the lake,
slice it up and separate the stalk from the roots and leaves. The
stalk is sun dried and woven into beautiful chairs, stools, mats,
carpets, hand-bags and baskets for sale.
</P>
<P>
William Omaria, the state minister for internal affairs, was
quoted as saying he is satisfied with this project and calling on
the facilitators to extend the project to up-countryrs prisons such as
Jinja and Kigo where the weed is in abundance.
</P>
<P>
The prison also has a biogas production project, which
generates energy used in cooking at the prison. The gas is said
to have been produced from the leaves and roots of the water
hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of Uganda's shore of Lake Victoria is covered
with the weed. The country is now using mechanical means to
remove the weed from the lake surface which has been affecting
fish catch and transport.

<HEADLINE> Kenya in Bid to Ease Interest Rate Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Interest rates in general
declined in the Kenyan money market in the past two months partly
due to governmental efforts, according to the September issue of
the Monthly Economic Review by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
Interest rate on the 91-days Treasury bill declined for the
fourth consecutive month to 23.7 percent in August from 24.7
percent in July, said the review available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Inter-bank interest rate declined further to 17.3 percent in
July from 21.7 percent in June 1998 following a reduction in
government's borrowing requirement that allowed some liquidity to
be released from Treasury bills redemption.
</P>
<P>
7 Interest on three months of deposits with commercial banks
eased in line with the downward trend in the Treasury bill
interest rate to 19.9 percent in July from 21.2 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in the review that interest rates,
which are still high enough to discourage investment, are
expected to continue declining mainly on account of improved
government's fiscal positions.
</P>
<P>
The bank also announced that it is carrying out tough action
to ease the interest rate burden. The measures range from cutting
public spending and governmet domestic borrowing to improve
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts, the government is ready to hold talks
with the IMF team on the rsumption of IMF's aid loans later this
month.
</P>
<P>
More commercial courts have been established to speed up the
process of recovering banking institution's bad debts.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has lowered the cash ratio by two percentage
points to 13 percent since July 1998 to reduce the interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The CBK review blamed a series of factors for the current
relatively high level of real interest rates in the eastern
African country. They are:
</P>
<P>
-- Excessive demand for credit in the money market mainly
from domestic borrowing to finance the government deficit.
</P>
<P>
-- The past high interest rates associated with the massive
liquidity mop-up in 1994 following the financial infractions of
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
-- Large portfolio of non-performing loans that result from
imprudent lending practices and the fact that many Kenyans borrow
money but fail to service debt. The judicial system is also slow
in resolving commercial cases.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, non-performing loans now stand at around 20
percent of the total advances by the banks, leading the banks to
charge high interest rates even on new loans to cover for
possible defaulting on loan repayments.
</P>
<P>
-- Domination of loans market by a few institutions that
stifle competition. Out of the 55 commercial banks in Kenya, only
10 banks control more than 70 percent of total deposits and more
than 65 percent of the loans.
</P>
<P>
-- Low supply of loanable funds from the external sources is
mainly due to the ripple effects of the suspension of the
multi-million-Dollar aid loans by the International Monetary Fund
mid last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Expectation of higher than actual inflation in line with
the high inflation rates in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Slows Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The increase in inflation
in Kenya over the past three months slowed down in August
following the sustained controled monetary expansion, stability
in the Shilling exchange rate and better supplies of basic foods.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to continue declining in Kenya in the
coming months thanks to prudent monetary policies and improved
supply of basic goods, according to the September issue of the
Monthly Economic Review by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
7 The decline in the international prices of imports,
particularly oil, that has also contributed to slowdown in
inflation, said the review.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in inflation was seen in all kinds of food,
fuel and power, and miscellaneous goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Month-on-month inflation declined to 9.8 percent in August
from 11.4 percent in July, data from the CBK review indicate.
</P>
<P>
7 Average annual inflation declined to 8.4 percent from 8.6
percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
The three-month overall annualized inflation fell to negative
13.6 percent in August from 10.4 percent in July. Three-month
annualized underlying inflation also remained low at 0.3 percent
in August.
</P>
<P>
The underlying average annual inflation however increased to
9.1 percent from 8.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The down in the overall inflation over last month was more
pronounced in the goods and services purchased by the lower
rather than by the middle and upper income groups, said the CBK
review.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it will make more efforts to reduce the
underlying month-on-month inflation to less than five percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the planned measures are to maintain annual expansion
in broad money supply in the year to June, 1999 at below 10
percent and to continue carrying out tight fiscal policies.

<HEADLINE> Experts Divergent on E-commerce Definition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Experts who met in
Austin, Texas this week to discuss issues concerning e-commerce
could not reach consensus on the definition of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Paul Resnick, an associate professor at the University of
Michigan, said that e-commerce should be narrowly focused on
transactions over computer networks, reported Techweb Friday.
</P>
<P>
But James McAndrews, a researcher with the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, said that e-commerce also includes credit card
transactions at local grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
"Electronic commerce is a larger category than just Web-based
commerce," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the customer goes into the store to purchase, he said,
the transaction is recorded electronically.
</P>
<P>
A software developer agreed with the wider scope of that
definition, saying, "It's everything binary. We are taking our
economy and digitizing it."
</P>
<P>
Kevin Koym, president of the software company Development
System Development, also supported the definition with wider
scope, saying e-commerce is not just the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it includes everything from learning about products
online and electronic transactions to online customer-service and
support, said Koym.
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation meeting, sponsored by the
Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of
Texas, was aimed to develop a strategy for studying e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Forty people, including computer scientists, attorneys,
economists as well as government officials and industry
researchers, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Sending Aircrafts to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday denied it
has dispatched military and civilian aircrafts to Bamyan, northern
Afghanistan, to help the Shiite Muslims who are fighting with the
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Iran News quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying that the reports on the
landing of Iranian military and civilian planes at the Bamyan
airport "are false."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that considering the dire situation of innocent
men, women and children of Bamyan that is under the siege of the
Taliban forces, Iran would extend every possible humanitarian aid
to them.
</P>
<P>
The reports on Iran's dispatch of aircraft to Afghanistan came
after fierce fighting erupted in Bamyan between the Taliban and
its rival the Northern Alliance led by the ousted president
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been threatening to take revenge on the Taliban forces
for their killing of nine Iranian diplomats based in Mazari
Sharif, northern Afghanistan. The Taliban on August 8 took over
the city and occupied the Iranian consulate, where 11 Iranian
diplomats worked.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Iran's powerful State Expediency Council Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the former president, warned Friday that Iran would
carry out a well-designed revenge plan with "clear objectives" at
an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here speculated it is a highly possible for Iran to
launch a military strike on the Taliban, as the country is
continuing its military buildup along the eastern border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have deployed 70,000
troops in the northeastern border province of Khorasan since early

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China's State Postal Bureau
and the postal service department of France today jointly issued a
set of two stamps, "the Palace Museum and the Louvre Museum."
</P>
<P>
This is the 10th set of stamps that was issued by China and a
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The two stamps feature the Palace Museum in Beijing and the
Louvre Museum in Paris, two ancient architectural structures.
</P>
<P>
Claude Adgreotto, designer of the stamps, used the lion images
at the Hall of Supreme Harmony, one of the most spectacular
buildings in the Palance Museum, and at the Louvre Museum.

in ancient times, represents the commitment made by the Chinese
and French Governments to preserving cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, is the
largest and best preserved architectural group in China.

<P>
The downgraded banks were Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Thai
Farmers Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Military Bank. A major
Thai financial institution, the Industrial Finance Corporation of
Thailand, was also downgraded.
</P>
<P>
"Moody's noted that the stability of Thailand's banking system
continues to be undermined by the financial crisis, as escalating
loan loses erode bank's capital and earnings," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The extreme fragility of the system inevitably threatens even
those banks that have raised considerable amounts of new capital
this year -- Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said even those banks needed to gain significant new
capital to fully restore solvency.
</P>
<P>
However, Moody's Investors Service placed the long-term debt
and financial strength ratings of the Bank of Asia on review for a
possible upgrade. The decision reflected the acquisition of a
majority interest in the bank by ABN Amro of the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Refusal to Taiwan Move at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that any act that
contradicts the purpose and principles of the U.N. Charter and
relevant resolutions of the U.N. General Assembly and that
interferes in the internal affairs of other countries is bound to
meet opposition from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark after the General Committee of the on-going
U.N. General Assembly refused again on September 11 the proposal
by a small group of countries asking for listing so-called
Taiwan's representation to the U.N. on the agenda of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This has fully demonstrated the firm will of the vast majority
of the U.N. member states to safeguard the U.N. Charter, the
U.N. General Assembly's Resolution 2758 and the norms of
international law, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the Resolution 2758 passed by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1971 has resolved the issue of representation of China
in the U.N. in a just, thorough and comprehensive way, and Taiwan,
as a province of China, lacks qualification necessary for
U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities' attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" in the U.N. can not gain support and are doomed
to failure, noted Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely advise that the countries concerned including
Nicaragua, in consideration of their long-term interest, not be
used by the Taiwan authorities again in their attempt to split
China, and not harm the sentiments of the Chinese people again by
standing in opposition to the vast majority of U.N. member states,
 which runs counter to the historical trend", said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the just cause of the Chinese
government and people to safeguard the country's sovereignty and
integrity will continue to win the understanding and support from
the governments of most U.N. member states and people around the
world, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Offers Loan for Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China will grant
a loan of 625 million yuan to Tianjin to build an expressway,
according to an agreement signed here this week.
</P>
<P>
The investment for the construction of the road is 1.1 billion
yuan, which would be raised from firms in and out of China through
Hong Kong-based Peregrine Investment Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
However, the part of investment to be raised from abroad did
not come after Peregrine went bankrupt in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis. And the project had to stop due to a lack of
funds. The bank decided to offer a helping hand after careful
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yulan, a leading bank official, said the bank will
continue to offer loans for projects in the fields of
infrastructure, transportation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The four-lane expressway will link downtown Tianjin with the
Tianjin Harbor and the Binhai District at a nearby development
zone. It will be able to accommodate 5,000-to-6,000 motor vehicles
an hour.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed in 2000, it will take half an
hour to travel between Tianjin's city proper and the development
zone, said a local government official.

<HEADLINE> Bonded Warehouse in Northeast China's Shenyang Coty to be Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The first bonded warehouse
for Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, will
be built in the city's high-tech development zone with approval
from the China General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The bonded warehouse will give tax breaks on imported materials
needed by processing enterprises and overseas-financed companies
in China for manufacturing export products.
</P>
<P>
This warehouse, the only one approved by the General
Administration of Customs in Shenyang, will have an area of 66,000
square meters and will cost 11 million yuan. It will be completed
and operational by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
As a major economic, transportation and cultural city of
northeast China, Shenyang has more than 500 companies that have
been given autonomy to organize exports independently, with a
combined trade volume of one-billion U.S. dollars. Half of this
consists of re-exports made with client-supplied or imported
materials.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the establishment of the bonded warehouse will
help advance the city's foreign trade by providing
overseas-financed enterprises, and export commodity processing
enterprises, with simplified tariff procedures.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani Asks Iran to Arm Refugees Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's deposed
President Burhanuddin Rabbani has asked Iran to arm the Afghan
refugees in Iran to fight against the Taliban militia, local daily
Iran News reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily, Rabbani said that his
government expected Iran to provide proper facilities to the
Afghan refugees in Iran so that they would be able to return to
their country to join the "national-religious Jihad (holy war)
against the enemies of the country".
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal if Tehran accepted his demand. But local
observers said that the Iranian government is considering the
proposal as it has vowed to avenge the Taliban's killing of
several Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that nine Iranian diplomats working in its consulate
in Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan, were killed by the
Taliban on August 8 when the Taliban forces took over the city.
</P>
<P>
Iran said only two other Iranian diplomats succeeded in
escaping the massacre, while Taliban on Friday said that all the
11 Iranian diplomats were dead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem is scheduled to
arrive here Saturday afternoon to consult with Iranian officials
about the latest development in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that Cem's talks in Tehran would focus on
the joint efforts of Turkey and Iran to help Rabbani's government
prevent the Taliban from taking over whole Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Rabbani-led government was ousted in 1996, and the Taliban
forces have taken over most of the country. However, the
international community still considers Rabbani as the legitimate
ruler of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the possibility of an armed conflict between the
Taliban and Iran, Rabbani stated that "it is the natural right of
any country to adopt defensive measures if that country's
territories are threatened."
</P>
<P>
But he noted that Iran had no intention to have a military
conflict with the Taliban, and Taliban's supporters should not do
anything which might deteriorate the situation. He was apparently
referring to Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates which
support and recognize the Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
He also urged international bodies, the United Nations and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference in particular, to become
more actively involved in resolving the Afghan issue.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Credit Rating Downgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- International credit
rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's has downgraded the outlook for
New Zealand's credit rating.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P affirmed this week its main AA+ long-term foreign currency
rating for New Zealand but changed the outlook to negative from
stable, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The ratings system has three levels: the outlook, which may be
positive, stable or negative; credit watch for a possible change
of rating; and the decision itself.
</P>
<P>
The downgrade absorbed the New Zealand government's latest
budget statement this week. The New Zealand Treasury in an
economic forecast predicted the country's economic growth of
negative 0.5 percent in the year to March 1999. It is also
forecast that the New Zealand government will have a deficit of
700 million NZ dollars in 1999-2000 and 300 million NZ dollars the
year after.
</P>
<P>
While downgrading the outlook for New Zealand's credit rating,
S&AMP;P cited uncertainty about New Zealand government's policy
because the National Party, the ruling party in the government,
lacks a secure parliamentary majority and might lose power in the
next election. It also cited proximity to East Asia's severe
recession, a deterioration in New Zealand government's budget and
persistent balance of payments pressures.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that rival agency Moody's Investor Services has
its AA1 rating of New Zealand under review for a possible
downgrade.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's credit rating is second behind AAA which applies
to only 12 countries out of 76 rated by S&AMP;P.

government took over the state power in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The government has formed the Progress of Border Areas and
National Races and Development Affairs Ministry and the Central
Committee for Development of Border Areas and National Races to
help develop the economy, social conditions and transport of
border areas, while conserving the traditions and culture and
literature of nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government has increased investment in the border
areas' development projects.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the government has spent more
than 9.51 billion kyats (about 31.7 million U.S. dollars) so far
for the projects of building roads, bridges, hospitals,
dispensaries, schools, irrigation facilities, generators, TV
retransmission stations and communication links in the regions.
</P>
<P>
The government has also designated the 1998-99 fiscal year
which began in April as the year of roads and bridges to
facilitate road links among villages and the rural and the urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the development of the border areas, the
government also gives more priorities to controlling narcotic
drugs. Myanmar has been able to turn the Mongla region in eastern
Shan state into an opium-free zone and efforts are being made to
bring about more similar zones. The country plans to totally
eliminate poppy cultivation in 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Defense Ministers Meeting on Congo Conflict Reaches No Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The three-day meeting of
defense ministers of seven African countries ended at 02:30 a.m.
(local time) Saturday, with no agreement reached on the
cease-fire and withdrawal of foreign troops from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was attended by defense ministers of
Angola, the DRC, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe as
well as officials and representatives of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations, was held in Addis
Ababa in accordance with the mandate given to it by the second
summit at Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The task of the defense ministers meeting was to establish the
modalities for effecting an immediate cease-fire and a mechanism
for monitoring compliance with the cease-fire provisions,
especially those relating to the withdrawal of foreign forces
from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
After its opening session on Thursday afternoon, the meeting
entered closed session immediately. The ministers resumed
their meeting at 10:30 p.m. Friday to discuss the draft modalities
for a cease-fire agreement but their views were divergent on the
draft. The delegations from Rwanda and Uganda left the meeting
hall around 01:00 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by OAU here on Saturday morning said:
"The ministers worked out draft modalities for a cease-fire
agreement in the DRC. The outcome of their deliberations will be
submitted to their respective governments."
</P>
<P>
"Considering that this is a continuing and intense process,"
the statement said that "more consultations need to be undertaken."

<HEADLINE> Foodstocks Enough, Stop Panic Buying: Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina urged the people to refrain from panic buying of
rice, saying the foodstocks in the country are enough and imports
of sufficient amounts of rice have been made.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for worries, we have got sufficient stock
of rice and more foodgrains are in the pipeline from various
external sources to tackle any situation," she said while
addressing a rally held Friday in the southeast district of
Narayanganj, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has made all arrangements for importing
required quantities of food, including rice," she told the
gathering, citing that some people in the capital had
unnecessarily gone on panic-buying of rice.
</P>
<P>
The government has already appealed to donors for aid and the
responses from different countries and agencies have been
positive, she added.
</P>
<P>
This year's flood has surpassed the records of the 1988 deluge
in terms of intensity and devastation, the prime minister
observed, saying that relief could not be reached everywhere as a
large number of roads have been damaged by flood.
</P>
<P>
However, she assured that relief supplies, including
foodstuffs, were being airdropped to the inaccessible, remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
The over two-month-long flood, which is still going on and
deteriorating further in a number of districts in the country, has
already affected over 30 million people in 47 districts of the
country's 64 districts, with the death toll rising to 843 so far.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Stock Markets Register Strong Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro stock exchanges registered Friday gains of 13.39 and 11.6
percent at the close of their transactions, thanks to a strong
rise of the nation's interbank rate from the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, the biggest in Latin America,
registered 5,398 points and traded 524.8 million U.S. dollars,
while the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange registered 18.412 points
and traded 58.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The strong gains were reported in the Brazilian stock markets
after they had registered Thursday record losses of 15.2 percent
and 15.9 percent respectively in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange president Alberto Reis said that
all this can be attributed mainly to the rise in the annual
interbank rate from the Central Bank of Brazil, announced late
Thursday night, which went from 29.75 percent to 49.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank had previously raised the interbank rate from
19 percent to 29.75 percent aiming at preventing speculative
operations and stopping the outflow of foreign currency.

<HEADLINE> Canada Condemns Taliban for Murdering Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada Friday condemned the
Taliban in Afghanistan for the murder of nine Iranian diplomats in
the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The killing of these Iranian officials demonstrates blatant
disregard of international law, and the Taliban cannot be excused for
its failure to control its soldiers," said Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
"Canada condemns these actions and any other forms of violence
against individuals in Afghanistan," added the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated Canada's support for the United Nations
Security Council's call for an urgent investigation into these
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy emphasized that "the Afghan crisis must be resolved by
peaceful means and that neighboring states must refrain from any
actions which could exacerbate the situation."
</P>
<P>
After having repeatedly denied any knowledge of their
whereabouts, the Taliban admitted Thursday that its military
forces had killed the missing Iranians. The Taliban leadership
claimed that its soldiers committed the murders on their own and
without any orders.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Break Obstacles Run World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese women broke
the world record in the 500m obstacles run today here, sending
the host team to the top ranking in the CISM 46th Military
Pentathlon World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Shen Liping clocked two minutes 20.9 seconds, beating the
previous mark of 2:23.6 set by Denmark's Heidi Olsen last year in
Sweden and finishing first in the second day of the seven-day
competition.
</P>
<P>
Wen Yu started the record-breaking spree with a time of 2:23.1
and finished second, while four-time world champion Wang Lianying
ran at 2:23.4 for third.
</P>
<P>
China, who finished fourth yesterday after the shooting event,
took the lead in the women's team competition with 6,516.6
points, followed by Sweden with 6,310.1 and Denmark, 237.3 points
less than the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Wang took the leading place in the individual competition with
2,207.2 points after two disciplines, with Wu second on 2,196.7.
Liselotte Freuler of Switzerland was third with 2,151.2 points.
</P>
<P>
"I ran even faster in the training," Shen said. "But I have to
save the energy for the following competitions."
</P>
<P>
China's team leader Jiao Liming said: "I'm very happy but not
surprised because they've done it in the training. There's only
one regret that Wu Jinfeng, who ran the fastest in training,
didn't not finish the record-beating day."
</P>
<P>
Wu tumbled just before the finish and placed fourth with
2:24.9.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are magnificent," Denmark coach Dennis Massesson
said. "Undoubtedly, they're the best."

<HEADLINE> Round-up: S.Korea's Economic Sluggishness Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean economy has
plunged into a deeper recession as gross domestic product (GDP)
and domestic consumption contracted sharply in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The poor economic performance was blamed for a sharp fall in
both consumption and facility investment in the wake of the
financial turmoil, said the Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Deepening sluggishness in domestic demand has gloomed the
prospects of the country's early economic recovery as economic
indicators related to production, consumption and investment
showed extremely poor results last month.
</P>
<P>
The nation has seen negative economic growth for seven months
in a row since January this year when output growth nosedived to
minus 10.8 percent from three percent last December.
</P>
<P>
Under a report on last month's industrial activity released by
the National Statistics Office, industrial production dived 12.9
percent in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea said in a report that the
country's economy sank by 6.4 percent in the first half of this
year while the GNP contracted by five percent and 7.6 percent in
the first and second quarters respectively, the worst setback in
the past 45 years.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption fell 11.9 percent due to wage cuts and
mass layoffs while facility investment plummeted 46.7 percent from
a year before.
</P>
<P>
Although the nation's export rose 20.9 percent, analysts warned
that export grow rate will decline for the rest of this year as
imports plummeted 23.7 percent in the first six months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The production of motor vehicles fell 45.4 percent in July from
a year earlier, partly affected by labor strike at Hyundai Motor
Corporation while output of machinery equipment and assembled
metals plunged 39.5 and 29.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Rapidly cooling domestic demand arising form pay cuts and
layoffs was the key reason behind weakening industrial activity in
the first half of 1998, said the Ministry of Finance and Economy.
</P>
<P>
Producers inventory contracted 7.8 percent in July as makers of
automobiles, machinery equipment and other domestic
demand-oriented goods trimmed production in the face of poor
domestic sales while wholesale and retail sales dropped 17.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The economic slump has become increasingly aggravated as
domestic demand has been sliding steeply due to plunging
consumption and investment as well as a slowdown in exports of
South Korean goods," said Lee Seong-tae, director of the research
department of the central Bank of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the economy will deteriorate in the
second half of this year as there is no sign of improvement.
</P>
<P>
They said exports, a long-time locomotive for South Korea's
rapid economic growth, is expected to dwindle in the second six
months of this year due to the weakening Asian markets and
decreasing import of material.
</P>
<P>
Government officials predicted that the economy will shrink
seven percent this year while some even forecast that the GDP
growth rate will be a negative 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government announced last week a package of
monetary and fiscal measures to revitalize the rapidly cooling
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The package includes taking a flexible approach toward money
supply, expanding credit guarantees for small and mediumed sized
enterprises, exporters and housing builders and increasing
consumer financing instruments for buyers of houses and other
durable goods.
</P>
<P>
This package apparently came in response to a mounting fear
that the economy was dragged into deeper water by austere measures
imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last December,
when the nation signed an agreement with monetary body for a resue
loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after suffering a financial crisis
caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Party Expresses Anguish at Cruel Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF) has expressed outrage and anguish at the
cruel killing of P. Sivapalan, mayor of Jaffna, in a bomb
explosion in the city Friday, reports reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sivapalan displayed extraordinary commitment to democratic
values and public service by responding to the request to succeed
former mayor Yogeswaran who was assassinated in May this year, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, Sivapalan was sworn in as mayor of Jaffna,
Sri Lanka's Northern Province capital, over 400 kilometers from
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
He was the legal secretary of the TULF which got the largest
number of seats in the Jaffna Municipal Council in local elections
held in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has been fighting a
war for independence since 1983, has rejected the January
elections on Jaffna Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Repatriated From Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 12 (Xinhua)-- Border police in Fujian
Province in east China recently accepted 225 illegal emmigrants
repatriated from Mexico and redoubled efforts to search for
"snake-heads", or groups which organize illegal border crossings.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrates, 212 males and 13 females seeking to
find employment in the United States, were swindled between
1996-1997.
</P>
<P>
The individuals, each payed between 35,000-40,000 US dollars,
were subjected to harsh conditions while shuttling through a
number of ports prior to arriving in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
They were eventually arrested at the U.S.-Mexican border,
according to Fujian police officials who said the intensified
battle against illegal emigration introduced early last year has
reduced the number of people involved in related activities by
about 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Floods Kill 40 in Mexico's Chiaps State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The biggest rainstorm in
Mexico within 40 years swept its southern state of Chiapas,
killing at least 40 people, victimizing more than 50,000 people
and causing enormous damage, the National Water Commission (CNA)
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, during the past 10 days, most areas in
the state were hit by a rainfall of 926.2 millimeters with daily
rainfall in some provinces reaching 341.9 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
The rains caused mountain torrents, mud-rock flows and floods,
which destroyed many villages, towns, roads and bridges, and cut
off regional communication and electricity in many localities.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon has inspected
some affected areas and helped direct the rescue work. Huge amount
of relief materials and rescue workers have been sent to the
afflicted areas.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring country Guatemala allowed Mexican rescuing vehicles
to pass its border freely.
</P>
<P>
Mexican ecologists said vast destruction of vegetation was one
of the causes of the rainstorms. From 1976 to 1991, 905,000
hectares of vegetation in Chiapas have been destroyed, which
cleared the way for the floods.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Investigation into Killings of Iranians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday called for an urgent investigation into the killings of nine
Iranian diplomats in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We join with other members of the United Nations Security
Council in calling for an urgent investigation into these crimes
so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice," State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The killing of nine Iranian diplomats was announced by
Afghanistan's Taliban militia on Thursday, which said its
fighters, acting without order, had killed nine of 11 Iranian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Since the disappearance of the 11 Iranian diplomats in
Afghanistan, Iran has been stepping up a huge military military
buildup on the border between the two countries, and asked the
United Nations to condemn the killings. It also demanded the
arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying for the past year to improve
relations with Iran while it has become more hostile toward the
Taliban since the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
which it alleged was masterminded by exiled Saudi financier Osama
bin Laden who now lived in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President on Jaffna Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga said Friday the bomb that killed Jaffna
Mayor was targeted not only at him but also at the whole Tamil
community.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a press release issued Friday night that
the death of Jaffna Mayor Ponnuthurai Sivapalan, several army and
police officers and civilians in a bomb explosion earlier Friday
in Jaffna city has shocked all those who cherish peace.
</P>
<P>
The release said: "civil administration was restored in Jaffna
soon after the return of civilians who placed their confidence in
the government which liberated Jaffna city from the LTTE
terrorists. The government also held local elections in the city
and gave the people an opportunity to elect their own
representatives."
</P>
<P>
The president said what else have the Tigers done except
betraying the Tamil people by exploding bombs at a time when the
government is doing everything possible to develop Jaffna and
create a peaceful environment for its citizens who have undergone
untold hardships under the Tigers control?
</P>
<P>
In the release, she also said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) which purports to represent the Tamil community has
bared its terrorist inclinations by attacking all sections of the
community.
</P>
<P>
All those who value peace and humanity reject the acts of
terror perpetrated by the LTTE, said she, adding that "I am
certain that the government will receive the support of all
sections of the community to achieve its noble objectives."
</P>
<P>
Jaffna city was once the stronghold of the LTTE rebels, who
have been fighting a 15-year war for a separate state in the
country. The city was recaptured by Sri Lankan government troops
in December, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Divers Find Swissair Voice Cockpit Recorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Divers recovered Friday the
voice cockpit recorder of Swissair Flight 111 which crashed off
Canada's east coast last week, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The recorder is expected to help investigators know what
happened in the final moments of the jet crash, which killed all
229 passengers and crew aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss plane, en route from New York to Geneva, crashed
about 60 kilometers southwest of Halifax, last Wednesday, about 16
minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
So far, experts are still trying to determine what caused the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The other so-called "black box", the inflight data recorder,
was recovered last Saturday, and sent to a lab here for analysis.
</P>
<P>
But experts found that an electrical failure moments before the
crash kept it from recording below from 10,000 feet, which was
about six minutes before the crash.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the second recorder will shed some light on
what was going on in the cockpit in the last few minutes before
the crash.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian agricultural
delegation is visiting here to strengthen agricutural trade ties
between Canada and Mexico, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is composed of Minister of Agriculture Lyle
Vanclief, five provincial agricultural ministers and a group of
Canadian business leaders.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the visit is aimed to increase agricultural
trade with Mexico within the framework of North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade now stands at over 800 million U.S. dollars
and is expected to grow steadily.
</P>
<P>
Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector earns over 22 billion
dollars annually, comprising just under 9 percent of Canada's
Gross Domestic Product(GDP).
</P>
<P>
"Canada understands the benefits of partnering -- greater export
sales, cost savings, control of quality and enhanced economic
activity for both partners," the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here on Thursday following a visit to
Brazil and Chile.

<HEADLINE> Once-Jailed Chinese Poet Views Honor as Token of Friendship (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- When Lu Yuan learned last
month of the decision to present him this year's Golden Wreath
Award of the Struga Poetry Evenings, he said: "This reflects the
friendship between the Chinese people and the Macedonian people."
</P>
<P>
Like most traditional Chinese scholars, the 76-year-old Chinese
poet, writer and translator who was once jailed for seven years
because of a false charge has serenity in the face of great honor.
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 23, he received the only Golden Wreath Award for this
year in the city of Struga in Macedonia, making him the first
Chinese who has won this renowned and long-standing prize in the
world's poetry circle.
</P>
<P>
The Struga Poetry Evenings, which started 37 years ago, is one
of the most important international gatherings held in Macedonia,
whose top prize -- the Golden Wreath Award -- is supposed to be
presented only to the world's most famous poets.
</P>
<P>
"Receiving such a prize is not only my personal glory, but also
the pride of the Chinese culture and, more important, it is a
reflection of the Macedonian people's friendship to the Chinese
people," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Struga Poetry Evenings as a contribution of the
Macedonian people to the world's cultural exchange, Lu said that
when more Chinese poems are understood by the world, the distance
between China and the world will become less.
</P>
<P>
"Through the efforts of poets, critics and translators, gaps
between different peoples will be bridged," he said.
</P>
<P>
On this year's Struga Poetry Evenings he recited one recent
work named "Chinese Kite": "...fly, fly up, higher and higher,
Chinese kite/ no matter how big universe gravity/ took you about
from all directions/ just thanks to an invisible, uncuttable,
umbilical cord/ connect you tightly with mother earth/ you are
unbeded forever in the childhood sky/ with the manner of
mysterious piece of brocade."
</P>
<P>
"In this poem one can read my love, feeling and thinking about
my own country", Lu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said that the reason he selected this piece to recite was
that it also deeply touched his many Macedonian friends.
</P>
<P>
"Paskal Gilevski, president of the Council of Struga Poetry
Evenings, once told me that they hope more Chinese kites, with
friendship, fly in the skies of Macedonia," Lu said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
After communicating with poets from more than 40 countries, Lu
said he found that Chinese poems, both traditional and modern,
have gained increasing understanding.
</P>
<P>
"Quite a lot of people know something about Qu Yuan, Li Ba and
many other famous Chinese poets," he said.
</P>
<P>
One thing Lu said deeply impressed him is that during the
recitation of his works Macedonia's 81-year-old president Kiro
Gligorov always sat quietly listening, although it was late at
night.
</P>
<P>
Lu was an English teacher in his early years. After New China
was founded in 1949, he worked for a newspaper. From 1955 to 1962,
he was jailed because he was believed to have had "different and
dangerous art values."
</P>
<P>
While jailed, he studied German and, when he was set free in
1962, he mastered the language so well that even some first-class
experts on German expressed surprise.
</P>
<P>
He worked mainly as a translator after 1962, but his isolation
lasted until 1980 when he was rehabilitated. Despite those hard
times, Lu Yuan has published 17 collections of poetry and 25 books
or translations.
</P>
<P>
"I have no time to regret the past; I need more time to write,
to think and to do my job better," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Homes to Be Rebuilt for the Homeless in Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- All efforts are being made to
ensure housing for people in China's flood-striken areas as winter
approaches, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang Province, where the swelling Nenjiang and
Songhuajiang rivers took away the homes of 900,000 people, the
government has vowed to ensure that residents are able to spend
the winter safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
"The top priority of our relief work is to see no one die from
the frigid winter temperatures," said Wang Donghua, vice-governor
of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
The province has distributed 140 million yuan worth of relief
materials among flood victims to help them prepare for the coming
winter.
</P>
<P>
In Gannan County, the government has raised 600,000 yuan in
special housing funds to help the affected farmers set up new
housing by cutting daily expenditure and collecting donations.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Yunxiang, vice-governor of the county, the
government was giving thorough consideration to the design of new
scientific and flood-proof housing for more than 50,000 homeless
residents, most of who still live in public houses or the homes of
their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
In Tailai, many homeless families have been given bricks to
build partial underground houses common in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
In central China's Hubei Province, the provincial government
has outlined a package of construction plans, and new housing for
victims is expected to complete by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, say it will take years to complete the home
reconstruction work and restore agriculture and industry in vast
hard-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
"We need about three years to make up for the heavy losses,"
said Liu Haisheng, Qiqihar mayor.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China will produce 32 million
bikes this year to meet rising market demand, according to the
China Light Industry News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the China Bicycle Association as saying
that market demand currently stands at 20 million
domestically-produced bicycles and some 13 million imported units.
</P>
<P>
China has trimmed bicycle production since 1996, due to
shrinking market demand and the accelerated development of the
automobile manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
The average Chinese family owns 2.32 bicycles, according to a
recent association survey.

<HEADLINE> Italy Condemns Assassination of Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini sent a massage on Friday to his Iranian counterpart
Kamal Kharrazi condemning the assassination of Iranian diplomats
captured by Afghan Taleban Militias.
</P>
<P>
"I hope those responsible for the assassination will be soon
identified and called upon to take responsibility for a crime
committed in flagrant violation of current international
conventions and of the most fundamental principles of civil
coexistence," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
But Dini also said that while his condemnation of the
"barbarous crime" was firm, he hoped a sense of responsibility and
moderation would prevail to overcome the currently strained
relations between Iran and Afghanistan and to prevent an
escalation of hostilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 11 Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan were abducted
early last month after Taleban, who control most part of
Afghanistan, captured the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif
from rival forces on August 8. There was no word about the fate of
two other diplomats who remained missing.
</P>
<P>
Taleban spokesman Maulvi Wakil Ahmed announced that the bodies
of the nine were found Wednesday in a mountain.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban militia on Thursday pledged to punish some of its
fighters who, "acting on their own", killed the nine Iranian
diplomats without orders.
</P>
<P>
But the government of Iran believed that Taleban should be
responsible for the crime.

<HEADLINE> Manila Mulls Selective Import Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
rejected the proposed 10 percent across-the-board import surcharge
but agreed to study selective imposition of the surcharge in a bid
to mitigate the adverse effects of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government's inter-agency Economic Mobilization Group made
this decision at a meeting Friday, the Philippine Journal reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez, a member of
the group, noted that when the country's tariffs were reduced
considerably the currency crisis was not yet raging.
</P>
<P>
But with the lingering financial crisis, the private sector has
clamored for a government measure that will dampen imports to help
local industries.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to impose a 10-percent surcharge on imported goods
was raised by business leaders during a recent joint Export
Development Council and Industry Development Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is intended to curtail the influx of imported
items and encourage local sourcing to assist local manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Hunt State Assets Stashed Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi Muhammad Ghalib pledged to hunt state assets which were
allegedly stashed overseas during the 32-year rule of former
president Soeharto, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We will consult with the Foreign Ministry to rescue the state
assets stashed overseas," Ghalib told reporters after meeting
Swiss Ambassador to Indonesia Gerard Fonjallaz at his office
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said earlier
this week that his ministry was ready to assist the Attorney
General's Office in rescuing state assets possibly stashed abroad
during the Soeharto era.
</P>
<P>
"We will make the best of this offer... the minister of foreign
affairs (Ali Alatas) has also offered to cooperate," Ghalib said.
</P>
<P>
Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth
was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his visit is to explain that Switzerland's
banking secrecy is "not absolute" as long as there is a formal
demand from a particular country to launch investigations into a
suspected bank account, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would not take the initiative (to launch the
investigation), it has to come from the country of origin of the
person (suspected of having illegally-gained deposits)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib came under fire after he said on Monday that he believed
Soeharto's public denial of charges that he had accumulated a
fortune worth billions of U.S. dollars during his rule.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest
daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, I
don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at
foreign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
</P>
<P>
American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto, who
stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21, had a
fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Coffee Export Revenues Drop in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee export
revenues dropped almost 22 percent to 192 million U.S. dollars,
compared to the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Coffee Exporters Association said Friday that the
total volume of coffee exports amounted to 1.6 million 60-kilo
bags in August, 30 percent more than in the same month of
1997. But due to the lower price in the international market, the
export revenues decreased by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that the Coffee exports are expected
to reach 17 million or 18 million bags this year, about 40 percent
more than last year.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Farmers Turn to Accept One-Child Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers used to
believe that "a cluster of children stand for happiness," but now
many young rural couples choose to have only one child.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhijun, a farmer in Xinle City of north China's Hebei
Province, has five siblings but he decided to have no more
children after his own daughter was born three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply aware of the burden of too many children
on society as well as on his family. As his family could not
afford to build another house, he had to live with his parents and
younger sister in the same room until he was 18 years old. "I
don't want to follow my parents," he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the natural population growth rate in
China has declined from 2.58 percent in 1970 to 1.055 percent in
1995 due to the implementation of the "one-child" birth control
policy. The decline has delayed China's population growth, and
otherwise the figure would have reached 1.2 billion nine years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Xie Daomin, a Chinese expert, said that the achievement should
be attributed to the consciousness of common people, especially to
the 800 million people in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Farmers -- not only among the Han people, but also among ethnic
groups -- have realized the significance of birth control.
</P>
<P>
Yangjim, a resident of Drashi Village of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, decided to have no more children after having a child. She
said that a mother with fewer children can retain her vigor
although ethnic minorities are allowed to have more children in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is the development of the rural economy that
changes the old birth idea of Chinese farmers. Many young farmers
are occupied with their economic operations, so they are reluctant
to be worn out by having more than one child.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the improving social security system has created
favorable conditions for birth control as farmers gradually have
fewer worries about their pensions.
</P>
<P>
To date, 82 million rural residents in China have bought
pension insurance.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said that
China is expected to set up a countryside insurance system in 20
years. And it will help more Chinese farmers to accept a one-child
family, he said.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said

<P>
On Primakov's experience in economic reforms, the spokesman
said, "He's been a part of the government. Obviously he's been a
part of discussions regarding international assistance and
support. As part of the government there has been a clear platform
to support economic reform. We certainly hope that that will
continue.".

<HEADLINE> China to Pace up Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to beef up the
construction of roads and railways to sustain economic growth,
especially in the wake of recent floods.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of
Communications, the floods had damaged 46 State level and 483
provincial-level highways and 2,393 county roads to varying
degrees.
</P>
<P>
Some 29,000 km of roads have been damaged, about 2.5 percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the transportation of relief materials, the
ministry has earmarked 60 million yuan for repairs to the damaged
roads.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge losses caused by the floods, the ministry is
determined to fulfill the target it set earlier this year, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways also plans to readjust its
construction schedule in an effort to do more to expand internal
demand and stimulate economic growth in the remaining four months.
</P>
<P>
Railway construction in the past few months has been slower
than expected due to a lack of preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
Major problems have arisen in acquiring the land required for
building the lines.
</P>
<P>
These problems have been compounded by the prolonged flooding
in certain areas of the country since June.
</P>
<P>
In spite of flood damage and the abnormally high temperatures
this year in some parts of the country, the ministry completed
investment of 10.37 billion yuan from June to August.
</P>
<P>
The State recently decided to increase investment in the sector
by 4.2 billion yuan to give further stimulus to railway
development.
</P>
<P>
Adding in funds from local authorities and foreign investors,
investment in the sector this year is expected to reach 53 billion
yuan.

<P>
KIEV, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine expects little "special
change" in its relations with a Russian government led by new
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is for Primakov's appointment to
benefit Russia, Kuchma told reporters during a visit to Kiev's
Polytechnic University.
</P>
<P>
"What benefits Russia will benefit Ukraine," he stressed,
affirming that his country hopes for an early restoration of
political stability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said he would meet Russian President Boris
Yeltsin as planned on September 18-19 but the meeting place is
being rearranged.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet decided (the place of the meeting)," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a previous plan, business leaders and regional
representatives were allowed to attend the meeting, scheduled in
Kharkov in eastern Ukraine close to the Russia border, for talks
on state issues and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that trade and transactions have been temporarily
suspended between Ukraine and Russia, Kuchma said that "it is
necessary today to have a summit" to coordinate actions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ukrainian side needs to know more about Moscow's
views and opinions after its cabinet reshuffle.

<P>
GUIYANG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Three Airbus 340 passenger
jets will be delivered to China Southwest Airlines in Chengdu next
month, the first jumbo jets in the airline's fleet.
</P>
<P>
The deal for 360 million U.S. dollars is part of the airline's
strategic investment program to compete in the rapidly growing air
transportation market in China, according to Zhou Zhengquan,
director of Civil Aviation Administration of China's Southwestern
Branch.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Yunnan and Guizhou Airlines also plan to
purchase planes abroad, with Guizhou cooperating with China
Southern Airlines to import two Boeing passenger jets this year.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern China includes Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou
provinces, as well as Chongqing municipality and the Tibet
Autonomous Region. Due to the rough terrain and difficult land
communications in this area, air transportation is growing by 30
percent on an average annual basis.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, there were only 20 passenger planes and eight civil
airports in this region, but the numbers are expected to climb to
70 and 19, respectively, by the end of this year and to 200 and 40
in 2010, Zhou said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The New York Liberty, who
failed to make the WNBA playoffs after reaching the finals in
1997, announced today they will not renew the contract of head
coach Nancy Darsch.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciated Nancy Darsch's efforts as head coach of the
Liberty, however, at this time we feel the team needs to move in
a new direction," said club vice president and general manager
Carol Blazejowski. "We wish her all the best in her future
endeavors."
</P>
<P>
Darsch compiled a 35-23 record in her two seasons with the
Liberty. She guided the team to a 7-0 start en route to a 17-11
mark in the league's first season in 1997. New York beat Phoenix
in the playoffs, but lost a one-game championship to the Houston
Comets.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Liberty compiled a 18-12 record, but missed the
post-season after losing to the Detroit Shock on the final day of
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
New York, unlike other teams in the league, stayed with a
veteran lineup throughout the season. Darsch spent 12 seasons at
Ohio State after seven years as an assistant coach at Tennessee.
She posted a 223-125 record, including four Big Ten championships
and seven NCAA tournament appearances.

<HEADLINE> Hingis, Novotna into U.S. Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The No. 1 player in the
world and the top player this summer will meet in the U.S. Open
women's singles final.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Martina Hingis rallied from two service
breaks down in the third set today to beat doubles partner Jana
Novotna 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, and earn a berth opposite second seed
American Lindsay Davenport in Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who won three titles during the summer season,
gained her first Grand Slam final by disposing of fellow American
Venus Williams 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won 18 of the final 22 points to overcome Novotna's 4-1
advantage in the deciding set and protect the world top spot she
has held for the last 76 weeks. Had she lost today, the
17-year-old would have surrendered the place to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
"I was just fighting," Hingis said of the comeback. "It was
getting windy and I was trying to keep the ball in the game. I
also wanted to protect my No. 1 ranking."
</P>
<P>
The loss was a disappointing one for the third-seeded Novotna.
After years of missed opportunities in big matches, the
29-year-old shed the "choker" tag by winning Wimbledon this year.
But the label is sure to return after her shaky performance in
the final two sets today and her collapse in the final five games.
</P>
<P>
A service break in the opening game of the third set gave
Novotna early control and a forehand winner and overhead smash
gave her another break and a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
But Hingis regrouped and broke Novotna three consecutive times
while twice holding serve at love. A backhand passing shot and a
backhand winner up the line gave Hingis two match points.
</P>
<P>
She sent a lob over the baseline on her first opportunity, but
cashed in and earned her sixth Grand Slam final when Novotna
netted a forehand on the next point.
</P>
<P>
"I was up 4-1 and from that moment on I started to miss too
many approach shots and volleys," Novotna said. "Against a player
like Martina you can't do that. I was simply missing too many
ball."
</P>
<P>
Novotna, the aggressor throughout, committed 50 unforced errors
 in the match, 20 in the final set. She made 17 unforced errors
and managed only 14 points in the second set, which Hingis won in
only 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Everything started to go too fast for me in the second set,"
said Novotna, who held serve to open the set and then dropped the
next six games. "I just lost it very easily."
</P>
<P>
Hingis will be gunning for her fifth Grand Slam singles title
and first singles title of any kind in early four months in
Saturday's final. She won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.
S. Open in 1997, and defending her Australian Open title earlier
this year. She has won three other tournaments this year, but
none since the Italian Open in early May.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, appearing in her fourth semifinal in the last five
Grand Slams, simply overpowered the hard-hitting Williams. Her
penetrating groundstrokes kept the fifth seed pinned at or behind
the baseline for much of the match. Williams made 26 unforced
errors.
</P>
<P>
"She was stepping into her balls well," said Williams. "She's
one of the more powerful players on the tour."
</P>
<P>
"I think she wasn't going for her shots as much, trying to be
consistent," said Davenport, who is coming off a summer season
which included three consecutive wins. "It was giving me a little
bit more time to set up and I knew if I had the opportunity I
really had to go for the shot. I was able to do that."
</P>
<P>
Davenport jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the opening set with a
pair of service breaks, but watched as Williams pulled even just
as quickly. After three additional service breaks, Davenport held
to take the set.
</P>
<P>
"I had all types of opportunities, just a matter of
capitalizing on them," Williams said of the first set. "I think
she did a better job of that today. She was more consistent and
ready to win."
</P>
<P>
The second set was the complete opposite as each player
controlled play on their serve. Davenport cashed in on the only
break point of the set in the seventh game to take a 4-3 lead and
served out the match, losing only one point in her final two
service games.
</P>
<P>
"At 5-4, I was just trying to be calm and tell myself to serve
a good game, " said Davenport, who wrapped up the match when
Williams sent a return past the baseline. "I knew the return was
going long and it was relief, it was happiness, it was joy obviou
sly getting to my first final."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's final will be the fourth meeting between Hingis and
Davenport this year. Davenport has won two of the previous three,
including the last meetings in the Los Angeles final, but Hingis
leads the all-time series 6-5.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't to Maintain Current Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
affirmed it would continue its high interest rate policy with the
aim to ensure the quick reduction of inflation and the
strengthening of the rupiah, national newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to continue to implement a firm monetary policy,
consistent with the monetary targets already established as part
of our program," the government stated in the new Supplementary
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was attached to the Letter of Intent on the IMF-sponsored
program, which was addressed to IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus in Washington by Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Industry and Finance Ginandjar Kartasasmita on the government's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
The document added that interest rates were expected to decline
gradually as inflation subsided and the rupiah "remains in line
with the program path."
</P>
<P>
Completion of the monthly review program this week paved the
way for the disbursement of another one billion U.S. dollars of
the IMF's contribution to Indonesia's bailout program.
</P>
<P>
Stability of the exchange rate is the cornerstone of the
economic reform program. The rupiah has lost about 80 percent of
its value since it started its free fall in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-lead economic program targets the rupiah reaching
10,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar by the end of this year, with an
accompanying inflation rate of about 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah rallied to between 10,000 and 10,500 to the U.S.
dollar in recent weeks, up from about 13,000 in August.
</P>
<P>
But the currency plunged to hover around the 12,000 level this
week due to anxiety over major demonstrations and rioting in
several parts of the country in the wake of sharp increases in
prices of food staples, especially rice.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government avowed on Friday it would proceed
quickly with its bank restructuring program to drum up further
confidence in the beleaguered currency.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to proceed quickly with the issuance of government
bonds needed to finance bank restructuring operations," said the
Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones of the
United States and Obadele Thompson of Barbados stole the show at
the first day of the 8th International Amateur Athletics
Federation World Cup on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jones broke the women's 200 meters World Cup record of 21.83
seconds by finishing at 21.62 seconds. Thompson set a new World
Cup record in men's 100 meters with 9.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
African athletes grabbed the first two golds in Friday's
competition. Nezha Bidouane from Morocco snatched the first gold
for the African contingent in the women's 400m hurdles with 52.96
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Samuel Matete won the second gold for Africa when
he took the lead in the men's 400m hurdles and finished 48.08
seconds. He was followed by Asia's Mubarak Al-Nubi, who clocked
48.17s, and Jamaican Dinsdale Morgan, with 48.40s.
</P>
<P>
Top athletes from around the globe began competing for their
continents as the Athletics World Cup opened on Friday afternoon
in Johannesburg, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The biggest commercial metropolis in southern Africa welcomed
the world athletics event with a refreshing shower, which has
been absent in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Teams of both sexes from five continents and two sports
superpowers-- the United States and Germany -- and an additional
men's team from Britain and a women's team from Russia, will
contest for the team trophy of the event, which was recently
renamed Nelson Mandela Trophy.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day competition, over 400 elite athletes will
take part in 20 men's events and 17 women' events. The medalists
will, for the first time in the 21 years' history of the World
Cup, get cash rewards ranging from 50,000 U.S. dollars to 10,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The men's contingents from Africa and the United States are
among the favorites for this year's World Cup, and the women's
teams from the United States and Europe are also hopeful for
claiming the title. In the 1994 World Cup, Africa won the trophy
in the men's events and Europe won in the women's.
</P>
<P>
The Asian contingent, which is significantly represented by
Chinese, also vowed to do their best in the contest. Twenty-three
of the team's 55 athletes are from China.

<HEADLINE> Devalued New Zealand Dollar Hits Food Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The devalued New Zealand
dollar has helped bump up food prices in the local markets.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Statistics New Zealand, the
New Zealand dollar fell 4.4 percent in the second quarter and
13.9 percent in the year ending June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The lower New Zealand dollar hits food prices in the local
markets, which rose 1.1 percent in August and were 4.2 percent
higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The monthly rise was the largest since May 1995 and the annual
rise was the largest since September 1990, Statistics New Zealand
said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest influences were a 7.2 percent rise in the price of
milk, a 24.4 percent rise in the price of cauliflower and rises in
imported grocery prices.
</P>
<P>
"The falling New Zealand dollar has been reflected in higher
import prices for foodstuffs and higher prices for meat and dairy
exports in the June 1998 quarter (the second quarter of the year).
This may well have contributed to this month's (August) sharp
increase in the food price index," deputy government statistician
Ian Ewing was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
When export prices rise, local prices tend to rise to match
them. A lower New Zealand dollar makes the price of imported goods
higher, the official said.

NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of

Czech Republic in the semifinal of the U.S. Open tennis

She jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the opening set with a pair of
service breaks, but the number 5 seed Williams pulled it even
quickly. After three additional service breaks, Davenport held to
take the set.
</P>
<P>
The second set was the complete opposite as each player
controlled play in their serve. Davenport cashed in on the only
break point of the set in the seventh game to take a 4-3 lead,
and from then, she surged ahead, losing only one point in her
final two service games.
</P>
<P>
Williams brought seven dresses to the Open, one for each round
on the road to the finals, but she got no chance to wear the last
dress.
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply saddened. I didn't have an opportunity to wear my
seventh dress," Williams said. "It was red, white and blue. Of
course matching hair and nails. I'm definitely going to put that
one in a coffin and bury it."
</P>
<P>
Williams, who reached the finals in her first appearance last
year at the Open, said: "I had all types of opportunities. It was
a matter of capitalizing on them. She did a better job of that.
She was more consistent and ready to win."
</P>
<P>
Williams, just 18 and in her second full year on the pro tour,
was critical of her performance.
</P>
<P>
"I really have to work hard on being better. I think I'm
pretty solid. I just have to become a better player, make better
decisions."

<HEADLINE> Spurs Chairman "Turns down Preliminary Offer" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur chairman
Alan Sugar turned down an 80 million pounds (135 million U.S.
dollars) offer for his English premier league club because it is
too low, according to local reports here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sugar, who is keen to sell his 40 percent stake in Spurs,
reportedly turned down the "indicative offer" from investment
company ENIC, which also has a stake in Rangers in Scotland, AEK
Athens in Greece, Vicenza in Italy and Slavia Prague in the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
ENIC has reportedly not made a formal bid for Spurs, which in
1983 became the first soccer club to be quoted on the London
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Neither Tottenham nor ENIC would comment on the report, which
follows a frenzy of activity in soccer clubs this week with
Manchester United agreeing a 624 million pounds (one billion U.S.
dollars) deal with BSkyB, Arsenal being courted by Carlton
Communications in a 275.0 million pounds (464 million U.S.
dollars) deal and Aston Villa also reportedly talking to media
organizations about possible future co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday Liverpool, who were linked with a possible
takeover by another broadcasting company, denied any chance of a
takeover.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham's value has been put at around 65 million pounds
(109.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sugar's personal stake in Tottenham is valued at around 32.0
million pounds (54 million U.S. dollars), almost three times the
amount he invested in the club when he took control in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sugar announced two weeks ago he wanted to sell his
controlling interest in Tottenham because of the abuse he has
received from fans unhappy at the club's lack of success since he
took over seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
They have not won a trophy since the F.A. Cup in 1991, just
before he took control, and have had more managers -- six -- in
the last seven years than they had in the previous three decades.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham, traditionally one of the biggest and most
successful clubs in English soccer, has fallen behind the
standards set by Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal in the
last few seasons.
</P>
<P>
The club, eighth in the premier league, are currently looking
for a new coach after Sugar sacked Swiss Christian Gross after 10
unhappy months last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although Tottenham have not challenged for honors for some
time, they have a successful pedigree in Europe, having won the
European Cup Winners' Cup in 1963 and the UEFA Cup in 1972 and
1984.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Resolution of the
General Assembly 2758 (XXVI) adopted in 1971 stated unequivocally
that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic
of China are the sole and lawful representatives of China to the
United Nations and this resolution is still valid today, Tanzania
stressed here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd Session of the
General Assembly, Daudi Mwakawago, Tanzania's Ambassador to the
United Nations, said this resolution restored all rights of the
the People's Republic of China at the United Nations and any
attempt to inscribe the question of the so called "Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations" will be clearly the
interference of China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mwakawago said Tanzania believes that the resolution 2758
showed the General Assembly's respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China and
domestic issues of one country can only be solved by peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said any attempt by the international
community aimed to discuss such issues should be fully
discouraged.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair held a 30 minute phone call with U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday to discuss the Russian crisis, the Northern Irish peace
process and the global economy, a Blair spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Clinton discussed a planned meeting of officials from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on Monday which will
focus on the crisis in Russia, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"They shared ideas on Russia in advance of the meeting and
agreed it was important to stay closely engaged with Russia and in
a position to help as political stability returns," Reuters quoted
the spokesman as saying.

Blair briefed Clinton on Thursday's landmark meeting between
the leaders of Northern Ireland's pro-British Unionists and

<HEADLINE> Pakistan: Question of Taiwan's Reentry to UN Must </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly,
in its resolution 2758 (XXVI) adopted at its 26th session, clearly
stated the representatives of the Government of the People 's
Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to
the United Nations, Pakistan reiterated here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Committee of the 53rd session of the
General Assembly, Ahmad kamal, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United
Nations, said this historical verdict clearly settled the question
of the representation of the Chinese people at this world body
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said Pakistan, like most others, welcomes the historical
ruling of the General Assembly, and it believes any attempt to
reopen the review of the issue constitutes a serious violation of
the Charter of the United Nations and it is confident that the
member states will reject any attempt to undermine the Charter of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said despite the historical verdict of the General
assembly, numerous attempts have been made in the past few years
to reopen the issue, and as a result, the wasteful debate takes
place every year in the General Committee, consuming the General
assembly's energy and time which should be devoted to the more
substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador stressed this is why the General Assembly must
bury this issue once for all so that the energy and attention can
be directed to the more pressing problems facing the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said Pakistan firmly believes that China is a sovereign
member state of the United Nations,and Taiwan, which is a part of
China, has no right whatsoever to join the United Nations, and
there is no need to review the resolution 2758 any more.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador expressed his most sincere hope that it is for
the very last time that the General Committee meets to go through
the avoidable agony of the consideration and debate on the subject
on which the decision of this year will on doubt be identical to
what it has been in the previous years.

<HEADLINE> IPU Conference Concludes in Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 100th Conference of the
Inter- Parliamentary Union (IPU) ended Friday in the Kremlin after
adopting three resolutions on human rights, water resources and
the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
During much of the six-day event, people's attention was drawn
to what was happening to the political scene of host Russia.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the close of the IPU conference, acting foreign
minister Yevgeny Primakov was confirmed in the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, as Russia's new prime minister, the
third in less than six months.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on the intensification of activities of national
parliaments in ensuring and defending human rights in the 21st
century was adopted in connection with the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommended to governments and parliaments to
promote the abolition of the death penalty, tortures and inhumane
treatment of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
China made reservations concerning the abolition of death
penalty and stipulations for the international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
The conference also recommended to governments and parliaments
to mark March 8, 2000, as a day of peace, development and
democracy based on the growing role of women.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution on water resources, the conference called
for measures for the preservation, distribution and optimal use of
such resources to ensure stable development.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, nominated by President Boris Yeltsin mid-Thursday,
delivered a speech before the world parliamentarians hours later,
noting that his country, though "temporarily feeble internally"
remains a major power in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, was one of the
busiest, if not the busiest, inside the Garden Ring of Moscow.
Besides chairing the open and closed sessions in the IPU
conference, he also had to chair sessions in the State Duma, not
to say the political bargaining outside the Duma building centered
around the nomination of premier.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who was chairman of the conference, said the
gathering "turned out to be quite in time" despite the fact that
the conference coincided with the country's political and economic
crises.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the parliamentarians for their support and assured
them that the State Duma would always be a "factor of democracy
and a guarantor that no more revolutionary coups will occur in
Russia".

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar plunged
against the Japanese yen Friday despite a report that Japan's
economy slid even deeper into recession in the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The mark swung wildly but recovered against the German currency
as U.S. stocks rallied late in the day.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to a five-month low against the yen while
dropping to an 18-month low against the mark. The Mexican peso
edged down, falling to a new low against the dollar for the

134.23 yen late Thursday. During trading, the dollar fell to
129.00 yen, a level last seen on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also rose to 1.6935 marks, up from 1.6843,
but that came after an intraday decline to 1.6708 marks, a level
last seen on April 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, the dollar was worth a record 10.6050 pesos, up
from 10.6000. In late trading in New York, the dollar was trading
at 10.5400, up from 10.4000 pesos.
</P>
<P>

European exchanges and a 5.1 percent plunge in Tokyo's Nikkei Stock
Average.

Thursday: 1.3890 Swiss francs, up from 1.3845; 5.6790 French

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Give up Illusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat on Friday urged the Taiwan authorities to give up any
illusion because the island, an inalienable part of China, has no
qualification for the membership of the United Nations, an
intergovernmental body composed of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, voiced his hope that "The Taiwan authorities should
realize that it has no qualification for and no possibility to the
membership of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Now it is time for the Taiwan authorities to give up any
illusions and nobody on earth can stop China from reunification,"
said the Chinese envoy.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Taiwan authorities to enter into political
talks with the Central Government under the principle of one
China. "This is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the
whole Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qin made the statement following the General Committee of the
53rd Session of the General Assembly rejected the so-called
question of "Taiwan's representation at the United Nations". The
General Committee met on Friday to adopt agenda and allocate
items for the current session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth consecutive refusal since 1993 by the
General Committee to put the so-called question in the agenda
for the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of today's meeting shows that there is only
China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of
China is the only lawful government representing the Chinese
people as a whole and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A majority of U.N. member states have reached a consensus that
the question of the Chinese representation at the United Nations
has already been a settled matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the General Assembly at its 26th session adopted by
an overwhelming majority the historical significant resolution
2758 (XXVI). In the resolution, the Assembly clearly and
unequivocally recognized "that the representatives of the
government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful
representatives of China to the United Nations and the People's
Republic of China is one of the five permanent representatives
of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt which amounts to the denial of the resolution 2758
(XXVI) is doomed to failure, and so is any attempt to support
separatist illusions, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the General Committee's rejection, representatives
from many other countries took the floor to back Beijing's
stance on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that the proposed "Taiwan's representation at the
United Nations" has long been a settled matter, and it simply
wastes time and energy to discuss this matter, which they said
is nothing but China's internal affairs.

announced in Frankfurt Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the ECB's governing council during a

cashless tradings.
</P>
<P>
The actual banknotes and coins will be introduced over a
six-month period starting January 1, 2002, after which the
participants' present national currencies will cease to be legal
tender.

MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A sailor who killed eight
fellow servicemen and threatened to blow up a nuclear-powered
submarine in Severomorsk, Murmansk region in northern Russia was
killed early Saturday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, Kuzminykh left the submarine and went to
the mooring, where he seriously wounded a sentinel and seized his
automatic rifle. He also wounded an officer who tried to stop him.
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded apparently died later.
</P>
<P>
Kuzminykh then returned to the submarine and killed five
sleeping fellow sailors. He took two other sailors hostage and

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Helped by Wall Street Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Light gains on Wall Street
left European equity markets not far from previous closes on
Friday after registering heavy falls in morning trade on growing
concerns that U.S. President Clinton could face impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
London blue chip shares climbed off the floor to show only
modest losses at the close, pulled up by Wall Street's opening
gains.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 finished the day 18 lower at 5118, on moderate
volume of 868m shares traded.
</P>
<P>
The index recovered significantly from the early test below
5000, which followed yesterday's losses in the U.S. and some big
falls in Far East markets overnight.
</P>
<P>
Once again, U.S. stocks were the prime focus for London
traders, who watched President Clinton's emotional apology at a
White House prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
His performance helped the Dow shake off a soft start, but
traders didn't believe the markets' volatility was now over,
according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
News that Russia's Duma endorsed Yevgeny Primakov as Prime
Minister, meanwhile, offered a much needed stabilizing influence.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares recovered from early lows, too,
lifted in part by Wall Street's attempts to hold gains, but
remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra DAX closed 10.18 points lower at 4754.65. The index
earlier fell through key support levels of 4640 and 4650, reaching
a low of 4600.17.
</P>
<P>
A Frankfurt-based trader said that while there were no
fundamental reasons for the market's drop, "there are technical
influences at work, coming from the U.S., Russia and Asia."
</P>
<P>
After pulling the market lower late on Thursday, the weaker
dollar continued to unsettle German stocks.
</P>
<P>
A Financial Times report that Russia had delayed partial
payment of interest on debt to the Germany government for the
first time since its financial crisis erupted also unsettled
traders.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares recouped considerable ground from early lows,
benefiting from Wall Street's attempts to claw back Thursday's 250
point deficit. The Cac-40 index finished 11.01 lower points at
3578.34.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Primakov Confirmation Marks Lull in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma's overwhelming
endorsement Friday of Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister marked a
much-needed lull in Russia's political storms, but ordinary
Russians are much eager to see whether the career diplomat can
bring goods back to store shelves and get prices down.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's nomination passed the lower house of parliament by a
vote of 317-63, far exceeding the required majority of 226 votes
in the 450-seat Duma, ending a 20-day government crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of political standoff between President Boris
Yeltsin and the opposition erupted on August 23, when Yeltsin
abruptly fired the five-month-old cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and
named former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as premier the
next day.
</P>
<P>
After Chernomyrdin was voted down twice by the lower house,
Yeltsin succumbed to pressure from the major opposition parties
and named Acting Foreign Minister Primakov, an independent, as
premier.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's easy confirmation in the State Duma was widely
expected. Only the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party
decried the choice, branding him as "pro- American."
</P>
<P>
First, the choice of Primakov, a major concession on the part
of Yeltsin, basically met the minimum requirements by the
Communists, the largest faction in the Duma. Indeed, Yeltsin made
unprecedented concessions in the political standoff: he initialed
a political agreement which favors the Duma in front of leaders of
the opposition left; he agreed to the formation of a coalition
government; he agreed to amend the government law and allow his
authority to weaken in appointing cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also satisfied the opposition's demand to name
Communist deputy Yuri Maslyukov as first deputy prime minister and
ex-head of the Soviet State Bank Viktor Gerashchenko as governor
of the Central Bank of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, the People's Power and the Agrarians control
211 seats in the Duma. If the 43 votes of the Yabloko, which was
the first to nominate Primakov as premier, the total of 254 votes
already exceed the required 226.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, as an independent, Primakov has been known to be not
interested in serving as head of the government. Neither did he
harbor any ambition for the 2000 presidential race, making him
apparently harmless to any party or politician.
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, against the backdrop riddle with political,
economic and social crises, most deputies appeared to be willing
to see an end to the government crisis, either out of
consideration of Russia's well-being, or for their own political
life.
</P>
<P>
Primakov has been pushed to the seat of premier under
extraordinary circumstances in an extraordinary period. The new
cabinet will face daunting challenges in harnessing the complex
political and economic situation, bringing the financial markets
back from the brink of collapse, and restoring people's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the end of the latest government crisis
is only a lull in Russia's volatile political scene and in no way
marks a full stop to the political struggle between Yeltsin and
the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The lower house, especially the Communist-led opposition left,
will continue to press for constitutional revisions that require
Yeltsin to cede more of his powers.

<HEADLINE> IPU Conference Ends in Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 100th Conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ended Friday in the Kremlin after
adopting three resolutions on human rights, water resources and
the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
During much of the six-day event, people's attention was drawn
to what was happening to the political scene of host Russia.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the close of the IPU conference, former foreign
minister Yevgeny Primakov was confirmed in the State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, as Russia's new prime minister, the
third in less than six months.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, nominated by President Boris Yeltsin mid-Thursday,
delivered a speech before the world parliamentarians hours later,
noting that his country, though "temporarily feeble internally"
remains a major power in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, was one of the
busiest inside the Garden Ring of Moscow. Besides chairing the
open and closed sessions in the IPU conference, he also had to
chair sessions in the State Duma, not to say the political
bargaining outside the Duma building centered around the
nomination of premier.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, who was chairman of the conference, said the
gathering "turned out to be quite in time" despite the fact that
the conference coincided with the country's political and economic
crises.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the parliamentarians for their support and assured
them that the State Duma would always be a "factor of democracy
and a guarantor that no more revolutionary coups will occur in
Russia".

<HEADLINE> USDA Forecasts Large Crop Output This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Major crops prices are
likely to fall further because of forecasts for large corn,
soybean and wheat crops amid flat exports, the Agriculture
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department predicts that this year's record soybean harvest
of 2.91 billion bushels (one bushel of soybean is equivalent to
27.216 kg) will drop prices as low as 4.65 dollars a bushel,
compared with 6.45 dollars last year. The new figure represents
a 35-cent decrease from the August estimate and would be the
lowest soybean price since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Corn production is forecast at 9.74 billion bushels, which
would be the second-largest crop on record following 10.1 billion
bushels in 1994 and is 2 percent above the August prediction.
</P>
<P>
Although corn exports have improved slightly, prices are
forecast down 15 cents a bushel (one bushel of corn is about 25.42
kg) from last month to as low as 1.80 dollars a bushel as compared
with 2.45 dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
As for wheat, record per-acre yields of 43.3 bushels an acre
raised the overall forecast to 2.56 billion bushels, up 2 percent
from last year even though farmers planted less acreage this year.
</P>
<P>
But like the other crops, this bounty combined with stagnant
exports means prices as low as 2.50 dollars a bushel, down almost
a dollar from last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Proposed Taiwan's UN Reentry Ends with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The General Committee
of the 53rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations
on Friday decided not to put the so-called question of "Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations" in the agenda for the
current session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth consecutive refusal since 1993 by the General
Committee to include the alleged question, raised by a small
number of countries, in the agenda for the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Once again and with no exceptions, the so-called question of
"Tainwan's Representation at the United Nations" on Friday met
with strong opposition from a majority of justice-holding Member
States at the General Committee of the 53rd Session of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
These countries voiced their opposition to the interference of
China's internal affairs by a small group of countries which
raised the so-called question of "Taiwan's representation at the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 40 countries, including Argentina,
Bangladesh, Chile, Egypt, Georgia, Germany, Iraq, Italy,
Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Mexico, Mongolia, Myammar, Nepal,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Saint Lucia and Tanzania, all took the floor
to back Beijing's position on Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that there is only one China in the world, the
Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government of China as a whole, and Taiwan is only a
part of China.
</P>
<P>
Ahamad Kamal, Pakistani permanent representative to the
United Nations, voiced his hope that "it is the last time for
the General Committee to discuss this already settled matter."
</P>
<P>
"Every year we have wasted a lot of time and resources on
this kind of issue, and we hope to have more time to discuss
substantial issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi and Kuwaiti envoys told the General Committee of the 53rd
Session of the General Assembly that the so-called "Taiwan's
representation at the United Nations" has long been "a settled
matter" and "it simply wastes time" for Taiwan to seek reentry
into the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the General Assembly at its 26th session adopted by an
overwhelming majority the historically significant resolution 2758
(XXVI). In this resolution, the Assembly clearly and unequivocally
recognized "that the representatives of the government of the
People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of
China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of
China is one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council."
</P>
<P>
Also under the resolution, the Assembly decided to restore all
rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and
to expel immediately the representative of Taiwan "from the place
which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all
organizations related to it."
</P>
<P>
The representative of Belarus, who described his country as "a
permanent supporter" of China's position on Taiwan issue, said
that Taiwan, as a province of China, lacks qualification for the
membership of the United Nations, which is an intergovernmental
organization composed of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee met on Friday at the Conference Room 2 at
the U.N. headquarters to adopt the agenda and allocate items for
the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Outside the conference hall, where the meeting is still under
way, diplomats from various countries showed cold shoulder to the
proposed Taiwan's UN reentry, saying that such a proposal "is
unpopular and doomed to failure."

<HEADLINE> Duisenberg Warns Against Panic due to Crises in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- European Central Bank President
Wim Duisenberg Friday warned European investors against
overreactions to the financial crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Although the crisis in Russia and the continuing economic
meltdown in Asia are set to have a dampening effect on the world
economy, the situation should not be dramatized because of the
relative smaller economic scales of the crisis countries and their
limited shares in the world trade, Duisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for a panic," said Duisenberg after a
meeting of the governing council of the European Central Bank
(ECB) in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ECB chief said that he saw no immediate threat
for European economies from the U.S. dollar's sharp declines over
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that if the dollar continued to tumble
against European currencies, the competitiveness of European
economies could be undermined.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises in Volatile Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rose
sharply in volatile trading Friday, with the Dow industrials up
almost 180 points.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street found encouragement in corporate profitability
pronouncements that overcame fears surrounding global economic
strife and unease over the fate of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average leaped 179.96 points, or by
2.4 percent, to close at 7,795.50. It gained 155.25 for the week.
But the Dow still was 16.5 percent below the July 17 record of
9,337.97 and 1.4 percent below where it began the year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow, down 248.48 points Thursday, was off an additional
96.30 in the early trading, then shot up to a gain of 117.40,
before giving up some of that ground. By late afternoon it was
charging higher again, rising as much as 201.33 in the final hour
before fading somewhat heading into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Trading was heavy, with 817.7 million shares changing hands on
the New York Stock Exchange, but below Thursday's 875.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 28.87 to 1,009.06, and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 28.87 to 1,009.06.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 12.23 to 500.00, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 6.98 to 613.21.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.65 to 353.61.
</P>
<P>
The Asian markets, which closed earlier than Wall Street,
suffered great losses Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plummeted 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, to close at 13,916.98. It was the largest one-day
point fall this year. The finish was just barely above the
Nikkei's 12-year closing low of 13,915.63 set on August 28.
