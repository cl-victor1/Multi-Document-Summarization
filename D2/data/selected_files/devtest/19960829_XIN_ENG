<HEADLINE> Mongolian Leaders Vow to Maintain Friendship With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will continue to
develop friendly and cooperative relations with China, the new
parliamentary speaker, Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, said today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to
Mongolia, Pei Jiayi, Gonchigdorj said the new parliament will
stick to the country's consistent foreign policies, which favor a
steadily developing relation with China.
</P>
<P>
On top of the government's foreign policy agenda, he stressed,
is the task of furthering relations with China, especially on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, who was elected speaker after the June general
election, also hailed the cooperation agreement signed by the two
countries in 1994, saying it offered a remarkable ground for the
cooperation between Mongolia and China in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mongolia's new Prime Minister Mendsaihani
Enhsaihan also met Pei, and said he is satisfied with the
development of Sino-Mongolia relations since 1990 when exchanges
by high-ranking officials from the two countries became more
frequent.
</P>
<P>
The June 30 general elections for the State Great Hural, the
country's parliament, saw the Democratic Union Coalition topple
the Revolutionary People's Party, which had been in power for more
than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
The coalition, which consists of the National Democratic Party,
the Socialist Democratic Party (SDP) and two other small parties,
won 50 seats in the 76-strong parliament.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorj, the SDP leader, was elected parliamentary speaker
and Enhsaihan was appointed as new prime minister in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Parke Blames New Seeding System After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- World number five Simon Parke
claimed that he fell victim to a controversial new seeding system
after his surprise first-round loss to Ireland's Derek Ryan in the
Hong Kong Open on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Briton, on the comeback trail after chemotherapy to fight
testicular cancer, lost 15-11, 15-11, 2-15, 15-11 to world No. 15
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
Parke said he was undone by the new seeding system brought in
by the Professional Squash Association which sees highly-ranked
players meeting each other in the first round of events.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Ryan claimed a sweet revenge for the defeat he
suffered at the hands of Parke in the Al Ahram tournament in Egypt
in May.
</P>
<P>
Second-seed Rodney Eyles of Australia found enough fortune and
labored to a 15-6, 8-15, 15-10, 7-15, 15-12 win over Zarak Jahan
Khan of Pakistan, who is ranked just eight places below him.

<HEADLINE> Russian, Chechen Troops Begin Withdrawal From Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Chechen rebel troops
start their withdrawal from the Chechen capital Grozny today in
line with a ceasefire agreement signed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Russian troops are reported to be quitting war-torn
Grozny today while seven columns of Chechen rebel troops are also
due to pull out.
</P>
<P>
A joint Russian-Chechen army will begin patrolling the capital
at 6 p.m. (1400 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Russian troops in Chechnya, Vyacheslav
Tikhmoirov, and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Mashadov ironed
out their differences and signed the ceasefire agreement in the
Chechen village of Novye Atagi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides are expected to complete the
military pullout by September 1.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed
is in Moscow to seek President Boris Yeltsin's backing for a
political solution to the 20-month-old conflict in which more than
50,000 have died.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin, on vacation outside Moscow, has not met his
security adviser since Lebed's abrupt return from Chechnya at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office Tuesday asked Lebed, Yeltsin's special
envoy to Chechnya, to submit a program for a political solution to
the Chechen conflict, saying that the president will decide
whether to meet face to face or talk with the army general by
phone.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lebed today said that whether the security
chief goes back to Chechnya will depend on Yeltsin's response to
the program.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the current situation in Chechnya
remains dangerous in spite of the military agreements signed.
</P>
<P>
Political ground is needed to secure the implementation of the
agreements and the two sides urgently need to hold political
talks, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Voices Great Concern over Conference of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today voiced great concern over a conference to be held in London
with the participation of Islamic fundamentalists throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, Mubarak said
that many people, who will attend the conference, support
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The conference does not serve the cause of international
terrorism combating and raises several questions, which we hope
will be answered in the coming days," he said while meeting with
members of the University Council of Alexandria. His statements
were carried by Egypt's national news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
It had been reported earlier that the conference, scheduled for
September 9, will be held under the name "The International
Islamic Conference Rally for Revival." It is sponsored by the
London-based al-Muhajiroon, a newly formed Moslem fundamentalist
group.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security authorities have been taking steps in a
bid to foil the convocation of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Arab political circles have criticized the British government
for allowing such a gathering under the pretext of democracy and
human rights, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak and other Egyptian officials have complained
repeatedly that European countries and the United States have
provided safe havens for extremists, who oppose governments in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Egypt has been haunted by a violent
anti-government campaign launched by Moslem extremists in an
attempt to install strict Islamic rule in the country.

<HEADLINE> Japan Asks Russia to Investigate Firing at Fishing Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Foreign Ministry
today asked Russia to investigate the Russian coast guard's
gunfire attack on two Japanese fishing boats, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that firing at unarmed, private ships, for
whatever reason, is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Two Japanese fishermen were injured when their boats were shot
at by a patrol boat in waters off northeastern Japan near the
disputed Kuril Islands, according to Japan's Maritime Safety
Agency (MSA).
</P>
<P>
Kunio Horiuchi, 44, and Akira Takiguchi, 54, were hospitalized
with gunshot wounds to their legs and are in a stable condition,
the MSA said.
</P>
<P>
The two ships were in waters close to the Russian-Japanese
border area which was covered in thick fog, Kyodo quoted MSA
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian coast guard admitted firing at the two Japanese
vessels, saying they entered Russian waters despite repeated
warnings, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The islands were seized by Soviet troops in the final days of
World War Two. Japan has been demanding them back ever since.

<HEADLINE> HK-Macao Affairs Official Meets With Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, today
discussed matters of common concern with a delegation from Heung
Yee Kuk in the New Territories, led by its chairman, Lau Wong Fat.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the rights and interests of the inhabitants of the
New Territories should be protected after 1997 in accordance with
the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong
and the Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
This will remain unchanged after the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland because the traditional rights and interests of the
inhabitants of the New Territories are not privileges, but the
result of a struggle between the people of the New Territories and
the British colonialists, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured the visitors that the Chinese government will not
cancel their rights and interests that were achieved through
struggle just because of its resumption of sovereignty over Hong
Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future of Hong Kong, Lu said that maintaining
Hong Kong's stability and prosperity means keeping its position as
an international financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
No attempt to use foreign forces to turn Hong Kong into a place
of political struggle will be allowed and it will violate the
Basic Law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping said that he is optimistic about the future of Hong
Kong, and that he believes that the Selection Committee, composed
of 400 permanent Hong Kong residents, can certainly select the
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in
a way that is satisfactory to all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that Heung Yee Kuk will give all its support to
China's principles and policies toward Hong Kong and make an
effort to implement the "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" policies.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lu also listened to opinions on some Hong
Kong issues presented by members of the delegation.

All major domestic and cross-border mergers and takeovers
within the European Union have to be approved by the Commission
where a deal may lead to a reduction in competition or a monopoly
situation.
</P>
<P>
The EC says that the takeover will not give Auchan a dominant
position in the Portuguese and European market taking into account
the market shares of the two companies and the existence of
competition within the industry.

<P>
Both groups have an important presence in Spain and the
takeover is only likely to have a significant effect in Madrid and
the northern province of Burgos, the commission says in a
communique.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Voices Great Concern over Conference of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today voiced great concern over a conference to be held in London
with the participation of Islamic fundamentalists throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, Mubarak said
that many people, who will attend the conference, support
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The conference does not serve the cause of international
terrorism combating and raises several questions, which we hope
will be answered in the coming days," he said while meeting with
members of the Alexandria University Council. His statements were
carried by Egypt's national news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
It had been reported earlier that the conference, scheduled for
September 9, will be held under the name "The International
Islamic Conference Rally for Revival." It is sponsored by the
London-based al-Muhajiroon, a newly formed Moslem fundamentalist
group.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security authorities have been taking steps in a
bid to foil the convocation of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Arab political circles have criticized the British government
for allowing such a gathering under the pretext of democracy and
human rights, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak and other Egyptian officials have complained
repeatedly that European countries and the United States have
provided safe havens for extremists, who oppose governments in the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, Egypt has been haunted by a violent
anti-government campaign launched by Islamic extremists in an
attempt to install strict Islamic rule in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Again Links Success of Economic Summit with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today reiterated that progress must be achieved in the Middle East
peace process to ensure the success of a regional economic
conference to be held in Cairo between November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
"The convocation of the conference without taking serious steps
toward the establishment of just peace in the region would make
prospects for its success slim and could bar some parties from
participation," Mubarak said in Egypt's port city of Alexandria
when meeting with members of the Alexandria University Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is keen to make the Middle East and North
Africa Economic Summit a success, according to Egypt's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within one week that Mubarak linked the
success of the regional economic summit with progress in Arab-
Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Mubarak indicated that he may cancel the
conference if peace talks remain deadlocked.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry
announced here today that Foreign Minister David Levy will pay his
first official visit to Egypt Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Levy will hold talks in the Egyptian
port city Alexandria with President Hosni Mubarak and his
counterpart Amr Moussa to discuss bilateral issues and the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Levy will return home late that day at the end of the visit,
his first visit to an Arab country since taking office in June.
</P>
<P>
Levy's visit comes against the background that Egypt,
disappointed in the stagnation of the peace process, has
threatened to cancel a regional economic summit due to be held
this November in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He will be the second senior Israeli leader to visit Egypt
after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's first trip to Cairo in
July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said Israel placed importance on Levy's
visit, which is mainly aimed at alleviating Arab's growing
dissatisfaction with the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak threatened last Thursday to cancel the Cairo
economic summit over Israel's lack of initiatives in restarting
the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in a bid to soothe Egypt's concerns, telephoned
Mubarak the same day to assure him that Israel would resume
formal peace talks with Palestinians "in the very near future."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold held
talks in Paris Tuesday night with his Egyptian counterpart Osama
al-Baz, which was also joined by U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Gold described the meeting as a "useful" one that touched on
various "meaningful issues," including how to prevent
deterioration in Israeli-Egyptian relations and to reactivate the
peace talks, but no agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
Other than the worry about the stalled peace process, media
reports said, the Egyptian side was also concerned about last
week's successful test of the Arrow anti-missile missile by
Israel, fearing it could change the military balance in the
region.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Levy is also expected to travel to
Paris on September 10, the first official visit to France by a
member of Netanyahu's government.

<HEADLINE> US Calls Off Talks With Britain Over "Open Skies" Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has called off
today's talks with Britain over an "open skies" agreement,
throwing into deep doubt the planned alliance between British
Airways and the American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the U.S. and British transport departments
are due to start two days of talks in Washington today in a bid to
strike a bilateral aviation agreement, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has reportedly announced that it had told
British negotiators that there was no point in coming to
Washington because British proposals fell so far short of providing
essential elements of an open skies agreement that talks would not
produce any positive results.
</P>
<P>
Paul Gretch, the leading U.S. negotiator, described the rift
between the sides as "a serious hitch" and he explained "the
British proposal fell so short of what we see as a true open skies
agreement in so many ways that it did not form a basis for
productive discussions and it was not appropriate to continue."
</P>
<P>
The British side has been resisting U.S. demands that its
carriers be given the right to fly to third countries from British
airports, the so-called "beyond rights."
</P>
<P>
British officials said that Britain would not grant "beyond
rights" for any American passenger flights, which allow U.S.
carriers to fly within the European Union market, while foreign
airlines do not have the right to fly between two points in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the surprise U.S. decision to pull out of the
talks, British government officials said that they were surprised
at the U.S. move and British proposals "go a long way to removing
restrictions on the aviation market, in particular the opening of
airports."
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded an open skies agreement with Britain
before it gives the green light to the proposed alliance between
British Airways (BA) and the American Airlines, which is expected
to create the world's most powerful aviation partnership.
</P>
<P>
British Airways said that it thought the delay in negotiations
would be temporary and "both sides are committed to delivering an
open skies agreement."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the American Airlines reportedly said that the
American Airlines was "surprised and disappointed at the
postponement of the talks," but he expressed the hope the delay
would be temporary.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks on substantive issues such as access to
Heathrow airport and the American demand for beyond rights is
expected to be held in London in September.

<HEADLINE> SFA Bans 3 More Ex-Barings Directors From City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Three more middle-ranking former
executives of Barings Bank were barred Tuesday from working in the
City and ordered to pay thousands of pounds in costs by a City
watchdog for management failures in the run-up to the collapse of
the bank 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), the City's leading
regulator, announced that George Maclean, head of the banking
group at Baring Investment Bank (BIB), Anthony Hawes, group
treasurer of BIB, and Anthony Gamby, director of settlements at
BIB, had all failed to act with "due skill, care and diligence."
</P>
<P>
Maclean, the most senior, was reprimanded, had his personal
registration with the SFA as a director suspended for two years
and was ordered to pay costs of 10,000 pounds (15,500 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Barings asset and liability committee and of
the management committee which made key decisions in the
investment bank, Maclean was involved in compiling a dismissive
response to probing questions from SIMEX, the Singapore market
authority, a month before the collapse, the watchdog said.
</P>
<P>
Hawes was removed from the SFA's registers of directors and
managers and cannot reapply for three years, and was also ordered
to pay 10,000 pounds costs.
</P>
<P>
The SFA said that Hawes authorized the flow of funds to
Singapore which were supposedly used as deposits with the Futures
Exchange, but a significant portion was not reconciled and was in
fact supporting Nick Leeson's unauthorized trading activities.
</P>
<P>
Gamby was reprimanded and his registration with the SFA as a
director suspended for one year. He is to pay 5,000 pounds (7,750
U.S. dollars) in costs.
</P>
<P>
The SFA found that he failed to ensure the settlements
department understood, controlled and reconciled the provisions of
funds to the Singapore futures operation.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday'a announcement brings to five the number of Barings
directors disciplined over the affair. Chief executive Peter
Norris and director Geoffrey Broadhurst have already had their SFA
registrations suspended for up to three years in May.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions of investigations into four other directors are
still pending.

<HEADLINE> UK Decommissions Last Polaris Nuclear Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The last four British Polaris
nuclear submarines were formally withdrawn from active service at
the Faslane navy base in Scotland earlier today, marking the end
of an era.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major and Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo attended the decommissioning ceremony of HMS Repulse,
which completed the last of its 60 patrols in May.
</P>
<P>
Portillo told reporters, "It was the fact that no enemy was
willing to take on the nuclear deterrent in the West that
preserved the peace."
</P>
<P>
"We need to make sure we are still defended and we hope not to
have to use these weapons, but having these weapons is the best
guarantee we won't have to go to war," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Polaris nuclear submarines have been replaced by new
Trident nuclear submarines, which are almost twice as big and
carry advanced missiles with much longer range.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawn Polaris submarines are to be tied up and left to
rust at another Scottish naval base, Rosyth, while an underground
storage site for nuclear waste is built.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Appropriates Funds for Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government, in a
regular cabinet session summoned by Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri
and presided by President Elias Hrawi today, decided a series of
appropriations for reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers approved a bill allocating 30 billion
Lebanese pounds (19.17 million U.S. dollars) of treasury loans to
the Central Fund for Displaced, Information Minister Farid Mkari
announced at the end of the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mkari said that the allocation was aimed at completing the work
of returning the people, displaced by the 1975-90 civil war and
repeated Israeli aggressions in south Lebanon, to their villages.
</P>
<P>
The second decision the cabinet made was to transfer 63
billion Lebanese pounds (40 million dollars) to the Council of
Development and Reconstruction from the 1996 budget of the
Ministry of Transportation to start the work of expanding the
Beirut International Airport.
</P>
<P>
It also approved a bill providing 37 billion Lebanese pounds
(23.64 million dollars) of treasury loans to Ellissar, a
newly-established public company in charge of developing Beirut's
predominantly Shiite south suburbs.
</P>
<P>
With the sum, the company would continue the work it had
started to evacuate the displaced people from the squated
premises, the information minister added.
</P>
<P>
It was noticed that the appropriations were made at a time when
two of Lebanon's five-phase parliamentary elections have finished
and the third is to be held in the capital of Beirut Sunday in
which the prime minister will stand in order to win one of the 128
seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates have scored a crushing victory in
the previous two rounds of election in Mount Lebanon and in North
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The information minister, however, denied that the 30 billion
Lebanese pounds allocated to the Central Fund for Displaced was
for rewarding the displaced people for their participation in the
election.
</P>
<P>
"It is within the country's duties to return the displaced to
their homelands and it has nothing to do with the rewards," said
the minister, who won a seat in the election in his constituency
in North Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UK World Trade Deficit Flat in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
showed minimal change at 1.118 billion pounds (1.732 billion U.S.
dollars) in June, according to official figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the June
figure of the deficit on visible trade with the rest of the world
compares with a revised May figure of 1.116 billion pounds (1.729
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figure was better than City analysts' expectation of a
deficit of around 1.4 billion pounds (2.17 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total exports fell slightly to 13.63 billion pounds (21.13
billion dollars) from 13.95 billion pounds (21.62 billion dollars)
and imports to 14.75 billion pounds (22.86 billion dollars) from
15.07 billion pounds (23.36 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the trend for the deficit was flat, but some
economists predicted that rising consumer demand was likely to
boost imports in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The government welcomed the news and said that the figure
demonstrated the strength of export growth.

<HEADLINE> US-Central America Trade Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The trade between the United
States and Central American countries continued its upward climb
during the first five months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Journal of Commerce reported here today that the total U.S.
trade with Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Panama rose from 5.57 billion U.S. dollars in the
first five months of 1995 to 5.95 billion U.S. dollars in the same
period this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect it will keep growing at a healthy trend as the
U.S. forges closer business relationships with its Central
American partners.
</P>
<P>
Total trade last year was 13.73 billion U.S. dollars, up 15
percent from 11.92 billion U.S. dollars in 1994, with goods moving
between the United States and Nicaragua jumping the most, 38
percent, followed by U.S. trade with Honduras, up 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that Central America's trade volume
with the United States will surpass U.S.-Caribbean trade within
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, U.S. imports from Central America rose 20 percent,
double the growth rate of U.S. imports from the entire Latin
American region, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of 1996, U.S. imports, mainly woven
and knit apparel, fruits and nuts, spices, coffee and tea, reached
2.9 billion U.S. dollars, up from 2.5 billion U.S. dollars a year
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for General Strike to Protest Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today called for a general strike in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip Thursday to protest the Israeli
plans to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Palestinian Council (PC) meeting in the West
Bank town of Ramallah, Arafat said Israel's decision to expand
settlement activity is a declaration of war on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's strongest condemnation of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government came one day after the Israeli
Defense Ministry approved plans for building a new neighborhood in
a settlement in the West Bank, and the Jerusalem Municipality
demolished a Palestinian building in Jerusalem's old city.
</P>
<P>
The new neighborhood, comprises 1,800 housing units, will be
built in the Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Safer, and 900 housing
units will be constructed at the first stage of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Municipality claimed that Palestinian
building, which the Palestinians said was served as a center for
the city's handicapped, was demolished because it was built
without a license, and financed by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called on all Moslems, including Arab Israelis, to pray
at the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem in the coming Friday prayer,
despite the Israeli closure and roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader denounced Israel's activities in the
West Bank and Jerusalem, and invited Israeli Arabs, Jews and
Christians to join him in the war, which he said Israel has
started.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since Arafat arrived in the Palestinian
autonomous areas in 1994 that he called for a general strike and
urged Palestinian to pray at the Aqsa Mosque despite Israeli
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli media pointed out that such calls were common
during the period of Intifada (Palestinian uprising) before the
Oslo peace accords were signed between Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The general strike will last between 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.
local time Thursday (0500-0900 GMT), according to the Palestinian
Radio.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Arafat, at first, had demanded for a
24-hour shutdown, but following deliberation from the PC, the
decision was limited to just four hours.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's political adviser, told Israel Radio that
the Israeli government started the escalation of tensions by
totally ignoring the Palestinian side, adding that the Israeli
activity in Jerusalem was the most dangerous step.
</P>
<P>
Tibi declined to say that Arafat's call was a signal of
renewing of the Intifada, but he said that the Israeli
government's policy "was not only leading to a deadlock, but a
dangerous lock."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Arafat's declaration, Netanyahu's office
released a statement today warning that the government will
response sharply to any attempts to worsen the situation, or to
any violence that would damage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Israel calls upon Arafat to refrain from
making such declarations and extreme actions which do not
contribute to advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat should take into account that the two sides are
involved in formulating understandings which will bring the
negotiations forward on a series of important subjects, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nissim Zvilli, secretary-general of the Labor Party,
Israel's leading opposition party, called on Arafat not to let the
Palestinians return to the days of violence.
</P>
<P>
Zvilli said that it is easy to understand the Palestinians'
disappointment over the freeze of negotiations on the
implementation of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, returning to violence would only bring
further suffering for the Palestinians and undermine efforts to
find a true solution to the conflict between the two sides.

PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today expressed his support for French cattle farmers suffering
from the considerable loss caused by the "mad cow" crisis which
erupted in Europe this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French government said today that France will
ask the European Union (EU) to compensate the loss of French
farmers specialized in the breeding of broutards cattle, who
produce 90 percent of such cattle in the EU market.
</P>
<P>
"The cattle farmers are in danger. The government knows their
problems, understands their problems and will support them in the
difficult crisis they are going through. We need our cattle
farmers," said Chirac when attending a cabinet meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will meet Thursday several delegates of some 100 cattle
farmers from Charroux, Vienne, who set off from home with 20 cows
on August 11 on a march towards Paris to protest the crisis caused
by the "mad cow" scare in Europe.

Before his departure at the end of a three-day visit to
Baghdad, Ekeus said that he held four rounds of talks with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and both sides agreed to solve
the issue of access and laid down "procedures on how to solve
the matter of prohibited materials."
</P>
<P>
However, Ekeus said that the Iraqi words would only have weight
if they were translated into action in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We got strong undertaking from Iraqi leaders that they
intended to faithfully and truthfully comply with the statement
reached on June 22," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of standoffs between the U.N. and Iraq on
inspections of Iraq's weapons program this year, the
U.N. inspectors reached an agreement on June 22 with Iraqi
authorities that promised to allow U.N. inspectors "immediate,
unrestricted and unconditional" access to any sites the
U.N. weapons inspectors want to go.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq blocked U.N. inspections shortly after the
signing of the agreement on grounds of national security. The
U.N. Security Council accused Iraq's behavior and demanded it
keeps promise.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, the Iraqi deputy prime
minister denied today that Iraq hides any prohibited arms or arms
components or documents related to them.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "allegations that Iraq concealed prohibited
weapons are false reports spread by the United States and
mercenary agencies employed by American intelligence with the aim
of misleading the UNSCOM, the Security Council and international
community to render various excuses to maintain the U.N. sanctions
on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said that during his talks with Ekeus, Iraq has affirmed
that the time has come for reclosing the files opened after the
August 1995 defection to Jordan of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's two sons-in-law.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq will insist on its demand for closing the
arms files so that para 22 of the U.N. resolution 687 on lifting
the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed crippling sanctions on Iraq,
including a ban on its vital oil exports, in 1990. The world body
will consider lifing the embargo only if Iraq destroys all its
long-range missiles and halt its nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons program.

Deputy Director of the Department of Veterinary Services
Welbourne Madzima explained that the disease had been detected in

The disease, which was traditionally transmitted by chickens,
is spreading unusually fast as its has been carried by birds such
as sparrows.

Madzima said Zimbabwe did not import live chickens from South

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF to Weigh Debt Relief of Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering a plan of debt
relief of heavily indebted poor African countries.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by Ethiopian Finance Minister
Sufian Ahmed who said the decision is to be made at their annual
meeting scheduled in Washington
</P>
<P>
Sufian said Ethiopia is one of the several Sub-Saharan African
countries benefiting from the package.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Ethiopia owed bilateral and
multilateral creditors more than three billion U.S. Dollars
excluding the amount it was indebted to the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister said the World Bank and the IMF will
definitely take "some form of action" but the amount to be
slashed from Africa's debt stock is yet to be decided by the
meeting, adding that "there is hope that the reduction will be
substantial."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the IMF and the World Bank have not so far
been involved in the reduction and rescheduling of the debt of
poor countries, pointing out the initiative was aimed at taking a
joint action by bilateral and multilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiation with the Paris Club creditors was going on
to push up a 50 percent debt reduction they granted Ethiopia three
years ago. "There is optimism that the next package may go as high
as 90 percent," said the Ethiopian Minister.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's debt is unsustainable with debt service ratio of 47
percent, compared with 20-25 percent debt service to export ratio
defined by the World Bank.

MAPUTO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Around 30,000 mines have been
removed in Mozambique since 1992, the Mozambican News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
But Philipe Decquemare, chief of the Handicapped

Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"Mozambique will have to need the experts to remove the
mines during the next 20 years," said Decquemare.
</P>
<P>
The mining experts working Mozambique are coming from 15
countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, South

<HEADLINE> AL Denounces Israeli Decision to Expand Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
condemned the reported Israeli decision to build 900 new houses in
a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, saying that it would lay a
new obstacle in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league said in a statement that such a fresh
move by the Israeli government would cause more tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
This renders the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks
meaningless and insignificant, the statement said, noting that the
move is designed to impose a fait accompli on the occupied
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that the Israeli government tends to
continue the fait accompli policy by Judaizing the Palestinian
lands and seizing them for the sake of Jewish settlers," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the Israeli Defense Ministry has approved
the construction of 900 apartments in the Kiryat Sifr settlement,
west of the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League said that it is deeply worried over
the reports as they came in the wake of a continued campaign by
hardline settlers and the demolition by Israel of an Arab building
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The building, financed by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), was only used to carry out charitable activities, the
league said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Urged To Prevent Spread of Cattle Lung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Transvaal Agricultural
Union (TAU) of South Africa has urged the government to take urgent
steps to tight border control to prevent the spread of
cattle lung disease, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pietersburg, the TAU said thousands of
cattle had to be culled after contracting the infectious Bovine lung
disease, which had already been eradicated in South Africa more than
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the outbreak of the disease in Botswana, Namibia and
Tanzania posed a serious threat to the entire South African cattle
population and particularly to provinces bordering Botswana and
Namibia, said the union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAU's Red Meat Producers Organisation Chairman Gert Roets
said effective border control is impractical and does not exist in
large parts of Botswana and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, cattle possibly infected with the disease were allowed
to roam freely into South Africa, said Roets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, South Africa once imposed a temporary ban to
import cattle from Botswana and Namibia, but lifted after test on the
animals turned out to be negative.
</P>
<P>
The TAU asked the government to force the southern African
Development Community member countries to use available
technology and vaccine to eradicate the disease or contain it.
</P>
<P>
roets said animal health care in other southern african countries
did not nearly compare to the services rendered in south africa to
keep livestock free from contagious disease.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he suggested the government seriously consider
deploying the South African National Defense Force commandos in
regions bordering neighboring countries to effectively patrol borders
and prevent the uncontrolled movement of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Commandos will also be able to prevent cattle smuggling into
South Africa, added Roets.

today made mixed reactions to the decision made by the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) that its
leader Jonas Savimbi will not serve as second vice-president in
the government.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA MP Norberto de Castro said that the decision

Ria Pereira, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, said that
the UNITA decision did not surprise him because Savimbi's recent

vice-presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Six countries have expressed
their readiness to send troops to beef up the strength of the
west African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, operating in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources said here today that Cote D'Voire and Bukina
Faso will for the first time dispatch their troops to join ECOMOG
while Ghana, Gambia, Benin and Mali are to send more men.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian soldiers have been serving in ECOMOG since the
operation began in 1990, but their strength has been scaled down
following series of frustrations in the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Gambia too has been maintaining some norminal presence along
with Mali which has merely sent military observers, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that there are some 12,000 ECOMOG soldiers
currently operating in Liberia. ECOMOG Field Commander Victor
Malu has said recently that about 18,000 officers and men will be
required to carry out the assignments of the force.
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Nigeria's Director of Defense Information
Fred Chijuka on Tuesday, will be solved if all the countries with
troops already serving with ECOMOG can contribute 1,000 troops
each.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG was established six years ago on the basis of five
battalions from Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Nigeria now has sent about 7,000 soldiers to the peacekeeping
mission, the largest contingent among the countries with troops
in ECOMOG.

JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-eight percent of
South Africans were in favor of a ban on tobacco advertisement,
Department of Health Director-General Olive Shisana said today.

<P>
This was revealed by a recent survey commissioned by the

<P>
Addressing a tobacco control workshop in Pretoria, Shisana said
the public clearly believed that freedom from an unnecessary and
avoidable burden of disease must take precedence over an
industry's freedom to promote a deadly product.
</P>
<P>
Shisana said smoking holds a serious threat to South Africa's
development, adding the international community has cautioned on
the effects of tobacco on sustainable and equitable development.
</P>
<P>
"If current smoking trends continue, health authorities will
have to siphon scarce financial and human resources into dealing
with smoking-related diseases," she added.

It is reported that lung and throat cancer, heart disease and
other smoking-related ailments has already become a common health

<P>
The accord envisages reciprocal visits by both countries to
defense industry facilities and the transfer of technology,
know-how and technical expertise in military fields.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters
today that Turkey had previously signed such defense industry
agreements with around 20 countries and that it was a standard
framework agreement, adding that Turkey had also such accords
with some Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February sparked a row in Middle East countries who are afraid
that Turkey is aligning itself with Israel against Syria and
other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: India Needs Additional Reforms to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- India needs additional
reforms to sustain high economic growth and poverty reduction, the
World Bank said in its latest country economic memorandum which
was released here today.
</P>
<P>
The 219-page report, entitled "India -- Five Years of
Stabilization and Reform: The Challenges Ahead," will serve as a
supporting background document for the annual India Development
Forum Meeting to be held in Tokyo from September 18 to 20 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the stabilization and reform measures
introduced since 1991 have considerably improved India's growth
prospects, but strong additional measures are required for India
to match the high East Asian growth rates of 7 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
After the fall in the GDP growth rate to less than 1 percent in
the crisis year 1991-92, a strong supply-side response to the
economic reforms, aided by a string of good monsoons, pushed the
growth to 5 percent in 1992-94, 6 percent in 1994-95 and 7 percent
in 1995-96, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the economic growth has been accompanied by an
improvement in industrial productivity, the report noted, adding
that driven by exports and private investment as well as an
increase in domestic savings, the recovery has not put pressure on
external accounts or inflation.
</P>
<P>
By reforming of the exchange rates and tariffs, it said, the
south Asian country's exports have recorded strong growth of over
20 percent over the past three years. However, despite rapid
growth of imports, this has helped contain the current account
deficit within prudential limits of below 2 percent of GDP, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of both the capital and current accounts have
increased foreign exchange reserves to 17 billion U.S. dollars and
reduced the debt service ratio from 30 percent of current receipts
in 1990-91 to 24 percent in 1995-96, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of future challenges are India's persistently
large imbalances, which have led to an increasing volume of public
debt and are accompanied by rising real interest rates, the World
Bank report said. The report proposed a strategy for fiscal
consolidation that could help raise public sector savings by 6
percent of GDP over the next four to five years.
</P>
<P>
Improving the efficiency of Indian agriculture is the key to
high growth and poverty reduction, the report stressed. It pointed
out that while India spends twice as much on agriculture as East
Asian neighbors, it comes out far less growth.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge facing India is an imminent crisis in
infrastructure, the World Bank noted, stressing that recent
government initiatives in raising investment in infrastructure and
improving services need to be carried forward.

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President Meets with Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine
Ben Ali met here today with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Moussa conveyed to the Tunisian president a
letter from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the outcome of the
recent contacts undertaken by President Mubarak with the parties
concerned on the Middle East peace process, the obstacles
encountering the process, and ways of pushing it forward.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also dealt with the Israeli decision of expanding
Jewish settlements and the overall Arab situation within the
framework of the recent Cairo Arab summit as well as bilateral
relations between Egypt and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Moussa indicated that Syria had announced its readiness to
resume negotiations with the Israeli side in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are also prepared to resume negotiations with
Israel over the final phase which includes such issues as
settlements, Jerusalem, refugees and self determination, the
Egyptian foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that all Arab parties are ready for the resumption
of negotiations on the basis of the Madrid conference resolutions
without compromise.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Israel now to demonstrate its desire for peace,"
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Moussa summed up the Arab stance by saying that "we favor
peace with Israel, provided it be a just and balanced peace on the
basis of the framework agreed upon in Madrid."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Tunisian president entrusted him with a
letter in reply to President Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister, who arrived here from Damascus,
Syria Tuesday, left here this evening to continue his Arab-African
tour, which will also take him to Mauritania and Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Formulating Program for ECOWAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Foreign Affairs
Ministry said today that it is currently formulating ''an
articulated and achievable program'' for the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The program, to be carried out during the tenure of Head of
State General Sani Abacha as chairman of the organisation, will
be consistent with the objectives enunciated by Abacha in a
speech after his election as the chairm on July 27, according to
the ministry's Director-General Jibrin Chinade.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Abacha pledged to focus on the socio-economic
goals of the sub-regional body which has been compelled by the
Liberian crisis to concentrate on security issues in the last six
years.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Ministry has established an ECOWAS unit
recently to engage in issues related to the organization. This is
a demonstration of the ministry's readiness to respond to the
challenges posed by Abacha's assumption of ECOWAS chairmanship,
according to Chinade.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the revitalization of the National Permanent
Committee of ECOWAS, arguing that it could be turned into a task
force for the implementation of the head of state's program.
</P>
<P>
The official meanwhile called for close cooperation among
relevant ministries to achieve the desired objective.
</P>
<P>
On the local negative comments on the country's involvement in
conflict resolution, Chinade said that Nigeria has made
substantial contribution to the initiative of the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
''We have undertaken this commitment in the belief that peace
in west Africa, which is our immediate area of concern, is a
pre-requisite for the economic integration of the sub-region,''
he argued.
</P>
<P>
It was in recognition of the comparative cost advantage of
conflict prevention, he noted, that the Organization of Africa
Unity has decided to set up an early warning system linked to
relevant united nations and sub-regional organizations to promote
the prevention of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Lamenting the poor international support for the attainment of
this objective in the continent, the official also called on the
international community to render ''genuine and concrete
assistance toward resolving the continent's conflicts''.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Worried Over Civilian Plight in Tajik Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 28 s cut off in the Tajik town of Tavildara, which
was retaken by the opposition forces on August 16.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC news reldisabled people left without food or medicines,
and it was impossible for them to undertake the three-day trek
across the mountains necessary for escape.
</P>
<P>
ICRC said it has been trying in vain for six months to gain
access to this region of the Pamirs which separates the
semi-autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan from the rest of the
country. A large part of the province, the Mionadu and Tavildara
valleys, has gradually come under the control of the opposition
forces since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire accord reached between the Tajik government and
the opposition on July 21 has not been working, said ICRC, adding
that both sides have also failed to keep promises to set free
captives and other detainees.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the situation in Grozny, where fighting between
Russian government forces and the Chechen separatists occurred
earlier this month, ICRC said in the news release that peace was
being restored in the Chechen capital in recent days, but few
people fleeing the city in past weeks have returned.
</P>
<P>
It said it resumed distribution of water and food in Grozny two
weeks ago and has recently provided assistance for some 60,000
people in all in the republic.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other sources said that a total of 110,000 people
had fled the chaos in Grozny to neighboring republics over the
past three weeks and the movement has now generally ceased.
</P>
<P>
ICRC said it was currently working to ensure water and medical
supplies for the possible return of people in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
In the news release issued Wednesday, ICRC also said that along
with other international organizations such as the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), it has since July 1994 helped 26,673
lost children in Rwanda and surrounding countries reunite with
their families, and more than 8,000 others at least get in touch
with their loved ones.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Banks See Double-Digit Profit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's big banks continue on
pace to shatter last year's record earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Montreal and the Bank of Nova Scotia has reported
third quarter profits that were sharply higher than in 1995,
according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Montreal made a profit of 220 million U.S. dollars
in the three months ending July 31, up 14 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Its profits for the first nine months of 1996 has reached 640
million U.S. dollars, which is 22 percent higher than last year
and closing in on the record 720 million it made for all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Bank of Nova Scotia said it made a profit of
200 million U.S. dollars in the third quarter, an increase of 22
percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Its profits for the first nine months of 1996 were 573 million,
which is up 22 percent from last year and sure to better last
year's record of 639 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The other four of Canada's big six banks are also expected to
report double-digit profit growth later this week and next week.
</P>
<P>
The earnings of Canadian banks have been surging since 1994
when much of the country's economy is sluggish and consumers are
struggling with heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the huge profits are lower loan-loss
charges and better results at the banks' investment-dealer units,
powered by continued active stock and bond markets, local media
reports said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. SEC Approves Major Changes in Nasdaq Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted today dramatic new reforms aimed
at improving competition and handling of investor orders on the
Nasdaq, a computerized stock market in New York.
</P>
<P>
SEC, the Wall Street watchdog, approved the most ambitious step
on the Nasdaq by a vote of 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The new rules allow certain customer orders to buy or sell
stock to mingle directly with dealers' quotes. And they would
require dealers to give customers the better prices quoted in
separate electronic trading systems that piggyback on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
By improving competition in this fashion, the rules stand to
save investors money by reducing transaction costs and preventing
a form of price fixing uncovered in separate SEC and Justice
Department investigations this summer.
</P>
<P>
It was the most important reforms the SEC adopted since late
1970s which would greatly alter trading practices in the U.S.
securities markets, SEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Two dozen major Nasdaq dealers settled a Justice Department
investigation in July by agreeing to closely monitor their
traders, including tape-recording their telephone calls, and to
take other steps to halt price fixing in stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
And earlier this month, the SEC formally censured Nasdaq and
its parent company for failing to police the market and ordered
Nasdaq to spend 100 million dollars over the next five years to
improve surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing Nasdaq is an unconventional stock market,
where dealers trade stocks over a network of computers and
telephones instead of meeting face-to-face on a trading floor.

<HEADLINE> 300 New Laws Passed In China Since Reform Moves Of the Late 70s (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The end of the 21st session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee in
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today was just like any
other session, with more than a hundred legislators pressing their
buttons to vote, but with one significant difference -- three laws
were passed and the last one was the 300th since the reforms and
opening up started nearly 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, could be
seen with an uncommon smile on his face at the end of the meeting,
when he commented, "This shows that our country has made
remarkable and inspiring achievements in building a legal system
since the reforms and opening up started."
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) at the end of 1978 signaled the beginning of
reforms and opening up for China, and since 1979, the NPC and its
Standing Committee have adopted a new Constitution and two
amendments to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
They have also made 214 laws, and 83 decisions on laws -- for a
total of 300 laws and resolutions on legal matters -- so that "a
socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, with the
Constitution at the core, covering civil, criminal, state
organizational, economic, administrative and procedural law codes,
has been basically established," an official with the Commission
of Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Before the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, China had virtually no laws to follow for years," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was at that juncture, that Deng Xiaoping said that democracy
should be guaranteed by a system and by laws, and that "the system
and laws will not be changed with shifting leaders and shifting
viewpoints and the attention span of the leaders."
</P>
<P>
It was then that China's legislative work entered a new era,
the legislative official said.

<HEADLINE> Water to Be Transported in Bag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Water has now become a new
internationally traded commodity with the increasing shortage of
fresh water in some countries.
</P>
<P>
Some entrepreneurs have found a new way of transporting water
-- in bags instead of in oil tankers, according to a report of the
Journal of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
Water would be shipped in huge tug-rowed fabric bags.
</P>
<P>
Terry G. Spragg, an invention promoter in California, said that
by the end of this year, he will hold extensive sea trials of two
connected bags -- each of 770,000-gallon capacity -- towed by a
tug. Eventually, he hopes to construct bags of nearly seven times
that capacity. He already conducted a 100-mile trial in April
along the northwestern coast.
</P>
<P>
The primary consideration for bags, which is made of industrial
polypropylene, is the cost. Bag transport could be one-third or
more cheaper than any other form of transport, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The inventor uses a patented zipper which would link bags to
one another much like rail cars in a freight train. Up to 50 or 60
bags, he said, could be pulled by a single 4,500-horsepower tug.
</P>
<P>
One way or another, "water will be moved around the world as
oil is now," said John Hayward, the World Bank's top water expert
from North Africa and the Middle East. "Within the next five
years, we'll see a rising recognition that water is an
international commodity."
</P>
<P>
Globally, there is one-third less water per person than 25
years ago, and over the next 30 years, officials estimate, world
water demand will rise more than sevenfold, according to the
report.

TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military in Japan started
its "touch and go" flight training today for the third time this
year at a U.S. air base in western Tokyo despite opposition from
local residents, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Navy field carrier landing exercise is taking place at
Yokota air base in and around the suburbs of Fussa until September
6, but there will be no training on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The "touch and go" exercises involve U.S. early warning planes
such as the Grumman E-2C and transport planes from the aircraft
carrier Independence, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Residents of six cities and towns near the training area have
demanded that the U.S. military call off the exercises.
</P>
<P>
"The noise pollution generated by the air exercises causes a
great deal of harm to the residents of this highly congested
area. All previous exercises have had a detrimental impact on our
lives," residents were quoted by Kyodo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The residents also complained that their protests had been
ignored by the U.S. forces.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Drill to Be Moved out of Okinawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States agreed
today to move the U.S. live-ammunition artillery drills out of
Okinawa Prefecture to five ranges of the Ground Self-Defense Force
(GSDF) in mainland Japan, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese government may have a hard job convincing the
relevant local authorities to accept the plan. They have given a
cool reception to the overtures of Defense Agency chief Hideo Usui
who toured the locations earlier this month, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the combined duration of the drills at the
five sites will total no more than 35 days, with a maximum of four
drills a year, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Each drill will take no longer than 10 days and none of the
five sites will be used more than once a year, according to the
agreement reached during a Japan-U.S. joint committee on the
Okinawa base issue, it said.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the plan in fiscal 1997, the central
government must persuade local governments to agree to it by
December this year, when a budget draft for the next fiscal year
will be compiled.
</P>
<P>
The drills to be relocated are currently carried out at the
U.S. Marine Corps' Camp Hansen, located in the center of Okinawa
Island.
</P>
<P>
There has been growing anti-U.S. sentiment in Japan since the
rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl last September, for which three
U.S. servicemen have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
The incident turned many in Okinawa, including the governor,
Masahide Ota, against the heavy U.S. military presence in their
island prefecture, which holds some 75 percent of the U.S.
military bases in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The five GSDF sites are the Yausubetsu range in Hokkaido, the
Kitafuji range in Yamanashi Prefecture, the Higashifuji range in
Shizuoka Prefecture, the Ojojihara range in Miyagi Prefecture and
the Hijudai range in Oita Prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Affects Southwest Chinese Airport Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Jiangbei Airport in Chongqing,
the largest city in southwest China, was hit by lightning that
scored the runway in three places, in the early hours of August
28, forcing the closing of the airport at six o'clock yesterday,
for 13 hours.
</P>
<P>
The weather in Chongqing was clear and hot until it was hit by
thunder storms on the evening of the 27th. At 5:00 in the morning
of the 28th, airport workers discovered three concrete piles on
the runway, and it was discovered that telephone lines were broken
and part of radar facilities had been destroyed by the lightning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Koreans Join Suit Over Forced Labor in World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An additional 40 South Koreans
joined a lawsuit in a Hiroshima court today against the Japanese
government and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, seeking millions of
yen in back pay and compensation for forced labor in the Japanese
city during World War II, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
They joined the six original claimants who filed suit with the
Hiroshima District Court last December.
</P>
<P>
The 46 South Koreans, many of whom are in their 70s and have
suffered from the effects of radiation from the 1945 atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, are seeking a total of some 500 million yen
(5 million U.S. dollars), Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
They are arguing that after they were unlawfully and forcibly
brought to Japan and made to work, they suffered from the effects
of the bombing and were then set free without any compensation.
</P>
<P>
The number of claimants and the sum sought make it the largest
among six such compensation suits currently lodged with courts in
Japan by former wartime Chinese and Korean forced laborers, the
news service said.

<HEADLINE> Digital Talking Book for The Blind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) --Thanks to a new invention, blind
people will be able to choose any page in a book to "listen" to,
using a CD-ROM with random page access.
</P>
<P>
Swedish and Japanese scientists demonstrated the invention
today at the 62nd General Conference of the International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutions in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The "Plextalk" will be put to experimental use in more than 30
countries at the end of this year, in the Digital Audio-based
Information System program, which was started by organizations for
the blind in Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Stephen King, director of the program, said that the equipment
is superior to cassette talking books, which don't allow the blind
to check the content table of the books and start at random.
</P>
<P>
Plextalk is also more of a bargain, because 10 to 15 cassettes
are needed for a book which can be held on one CD-ROM, said King,
who is also a director at the Royal National Institute for the
Blind.
</P>
<P>
He said that the digital talking book may become a universal
item just like fountain pen, typewriter, and cassette player,
which were also invented for the blind originally.

<HEADLINE> Women's Volleyball GP Marred by Internal Strifes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Japan, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The first leg of World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix preliminaries will start here
Friday with the top three Olympic finishers and host Japan.
</P>
<P>
But what drew the media's attention is the internal conflicts
that had haunted two of the teams.
</P>
<P>
Gone was George Eugenio, who masterminded the successes of the
Olympic gold medalists Cuba in the past decade as the head coach,
was sacked last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's sports authority National Sports Institute (INDER) had
said the removal was because of "conduct incompatible with his
educational role". The National Volleyball Commissioner Inocencio
Cuesta Chapman was also fired.
</P>
<P>
Former assisstant coach Antonio Perdomo replaced Eugenio to
guide the formidible squad at the grand prix here. But at the
news conference he refrained from coming into details as well.
</P>
<P>
"INDER made the new schedules (for sports development) because
they have to strengthen the teams for the Olympic Games in Sydney
in 2000," Perdomo told a news conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Adjustments were made and Eugenio was no longer the head coach
of the Cuban women's volleyball team," he added.
</P>
<P>
Perdomo said he was not officially appointed head coach because
the national volleyball governing body was also reshuffled.
</P>
<P>
"My job adjustment needs the sanction of the volleyball
association, including the commissioner," Perdomo said. "So I
cannot say I am the head coach already."
</P>
<P>
Perdomo said, "I know the players had been under the guidance
of Eugenio for a long time. But the players are same as before and
I know each of them well like Eugenio. So I think I can do what
he had done."
</P>
<P>
He has to do without Olympic stars Mireya Luis and Magaly
Carvajal, both of whom retired after Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The other victim fell to internal conflicts is Japan, who hit a
all-time low at the Olympics after its failure to enter the last
eight in Atlanta last month.
</P>
<P>
But Japan will field an even weaker line-up at the grand prix
as two of its veteran players, Mika Yamauchi and Tomoko Yoshihara,
were absent.
</P>
<P>
Both players are from Japan's Daiei Club and there were reports
that Daiei had been at odds with the country's volleyball body.
</P>
<P>
The head coach is also new. Nobuchika Kuzuwa is in, Noriyuki
Muneuchi is out.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to gather experience," said Kuzuwa from NEC
Club. "I am confident that my players could do their best here."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the other two teams, Olympic runners-up China and
bronze medalist Russia, are basking in a stabler situation.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Lang Ping was worried that her players could
be too tired after the Olympics, while Russian coach Nikolai
Karpol hoped his team could fare better than in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Lang said two of the Olympians, hit by the flu, were left
behind in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday China will try to avenge its loss in the Olympic
final when they play Cuba, while Russia will face Japan.
</P>
<P>
The eight-nation grand prix event will last five weeks, with
the first four as preliminaries. The other four teams are the
Netherlands, defending champion United States, Brazil and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary stage, the eight teams are divided into two
groups to play round-robin matches in two cities simultaneously in
each weekend. The Sendai event runs along with a leg in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The top three overall finishers and host China will enter the
finals in Shanghai, China in late September.

<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Premier Li Peng spoke
highly of the role of Rajiv Gandhi in developing Indian-Chinese
relations and said that he hopes that the long Sino-Indian border
will become a place of friendship to benefit the peoples of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The comment came today at a meeting with Mrs. Sonia Gandhi,
Rajiv Gandhi's widow and president of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation
of India, in the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi is in China to attend the Symposium on Retrospects
and Prospects of Sino-Indian Relations, which is sponsored by the
Center for Peace and Development Studies of the China Association
for International Friendly Contact and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute
on Contemporary Studies of India.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Symposium, which ended Wednesday, focused on
improving Sino-Indian relations to meet the needs of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi's China trip in 1988 had an important influence in
improving the two countries' relations. The visit could be termed
a turning point in bilateral relations, Li noted, and there have
been quite a few exchanges between the two countries in various
fields and leaders of the two countries have maintained contact on
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Praising the role of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, Li said that
the Foundation and other non-governmental organizations in India
have played a positive role in advancing bilateral relations. "You
are the envoys of non-governmental diplomacy, and have been
playing a useful role in enhancing mutual understanding and
friendship and developing friendly cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Gandhi said that this is her third China trip. The first was
with her husband Rajiv Gandhi when he was Indian Prime Minister,
and the visit left her a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li visited India in 1991, and together, the two visits
put bilateral relations on a track of normal development, Gandhi
noted. She also promised that her Foundation will continue to
contribute to increasing the friendship of the two peoples and to
developing relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Closing Session of 8th NPC Standing Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A law that protects the rights
and interests of the elderly and one on the coal industry, and
amendments to a law on mineral resources were passed here today at
the final meeting of the 21st session of the Standing Committee of
the 8th National People's Congress (NPC), and President Jiang
Zemin signed them into law.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC,
presided over today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Protecting Rights and Interests of the Elderly,
which takes effect October 1, states that it is the obligation of
the children to provide economic and spiritual support for their
elderly parents, something which is part of Chinese tradition.
</P>
<P>
The law also states that children as well as their spouses who
refuse to provide support or who infringe upon the rights and
interests of the elderly are subject to penalties.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments to the Law on Mineral Resources, which take
effect January 1, 1997, state that factories must be licensed
before they can have the right to mine.
</P>
<P>
The law is intended to protect the country's mineral resources,
ecology, and safety of the workers.
</P>
<P>
The Law on the Coal Industry, whose goal is safeguarding
China's coal resources and standardizing coal industry operations
and which is to take effect on December 1, is a detailed set of
rules on coal production, building of coal mines, and safeguarding
mine areas.
</P>
<P>
Agreements signed by the presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan, and Tajikistan on confidence-building in
the military field in border areas, on April 26, 1996 in Shanghai,
were approved at the meeting, along with a list of names of
officials who have been appointed to office or dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that, since the first session of the 8th NPC in March
1993, the Congress and its Standing Committee have passed 89 laws
and resolutions on legal matters, including a number on the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"A major step has been taken in forming a legal framework for a
socialist market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China in late 1978, to today's closing meeting,
a total of 300 laws and resolutions on legal matters have been
approved by the NPC and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for the National Economy
and Social Development and the Long-term Goals for the Year 2010,
which was passed at the 4th session of the 8th NPC, states that
"China intends to build a socialist country ruled by law."
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that "the NPC and its Standing Committee will
continue to give priority to legislative work, in a move to put
that important principle into practice," and added that the
Standing Committee of the NPC will do its utmost to improve and
strengthen the enforcement of those laws.

BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- An air operation which enables
humanitarian aid to be flown into crisis-stricken areas of
Somalia, southern Sudan and Uganda, has been extended again for

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Crashes in Northern Norway, No Survivors Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A Russian airliner with 129
passengers and 12 crew on board crashed on Norway's remote Arctic
island of Spitzbergen on Thursday and all 141 people are believed
dead, reports here say.
</P>
<P>
A rescue operation has been launched but so far no survivors
have been found and no one appeared to have survived the disaster,
the Norwegian news agency NTB quoted Norwegian officials and
Russian airline officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the plane, a Tupolev 154 belonging to Russian
carrier Vnukovo Airlines, was found 10 kilometers east of
Longyearbyen, the only airport on the island, said spokesman Finn
Bjoernar Hansen at the north Norway Bodoe rescue center.
</P>
<P>
The flight from Moscow, due to arrive at around 10:15
a.m. (0815 GMT), lost contact with the airport shortly before it
was due to land.
</P>
<P>
The plane was reportedly carrying Russian workers to a coal
mine in the area. Russia runs a coal mine near the town of
Barentsburg under an agreement with Norway.
</P>
<P>
NTB said three Norwegian helicopters, two Russian helicopters
and an aircraft were searching for the missing flight on the
island.
</P>
<P>
But Bjoernar Hansen said the center still knew nothing about
the fate of the passengers.

</P>
<P>
The refugees and displaced people now are living in Sudan and
Ethiopia.
</P>

The EC has also cleared a package of emergency food aid worth 2
million ECU (2.6 million dollars) which the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees will use for food aid programs in
Algeria, Nepal, Thailand and the Congo before the end of 1996.

KUWAIT CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The volume of trade in
Kuwait's Stock Exchange Market dropped by 26.6 percent in the
week ending Wednesday while its value dropped by 17.6 percent
compared with the previous week, according to a bourse report
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the shares traded during this period dropped
from 489 million to 358.5 million and the total value dropped from
87.7 million Kuwait Dinars (289.4 million U.S. dollars) to 72.2
million Kuwait dinars (238.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of contracts also dropped by 17.8
percent, falling from 5,772 to around 4,743.
</P>
<P>
However, the share index rose by 13.2 points to reach 1623.4
points over last week's closing rate.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the volume fall is normal after rising for a few
consecutive weeks. It could also be due to the fact that the
private debtors involved in a program to settle 20 billion
dollars of bad debt owed to the state have to pay a portion
of the debt in the first week of September.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the market would be much stronger in the
second week of September after the bad debt payment and when many

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Launch Tariff Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is to launch a tariff
reform program which includes offering developing countries
preferential tariffs to boost their exports to the country, the
Finance and Economy Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
One of the plans aims to help South Korean businesses who
import goods or raw materials used in products which are
re-exported.
</P>
<P>
The government is to introduce a quarterly settlement of
drawback accounts, estimated at a total of 1.46 billion
U.S. dollars a year. Drawbacks are refunds of import duties when
taxed products are re-exported.
</P>
<P>
At present, exporters, who import materials used in finished
goods for export, are required to pay duties on such materials
within 15 days of every import declaration and are reimbursed for
the duties they have paid after all the products made from the
imported materials have been exported.
</P>
<P>
The new drawback account settlement system will free up some
340 million dollars a year which these companies can use in other
ways, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Another plan calls for the introduction of a control system for
foreign goods trans-shipped through South Korean sea and air ports
to prevent them from using the country's trademarks or being
disguised as goods of South Korean origin.
</P>
<P>
The reforms will be introduced in the National Assembly for
approval during the next session of parliament which opens in
September.

gas, estimated at 50 million standard cubic feet, by supplying
gas through the pipeline to solve the energy crisis being faced
by countries in the sub-region.

<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia should
respect and trust each other, keep political relations healthy,
and promote economic and trade ties as well as co-operate in
diverse sectors, based on equality and mutual benefit in a bid to
push bilateral ties to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji during a
meeting with Tim Fischer, Australia's deputy prime minister and
minister of trade, here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the two countries' leaders have maintained
exchanges and contacts, advancing bilateral relations a
considerable amount. Since the establishment of its coalition
government half a year ago, Australia has sent four cabinet
ministers to China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral economic and trade co-operation has
also scored sound development. The two countries are important
trade partners, and bilateral trade is increasing annually, while
economic and technological co-operation has improved.
</P>
<P>
According to the Vice-Premier, Australia is one of China's
important foreign investment sources and one of the countries
where China's overseas investment is directed.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, still great potential for economic and
technological co-operation that hasn't been exploited, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that the goal of his China visit is to explore
ways of increasing co-operation by the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Australian coalition government, like
preceding governments, will continue to devote itself to
developing co-operation with the Asian region and that his
government puts priority to developing bilateral ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Australia will strive to expand its economic and trade ties
with China, Fischer said, and his country is willing not only to
provide China with primary products but also to reinforce
co-operation in hi-tech products and financial services.
</P>
<P>
Fischer and his party arrived in Shanghai Wednesday at Zhu's
invitation.

purpose came to 117.8 billion yuan in 1995, an increase of 26
percent over 1994.

JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here today the peace agreement between the Philippine
government (GRP) and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
would unite the Filipino people and enable them to become a
tremendous force for stability and progress in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"What we are about to conclude today is another important step
toward the realization of a political stable, socially cohesive
and economically progressive Southeast Asia," Alatas said at the
second day of the fourth round of formal peace talks between the
Philippine government and MNLF.
</P>
<P>
"we would then be so much closer to our goal of a new regional
order of peace and stability, prosperity and mutual tolerance. We
would then be in an enhanced position to contribute to global
stability and prosperity," Alatas added.
</P>
<P>
sharing Alatas' opinion, MNLF chairman Nur Misuari said the
peace agreement between the MNLF and the Philippine government
would not only be for the people of Mindanao but also for the
people in the region as well as the rest of the globe.
</P>
<P>
Philippine government negotiator Manual T. Yan said the
agreement should be dedicated not only to the grim memory of war
but to the permanent dawning of peace.
</P>
<P>
"It shall carry the aspirations of the poor, nameless people
who sacrificed and perished in conflict. It shall be a monument to
their yearnings for a better life for their children," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary General of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) Mohammed Mohsin said the peace agreement
is not the final objective of the effort to create peace and
prosperity in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with Mr. Alatas that the implementation of the
agreement will be what we are waiting for," Mohsin said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has chaired an OIC meeting to broker talks to end 25
years of fighting between the Moro rebels and the Philippine
government troops which has cost some 125,000 lives in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the mixed committee meeting has managed to compile
all the points of consensus and consider the modalities for the
continuing participation of the OIC during the transitional period
leading to the establishment of the regular autonomous government.
</P>
<P>
According to Alatas, OIC participation would include generating
broad international support for the projected zone of peace and
development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, home to the world's largest Moslem population, has
hosted three formal talks between the Philippine government and
the MNLF since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which are holding closed session today, will
sign the 1996 interim agreement and adopt the final peace
agreement based on the agreed interim agreements already achieved
during the four successive formal talks.
</P>
<P>
The GRP-MNLF final agreement is expected to be initialed
tomorrow at the state palace in a ceremony to be witnessed by
Indonesian President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, the final agreement will be signed in
Malacanang Palace, Manila.

<HEADLINE> China Preserves Some 50 Million Ancient Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China has 50 million ancient
books in a nationwide literary collection, experts attending the
ongoing 62nd international library conference announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey in 22 public libraries and 38 academic
libraries in China shows that they kept about 14 million ancient
books.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese invented characters over 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
China's ancient books were gradually transferred from
individuals to public libraries from late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Most of the ancient books are currently kept in China's state
or local libraries.
</P>
<P>
China's earliest ancient written works are documents inscribed
on bones and tortoise shells from the 13th century BC. Most of the
preserved ancient books were written on paper. Others were
inscribed on silk scrolls, bamboo slips, bones and tortoise shells.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Liu Jiazhen from Wuhan University, the
preserved ancient books are only a small amount of the total in
history. Most of them have been destroyed by burning on the orders
of emperors, wars or natural disasters. Part of them were removed
away by foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
The preserving of present ancient books has been a big problem
for experts.
</P>
<P>
Now experts are involved in a race against time to save many of
the priceless works - most of them centuries old.
</P>
<P>
Book-eating insects are gradually nibbling their way through
many rare books in south China, while in the northern regions dust
is a massive problem in book preservation work.
</P>
<P>
To date, 90 percent of the libraries and 43 academic libraries
have their own book repair and restoration staff and some big
libraries have been equipped with temperature and moisture
regulating equipment.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1985, China began to make copies of ancient books
by microfilming. So far, China has "rescued" more than 20,000
ancient books.
</P>
<P>
The very latest compact disc technology is likely to be used to
preserve the written works for all time, the conference was told.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chinese and American technicians are researching ways
of preserving ancient books onto compact discs.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Likely in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of a NATO summit
next year to address crucial issues on the military alliance's
future role and eastward expansion is growing increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
NATO has made no public comment about holding a summit, but a
decision is widely expected to be made by NATO foreign ministers
at their semi-annual meeting in December, according to the
Atlantic News, a bi-weekly publication here.
</P>
<P>
Last week German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said a NATO
summit would be held at the beginning of 1997 to discuss
enlargement of the transatlantic military alliance. But NATO has
not confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
A NATO expert said a summit is possible because it is normal
for heads of state and governments of NATO members to make
decisions together on important issues.
</P>
<P>
The last NATO summit was held in January 1994 in Brussels to
inaugurate the Partnership for Peace program, to strengthen the
alliance's relationship with countries of the former eastern bloc
before extending membership to them. The summit also discussed the
idea of creating a Combined Joint Task Force to give more power
and autonomy to European countries within NATO.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of any summit will be the continuation of NATO's
transformation in the wake of the ending of the Cold War,
relations with Russia, intensification of the Partnership for
Peace program and NATO enlargement to include countries of the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Debate over a new Implementation Force (IFOR), its mandate and
composition, will intensify after the elections in Bosnia on
September 14. IFOR is due to pull out of Bosnia by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
There has been talk of a land force of some 20,000 troops, or a
large division with three multinational forces, including an
American land contingent.
</P>
<P>
"More and more officials recognize the need for NATO to
continue playing a role in Bosnia to maintain peace and prevent
the return of hostilities" once IFOR is gone, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be on the agenda of an informal meeting of NATO
defense ministers next month in Bergen, Norway.

<HEADLINE> Subregional Cooperation Along Mekong River Ripe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Conditions are ripening for
economic and technical cooperation between the sub-regions along
the Lancang-Mekong River, said a senior Chinese foreign trade
official.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, told participants at a recent international seminor
held in Kunming that shared interests in these areas are the
foundation for cooperation in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Lancang-Mekong River extends through China's Yunnan
Province, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, covering
2.3 million sq kms that have a total population of 230 million.
</P>
<P>
"At present, countries in the sub-region, most of them still
backward, are eager to develop their economy," Long said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the increase in world economic integration
and regional economic conglomeration, opening up and development
have become the main theme of the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in the sub-region is seen as an important strategy
that provides opportunities for economic promotion, Long said.
</P>
<P>
The assistant minister also said that the international
community has attached great importance to the development of the
sub-region, considering it to be one of the last virgin land
regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
International organizations such as the UN Development Program,
the World Bank, the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the
Asian Development Bank have all made commitments to the
development.
</P>
<P>
UNDP has said that when a fund is officially founded for the
sub-regional cooperation, it will provide two million US dollars of
assistance to the fund.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, five ministerial-level meetings of the countries
involved were held to discuss the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Treasure House of Tibetan Buddhist Scriptures Well Preserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has
invested heavily in the country's largest sanctum of Tibetan
Buddhist scriptures, according to Chinese officials attending the
62nd IFLA conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the government has spent more than one million yuan
building a new storehouse for priceless Buddhist scriptures in
Lapuleng Monastery, in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, in
northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The monastery, first built in 1709, has a collection of 65,000
scriptures, including 12,000 Tibetan Buddhist scriptures, the
biggest collection of its kind in China, according to Qiu
Qiaoying, a researcher with the Gannan Prefecture Archives Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the monastery are kept two priceless palm-leave Buddhist
scriptures.
</P>
<P>
It has become a great reference base for Tibetan study, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Gansu Provincial Buddhist Theological Institute was set up
in the monastery in 1985 to train scholars of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Besides Buddhist teachings, the collection covers books on
medicine, craftsmanship, history, biography, astrology and
numerics, Qiu said.

<HEADLINE> Grobbelaar to Serve as National Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean goalkeeper Bruce
Grobbelaar will take the helm of the national soccer squad for its
next two international matches, the Zimbabwe Football Association
(ZIFA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ZIFA spokesman Vincent Pamire said the former Liverpool and
Southampton goalkeeper accepted a temporary coaching contract
ahead of encounters against Tanzania on September 29 and Sudan on
October 5.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Grobbelaar was assistant coach for Zimbabwe for
their 1998 World Cup preliminary matches against Madagascar, in
which Zimbabwe lost 4-3 on aggregate in June.
</P>
<P>
Pamire said Grobbelaar takes over as national coach until a
permanent replacement is appointed for predecessor Marc Duvillard
of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Duvillard, coming under fire after the aggregate loss to
Madagascar, reportedly asked to work with the nation's under-23
team and other junior sides.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, Wimbledon goaltender Hans Segers and Aston Villa
striker John Fashanu pleaded innocent in May to charges of giving
or accepting bribes to fix English premier league matches between
1991 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Issuing Law on Children's Libraries Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- In a move to provide more books
and reading places for children, Chinese experts said here today
that the government should issue a law as soon as possible to
protect the healthy development of children's libraries.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zheng Lili from Beijing University, who is attending
the current 62nd General Conference of International Federation of
Library Associations, said that China now has more than 350
million children, over 200 million of whom can read.
</P>
<P>
The current number of children's libraries are not enough to
satisfy their needs, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 million primary and middle students are eager to use
libraries, and most of them who cannot continue their study in
higher schools are eager to use libraries as a place to study,
Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chinese colleges and universities enroll over
600,000 students each year, with the enrollment rate standing at
three percent. The rate for senior middle schools is 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 17,000 children's libraries of
different levels. Most of them are in economically-developed
eastern China and in southeastern coastal areas. Less than
one-fourth of these libraries are distributed over the northwest
and southwest parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ning Guoyu, curator of Tianjin Children's Library, said the
slow development of China's children's libraries lies in lack of
funds, both for construction and for buying books.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that China's neglect to issue a law to
promote and protect children's libraries is the key factor
blocking the development of these facilities.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government issue a law as soon as
possible to provide a legal guarantee for the development of the
country's children's libraries in terms of policy and funds.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said the law should have concrete regulations on ethnic
group children and handicapped children in order to guarantee
their rights to read.
</P>
<P>
Some other experts pointed out the government should encourage
and support collective units and individuals in running children's
libraries, while promoting the building of public libraries for
children.

<HEADLINE> APEC Energy Ministers Stress Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Protection of the environment
was identified today by energy ministers of APEC as one of the key
issues for their economies to address as they developed the energy
needed to meet their continuing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the two-day's ministers' conference
of Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), the ministers noted
"the Asia Pacific region will be the main driver of global
economic growth into the next century." With the economic growth,
the APEC economies are entering a period of massive growth in
their energy needs.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers agreed that the application of economically
sound measures to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of
energy production and use is essential to protect the well being
of both present and future generations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Meeting APEC's rapidly increasing demand for energy in an
environmentally responsible way will be essential if the region's
economic growth potential is to be fully realized."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the electricity demand expected to increase by
between 50 and 80 percent between now and the year 2010, about 1.6
trillion US dollars in investment capital would need to be spent
on power infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in their statement that this capital could
not be found by the APEC members and international financial
institutions. "If such growth is to be realized, business sector
finance for power infrastructure will be essential."
</P>
<P>
After the two-day's meeting, the ministers would take back to
their governments a 14-point non-binding set of energy policy
principles, which they adopted yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Those points, among other things, ensure that member economies
will pursue policies for enhancing the efficient production,
distribution and consumption of energy. The ministers agreed to
report on their conclusions to a meeting of APEC leaders at Subic
Bay in the Philippines in November.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
today reiterated the central government's policy towards Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said people who support China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the "one country, two systems"
principle should be united in participating in the preparations
for establishing the Special Administrative Region (SAR), no
matter what views and attitude they have toward Hong Kong's
development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation from the
Heung Yee Kuk in the New Territories, led by its chairman Lau Wong
Fat.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that in history the New Territories had made a
protracted struggle against British occupation as well as for the
interests of the inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, people from all walks of life worked hard for
Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong question, drafting of
the Basic Law, Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory
Committee for the Hong Kong SAR, Preparatory Committee, and the
engagement of advisors on the Hong Kong affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it is only 306 days before Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, and he hoped people in various circles in the New
Territories will continue to promote their tradition of "love of
the motherland and Hong Kong", and make more contributions for
Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that there was no democracy in Hong Kong under
British rule. Participation in the preparation for the
establishment of the Selection Committee and the SAR government,
is the first step for people in Hong Kong to realize democracy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the co-operation with the British side, he
voiced his hope that the two sides will continue to co-operate in
the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Qian also explained to the Hong Kong visitors the Chinese
government's policy on relations between the central government
and the future SAR government, and Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>

Office of the State Council, attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today that Britain welcomed the
renewed interest shown by India and Pakistan for resumption of the
Indo-Pakistan dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain is willing to mediate between India and
Pakistan for resolving their bilateral issues only if the two
countries wish so.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who came here from Pakistan Wednesday night for a
two-day official visit, has held official talks with Indian
External Affairs Minister I. K. Gujral. He is to call on Indian
Prime Minister Deva Gowda later today.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said that Britain's differences
with India on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) would not
affect Indo-British relations. He ruled out any economic sanctions
on India.
</P>
<P>
He, however, expressed the hope that the CTBT would have the
backing of all the nuclear threshold states including India.
</P>
<P>
India had threatened to block the CTBT at the Conference on
Disarmament (CD) in Geneva recently, resulting in the failure of
the CD to pass the treaty.
</P>
<P>
India is Rifkind's second leg of his five-Asian-nation tour,
which will also take him to Sri Lanka, Japan and Mongolia. He will
leave here Friday.

<P>
About 300 Taiwan companies have settled in the booming zone,

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold General Strike in West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians held a general
strike in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip this morning, the first
time in two years, to protest against Israeli government's
policies on Jerusalem and the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The 4-hour strike, called by Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, started at 8:00 a.m. local time (05:00GMT) with all
shops and other commercial places being shutdown.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Jerusalem, a commercial strike was held, while
only partial commercial strike was reportedly observed in the
disputed West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has called
on its members to carry out violent attacks against Israeli
targets.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat condemned Israeli government's decision to
expand settlement activity in the West Bank, and to demolish
Palestinian building in Jerusalem, saying it was "a declaration
of war" on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Palestinian Council (PC) in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, Arafat called for a general strike to be observed in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip today to protest against Israeli
government's policies.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's sharp reaction came one day after the Israeli Defense
Ministry approved plans for building a new neighborhood in a
settlement in the West Bank, and the Jerusalem Municipality
demolished a Palestinian building in Jerusalem's old City.
</P>
<P>
The new neighborhood, comprises 1,800 housing units, will be
built in the Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Safer, and 900 housing
units will be constructed at the first stage of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Municipality claimed that Palestinian
building, which the Palestinians said was served as a center
for the city's handicaps, was demolished because it was built
without a license, and financed by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time, since Arafat arrived in the
Palestinian autonomous areas in 1994, that he called for a
general strike and urged Palestinian to pray at the Aqsa Mosque
despite Israeli roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that such calls were common
during the period of Intifada (Palestinian uprising) before the
Oslo peace accords were signed between Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Arafat, at first, had demanded
for a 24-hour shutdown, but following deliberation from the
PC, the decision was limited to just 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, Arafat's political adviser, told Israel Radio
that the Israeli government started the escalation of tensions
by totally ignoring the Palestinian side, adding the Israeli
activity in Jerusalem was the most dangerous step.
</P>
<P>
Tibi declined to say that Arafat's call was a signal of
renewing of the Intifada, but he said that the Israeli
government's policy "was not only leading to a deadlock, but
a dangerous lock."
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Arafat's declaration, Netanyahu's office
released a statement, warning that the government will response
sharply to any attempts to worsen the situation, or to any
violence that would damage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Israel calls upon Arafat to refrain from
his declarations and extreme actions which do not contribute
to advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat should take into account that the two sides are
involved in formulating understandings which will bring the
negotiations forward on a series of important subjects, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nissim Zvilli, secretary-general of the Labor Party,
Israel's leading opposition party, called on Arafat not to
returned the Palestinians to the days of violence.
</P>
<P>
Zvilli said that it is easy to understand the Palestinian's
disappointment over the freeze of negotiations on the
implementation of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that returning to violence would only
bring further suffering for the Palestinians and undermine
efforts to find a true solution to the conflict between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that in the wake of Arafat's
call for massive participation in Friday prayer at the Aqsa
Mosque in the old City of Jerusalem, Jerusalem police are
expected to request reinforcement to help keep order tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Resilient Economy Keeps GDP on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's real gross
domestic product (GDP) rose by 3.5 percent in the second quarter
of this year, compared with 3.3 percent in the first, as farming
pulled its weight and the rest of the economy remained resilient.
</P>
<P>
GDP growth was a touch lower than expected, but economists
remained confident that the rate for the year as a whole is still
on track for about three percent, an official economic press
release said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's agricultural output surged, but the 41 percent
of growth in the sector was almost half the first quarter's
massive 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
A rebound in the non-farm economy helped keep the overall GDP
growth rate at a decent level. The non-agricultural sector grew
by 1.8 percent from only 0.4 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank, South Africa's central bank, said in its
annual economic report that the main bonus from agriculture would
come in the next two quarters, as the bulk of the summer crop
would be harvested in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the agricultural bonanza in the second half
would mask the slowdown in the rest of the economy, which would
gain momentum over the couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed a decline of one percent in mining
output, which was offset by manufacturing growth of 1.2 percent
and a 4.7 percent rise in trade.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted there seemed to be a large discrepancy
between the government's monthly statistics for manufacturing and
retail trade and the GDP figures.
</P>
<P>
Some felt a higher rate of GDP growth for the quarter would be
more consistent with the monthly statistics which showed
annualized growth of double digits.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Libraries Not to Charge Borrowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese libraries are not
permitted to charge book borrowers, an official of the Ministry of
Culture said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese libraries see to it that every citizen is entitled to
obtain information on an equal footing," said the official, who is
in charge of libraries.
</P>
<P>
She said that libraries are an undertaking that serves the
general public, and that serving the people is their aim.
</P>
<P>
"This provision of the Chinese government complies with
stipulations of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization," she said.
</P>
<P>
Expenses for libraries across the country are covered by the
government, she said, noting that Chinese leaders have repeatedly
pledged that the government must assist the development of
libraries.
</P>
<P>
Fund shortages are considered the biggest problem confronting
libraries throughout the world and have forced libraries in
developing countries to cut back on the number of books and
magazines they plan to buy.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the ongoing 62nd General Conference of the
International Federation of Library Associations agree that
information should be obtained only by wealthy people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said that while providing services other
than lending books, Chinese libraries collect fees. The services
include copying files and lending audio and video publications.
</P>
<P>
She explained that such services are also charged in many other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Tehran to Use Gas Automobiles to Reduce Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian capital of Tehran,
one of the most polluted cities in the world, is to use some
20,000 gas-powered automobiles as part of the battle against air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official said that it took four years
for Tehran to replace gasoline with natural gas for the 20,000
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government has decided to step up its efforts to
convert 20,000 automobiles from gasoline to natural gas annually
from now on.
</P>
<P>
Khosrow Jenaqi, director for the fuel conversion project, said
that there are 25,000 taxi-cabs in Tehran, of which 14,000 have
been renovated to use gas instead of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts are under way to convert another 11,000
taxi-cabs. The cost for the conversion for each vehicle is about
250 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 13 liquefied natural gas distribution
stations, and will increase the number to 33 by the end of this
year, thus have the capacity of accommodating 60,000 automobiles a
day.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that Tehran is facing serious air
pollution with two tons of lead entering the air every day. About
80 percent of the air pollution is caused by cars in the city.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that 65 percent of the pollution in Tehran is
caused by vehicular exhaust, 24 percent is generated by industries
and service centers and 11 percent is attributable to home water
heaters.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 10 million, there are some 3 million
cars in the city. The percentage of polluted gas in the air of the
city is some six times as big as the permitted figure.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the poisonous gas released by automobiles in
the city will cause various diseases related with liver, kidney,
spleen, brain, bones and muscles.
</P>
<P>
Long time ago experts have warned the citizens of the serious
air pollution and urged the Iranian government to take serious
measures to reduce air pollution in the city.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Host China Anti-Corrosion Achievements Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to hold an exhibition
in Beijing displaying its anti-corrosion achievements from October
22 to 25, according to the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI).
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, to be jointly sponsored by MCI and the China
Chemical Anti-corrosion Technology Association (CCATA), will
provide a display area of more than 2,200 square meters in the
Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said that losses suffered by
corrosion is six times the total caused by other nature hazards.
</P>
<P>
In China, corrosion turns some 10 million tons of iron and
steel into solid wastes each year, about the same amount of the
annual output of the Shanghai-based Baoshan Steel Complex.
</P>
<P>
And the corrosion often forces chemical industrial
installations to shut down, usually causing losses of millions of
yuan daily.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that though the corrosion is
inevitable, there are methods to detect and control it.
</P>
<P>
He praised the CCATA, established in 1986, for its great
successes over the past ten years which have contributed
significantly to the country's anti-corrosion cause.
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope that the exhibition will encourage people to
fight corrosion to save 60 to 80 billion yuan (about 7.2 to 9.9
billion US dollars) annually in the coming five years.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Former air traffic
controller Johari Saaid, accused of setting fire to the air
traffic control building at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport
four years ago, was sentenced to 10 years jail by Malaysia's
Sessions Court today.
</P>
<P>
The court, which found him guilty, ordered the 44-year-old man
to serve the sentence from today, according to Malaysian news
agency Bernama.
</P>

The sentence was stayed on Johari's application pending an
appeal he intended to file in the high court and bail of 40,000
ringgit (about 16,000 US dollars) in two sureties was allowed, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Johari, charged under the Penal Code which provides for a
maximum sentence of 20 years jail on conviction, was convicted on
"circumstantial evidence" of causing mischief by setting fire to
the tower at Terminal One of the airport on October 15, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mat Zaraai Alias was quoted as saying during sentencing
that he had considered public interest and wanted to convey a
warning to others not to commit a similar offense.
</P>

He said the offense by Johari was serious as it crippled civil
aviation and created an unfavorable image of the country.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Well-Known Taiwanese Personalities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today reaffirmed that economic cooperation across the Taiwan
Straits should not be affected or disrupted by political
differences.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of well-known Taiwanese scholars and public
figures from industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan,
including Kao Ching-yuan here this afternoon, Jiang said: "We have
always held that it is imperative to take practical steps to
accelerate the accomplishment of direct mail, trade, air and
shipping services across the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, extended a warm welcome to the Taiwan
visitors, who are in the Chinese capital attending an on-going
seminar on economic co-operation between Beijing and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciations for the positive views that the
delegates put forth to the seminar on the enhancing of economic
cooperation on both sides of the straits, and on the realization
of direct cross-straits links at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the compatriots across the Taiwan Straits are
related to each other as blood to flesh and share the weal and
woe, and their economies are mutually complementary.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of economic exchanges and cooperation is of great
significance to the growth of the Taiwan economy, and is also
beneficial to the Chinese mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Facing the development of the world economy in the 21st
century, Jiang said, big efforts should be made to accelerate the
pace of cross-straits economic exchanges and cooperation, to bring
benefits for the common prosperity of the economies of both the
mainland and Taiwan and happiness to the entire Chinese nation.

Five-Year Plan, covering 1996 to 2000, and a long-term plan for
the year 2010.

<P>

road with Chinese characteristics, and adhere to reform and
opening to the outside world with economic development as the main
task.
</P>
<P>
"We have the confidence and ability to bring China, a country
with sustained economic growth, overall social progress and full
of hope and vitality into the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said there exists boundless potential and opportunities
in the process of developing the country's economy. Countries all
over the world are confident about China's vast market and
promising economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the far-sighted Taiwan industrialists will,
too, share the same view in this regard," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan Straits are of
the same ancestry, so Taiwan industrialists have obvious
advantages to undertake businesses on the mainland, Jiang said,
adding that "we sincerely hope that Taiwan entrepreneurs will
seize the opportunity and come to invest."
</P>
<P>
"We will continuously carry out the policy on encouraging
investments by Taiwan industrialists, and completely implementing

<HEADLINE>   South Korea's Current Account Deficit Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit amounted to 11.66 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven
months of this year, surpassing the bank of Korea's 11.3 billion
U.S. dollars estimate for the entire year, according to the
figures released by the bank here today.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the seven-month period is up 79.4 percent from
the 6.5 billion U.S. dollars a year earlier and is likely to
exceed the 12-billion U.S.-dollar mark the government has set as
this year's limit soon, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit in July recorded 2.28
billion U.S. dollars, which is a similar figure to last April's
record monthly high of 2.29 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Such a huge deficit is attributable to a rapid increase in
imports, the extravagant spending at home and abroad, and a
decline in the prices of such major export items as
semiconductors, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current account deficit this year is likely to
surpass 15 billion U.S. dollars unless semiconductor prices
recover, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's foreign currency holdings decreased
1.5 billion U.S. dollars from June to 35.06 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of July.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Archeological research showed
that a town in Takeo Province may be the center of the Funan
Kingdom of Cambodia, an American archeologist said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Dega was attending the International Conference on
Khmer Studies here.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference that according to radio-carbon and other
evidences, Angkor Borei, a town 65 kilometers south of Phnom Penh
and 10 kilometers from the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, could have
played a commercial role in the kingdom's trade between the first
and sixth centuries.
</P>
<P>
The town may have been more influential than Oc-Eo, a better
known Funan-era site in Southern Vietnam, Dega added.
</P>
<P>
Further research at the site is yet needed to determine its
role in the region at different phases in history, the
archeologist said.

<HEADLINE> Moslems Threatens to Stop Cape Town's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A radical Moslem
organization based in Cape Town has threatened to jeopardise
South Africa's bid to host the summer Olympic Games in the year
2004.
</P>
<P>
Known as People against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), the
nationwide organization said it will rally support from both
within South Africa and abroad to have the games staged
elsewhere, a local daily ''the Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The group's spokesman Mohammed Ali Parker said if Cape Town
hosted the Olympics, drug tests would have to be conducted on
spectators rather than on the athletes.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a meeting in a mosque in Cape Town last
night.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, South Africa's oldest city, is bidding to host the
games.
</P>
<P>
PAGAD came into the limelight early this month when some of
its members were involved in the public execution of a suspected
leader of drug dealing group in Cape Town.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Arafat's Patience Worn out by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Wednesday called for civil protests, including a one-day
general strike today and a mass pilgrimage to Al-Aksa Mosque in
east Jerusalem Friday, arousing fears about the possible renewing
of intifada, or armed Arab uprising.
</P>
<P>
The outpouring of anger by Arafat is not because he acted on
impulse, but rather the result of the provocative policies
implemented so far by the new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, Arafat has been consistently urged
by the U.S. and several Arab allies for being patient with
Israel's new Likud government.
</P>
<P>
But now his patience was finally worn out by the stagnation of
peace process and provocation by the hardline government, which
have fueled the growing dissent in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the president of Palestinian Authority (PA)
lashed out with the strongest terms at the new Israeli
government, denouncing its policy of expanding Jewish settlements
as "a declaration of war against the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Upon taking over power in June, the Likud government produced a
series of hardline policies toward the peace talks, including
rejecting an independent Palestinian state, opposing the division
of Jerusalem, and lifting a ban on expanding the Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
All these reversed the land-for-peace basis on which the PA
and former Labor government had conducted the peace talks and
made major progress.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government has repeatedly urged the PA to fulfill
so-called its commitment in combating terrorism, despite Arafat's
concrete efforts to crack down on the extremist militant groups
such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Jihad.
</P>
<P>
While promising to implement the agreement to pull back its
troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, the Likud government at
the same time demanded revising the redeployment plan under the
excuse of protecting the security of over 400 Jewish settlers
living among 200,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Israel went a step further by conditioning the
pullback on the PA's closing down several institutions in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, the Israeli cabinet decided early this month to
lift a freeze, imposed by the former government in order to
conduct peace talks, on expanding Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel continues a six-month long crippling closure
on the territories, which has dealt a severe blow to the
fledgling Palestinian economy, now moving from bad to worse as
the unemployment rate running as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic deterioration has increased the growing dissent in
the territories, which is undermining the leadership of Arafat
and the Authority.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, violent conflicts erupted between police and
protesters in several towns on the West Bank after the death of a
jailed Palestinian extremist as a result of police torture.
</P>
<P>
Since the creation of the Israeli new government, Arafat has
made great diplomatic efforts in a bid to pressure Israel into
resuming the talks as soon as possible on the basis of the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He has visited major Arab countries such as Egypt, Jordan,
Syria and Saudi Arab to mobilize the international forces against
Israel. He even wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking him
to urge Israel to revive the negotiations at an early date.
</P>
<P>
However, all these efforts have failed to impress the Israeli
government, whose hardline leader Benjamin Netanyahu still
remains noncommittal to a much-called-for meeting with Arafat. The
apparent contempt has added to Arafat's anger, which burst out
Wednesday after an Israeli bulldozer razed a PA building in
Jerusalem's old city.
</P>
<P>
It is incorrect to say now the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process has ended, because Israel has promised to resume the
formal talks within a week. However, to break the deadlock, a
fundamental change of attitude on the part of the Israeli
government is necessary to prevent further escalation of the
current tension and to achieve progress in the future
talks.

<HEADLINE> African Immigrants Expelled by France Arrive in Tunis, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Two groups of African immigrants
expelled by France on two chartered military aircraft Wednesday
evening arrived early today in Tunis and Bamako.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 737 military aircraft chartered by the French
government dropped 12 Tunisian immigrants at the Tunis-Carthage
airport early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The plane continued its flight to Kinshasa to bring home about
20 Zairean immigrants, said a report of Agence France Presse (AFP)
from Niamey, Niger, where the airplane made a stopover for
refueling and changing its crew.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Airbus 310 arrived in Bamako-Senou airport in the
Malian capital also early today with 34 Africans, including 21
Malian men, one Malian woman with her baby, and a Senegalese man
mistakenly brought aboard, said an AFP report from Bamako.
</P>
<P>
A French military aircraft flew from Dakar to Bamako to set up
a boarding bridge to let the expelled disembark.
</P>
<P>
The 24 Africans were received by officials of the Malian High
Council of Exterior Affairs (foreign ministry) and the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
France expelled the first group of 57 African immigrants to
Mali, Senegal and Zaire last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The expulsion has been strongly condemned by Mali's political
associations, trade unions and church leaders.

<P>
JIUZHAIGOU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A conference on national
parks and protected areas in East and South Asia is still in
session in Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day conference, which opened last Sunday, focuses on
how protected areas can be managed better still, how to develop
ecologically-sound tourism in protected areas, and dealing with
development of tourism and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature, the reason Jiuzhaigou was chosen as the site of the
conference was to show the management experience of the reserve,
which is famous for waterfalls, colorful forests, cloud-covered
mountains, giant pandas, lesser pandas and golden monkeys. It was
designated a leading state scenic spot and giant panda protection
zone in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
It was once a forest farm and most of its residents are
Tibetans. The local residents are now mainly engaged in tourism
and the service industry.
</P>
<P>
China now boasts more than 700 nature reserves approved by
government, and has some 1,000 giant pandas in the wild.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Euroyen futures trading at the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) leapt to a
record daily volume of 121,826 contracts on Wednesday, marking a
sharp increase from the previous record of 95,553 contracts set on
May 15, 1996, the Simex said today.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that this new record was yet another
strong indicator of growing interest in the contract, which in
June this year traded its highest average daily volume of 38,549
contracts.
</P>
<P>
This surpassed the previous daily average record of 35,284
contracts established in June 1994, it said.
</P>
<P>
Simex noted that the buoyant contract had been on a record
breaking trend since its inclusion in the highly successful Mutual
Offset System (MOS) between the Simex and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The MOS, launched in 1984, has enabled Simex and the CME to
mutually trade and offset the Eurodollar futures contract for the
past 12 years, and has contributed to the Eurodollar's rise to
become the world's most actively traded futures contract, it said.

BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China has an estimated 100
million people with high blood pressure, experts disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A census of the country's hypertension sufferers in 1991
indicated that the incidence of the diseases was 11.88 percent,
and there were about 3.5 million new patients added to the total
each year, according to a newspaper on Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Medicine News cited a recent national symposium as
saying that the country has an estimated 100 million people
suffering from high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
The disease, causing damage to the heart, brain and kidneys,
has become the country's top disease to endanger people's health
and lives and, and China's number one killer.
</P>
<P>
Specialists participating in the symposium on protecting and
curing hypertension called for greater efforts to publicize basic
knowledge about the disease.
</P>
<P>
They said that a reduction in the high pressure was no longer
the sole purpose of healing. Doctors should set their sights on
reducing the level of incidences and deaths caused by
complications of heart diseases, they said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medicine is expected to provide an alternative to
conventional hypertension treatment that has drawn attention from
both domestic and foreign doctors, they said.

<HEADLINE> Estonia to Elect President for 4th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A special Estonian electoral
college will ballot for the country's president on September 20
after the previous three rounds of votings failed to produce a
head of state.
</P>
<P>
Any party, having parliament presence or not, could nominate
its candidate to join the race in the country's first presidential
election by an electoral college if its nominee got 21 signatures
from the 374 members of the electoral body.
</P>
<P>
The candidate who gets half the votes of the electoral college,
comprising all the 101 parliament members, local autonomous
leaders by proportion and party representatives, would win.
</P>
<P>
The college was formed under the Estonian constitution after
the parliament cast ballots three times in vain to produce the
required two-thirds of votes for a president in August 26 and 27.
</P>
<P>
The two major rivals for the five-year presidency, incumbent
President Lennart Meri and Vice Speaker Arnold Ryuitel, vowed to
hold out in the competition despite their failure to get a
two-thirds majority in the three rounds of voting, Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In those votings, 67-year-old Meri got 45, 49 and 52 votes
respectively, while 68-year-old Ryuitel got 34 twice and 32 for
the third time.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Local media today condemned
the visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikedo who claimed
China's territory Diaoyu Islands as part of Japan's and refused to
make commitment to pay compensations for victims of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Tin Tin Daily News pointed out in an editorial that it is an
indisputable fact that Diaoyu Islands belong to China.
</P>
<P>
It said that Diaoyu Islands were seized by the Japanese
aggressors in 1895 when they occupied Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Diaoyu Islands, Ikedo said here Wednesday
that there was nothing to discuss as far as his government was
concerned because the islands were an inseparable part of Japan's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the Japanese foreign minister's arrogant
attitude toward China's sovereignty has aroused great indignation
of the Chinese people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po, Ming Pao Daily News and Sing Tao Daily also
criticized the Japanese foreign minister for whitewashing Japanese
crimes during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some other newspapers and TV stations criticized the Japanese
foreign minister for "talking wildly," saying that Ikedo's action
would drive Hong Kong people into a big rage.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Yukihiko Ikedo has
encountered several groups of protesters seeking billions of
dollars in compensation for war victims and claiming China's
sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
About 300 members of the Reparation Association marched to the
Japanese consulate, calling on the Japanese government to
reimburse the women forced into sex slavery during the war as well
as holders of now worthless Japanese military scrip and currency.
</P>
<P>
A group of demonstrators maintained an overnight vigil outside
a hotel, where Ikedo was staying. They tried to hand in a
petition, urging Japan to apologize for its war crimes and take
prompt action to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ikedo was here for a two-day stopover on his way back to Japan
from the Middle East.

<P>
PARIS, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- To protest the Israeli decision to expand Jewish settlement
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Wednesday took two measures without precedent since the Oslo peace
agreement was signed three years ago: a call for a general strike
today and a call for a mass pray at the esplanade of Mosque Aqsa
in East Jerusalem Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, since the two million Palestinians have passed to a
state of autonomy, the general strike will have little impact on
Israel except East Jerusalem. Repeatedly hit by israel's closing
of frontier, Palestinian shopkeepers will close their stores for
eight hours only today.
</P>
<P>
-- The World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of
Children in Stockholm Wednesday adopted a declaration and a
project of action to combat the evil of sexual abuse of children
around the world. It will need one year for the whole world to
agree upon the content of the declaration and project, unanimously
supported by 130 countries attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no clear definition of the term
"exploitation for commercial purpose" and even the exact
definition of the word "child." Some countries which have signed
the declaration allow men to marry girls of 12 years old, a
phenomenon called "legalized prostitution" by some
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- As expected, Susan McDougal, the woman who was put at the
front of the stage in "Whitewater affair," was put behind the bars
just before the start of the Democratic Convention in Chicago.
She was condemned to two years in prison by a court in Little
Rock, Arkansas for embezzling 300,000 U.S. dollars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Susan and her husband James were closely associated with Bill
Clinton -- who was governor of Arkansas at the time -- and Hillary
Clinton in an immobile project named "Whitewater." Clinton was
said to have exercised his influence on a local bank to let Susan
obtain loans.

<HEADLINE> APEC Pushes for Globalization of Smaller Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum is pushing for the globalization of small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) by strengthening contacts and
cooperation among SMEs in the region, the APEC '96 News Bureau
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 delegates from the 18 APEC members are to attend the
third ministerial meeting on SMEs scheduled for next Thursday and
Friday in Cebu, the Philippines, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims to establish linkages among SMEs in the region
and encourage the involvement of supporting organizations to
foster the globalization of SMEs.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the APEC Center for Technology Exchange and
Training for SMEs will be launched in the Philippines on September
7, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The center is envisioned to facilitate contacts between SMEs
and the sharing of experiences to support the development of the
small business sector.
</P>
<P>
The APEC is attaching importance to the development of SMEs as
these businesses are expected to become a major vehicle for
economic growth and sustainable development in an environment
driven by free trade, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
SMEs account for some 90 percent of the enterprises in the
Asia-Pacific region, and contribute 30 to 60 percent of the
region's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
They also account for 32 to 84 percent of the employment in

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Having Clandestine Trade With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has been all out
to tighten sanctions against Burundi and any claims that it is
carrying out clandestine trade with Burundi is a lie of the
highest order, a Rwandan envoy here said.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Acting Ambassador Emmanuel Mutimura was reacting on
Wednesday to allegations raised last week by five former Burundi
Parliamentary members in the pre-military coup regime who are
exiled in Dar es salaam, according to a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan envoy told reporters in the embassy that the
government of Rwanda has been fully committed to the
implementation of the sanctions on that tiny war-torn central
African state.
</P>
<P>
"Our president had attended all the meetings in Kampala and
Arusha and there was no way the Rwanda government could reverse
its resolution without meeting other neighboring heads of state,"
affirmed the acting ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said peasants in Burundi had started
boycotting sales of the cash crops to the Buyoya government and
that instead they sold them to the Hutu CNDD movement which later
sold them in Rwanda. The crops would be sent via Uganda to Kenyan
ports for exports, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said gemstones business was being conducted
by individual Burundi businessmen who use the prevailing
sanctions to smuggle the gemstones into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on these rumors, Uganda acting High Commissioner to
Tanzania Godfrey Kalimugogo said such allegations were false and
unfounded as Uganda had cut off not only economic but also
communication links with Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to working together with our brothers in
Tanzania, Zambia, Kenya, Rwanda and Zaire to uphold the
principles of mutual cooperation. If we turn loose these
sanctions, we will lose credibility to the international
community," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Helping Iraq Smuggle Gasoline to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
once again rejected U.S. allegations that Iran is helping Iraq
smuggle gasoline to the regional states via the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran's permanent representative to the U.N. Kamal Kharazi
dismissed the U.S. claims that Tehran has been involved in
Baghdad's violation of the U.N. economic sanctions by allowing
Iraqi ships to smuggle oil through Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA this morning published the
statement by the Iranian government as a response to the American
accusation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy to the U.N. in a letter on June 17 to the head
of the U.N. Security Council's sanctions committee claimed that
Iraq, using Iranian waters, has been smuggling gasoline to the
regional states via the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kharazi said the claims are part of Washington's anti-Iran
propaganda, which "as always are based on false and unfounded
allegations."
</P>
<P>
The claim comes at a time when Iran has increased the number of
its coastal guard patrols at Arvand River and other borders in the
Gulf to tightly control implementation of the U.N. Resolution, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration earlier claimed that ships carrying Iraqi
oil products have used Iranian territorial waters to smuggle
oil.

following Wednesday night's shooting attack on a bus near the West
Bank town of Bethlehem, in which two passengers were lightly
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when unidentified gunmen opened fire at
a Hebron-bond No.160 bus traveling on the bypass road leading to
Gush Etzion, a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that 15 shots were fired at the bus, and
glass shards of the bus slightly injured Moshe Shahar, 54, and
Rafael Elbaum, 46, in their legs.

PARIS -- Approximately 11,000 people demonstrated in the
streets of Paris Wednesday to support the paperless immigrants
threatened with expulsion by the French government, said police
sources.
</P>
<P>
The Movement Against Racism and For Friendship between Peoples
estimated that 20,000 went to the street today to protest the
expulsion of Africans.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators stopped at the Stalingrad square at 20:30
before ending the one-and-a-half hour protest. Some clashes took
place between demonstrators and police not far from the Saint
Bernard Church, from which 300 African paperless immigrants were
violently expelled last Friday.

BELGRADE -- Bosnian refugees started voting at all polling
stations in Serbia on Wednesday, head of the OSCE liaison office
in Belgrade Zivota de Luca said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Provisional Election Commission (PEC) of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Sarajevo has postponed municipal elections in Bosnia, 84,781
refugees in Yugoslavia's two republics -- Serbia and Montenegro --
will cast all five ballots by September 3 to choose their member
for the three-member Bosnian Presidency, the president of the Serb
state, Serb parliament, cantonal and municipal assemblies, de Luca
said.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said more than 70,000 Bosnian refugees living in
Yugoslavia will return to the Serb-held territories in Bosnia to

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey and Israel Wednesday signed another defense
cooperation accord, strengthening relations between the two
countries in the field of defense industry, despite the strong
Arab pressure on Turkey to cancel previous agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Undersecretary David Ivry arrived here for a
one-day working visit in a bid to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The signing was planned for early August but was postponed
because of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's first trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the accord will boost relations between the
two countries in the defense industry, providing the necessary
procedures for the 600-million-dollar upgrade of 58 Turkish F-4
fighters by Israel to go ahead.

<HEADLINE> Iran Announces Arrests of "Iraqi, US Spies" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced that it had
arrested 137 "Iraqi and U.S. spies," according to an official
report here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was contained in a statement made by Iranian
Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan and reported by Iran's
official news agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Fallahiyan was quoted by IRNA as saying that the "Iraqi and
U.S. spies" along with those from other countries "are awaiting
trial."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian information minister did not reveal their
names and identities in the report.
</P>
<P>
Fallahiyan said that "the enemies of the Islamic revolution"
had tried many ways to topple the Islamic Republic of Iran but
all their attempts had been in vain.
</P>
<P>
He accused them of plotting coups d'etat, backing imposed war,
stirring the masses in cities against the government and creating
insurgent, rebellious "terrorist grouplets" as
counter-revolutionary elements.
</P>
<P>
He said that several "terrorists" had been captured and 10
bombs seized from them, but he did not further specify his
accusation.
</P>
<P>
Iran enjoyed full internal security and peace due to the fact
that the people had been voluntarily cooperating with the
government in this respect and were fully alert to the
conspiracies of the enemies, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
 while meeting Wednesday with the information minister and some
other high-ranking officials, warned that encroachment upon
Iranian territory and interests would be costly to any aggressors
because of the strategic location of Iran in the region and the
world.
</P>
<P>
"It would backfire on the conspirators and it looks unlikely
that the enemies of Iran would not have realized that by now," he
added.

<HEADLINE> More Homes to be Built in "Greater Jerusalem" Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has agreed to let the settlement movement plan
some 2,000 new homes in Givat Ze'ev and Ma'aleh Adumim in the so
called "Greater Jerusalem area," Israel Radio reported this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Council of Jewish communities in Judea,
Samaria (the West Bank) and the Gaza (Yesha) Yechiel Leiter said
that Mordechai's decision permits the planning of some 850 units
in Givat Ze'ev and 1,200-1,500 units, plus a hotel, in Ma'aleh
Adumim.
</P>
<P>
However, Leiter expressed Yesha's disappointment over the
"modest scope of the decision."
</P>
<P>
"On a scale of our expectations, from 1 to 10, that reaches
about 3," Leiter said. "It is more than we had four months ago,
but it is very far from our expectations."
</P>
<P>
Leiter said there were two reasons for the disappointment,
first, this permission is only for the "Greater Jerusalem"
region, an area where even the previous government built almost
4,000 homes, and the council wants to see building in the heart of
the West Bank as well.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, Mordechai only gave permission to plan, and
there is yet no guarantee that this will be followed by permission
to build.
</P>
<P>
"We thought the government would move at the same pace to
reinstate building in Judea and Samaria as the previous
government moved to halt it," Leiter said. "So far, however, it is
nowhere near that pace."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister's decision was revealed at a time when
tensions between the Palestinians and Israel are escalating
following Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat's
accusation of the Israeli new government's policies as "declaring
a state of war" against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special session of the Palestinian Council (PC)
Wednesday, Arafat called for 4-hour general strike to be observed
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and mass pilgrimage to the
Aqsa Mosque in old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A resolution recommending the suspension of contacts with the
Israelis was also passed by the 88-member legislation council,
the first of this kind which was adopted by the council.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' move came one day after the Israeli Defense
Ministry approved plans for building a new neighborhood in a
settlement in the West Bank, and the Jerusalem Municipality
demolished a Palestinian building in Jerusalem's old City.
</P>
<P>
The new neighborhood, comprises 1,800 housing units, will be
built in the Jewish neighborhood of Kiryat Safer, and 900 housing
units will be constructed under the first stage of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Municipality claimed that Palestinian
building, which the Palestinians said was served as a center for
the city's handicaps, was demolished because it was built without
a license, and financed by the PA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat denounced Israel's activities in the West Bank and
Jerusalem, and invited Israeli Arabs, Jews and Christians to join
him in the war, which, he said, Israel has started.
</P>
<P>
Declaring there will be no Palestinian state without
Jerusalem, Arafat said the Israeli prime minister was "stupid" to
upset the matter of the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time, since Arafat arrived in the
Palestinian autonomous areas in 1994, that he called for a
general strike and urged Palestinian to pray at the Aqsa Mosque
despite Israeli roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that such calls were common
during the period of Intifada (Palestinian uprising) before the
Oslo peace accords were signed between Israel and the
Palestinians in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Housing Project Will Be Speeded Up, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The construction of urban
dwellings will move more quickly and obstacles to its success will
be removed, said Minister for Construction Hou Jie during a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that this idea was originally presented by Vice Premier
Zhu Rongji in mid-July at a meeting on housing reform. Zhu said
then that the construction of urban housing offers new growth
potential to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that the need to speed up the construction of urban
dwellings is an inevitable outcome of the development of the
overall economy, and in turn can push the economy forward.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there is a huge housing problem in China's
cities. On the other hand, people are now beginning to have the
economic ability to afford a house," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the total individual savings in
China now have exceeded 3,500 billion yuan, about 438 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Now is just the right time to buy a house, because the cost of
raw materials for construction, such as steel, wood and cement are
at their lowest point in recent years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hou said that in the past, the light industry, and the
electronics and manufacturing industries played a fundamental role
in pushing the national economy forward.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the consumer hot-point has shifted to urban housing,
the time is right for the construction sector to play a leading
role in the national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that investments in housing will be profitable,
and that the development of home-building and its consumption will
attract a large number of related industries for development.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the construction of urban dwellings is
not just a housing problem, it also is closely related to the
maintaining of social order. He said that without enough houses,
employees will not be content, and society will face potential
disorder.
</P>
<P>
He said that more funds and preferential policies will be given
to encourage both construction and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"The key issue here is to unblock the houses' circulation
channels, and discover a way to sell and transfer the houses
properly," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to do that, cooperation is needed from
the related departments, including the State Planning Commission
and the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Investment emphasis will be placed on the ordinary urban
dwellings, in order to ease the housing problems of medium and
low-income residents, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt Agrees to Increase Workers' Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government
apparently relenting to the ongoing strike by civil servants has
said it will pay them a 20 percent salary increase on top of the
six percent cost of living adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants, who went on strike on Monday last week
demanding salary rises of between 30 and 60 percent, will now
receive a minimum of 26 percent and a maximum of 29 percent for
those entitled to the three percent upward notches in grade
back-dated to July 1.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Florence
Chitauro said last night that the civil servants should have
received the 20 percent, which was part of the 60 percent
recommended by the Public Service Commission after the job
evaluation exercise.
</P>
<P>
She said she was only made aware of the fact that the majority
of the civil servants had not received the 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro admitted that the government had made a mistake in
not awarding the 20 percent increase, but refused to say who had
made the mistake which led to the industrial action.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry only agreed to meet with the
representatives of civil servants to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
''We are now discussing openly with a view of coming up with
an amicable agreement,'' She said.

The loan is being extended at the concessional interest rate
of three percent for the first seven years and four percent
thereafter.

HEFEI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Tourists are returning to the
scenic Huangshan Mountain, after heavy rains hit the area in late
June and early July this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists who visit the mountain every day has
exceeded 5,000 since mid-July, according to sources from the
Administrative Committee for Huangshan Mountain Scenic Area.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, 432,700 tourists had visited the region, of
which 23,100 were from overseas, an increase of 2.2 percent over
the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Business income by the end of July reached 97.57 million yuan,

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Year-Old Graves Unearthed in Southeastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has discovered a number
of 4,000-year-old earthen jars containing skeletons of babies and
adults at Oylum Hoyuk in Kilis bordering Syria.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News today quoted Engin Ozgen,
professor of Hacettepe University, as saying that the excavation
carried out on the eastern side of Oylum Hoyuk has revealed
remains of buildings, large jars used for burials and some small
Early Bronce Age artifacts dated around 2200-2000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Ozgen said that the graves at the mound, which has witnessed
settlement by various civilizations due to its militarily and
economically strategic location between Anatolia, Syria and
Mesopotmia, provided evidence of the regional tradition of
burying the dead under the floor of their dwellings.
</P>
<P>
"We understand from our finds that in this period the dead
were buried under the floor in a jar with their belongs," the
professor said.
</P>
<P>
On the unearthing of a grave stele, Ozgen said: "We have come
across a huge commemorative structural complex in a stratum which
we found was dateable to the Middle Bronce Age. We discovered a
stele in the street near this complex, judged from its size to be
an administrative center."
</P>
<P>
The stele, made of limestone, is 30 centimeters high, 20
centimeters wide and eight centimeters thick, the professor
said.

<HEADLINE> Librarians Accuse Western Powers of Looting China's Library (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- International librarians said today
that newly-discovered evidence showed western countries looted and
destroyed China's largest library during their siege of Beijing in
1900.
</P>
<P>
They described the looting as a crime comparable to the burning
of Alexandrian Library by barbarian Roman soldiers some 2,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1900 an Allied Forces made up of over 2,000 soldiers from
Britain, the United States, France, Russia, Japan, Germany, Italy
and Austria gunned their way into Beijing and looted the
3,000-year-old city, in the name of protecting foreign embassies.
</P>
<P>
The foreign forces led by British Admiral Seymour ransacked
Hanlin Academy, the imperial center for scholarly studies in the
Qing Dynasty which is located in downtown Beijing. All its
collection of precious ancient Chinese books were either taken
away or destroyed during the raid.
</P>
<P>
"The exact contents of the Hanlin Library is not known with
certainty. No record of its collection survives," said Donald G.
Davis JR., professor of the University of Texas at Austin of the
United States, who did a three-year research on destruction of
Chinese books in the Beijing Siege of 1900 with Chinese partner
Cheng Huanwen, professor of China's Zhongshan University.
</P>
<P>
The two scholars showed some of the historical materials they
found at the current 62nd General Conference of the International
Federation of Library Associations and Institutes (IFLA) which
opened in Beijing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"What is known is that the materials housed in the libraries
was irreplaceable. Among the collections was the noted
encyclopedia collection of volumes, 'Yong Le Dadian (Yongle
Encyclopedia)', commissioned by the Ming Dynasty's emperor in the
early 15th century, and the original texts of 'Si Ku Quan Shu',"
said Davis JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Si Ku Quan Shu" is the complete library in four branches of
literature -- philosophy, history, classic and literature, is the
greatest treasure of Chinese traditional literature.
</P>
<P>
Davis JR. briefed IFLA delegates on "Yong Le Da Dian" as "one
of the largest works of its kind ever produced."
</P>
<P>
First compiled between 1403 and 1407, the encyclopedia
consisted of 22,877 sections of which 60 were simply the table of
contents. Altogether the 22,877 sections in 10,095 handwritten
folio volumes contained more than 370 million words -- twelve
times Diderot's famous encyclopedia of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
Davis JR., a leading scholar in library history in the United
States, described British and other foreigners entering the Hanlin
library for its collections by quoting witness:
</P>
<P>
"...books and manuscripts were salvaged more or less at random
by sinologues. Some of the hand-carved wooden blocks on which
works of great antiquity were preserved found their way into the
British Legation; they were used by the Marines for shuttering up
loopholes and by the children, among whom the 'Boxers' were now
only a fashionable game, for constructing miniature barricades."
</P>
<P>
Davis JR. said, "Such vandalism would have even been so hard to
forgive if it had been committed in a conquered city as an act of
retribution. History affords no comparable example of cultural
felo-de-se."
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that he and Davis JR. found a picture taken at the
time -- empty shelves in the Hanlin library with hand-carved
wooden blocks scattered around.
</P>
<P>
"The picture proved that after the British and other foreigners
looted the library, they relentlessly destroyed it," Professor
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout this century, more than 370 volumes, or about 810
sections were accounted for in China and elsewhere. Former Soviet
Union returned 64 volumes from various repositories in the early
1950s. Former East Germany returned three volumes in 1955.
</P>
<P>
"But, the 41 volumes stored at the Congress of Library of
the United States are yet to be returned," Cheng added.
</P>
<P>
"How many more volumes from this unique collection exist in
European and Japanese research libraries or are in private hands
is a matter of speculation," said Davis JR., "how many souvenir
volumes, carried home by people in the Allied Legations in 1900
and hidden away in attic trunks, are unknown. Some could yet
appear."

KUWAIT CITY, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The oil sector of Saudi
Arabia generated a revenue of 41 billion U.S. dollars in 1995,
representing a seven percent increase compared to the previous
year, a study said.
</P>
<P>
The study "Middle East Outlook 1996/97" conducted by the

the revenue generated from the Neutral Zone with Kuwait which
produces 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) shared equally by the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The study said the oil production during 1995 amounted to an
average of 8.02 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the Saudi oil exports will rise to 50.5
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's total oil reserves were 261.2 billion barrels as
recorded by the end of 1995, amounting to 25.7 percent of the
proven total world reserves. This makes the kingdom the world's
largest oil producer.
</P>

in Hiroshima, western Japan, during World War II, the Kyodo News
Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total 46 South Koreans, many of whom are in their 70s and
have suffered from the effects of radiation from the 1945 atomic
bombing of Hiroshima, are seeking a total of 500 million yen
(about 4.7 million U.S. dollars) from the Japanese government and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd..
</P>
<P>
They are seeking 10 million yen (about 90,000 U.S. dollars) for
each in compensation and a further 90,000 yen (about 833
U.S. dollars) for each in unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
They said that after they were unlawfully and forcibly brought
to Japan and made to work during World War II, they suffered from
the effects of the bombing and were then set free without any
compensation.
</P>
<P>
The number of claimants and the sum of compensation sought have
made the suit the largest among six lawsuits of their kind lodged
with Japanese courts by former enslaved laborers from China and
Korea.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Amend Laws on Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Ministry of Power
is considering amendments to the laws on electricity supply to
allow private producers to enter the field of transmission and
distribution which is hitherto a government monopoly, an official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that reforms in the country's power sector, which
started in 1991, had not included privatization measures and the
private sector was neglected over the years.
</P>
<P>
It is now necessary to improve power transmission and
distribution in India and allow the private sector to play a part,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The transmission and distribution of power is now controlled by
the State Electricity Board of India.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Yantai's shimmering beaches and
cultural relics are attracting an increasing number of tourists
from China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
From January to July, Yantai received more than four million
domestic and overseas travelers. More than 55,000 of them were
from overseas, an 85 percent leap over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Located on the coast of the Bohai Bay in east China's Shandong
Province, Yantai features scenic beaches and islands, and numerous
sites of historical interest.
</P>
<P>
Penglai Pavilion, one of the four most famous pavilions in
China, is the top tourist attraction in Yantai. Many legends
circulate about the beautiful ancient structure, which is covered
with the writings and inscriptions of many famous men of letters
in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
And new scenic spots have been built around the pavilion.
</P>
<P>
Yantai was among the first coastal cities to be designated as
open by the Chinese government. With local economic growth and the
influx of overseas investment in recent years, Yantai is expanding
its tourist markets from the traditional areas in Shandong, the
neighboring Liaodong peninsula and part of north China, to other
regions at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The city has opened air routes to more than 20 cities, such as
Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Xi'an, as well as chartered flights to
overseas destinations including Seoul and Hong Kong. An ocean
route to Pusan has also been opened.

<HEADLINE> Introduction of Fine Domestic Animal Breeds in Tibet Fruitful (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past three years, more than 30,000 local sheep have
been artificially inseminated and the breeding of over 30,000 ewes
has been improved.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sheep, breeding hens and pigs are also seen
in the center.
</P>
<P>
The breeds were carefully chosen, said Jin Yaping, director of
the center. He added that their survival rate is high and they can
adapt themselves to local feed such as wheat and barley.
</P>
<P>
According to Jin, local hens do not lay eggs until one year
after being hatched, and they lay a few, and small eggs. But the
introduced hens began laying eggs just 120 days after incubation.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to spread the use of these fine breeds in rural
areas. I am sure that they will benefit Tibetan farmers
substantially," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Meng, lecturer at Northwest China Agriculture University,
who is now in charge of the introduction and spreading of
vegetable technology, said that although the Tibet plateau
environment is not suited to the growing of plants, most vegetable
varieties from other parts of China can grow well in greenhouses
or under plastic sheet-covered sheds.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Zhang and his Tibetan students have
introduced nearly 50 varieties of vegetables from the rest of
China, including the Tianjin cucumber and the Shaanxi tomato.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we planted 0.067 hectare of cucumbers and harvested
more than five thousand kilograms. As a result, the price of
cucumbers in the Gyangze market plunged to 1.4 yuan for one kg
from four yuan," Zhang said happily.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Consumer Confidence Peaks in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in
Singapore on the second half of this year reached an all-time
high, despite recent concern about an economic slowdown, local
newspapers reported today, citing results of a survey.
</P>
<P>
The MasterIndex survey of consumer confidence in the Asia
Pacific region, conducted by the MasterCard International in June,
found that the MasterIndex of consumer sentiment for Singapore
climbed to 84.5 on a scale of zero for pessimism and 100 for
optimism.
</P>
<P>
This has been the highest score for Singapore since the
MasterCard International survey was started in mid-1993, way up
from last year's second-half score of 75.4. The previous highest
record was 82.6 in the second half of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The bi-annual survey asks some 4,860 people in the middle and
high-income groups in 12 countries and regions for their views on
five variables, namely, the economy, employment, regular income,
stock market and quality of life, for the six months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Of the 400 respondents in Singapore, the reports said, just
over half were upbeat about the economy and their income flows in
the six months to December, with about 40 percent "neutral" about
prospects in each case.
</P>
<P>
The reports noted that Singapore's tally was boosted by
all-time high scores for optimism on quality of life, with a score
of 92.2, and regular income, 93.2.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence in the economy was 87.6 and employment,
82.6. They were not far from their record levels.
</P>
<P>
However, expectations about the stock market were much less
positive at 67, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya-Zimbabwe Cooperation In Farming Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has called for cooperation in agriculture between Kenya
and Zimbabwe to prevent food shortages in his country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Agricultural Show of Kenya in Mombasa on
Wednesday, Mugabe said he acknowledged Kenya's success in
Agriculture, which he attributed to visionary government
policies, continuous research, relevant infrastructure and
hard-working farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe who arrived in Kenya for a three-day visit on Tuesday
said Kenya's success in agriculture has enabled it to be
self-sufficient in food production and to have a surplus for
export.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exported food to Zimbabwe last December after successive
droughts occurred there since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Mugabe also called on Africans to
shun tribal and ethnic divisions which he said are akin to
colonial policies of isolation.
</P>
<P>
Such policies brought about by the colonialists have caused
human miseries in Africa which otherwise would have been a
paradise in the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Daniel arap Moi said economic woes in
African countries were due to crippling debt burdens and
increased trade barriers from industrialized countries which
could only be countered by economic integration among African
states.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Moi cited the East Africa
Cooperation initiative, the Common Market for East and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) as examples of such integration.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerating Oil Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 29 (Xinhua)--The Chinese government has invested
6.2 billion yuan (74.7 million US dollars) in 1996 to exploit oil
and gas in Tarim, Junggar and the Turpan-Hami basins in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The investment has been in conjunction with experts'
predictions that the discovery of oil and gas has entered another
peak period. Over 100 industrial oil-bearing structures have been
verified in the three basins.
</P>
<P>
This year, China has accelerated its exploitation of oil by
selecting 20 large promising oil-bearing structures in the Tarim
basin. By August, workers had acquired industrial oil streams in
13 out of 23 oil wells under exploration there.
</P>
<P>
The exploiting group has discovered the Caidong Desert
oilfield, with a reserve of 45 million tons of crude oil, and
Hutubi gas field with 20 billion cubic meters. The Lukqun
structure near Aydinhu lake has a verified reserve of over 50
million tons o of oil.
</P>
<P>
The Tazhong 4 oilfield in the Tarim basin, which has a reserve
of 100 million tons, has shown a promising future. By July, the 41
designed oil wells had been completed with some having 3,000 tons
daily oil-production capacity. By the end of 1996, the oilfield
will have an annual production capacity of five million tons,
together with the other four oilfields.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary preparation has been finished for the
exploitation of Turpan oilfield. This year, the crude oil
production capacity will climb to 3.5 million tons. The Xiaoguai
oilfield which is in the older Junggar oilfield is expected to
have proven reserves up to 59 million tons.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year,the crude oil production capacity in
Xinjiang is expected to rise to 17 million tons from the 15
million tons reported in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The China National Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and
Development Corporation has set a goal to discover 1.5 billion
tons of oil, with a combined annual production capacity of 24
million tons of crude oil in the three basins during the next five
years.

LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
procured a quantity of drugs worth 4.2 billion Kwacha (about 3.3
million US Dollars) under an emergency arrangement to meet the
demands in the country.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Health Minister Katele Kalumba as
confirming on Wednesday that the drugs, which were part of the
World Bank facility amounting to 6.0 billion Kwacha (4.6 million
US Dollars) had finally arrived and were being stored at Medical
Stores.
</P>
<P>
Contingency measures were approved by the government early
this month to obtain drugs worth more than 10 billion Kwacha
(about 8.0 million US Dollars) between now and next year to avoid
shortages.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Medical Stores have been receiving
requests for the supply of drugs from hospitals including Ndola
central hospital, Mansa general hospital and Lusaka urban health
centers.
</P>
<P>
The company, however, has been unable to supply the hospitals
because of the huge debt of 1.2 billion Kwacha (0.95 million US
Dollars) it is now owed by hospital boards, which forces it to
start demanding cash payment.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks to Resume Next Week: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has promised Palestinian Authority (PA) leader Yasser
Arafat that Israeli-Palestinian talks will resume within a week,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Levy made a phone call late Wednesday night to Arafat after he
called on Palestinians in the territories to stage a massive
strike today and make a pilgrimage to the Al-Aksa Mosque in east
Jerusalem Friday.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Arafat the Israeli-Palestinian steering committee on
peace negotiations would meet within four days, as Israel was in
the process of drawing up new proposals for the resumption of the
talks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat demanded an immediate resumption of the peace talks and
a second meeting with Levy, with whom he held the first meeting on
July 23.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his call for strike which has aroused concern
about renewed violence between the two sides, Arafat said he was
trying hard to calm down the situation but faced "great
difficulties," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy also telephoned Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti to request him to help ease the current tension
between Israel and the PA.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti is expected to travel to the territories today to
hold a meeting with Arafat. Promising to take steps to prevent
the deterioration of the situation, he also demanded Israel to
refrain from putting more pressure on Arafat who was facing
"tremendous difficulties," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Danny Naveh, Director-General of the Israeli cabinet, also told
Israel Television that the Israeli-Palestinian talks would be
renewed soon to discuss all outstanding issues including Israeli
pullback from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed its troops
 redeployment in the volatile West Bank town of Hebron by
March. But the former Labor government froze the plan since a
series of suicide bombing attacks killed 58 people inside Israel
in late February and early March.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli hardline Likud government has promised to honor
the signed agreements. But at the same time it wants to revise
the Hebron redeployment under the excuse of protecting the
security of over 400 Jewish settlers who live among 200,000
Palestinians. The PA strongly opposed such a move.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the stagnation of the peace process, Israel's
continuing closure on the territories has led the Palestinian
economy from bad to worse, fueling the dissent that is
undermining the leadership of Arafat and the Authority.

<HEADLINE> Expansion of Property Management in Beijing Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A group of noted Beijingers are
urging the expansion of property management in the capital's urban
residential areas to create better living conditions for
residents, today's "China Daily" says.
</P>
<P>
It is no longer enough to simply collect rents and make repairs
after the damage has been done, the Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference told the
municipal government in a report last week.
</P>
<P>
After a four-month investigation of Beijing's real estate
industry, the committee suggested that a "comprehensive,
specialized, socialized ad multi-function" management system be
applied to all new urban housing projects, instead of collecting
rent and having repairs made by government-appointed organizations.
</P>
<P>
The paper says, under the proposed new property management
system, specialized companies would be paid to look after the
housing projects and provide various needed services to residents.
</P>
<P>
Since the rapid development of China's real estate began in
1990, real estate management has become a new industry across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In each of the past six years, Beijing has constructed about 10
residential areas for local residents.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, one-fourth of the city's residents
were living in well-designed housing. Beijing has designated 263
large residential areas of which 82 have been completed and 181
are under construction, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Among these residential areas, 10 percent provide tenants with
full services.

<HEADLINE> Fatal Coconut Disease Hits Sri Lankan Plantations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A fatal coconut disease has hit
Sri Lanka's southern coconut plantations, sources from the Coconut
Research Institute said here today.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 bearing coconut palms have already been affected by
the disease -- identified as Ganoderma Root and Bole Rot caused by
a soil borne fungus Ganoderma Boninense, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said the infection, which eventually leaves the coconut
tree a tapering crownless trunk, usually affects bearing palms
aged between 15 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The disease, spread through root contacts and water, is often
aggravated by dry weather. Irrigation canals and reservoirs are
largely responsible for the spread of the disease, the sources
noted.
</P>
<P>
The institute has launched a detailed field survey in the
affected areas in a bid to check the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The coconut industry is one of Sri Lanka's primary agricultural
industries, along with tea and rubber. The country produces about
2,622 million coconut nuts per year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces
are on high alert following Wednesday night's shooting attack on a
bus near the West Bank town of Bethlehem, in which two passengers
were lightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred when unidentified gunmen opened fire at
a Hebron-bond No.160 bus traveling on the bypass road leading to
Gush Etzion, a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said that 15 shots were fired at the bus, and
glass shards of the bus slightly injured Moshe Shahar, 54, and
Rafael Elbaum, 46, in their legs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops quickly began searches, and declared the
Bethlehem area a closed military zone, baring Palestinians from
moving out of the town until the conclusion of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Dayan, head of the Central Command of the Israeli army,
told Israel Radio that at least two people carried out the attack,
adding that security forces had arrested one suspect.
</P>
<P>
Security sources are checking the possibility that a group of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, known as the
Halhour Band, is responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The same group may have been responsible for the two
driving-by shooting attacks near the Hebron area in recent
months, during which four Israelis were killed.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday night condemned the
attack, saying there will be a strong response to terror attacks
or any other violence activities.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel would not agree to return to a situation
of mass terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinian extremist
groups to put pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it was up to the Palestinian Authority (PA)to
fight terror as it was committed to do, adding that the PA was
also obliged to respect its commitments made not to operate in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after PA President Yasser Arafat blasted
Israeli new government's policies as "declaring a state of war"
against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special session of the Palestinian Council (PC)
Wednesday, Arafat called for 4-hour general strike to be observed
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and mass pilgrimage to the
Aqsa Mosque in old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A resolution recommending the suspension of contacts with the
Israelis was also passed by the 88-member legislation council,
the first of this kind which was adopted by the council.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces said that there was no special
deployment due to Arafat's statement, but soldiers would be
poised to deal with any security problem that may arise.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that troops manning roadblocks have
been instructed to particularly diligent in their security
checks and to only allow those Palestinians with valid permits
to enter the Jerusalem area.

HANOI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam is

<HEADLINE> India's Software Export to Quadruple by 2000: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- India's revenue from software
exports is expected to touch 100 billion rupees (2.86 billion U.S.
dollars) by the year 1999-2000 from 25 billion rupees (75.7
million U.S. dollars) in 1995-96, said a latest study of the
Export-Import (EXIM) bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's software exports grew at an annual rate of 57
percent in the last four years, said the study.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Europe accounted for about 78 percent of India's
total software exports while the emerging markets were Far East,
West Asia, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the main strength of India's software
industry lies in the availability of a large pool of low-cost
skilled manpower, the international recognition of the
availability of a wide range of skills and expertise, liberalized
economy and quality orientation of software exporting companies.

<HEADLINE> Introduction of Fine Domestic Animal Breeds In Tibet Fruitful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Lhaba Cering, 66, a Tibetan
farmer, was washing a large sheep by a brook near his village. The
sheep hedged about and Lhaba was spattered with mud.
</P>
<P>
Onlookers watched the spectacle curiously, taking a keen
interest in the 'king-sized' sheep.
</P>
<P>
"My sheep is not a local one. It's an off-spring of the Inner
Mongolian sheep," Lhaba said proudly.
</P>
<P>
Lhaba is a resident of Niandui Township, Gyangze County, Xigaze
Prefecture, southeastern Tibet. When a sheep-breed improvement
center was established there in 1993, Lhaba was among the first to
send his sheep to receive artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
"The Inner Mongolia sheep are very good indeed. The local sheep
can only produce about 0.5 kg of wool and 20 kg of mutton a year,
while the Inner Mongolia sheep can produce 4.5 kg wool and 50 kg
of mutton a year. The quality of the meat is much higher too,"
commended Lhaba.
</P>
<P>
The village now has 100 Inner Mongolia sheep, Lhaba said,
adding that he has four.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Tibet have introduced livestock of fine breeds from
other parts of China, according to an official of the regional
government.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, seven professors from Northwest China Agriculture
University in Xianyang, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, were
invited by the Tibet regional government to set up a center for
spreading agro-techniques in Gyangze County. They concentrated on
introducing fine species of plants and domestic animals into
Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Development Board
(TDB) of Singapore plans to make Singapore an international
franchise hub for home-grown and international franchises, the
Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, Singapore will host its first franchise
exhibition and conference -- Global Franchising 97 -- on September
25-27 next year, which is expected to bring together 180
exhibitors from 28 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior TDB official as saying that the TDB,
a statutory body under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, will
help successful local businesses develop home-grown franchises,
assist local companies in acquiring master franchise rights for
the region, and promote Singapore as the regional headquarters for
franchise holders and franchisers.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said it hopes to have 125 local franchisers and 175
foreign master franchises in Singapore by the year 2000, up from
85 local franchisers and 125 foreign master franchises at present.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the franchising business now makes
up 13 percent of the total domestic retail sales volume in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said the TDB is working with other government agencies like
the Economic Development Board and the Productivity and Standards
Board to develop the franchise industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and
Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing
satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite
on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is
estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon
rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said
Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
</P>
<P>
Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly
through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months
annually, but the RSSs can do that.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to
build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in
Amazon's Pantanal wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will
build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the
satellites.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa,
recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the
RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Export Drop to Cause Major Job Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- A severe drop in Thailand's
exports of 42 key products, which constitute 85 percent of the
export revenue, is expected to result in the loss of 616,400 jobs
this year, The Nation daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The business sector will have to resort to cutting job to make
export products competitive amid negative growth and rising wages,
the local SCB Research Institute was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The largest cut of 486,000 jobs will take place in the
country's sunset industries, which cover 18 products such as
threads, fibers and rubber products, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
These industries witnessed a 19.6 percent export drop in the
first five months of this year. The export growth rate of these
industries ranged from minus 0.7 percent to minus 47.5 percent
during the said period.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's five traditional agricultural products -- rice,
rubber, sugar, tapioca products and coffee -- recorded a meager
export growth of 5.4 percent, which could not cover rising wages,
the institute said.
</P>
<P>
These sectors could shed 114,000 jobs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Medium-growth sectors will cut 16,400 jobs, while rising
industries, recording a 25.2 percent export growth, will hire an
additional 175,000 workers, according to the institute.

<HEADLINE> Global Coffee Consumption Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Global coffee
consumption in this decade is heading downhill but its geographic
distribution tends to be more balanced, says a study by the
International Coffee Organization.
</P>
<P>
While the average annual growth of coffee consumption was 1.3
percent between the eighties and the 1991/92 coffee-growing year,
the demand for this product has practically stood still since the
1992/93 year.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90 million sacks of coffee beans were consumed
around the world during the 1995/96 year, and another 90 million
sacks are predicted to be used for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The study attributes the decrease in consumption to the
economic problems in several important coffee-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coffee has been consumed by more and more
countries. The United States, which purchased one half of the
coffee beans in the 1960s, reduced its share to 26 percent during
the 1994/95 year, while the European Union countries took up the
biggest share of 50 percent. The share of the Far East rose to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the study predicts an upward trend for coffee
consumption for the next two decades, with the greatest increase
likely to be in the new markets in central and eastern Europe,
Asia and several Latin American countries.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) withheld a 5-million-U.S.-dollar credit to
Colombia, Finance Minister Jose Ocampo told the Senate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the credit, requested by Colombia from the IDB's
Multilateral Investment Fund, was vetoed by the United States as
part of its economic sanctions against the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The United States, critical of Colombia's anti-drug war,
revoked the visa of President Ernesto Samper for his alleged ties
with drug traffickers and cut its economic aid to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo hoped that the IDB credit will be resumed once the
United States reconsiders the anti-drug policy of the Samper
government.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Public Employees Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1 million public
employees walked off their jobs today in Venezuela to protest
against an unfulfilled promise made by the government.
</P>
<P>
The 12-hour strike, which began at 06:00 local time, was called
by the National Federation of Public Employees (FEDEUNEP).
</P>
<P>
The organization said the top-level authorities of the Labor
Ministry and the General Prosecutor's Office had repeatedly failed
to comply with the commitments they signed with the union.
</P>
<P>
The employees were demanding a compensatory bonus, which had
been announced by the government but never given to them.
</P>
<P>
They were also demanding that they send a representative to the
meetings being held to restructure public administration offices.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, FEDEUNEP President Carlos Borges has
been warning the government that it would undertake pressure
tactics after the 120 hours of conciliation established by labor
laws expired.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Labor Ministry and other public bodies met
Tuesday with the directors of the federation in an attempt to
prevent the strike.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry classified the strike as illegal because
they said the government was not denying the workers their
economic rights.
</P>
<P>
The FEDEUNEP declared that it will go further and has scheduled
a march to the national congress Thursday.

Helmut Kohl will yield concrete political and economic results,
President Leonid Kuchma said today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dutch Pair Kidnapped in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government said
today that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree
farm in northern Costa Rica was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife, Jetsi Hendrika Coers, both 50
years old, were seized late Saturday or early Sunday by at least
two gunmen who took the couple off their own car, leaving behind a
ransom note demanding 1.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Security Minister Bernardo Arce said that the
kidnapping took a different turn because former Nicaraguan
guerrillas were involved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, a German tourist and her Swiss tour guide
were kidnapped also from northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan
border.
</P>
<P>
They were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to
free them.
</P>
<P>
Two former Nicaraguan guerrillas have been arrested in
connection with that kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Because of apparent threats to foreigners in Costa Rica near
the Nicaraguan border, the security minister said the government
has advised many to take additional security measures on their
own.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand exported rice worth 30
billion baht (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the first seven months
of this year, an increase of two billion baht (80 million U.S.
dollars) in value over the same period last year, the daily
Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of rice exports in the period dropped to
3.2 million tons from 3.7 million tons in the corresponding period
last year, said Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan, who is
chairman of the Rice Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee on Wednesday agreed to set up a sub-committee to
monitor the country's rice output and markets worldwide and assess
the findings at its next meeting to draft the rice export policy
for the 1996-1997 crop.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also approved low-interest loans of 400
million baht (16 million U.S. dollars), probably at an interest
rate of 3.5 percent a year, for millers and exporters to buy
dryers to help paddy growers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges U.S. to Lift Shrimp Import Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has asked
the U.S. to lift an import ban on Thai shrimp for one year to
enable Thai companies to improve its farming methods, the Bangkok
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Montri Pongpanich made the request
at a meeting here Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador to Thailand
William Itoh on trade issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Montri said he asked the U.S. ambassador to support Thailand's
proposal to temporarily lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
The ban was launched in connection with the failure of Thai
fishermen to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs), which pushed
environmentalists to campaign and pressure the U.S. government to
ban the import.
</P>
<P>
Montri said the Thai side hopes the ban will be relaxed and one
year will be given to Thai fishermen to meet the requirement by
installing TEDs.
</P>
<P>
He said the ambassador was positive to the request and expected
the issue to be officially discussed during a visit by a U.S.
fishery delegation to Thailand next month.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian P.M Sees Good Relations With Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Ukraine are nearing the
conclusion of a long-delayed agreement on friendship and
cooperation after prime ministers of the two countries met in
Moscow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko made this remark after
returning from his one-day Moscow visit, last night.
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting with his Russian counterpart, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, as constructive, saying they had reached
understandings on almost all the major issues.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of economic and trade cooperation and the future
of the Black Sea Fleet, the latter the major obstacle to the
signing of friendship agreement, occupied their
nine-and-a-half-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko said Russia, Ukraine's top creditor nation, was and
was always his country's major trade partner.
</P>
<P>
As for the Black Sea Fleet, there existed the possibility of
the two sides reaching a final agreement within months.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been a sticking point in relations between the
two countries since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Both
claimed rights to the former Soviet fleet, based on the Ukrainian
peninsula of Crimea.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have already reached preliminary agreements
on the fleet, but remain at odds over the status of the city of
Sevastopol, the fleet's base, and what to do with many of the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to another report from the Ukrainian National
Information Agency, Chernomyrdin also spoke highly of the meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the prime minister as saying that Russia's
Ukraine-policy was stable and Russia was keen to establish a true
strategic partnership with Ukraine.

JAKARTA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Troops have been withdrawn from
streets of Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, as situation has
returned to normal, military sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Four battalions had been deployed at some of the city's main
streets following the violent takeover of the headquarters of the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) on July 27 and the riots that
ensued.
</P>
<P>
Commander of Jakarta's Jaya Sakti Infantry Brig. Col.
Tritamtomo confirmed Wednesday that his troops were withdrawn from
Jakarta's streets, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Upon the order of the chief of the Jakarta military command,
the gradual withdrawal of the troops has been completed," said
Tritamtomo, adding that all troops have returned to their
respective stations.
</P>
<P>
On whether the chief of the Jakarta military command has also
revoked the shoot-on-sight order, Tritamtomo said, "no one has so
far been victimized by the order. There is no problem with that.
We only obey instructions."

<HEADLINE> Old Suzhou's Population Level Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The population in the
2,500-year-old city of Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province has
had an annual decline of 3,200 persons over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The population of the old urban area of this booming city,
known as the "Oriental Venice", is 320,948, compared with 353,652
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The city is famous for its 60-odd traditional Chinese gardens,
making it one of the main tourist attractions in China.
</P>
<P>
The city is now divided into two parts: the old urban area and
a newer area. The city's total population is 1.05 million,
compared with 710,000 ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The population drop in the older part of the city is due to the
fact that the city wants to protect traditional culture and
gardens and is increasing population controls.
</P>
<P>
Only some professionals that are needed in the older part are
allowed to move in and reside there. In the past decade, no new
factories have been allowed there, and over 130 factories have
been moved outside, and some 8,000 households, with 30,000
residents, were persuaded to move out of the older part.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the relaxation of population pressures has led to
better protection of the older part, where 800 old lanes, 163
bridges, and a 35-kilometer canal have been repaired.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou New Area in the western part of the city is a
booming industrial and trading zone, with fast economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Near Leihe Village, in Huimeng
Town, Mengjin County, in central China's Henan Province, there is
a 1500-year old temple where several dozen ancient stone tablets
are kept.
</P>
<P>
For many years the temple was empty and the stone tablets were
unprotected. Last year, however, the local government renovated
the temple, but, because of financial reasons the government was
not able to put someone in charge of cultural relics protection
there.
</P>
<P>
The problem was soon solved, however, when 72-year-old Shi
Songfeng volunteered to put a hut near the temple to live in to
watch the cherished stone tablets.
</P>
<P>
"We have hundreds of relics that can be traced to nearly all
ancient dynasties, 25 of which are under key state protection",
said a local county official.
</P>
<P>
But, because the county is one of the poorest in Henan, the
task of protecting the cultural relics has long been considered a
financial burden, and peasants were known to rob ancient tombs and
sell the cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
"At that time we knew that without the understanding and
participation of the local farmers the protection of all the
cultural relics would be extremely difficult", said the official.
</P>
<P>
So, the government started to educate the public about cultural
relics protection and issued regulations.
</P>
<P>
"Now the situation is much better, with 26 volunteers having
formed a county-wide protection network and playing a significant
role in the protection," the official explained.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Sen, a man who is nearly 60, often patrols near his
village at night to make sure that the ancient tombs there are not
broken into.
</P>
<P>
In another village, the villagers voluntarily set up a
particular cultural relics zone where they decided not to build
any houses.
</P>
<P>
"Now with the participation of the farmers, the cultural relics
protection has become much easier," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Issues Chechen Orders, But No Lebed Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President's Press
Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today that President Boris
Yeltsin has issued corresponding orders after thoroughly studying
plans by peace envoy Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
He added however that the president had no plans to meet Lebed
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing in the Kremlin, Yastrzhembsky said the new
orders made the old ones more concrete and were aimed at
consolidating the peacemaking process and leading it towards
constructive decisions. But the spokesman did not detail the
orders.
</P>
<P>
While Yeltsin had no immediate plans to meet Lebed,
Yastrzhembsky said this should not be considered a factor
obstructing the political resolution of the Chechen crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council, was appointed
as presidential plenipotentiary in Chechnya two weeks ago to solve
the crisis there. He suspended his talks with Chechen rebels on
Sunday and flew to Moscow expressly to get Yeltsin's backing for
his plans on Chechnya's political future.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Lebed expressed hopes of meeting Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. But the president, who met the
prime minister on Monday, has not met Lebed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Yeltsin and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl held talks on the Chechen issue by
telephone on Monday and Wednesday and discussed Kohl's one-day
visit to Moscow on September 7.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
financial city has ordered 620 million yuan-worth of advanced
switching equipment to double its mobile telecommunications
capacity by July of next year.
</P>
<P>
By then the city's mobile telephone switching capacity will
exceed 800,000 channels, according to People's Post and
Telecommunications News.
</P>
<P>
Out of that investment, about 370 million yuan will be spent on
mobile telecom equipment manufactured by a local company, Dongfang
Telecom, for a mobile switching machine and 71 base stations,
adding 3,128 channels to the city's analog mobile telecom network,
bringing the switching capacity to more than 200,000 channels, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The other 250 million yuan will be for GSM (global service for
mobile communications) equipment from Siemens. Shanghai Siemens
Co., a joint venture, will supply three mobile switches and 103
base stations for expanding the city's GSM network. Upon
completion, Shanghai's GSM switching capacity will be 230,000

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Becomes Oil Multinationals' Investment Hot Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Chemical Company of the
United States will invest four billion US dollars to build an
ethylene plant with an annual production output of 400,000 tons in
north China's port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The project marks a new round of investments by multinational
companies in petrochemicals in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The city has become a favorite investment area for oil
multinationals, such as Mobil, Shell, Esso, Japan Energy and
Caltex.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1994, Mobil invested 30 million US dollars to
establish a lube blending plant with a yearly production capacity
of 60,000 tons in the southern part of the city's port.
</P>
<P>
Later, Esso invested nearly the same amount to establish a
similar-sized plant in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shell's investments in the southern part of the port have
surpassed 100 million US dollars, including a 60,000-ton lube
blender, a depot capable of handling 1.5 million tons annually and
an oil pipeline leading to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The area will be built into China's largest kerosene import
transfer station.
</P>
<P>
Caltex plans to build a lube blender in a bonded zone in the
northern port area.
</P>
<P>
The companies made individual investments, but Japan Energy
opted for a joint venture to set up a lube blender project in
Hangu.
</P>
<P>
Yu Heyuan, deputy director of the Tianjin Port Office, said
that the Dow Chemical investment project is under active
negotiation, and other multinationals investment projects are
operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Projects funded by Shell and Mobil are nearing completion. Some
companies have increased their investments to expand production
scales and varieties.
</P>
<P>
"The sign that so many multinationals are focusing in a port
covering only 30 square kilometers indicates that the port will
become a new petrochemical industry base in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the completion of a range of infrastructure
facilities is one reason why so many multinationals have been
attracted to Tianjin. The city has made major investments in
building three berths in the port, and also in a railway bridge
linking its north and south areas.
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts said another reason is that the sudden increase of
luxury cars and precision instruments in China in recent years has
greatly raised market demands for lube and oil-based products. But
present domestic production capacity cannot yet meet the market
demands.
</P>
<P>
As it is endowed with a better industrial foundation and
convenient traffic conditions, the largest port city in north
China will be the best investment destination for overseas oil
companies, analysts noted.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Increases for Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province actually utilized 823 million US dollars in the first
seven months of this year, up 65.6 percent over the same 1995
period.
</P>
<P>
A batch of large foreign companies, including General Motors of
the US, have invested in Hebei, and the investment for many of
their projects surpassed ten million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the seven-month period, Hebei approved a total of 491
foreign-funded contracts, which were valued at 2.21 billion US
dollars, up 59.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the increase of foreign investment
to several business fairs. Hebei's chemical, medicine, grain, and
electronics departments have separately held fairs to lure
overseas investment over the period.

<P>
SAN JOSE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto arrived in Costa Rica today for a brief three-hour visit
during which he will meet the leaders of Guatemala, Honduras and
Belize as well as Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here noted that Hashimoto's meeting with these
leaders is awakening expectations in the region for closer
financial and commercial cooperation with and more technical
assistance from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficits of these countries with Japan will top the list
of issues to be discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing before the meeting, Honduran President
Carlos Roberto Reina hoped that Japan would give these countries
more aid in exchange for their support for Japan's effort to enter
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu said he was convinced that
Japan would expand cooperation with his country once a peace
accord was signed by the government and the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting will be representatives from El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama, whose presidents are unable to
come.
</P>
<P>
San Jose is the fifth stop of Hashimoto's Latin American tour.
He has been to Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Troops Clash with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military mounted
an air and ground assault on a rebel Muslim training camp in the
south, leaving ten people dead, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said nine MORO Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) men
and one member of the Philippine armed forces were killed in
Wednesday's operation in south Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is one potent MORO rebel group who opposes the peace
deal between the government and the MORO National Liberation Front
(MNLF) and vows to continue seeking Muslim independence in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, the army artillery and the air force
gunships were pounding the MILF training camp, which was estimated
to house 200 fighters. The rebels fled away.
</P>
<P>
It was not known which side initiated the clash. Both have been
observing a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The incident coincided with the smooth progress in the final
round of peace talks between the government and the MNLF in
Jakarta. The talks are expected to lead to the initialing of the
final peace deal on August 31 and the signing in Manila on
September 2.
</P>
<P>
The government and MNLF peace negotiators are saying that there
are no more hitches to the signing of the agreement to end the
24-year war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"We are now at the end of the road and this is the road to
peace," said Nur Misuari, the MNLF chairman, while an equally
confident President Ramos told newsmen in Manila that he does not
see "last minute hitches (to the signing of the accord)."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos dared critics of the Mindanao peace plan to
sue him for ordering the creation of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
He said he "welcome any legal challenge" to the peace formula
but the constitution provides that people's initiative can not be
used to challenge purely executive action.

<HEADLINE> Sun Yat-sen's Grand-Daughter Committed To His Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Lily Sui-Fang Sun Wong,
granddaughter of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, has vowed to continue
her hard work to realize the ideals of her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
She said that her grandfather's program of governing China is
still "very useful" to China's construction.
</P>
<P>
Sun, 60, now lives in the US. In an interview with Xinhua, she
revealed her memories and the way she worshipped her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
Sun, chairwoman of the Sun Yet-sen Education and Peace
Foundation, and a board member of three U.S. universities, firmly
follows Sun Yat-sen's ideas. Last year her book, "My Grandfather
Sun Yat-sen", was published.
</P>
<P>
Every year she travels the world, including Taiwan region, to
deliver speeches, in an effort to spread Sun Yat-sen's ideas.
</P>
<P>
"I resolutely oppose the independence of Taiwan. Dr. Sun
Yat-sen stood for harmony of the whole world, let alone the
Chinese inland area and Taiwan, both of which are part of China,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997, she
said, "Of course, it's good. I hope Hong Kong will remain
unchanged in its social system for 50 years, just as Mr. Deng
Xiaoping has promised."
</P>
<P>
Sun is also a pious Buddhist believer. She dedicates most of
her energy to the charitable course. This time she returned to
China to attend the Second Congress of the Liaoning Charitable
Federation. She was elected the honorary chairwoman of the
federation.
</P>
<P>
Sun, born in Shanghai, studied and worked in Hong Kong, Taiwan,
the Chinese mainland and the United States, and finally settled in
Honolulu, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Charity is her lifetime goal and is also the best method to
carry forward Sun Yat-sen's ideas, said Sun, who has served as a
guarantor for the study of eighty students from the Chinese
mainland in the US.
</P>
<P>
She has spent more than 10 million yuan in northeast China's
Liaoning Province improving the breed of cattle. She has set up
universities and hospitals in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"I am just doing what my grandfather stood for," she said,
adding that she will follow the example of her grandfather and
work hard to realize his ideas.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I believe that a kind person will come to a good
end."
</P>
<P>
Last year, she was granted an honorary doctorate degree by the
Prime Minister of Sri Lanka to commend her for her contributions
to humanity and world peace.
</P>
<P>
In addition to handling matters related to charities, she
serves as an envoy promoting cultural exchanges between the West
and the East.

<HEADLINE> Haemophilia Expert Arrested Over HIV-Tainted Coagulants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Public
Prosecutors Office announced here today the arrest of Takeshi Abe,
a leading haemophilia expert.
</P>
<P>
Abe, 80, former Vice President of Teikyo University, was taken
from his Tokyo home following his questioning earlier in the day.
His arrest was based on suspicion he allowed HIV-tainted
blood-clotting agents to be administered to patients while aware
of the risk of HIV infection, according to a Kyodo report.
</P>
<P>
As the questioning continued, prosecutors searched Abe's home
and other places for evidence of suspected professional negligence
as a doctor, resulting in the death of a haemophiliac, a crime
punishable with a maximum prison term of five years.
</P>
<P>
The family of a man who died of AIDS in 1991 after being
administered HIV-contaminated blood coagulant in 1985 filed a
murder complaint against Abe with the prosecutor's office this
February.
</P>
<P>
Abe, who once worked at Teikyo University's Tokyo hospital,
was the head of a government study team on AIDS that in 1985
authorized the use of heat-treated blood products considered safe
from HIV.
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are also looking at whether Health and Welfare
Ministry officials could be held responsible for related
professional negligence, law enforcement sources said.
</P>
<P>
 The ministry did not order the recall of untreated blood
products even after licensing the safe, heat-treated coagulant.
Untreated blood products were not fully withdrawn from the market
until 1988.
</P>
<P>
 Tainted products infected about 1,800 of the nation's 4,500
haemophiliacs with HIV in the 1980s, and some 400 have already
died of AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Restrictions Eased for Developing Foreign Trade in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities
will allow Shanghai, the country's largest industrial and
commercial center, to have greater autonomy in approving the
establishment of foreign trade companies in its booming Pudong New
Area.
</P>
<P>
The city will have autonomy in approving foreign trade
enterprises in coastal areas with an export volume of more than 10
million US dollars each, and foreign trade enterprises in
land-locked areas with an export volume of more than five million
US dollars each, to set up branches in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade companies elsewhere will enjoy the same treatment
the central authorities give to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Income tax on foreign companies will be levied at a rate of 15
percent; if their goods are exported from Shanghai, and they
declare the goods to Shanghai Customs, they may enjoy the same tax
refund policies, just as Shanghai enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By June, 51 foreign trade enterprises owned by other provinces,
cities or central government agencies had established branches in
Pudong, and many of them have started businesses.
</P>
<P>
At present, port functions in Pudong have taken
shape. Businesses are mainly undertaken by international shipping
and Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone. Pudong has opened nine international
navigation routes to Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America, seven of
which have gone into operation. The port is now capable of
handling more than 2.7 million tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
With favorable geographical advantages and favorable policies,
the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone is developing the processing trade and
the entrepot trade on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
It has conducted imports and exports business with over 130
countries or regions. Its major trade partners include Japan, the
United States, Southeast Asia, Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the functions of the port and enhance ties
with international markets, Pudong will allow companies
exclusively invested by overseas businesses, or Sino-overseas
joint venture trade companies, to set up in the bonded zone. In
the zone, enterprises can carry out processings, but the
duty-security system will not be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The zone will also pilot service trades, so that breakthroughs
can be made in international financing, shipping, goods
distribution, consulting services and commodity inspection
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Local customs will also introduce a range of measures to merge
with international practices and further guarantee the development
of port functions.

<HEADLINE> Police Chief Suggests Death for Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Colombian law
enforcement officer today called for the death penalty or life
imprisonment for kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Rosso Jose Serrano Cadena, director of the Colombian National
Police, pointed out that with 1,200 kidnappings a year, Colombia
had the highest kidnapping rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
Right now about 550 people are being held by their kidnappers
in Colombia, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Serrano Cadena told a press conference that though the death
penalty was prohibited in Colombia, it should be imposed on these
"vagabonds".
</P>
<P>
"We need harsh and coercive measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Serrano Cadena said that if Colombian legislators decided on
life imprisonment as a punishment, the convicted kidnappers should
be held in maximum security jails.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappers continued to arrange kidnappings from inside prisons
and when they get out, said the police chief.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the figures, it seems that we have lacked the will
to halt this crime."
</P>
<P>
In Colombia, kidnappers are now given the same punishment as
car thieves.
</P>
<P>
Colombian Army Commander Harold Bedoya Pizarro said today that
the congress should discuss the establishment of a death penalty
system in the country to crack down on kidnappers and drug
traffickers and terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Ferreira Falls to Nainkin at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ninth-seeded Wayne Ferreira
suffered a surprise defeat to fellow South African David Nainkin
in the first round of the U.S. Open tennis on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Nainkin, ranked 215th in the world, took two
hours and 22 minutes to oust Ferreira, the world number seven who
became the fourth men's seed to fall in the first round and eighth
overall.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Grand Slam win for Nainkin, who has played
as a qualifier in six of his seven Grand Slams and a lucky loser
in the other.
</P>
<P>
Nainkin converted five of six breakpoints, including his second
match point in the 12th game of the fourth set before winning the
match 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
American Todd Martin advanced into the second round in the

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Expects Kohl's Visit to Boost Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 39 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine gives top priority to its
relations with Germany and hopes the upcoming visit by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will yield concrete political and economic results,
President Leonid Kuchma said today.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who will begin a three-day official visit on Monday, is
the first German Chancellor to do so since Ukraine declared
independence from the former Soviet Union in August 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kohl is expected to hold talks with Kuchma, Prime Minister
Pavel Lazarenko and Parliament Speaker Alexander Moroz over
bilateral economic and energy policies, Ukraine's econonic and
political reforms.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the future European security structure,
the enlargement of the European Council and the prospect of NATO's
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will sign a series of documents, including a
cooperation accord between TV stations.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma visited Germany in July last year. Germany now leads
most other western European countries in investment in and trade
with Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Curb Arable Land Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to spend 50 million yuan (5.9 million U.S. dollars)
to preserve its arable land and conserve its water resources in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
An official from the province's Office of Water and Soil
Conservation said during that period, one million hectares of land
will be "rescued," in an effort to race against time to support
its population on gradually decreasing arable land.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that if the target is realized,
the amount of recovered land will exceed the amount lost each year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning's three million hectares of arable land is declining
by 20,000 hectares a year.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, though embracing rich natural resources, is dwarfed
by its ratio of 900 cubic meters of water per resident -- one
fourth of the national average.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to expand arable land, the province has
auctioned off waste land to farmers willing to cultivate the land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the rights to over 80,000 hectares of
barren land had been leased for agricultural development by
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Unprepared Enlargement to Hurt EU Unity: Kinkel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Accepting new members without
ample preparation and coordination would undermine the unity and
action capacity of the European Union (EU), German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the "1996 Alpbach European Forum", Kinkel stressed
that establishing a monetary union and accepting new members were
two crucial issues for the EU, and improper handling of them would
put the EU's integration at stake.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that the EU had signed agreements to
grant the associate membership to 10 countries: Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
For all these countries plus Malta and Cyprus which have
applied for EU membership, said Kinkel, the question was not
whether they would be admitted but when and how.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel added that although there could be two ways to start
membership negotiations: all at one time or on a phase-in basis,
it is essential that political and economic requirements are met
and reforms are carried out.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Environment Protection Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced a series of proposals to strengthen environmental
protection while traveling to the ongoing Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
"Good environment policy is good for the economy," said Clinton
in Battle Creek, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
He was traveling to Chicago aboard "The 21st Century Express"
which is to take him to the convention venue where he is to be
nominated a second time as the party's presidential candidate
later today.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to double the speed of cleanup at toxic-waste sites
and expand federal grants to states and cities to return
toxic-waste sites to productive uses.
</P>
<P>
The cleanup will get 1.9 billion dollars from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics said that 27 million Americans, including
more than 4 million children, live within six kilometers of a
toxic-waste site.
</P>
<P>
He said that two-thirds of the sites would be cleaned up by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is seeking a second term in the White House, wants
Congress to restore the 725 million dollars in assistance for
projects aimed at improving the quality of local drinking water.
</P>
<P>
He said he would send to Congress legislation to expand
enforcement against environmental crimes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also proposed an ambitious 2.5-billion-dollar program
to fight illiteracy. The program will be known as "America Reads."
</P>
<P>
At a rally outside the Wyandotte public library in Michigan,
Clinton said the United States "will not be able to take advantage
of the future or understand the past" if its citizens read poorly.
</P>
<P>
The America Reads program is expected to ensure that every
child is literate by the end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to parents for cultivating children's minds through
reading so that they can thrive in the global economy as adults.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for a ban on what is called "cop-killer"
bullets, a ban on guns near school premises and additional
penalties for drug dealers in possession of weapons. He has
endorsed a ban on handgun sales to those convicted of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president started his four-day train trip Sunday to
Chicago from West Virginia and prepared one topic for each of the
four days and the topics were designed to maintain his campaign
momentum and to link the train trek with this year's themes of the
Democratic Convention, which are opportunity, responsibility and
community.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans already held their national convention in San
Diego, California, earlier this month and nominated former Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole as presidential candidate and Jack
Kemp, his running mate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Environmental Protection Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearing Chicago aboard his
campaign train "The 21st Century Express," U.S. President Bill
Clinton Wednesday afternoon announced a series of proposals to
strengthen environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The train is taking him to the ongoing Democratic National
convention in Chicago later today.
</P>
<P>
"Good environmental policy is good for the economy," Clinton
said, at a stop in Battle Creek, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Good jobs result from efforts to clean up the environment, news
reports quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed to double the pace of cleanup at priority
toxic waste sites, and expand grants to states and cities to
return "brownfields" toxic waste sites to productive use.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton wants Congress to restore 725 million
dollars in assistance for local drinking water improvement
projects.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would send to Congress legislation to expand
enforcement against environmental crimes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton started his four-day train trip to the Chicago
Democratic National Convention on the train on 25 in West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
In Ohio, he discussed the crime issue Monday and endorsed a ban
on handgun sales to people convicted of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, there were 88,500 instances of domestic violence
involving weapons, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who planned to make announcement of a series of
policies during his tour across several mid-West states, also
called for a ban of what is called "cop-killer" bullets, a ban on
guns near school property and additional penalties for drug
dealers possessing weapons.
</P>
<P>
The policy initiatives, one topic a day, until Clinton arrives
in Chicago to appear in time for his nomination Wednesday night
are designed to maintain his campaign momentum and to link the
train trek with the themes of his party's national convention now
entering its third day.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Clinton proposed an ambitious 2.5-billion-dollar
plan to fight illiteracy in Wyandotte, Mich.
</P>
<P>
At a rally outside the Wyandotte public library in Michigan,
Clinton said that the United States "will not be able to take
advantage of th future or understand the past" if its citizens
read poorly.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's "America Reads" challenge asks to insure that every
child is literate by the end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
He urged parents to cultivate their children's minds through
reading so that they can thrive in the global economy as adults.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite its eagerness for a
diplomatic channel with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), the United States has still not made a breakthrough in
opening up liaison offices in both capitals, State Department
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There still remains some outstanding technical issues, which
have blocked the way toward that diplomatic goal, State
Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States wants "very much to open liaison
offices in both capitals", as the two countries have not had a
relationship for two generations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. congressman Spence Richardson has recently visited DPRK
and was reported to have talks with its officials over issues
concerning the opening up of the liaison offices.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the technical issues involve "things like leases
on buildings and how you move diplomatic mail and how you
accredit diplomats, and etc.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the United States would keep raising the issue of
liaison offices and to continue to try to work out the ways
toward that goal.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Effectively Rejected for Trip to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan has in effect been rejected to go to Libya for a gift of
about $1 billion as the State Department indicated on Wednesday
that the U.S. laws prohibit citizens from traveling to what they
call are terrorism-sponsorship countries.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. citizens ought to observe the laws of the land as passed
by the Congress, and enforced by the executive," said State
Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies.
</P>
<P>
He said the United states has imposed embargo on Libya for
several years and "American citizens have to make up their own
minds about what they want to do".
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, organizer of last year's Million Man March in
Washington, was praised by Moammar Gadhafi when he visited Tripoli
last January, calling him a "fighter for justice".
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Chicago, where Nation of Islam is
based, Farrakhan vowed to win permission of traveling to Libya
for the gift and said he would use the money to establish a
job-creation program to aid those who will lose welfare benefits
under the reform legislation signed into law by President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Davies avoided to say "No" to Farrakhan's applications, saying
it is up to the Treasury Department to make a decision.

PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Eleven thousand people
demonstrated in the streets of Paris today to support the
paperless immigrants threatened with expulsion by the French
government, said police sources.
</P>
<P>
The Movement Against Racism and For Friendship between Peoples

place between demonstrators and police not far from the Saint
Bernard Church, from which 300 African paperless immigrants were
violently expelled last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off some quarters of the area in the evening to
prevent an outbreak of clashes between police and the
demonstrators who refused to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the southern French city of Toulon, which is
administered by the ultra-rightist Front National, today banned
two demonstrations organized by leftwing parties, trade unions and

<HEADLINE> China Urges Burundi to Renounce Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
today strongly urged leaders of all Burundi parties to renounce
violence and commit to dialogue; renounce ethnic hatred and commit
to national reconciliation; and renounce party conflict and commit
to national interest.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the open debate on the situation of Burundi by the
Security Council, He Yafei, China's alternate representative to
the U.N. Security Council, said that the key to settling the
Burundi question lay in national reconciliation, peaceful
coexistence and power sharing by the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to achieve this objective is for all parties in
Burundi to cease all hostilities immediately and enter into
dialogue and negotiations unconditionally with a view to seeking a
political solution to lasting peace, stability and security in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has suffered from violence and armed conflicts
repeatedly in the past three decades, especially since the coup
d'etat in October 1993. The Tutsi dominated military force
announced last July 25 that President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of
Hutu was replaced by Major Pierre Buyoya. The Burundi situation
has become focus of international attention again.
</P>
<P>
He Yafei stressed that the final solution to the Burundi
question lay with the Burundian people themselves and a pressing
task for the Security Council now was to get all Burundi parties
to clearly understand this situation, give up the use of force and
devote themselves to genuine peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He shared Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's view that
the Burundi conflict is not susceptible to military solution,
political means must be found.
</P>
<P>
He praised the efforts made by African countries, particularly
the neighboring countries of Burundi and former President Julius
Nyerere of Tanzania, for the settlement of the Burundian question.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government had all along been very much concerned
about the destiny of the African people and deeply sympathized
with the Burundi people in their sufferings. "We will, as always,
support all measures that will contribute to peace and stability
in Burundi," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the open debate on Burundi by the Security Council today,
representatives of 23 countries aired out their views. Though some
suggested imposing arms embargo and economic sanctions on Burundi,
many recommended political solution and peaceful settlement of the
question so as to realize lasting stability.

1997, to limit the annual inflation rate to about 3 percent by the
end of 1997, and to gradually reduce the external current account
deficit from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1995 to 7.3 percent in 1996 and
6.4 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Refugees in Yugoslavia Start Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian refugees started voting
at all polling stations in Serbia on Wednesday, head of the OSCE
liaison office in Belgrade Zivota de Luca said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Provisional Election Commission (PEC) of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Sarajevo has postponed municipal elections in Bosnia, 84,781
refugees in Yugoslavia's two republics -- Serbia and Montenegro --
will cast all five ballots by September 3 to choose their member
for the three-member Bosnian Presidency, the president of the Serb
state, Serb parliament, cantonal and municipal assemblies, de Luca
said.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said more than 70,000 Bosnian refugees living in
Yugoslavia will return to the Serb-held territories in Bosnia to
vote in person on September 14.
</P>
<P>
De Luca said the PEC in Sarajevo would not take into account
ballots with votes for municipal elections as the PEC has decided
to postpone the local elections to next April or May.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian refugees in Serbia will vote at nine polling stations
in Belgrade and in another 46 towns in the republic, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55
countries around the world, representing about 20 percent of
Bosnia's total electorate. They are due to begin voting on
Wednesday, August 28. But 78 percent of the refugees who
registered outside Bosnia opted to vote by absentee ballot in
their pre-war hometown, election figures show.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Mixed, London Hit New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
ended mixed today, with British stocks hitting a new closing high
and Frankfurt shares also closing slightly higher while the Paris
bourse dipping sharply on a weak franc and low expectations for
the new budget.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by a firm start on Wall Street, a successful gilts
auction and better-than-expected British world trade figures,
London stock market had climbed to a new record high at 3922.1
earlier in the day before slipping back slightly and closing up 13
points at 3918.7, a new peak.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, Frankfurt shares closed higher although the market
shed some of its early gains on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a steady dollar and firm demand for chemical
stocks had helped the market.
</P>
<P>
However, the Paris bourse slipped sharply in the morning, even
breaching through the 2,000-point resistance level before it
finished 15 points down but still above the key psychological
level of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that tradings were thin, cautious, hitting by a
fall in industrial production in June, a weak franc, worries about
government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget and possible
industrial unrest.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British
shares ended 13 points higher at 3,918.7. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30
share index closed 4.32 points up at 2,563.16. In Paris, the
CAC-40 share index finished down 15.09 at 2,002.9.
