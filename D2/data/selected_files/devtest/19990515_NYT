A SUBDUED CLINTON ADDRESSES SATTLE FUND RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton dropped into Seattle on Friday for a
serious, pensive and nostalgic speech to big Democratic donors in
which he defended NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and called for
national resolve in curbing school violence.
</P>
<P>
   In sober talk not often heard at $5,000-a-head fund-raisers,
Clinton decried the atrocities committed by Serbs in the name of
``religion, ethnicity, an imagined history and old slights.'' He
also spoke of a national need to reach ``disconnected kids in
America'' before they commit acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 32-minute speech _ which often treated his
not-yet-complete presidency in the past tense _ dealt extensively
with the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Littleton happened, it broke a dam in the psyche of
America,'' the president said. ``We owe it to the families and the
kids who perished not to let this opportunity pass, and not let it
descend into finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spun off figures on the decline in crime, said the
country is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to see our attempts to save our children
turned into Chapter 57 of America's ongoing cultural war for
someone's political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to see is every single segment of our society
stand up and say, not that it's someone else's fault, but `What can
I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The president's fund-raiser was unspectacular in its proceeds.
Democratic and corporate donors ponied up about $200,000 _ less
than insurgent Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley raised
here last month.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 70 or so people who showed up at Seattle's
Rainier Club said they were moved by his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``His potential for charismatic and inspiring leadership was
never in question,'' Seattle Mayor Paul Schell said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Open and ebullient on previous Northwest visits, Clinton spent
his time Friday in the protective cocoon of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not answer questions about regional issues. His only
audience was seven tables of major donors behind closed doors at
the Rainier Club. He made a brief stop at the Elliott Bay Book Co.,
which later produced rush-hour tie-ups as traffic on Interstate 5
was held up to accommodate Clinton's motorcade on its swift passage
back to Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   The president who once loved to work crowds at Pike Place Market
rallies ducked into his limousine outside the Pioneer Square
bookstore with only a perfunctory wave to shoppers kept behind rope
lines a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle stop opened a three-day fund-raising tour devoid of
public events. Clinton moved on last night to California's Silicon
Valley for a $25,000-a-couple dinner. On Saturday night he will be
in Los Angeles for a dinner _ starting at $25,000 a couple _ held
by Hollywood moguls and Dreamworks partners David Geffen, Steven
Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The president will spend Monday
at similar events in San Diego and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was different from past Seattle stopovers in
another respect _ he was greeted by chanting demonstrators
representing multiple causes and both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, students and downtown employees on their lunch breaks
protested issues ranging from the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to the
Makah's attempts to harpoon a gray whale to the alleged leaking of
U.S. strategic weapons information to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, stop raping Serbia,'' one sign said. Another placard
said, ``By land or by sea, human or animal killing is still
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of protests focused on the bombing of targets in
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, a campaign mounted to force withdrawal
of Serbian forces from the largely ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the leaders of the countries who want the war,''
retiree Emert Browning said. ``The thing that bothers me is that we
are spending billions of dollars (on the bombings).''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at 1:20 p.m., the demonstrators erupted
with the chant ``Stop the bombing now, Bill,'' easily drowning out
the handful of onlookers clapping and cheering in support of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton and his supporters _ including
veterans of Vietnam-era anti-war protests _ defended the NATO
campaign in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims, co-chairman of the luncheon,
spoke of taking his three sons to the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., which recounts the Nazi extermination of 6
million European Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to have a president who decided that kind of
genocidal activity had to stop,'' said Sims, referring to the
ethnic cleansing in which Kosovo residents have been driven from
their homes and in some cases killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke with China's President Jiang Zemin on his
flight to Seattle, repeated his apologies for last week's
destruction of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a terrible mistake with the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy, and I regret it more than I can say,'' the president said.
Clinton noted, however, that people can see Belgrade bomb damage on
CNN _ while the Serbian atrocities in closed-off Kosovo are ``what
you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of an incident in which 15 men allegedly were
roped together and burned alive, and of mass rapes committed
against Albanian women, who then face ostracism in their Muslim
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the promise of the 21st century to be overthrown
by the oldest poison in human existence,'' said Clinton, referring
to ethnic hatreds that have claimed thousands of lives and
dislocated more than a million people in states that formerly made
up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The speech brought tears to the eyes to one listener, Maryann
Tagney Jones of Washington Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking about the fact that they (Serbs) chose to rape
young women because they were Muslim, knowing what that would do to
their lives,'' she said. ``Just the thought of that, the base
brutality, made me cry.''

METS DEFEAT PHILLIES, 7-3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (fixes typo in `Philadelphia' in 1st sentence; changes headline)   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They had stumbled into Philadelphia, reeling and
wrung out, insisting they were not worried about their slump but
slipping behind the streaking Phillies in the standings all the
same. But like fireworks that illuminate even the heaviest clouds,
the New York Mets' hitters unleashed a bombardment that lifted them
to a 7-3 victory Friday night over the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with another disciplined outing by Masato Yoshii, the
victory jolted the Mets out of the doldrums that had engulfed them
during their 2-4 slide in Arizona and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, Robin Ventura and Edgardo Alfonzo all hit home runs
_ Olerud's and Ventura's were both two-run shots in the first
inning _ to boost the Mets to a 5-1 lead by the third. Olerud's
blast was only the 14th that ever reached the upper deck of
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who had pitched six shutout innings in each of his last
two starts, had allowed only a solo inside-the-park homer by Bobby
Abreu to that point and seemed firmly in control of the game,
allowing just one other runner to reach second base and getting
ahead on most hitters. His fastball was regularly in the '90s, an
uptick that Manager Bobby Valentine has attributed to a slight
change in Yoshii's mechanics. With the new success has come an
increased aggressiveness and confidence from the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go up there, I'm trying to be as aggressive as
possible,'' Yoshii said. ``I'm pitching the same as usual. Nothing
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets added another run in the top of the fifth inning,
Phillies starter Chad Ogea was gone, the former Met Yorkis Perez
was trying to prevent a blowout and Valentine was leaning back on
his bench in satisfaction. The Mets scored the run thanks to the
leadoff hitter Roger Cedeno, who showed the speed of a sprinter in
stealing four bases Friday night. He hit an infield single, then
stole second, advanced to third on an Alfonzo fly ball and scored
on Olerud's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has given Cedeno, who is filling in for Rickey
Henderson and has 14 stolen bases, the green light to go whenever
he gets on base. Like Cedeno, the Mets read all the signs correctly
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed and power, that was all our runs,'' Valentine said. ``It
was a well-balanced attack, guys hitting the ball hard and Roger on
the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But starting pitching has given the Mets fits this season, and
in the bottom of the fifth, Yoshii flirted with disaster. He
yielded a leadoff homer to pinch hitter Dave Doster, whose shot hit
the left-field foul pole. Three batters later, Scott Rolen sent a
2-2 pitch against the left-field scoreboard to narrow the Mets'
edge to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a couple of mistakes and they hit the foul pole,''
Valentine said of his starting pitcher. ``He was fabulous, making
pitches, keeping them off stride. He came up big. When he keeps the
ball down, he's a good major league pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine let Yoshii bat in the sixth, and his pitcher redeemed
his decision in the bottom half of the inning. Yoshii struck out
Ron Gant, got Abreu to ground out and forced Mike Lieberthal to pop
up to Olerud. It was all Valentine could ask of his starter, and
better than the Mets' manager has received recently from the rest
of his rotation. In six innings, Yoshii gave up three runs on five
hits _ the three solo homers did the damage _ with two walks and
four strikeouts. The pitcher who two weeks ago was battling for his
job baffled a team that went 5-1 on its recent road trip while
hitting .336 with 15 home runs and 44 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard on his mechanics,'' Valentine said. ``He knows
when he has it. And he flaunts it when he does.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ BOBBY JONES will start Monday after he threw Friday and
reported no problems after his session. Jones has had soreness in
his elbow and tingling in his fingers, but he was pleased with his
performance in a series of tests the team gave him. ``That eased my
mind,'' Jones said. ``There's still a little swelling, but nothing
drastic.'' RICK REED will pitch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mets purchased the contract of pitcher PAT MAHOMES from
Class AAA Norfolk. To make room for Mahomes on the 40-man roster,
the Mets transferred outfielder JAY PAYTON to the 60-day disabled
list, retroactive to opening day. At Norfolk, Mahomes was 4-1 with
a 3.49 earned run average in six starts. In 382/3 innings, he
allowed 38 hits, 17 runs (15 earned), with 12 walks and 24
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   _ RICKEY HENDERSON, hampered by a strained right knee, ran in
the outfield Friday and will likely be ready to play Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pitcher JOSIAS MANZANILLO will accept his assignment to
Norfolk while reserving the right to dispute the assignment.
Manzanillo told the Mets he had a sore right elbow, but general
manager STEVE PHILLIPS says Manzanillo didn't mention it until told
of the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entering the game, the Mets led the National League with a
.989 fielding average. &QL;

BROWNBACK A LEADER IN NATIONAL EFFORT TO DEFEAT CULTURE OF
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the very moment the press conference he had
called Monday to discuss youth violence was set to begin, Sen. Sam
Brownback, the senior Republican from Kansas, was in a taxicab
shuttling between the White House and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The room, meanwhile, was full. Sen. Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota
Democrat waiting to share the cameras with him, was in the hallway
cooling his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback finally arrived about 15 minutes late. Just before
taking the microphone, he acknowledged a face in the front row, and
in an audible whisper said, ``Good morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 2:15 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Brownback if his sense of time is a little skewed these
days. His clock is dictated by the demands of the issue du jour _
culture and violence. As the nation probes its collective psyche
looking for explanations of the high school murders in Littleton,
Colo., last month, Brownback has emerged as one of the leading
Washington headshrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time frame where the country is willing to listen
and discuss culture,'' he said. ``I think it's been building for a
long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a moment of maximum political exposure, especially for
someone such as Brownback who has been pushing cultural renewal for
years.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the floor Wednesday, calling for a measure that would
allow entertainment companies to work together toward a voluntary
code of conduct about violence in programming.
</P>
<P>
   For all the polls that politicians use to divine public opinion,
and all the advice they get from experts, success often comes from
just being in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   A 42-year-old conservative Republican, Brownback has been riding
a fast train ever since he arrived in Washington less than five
years ago. After one high-profile term in the House as one of Newt
Gingrich's often-quoted revolutionaries, he ran for the Senate in
1996, for the seat Bob Dole held for 27 years. He won and
immediately made the cover of Time magazine in the company of the
Senate Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He is soft-spoken and disarming. But he is also somewhat of a
political swashbuckler, crossing swords with the entertainment
industry, or taking on issues like campaign finance reform that are
sure bets for attention. Yet he also is a lonely voice against
slavery in Africa, an issue that gets scant mention.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill aides call him prudent and careful, never one to do
anything purely by accident. It was in the Colorado massacre that
he saw the confluence of issues and concerns that have been part of
his recent focus _ and why viewers suddenly see him constantly
before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Long before high schoolers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
massacred 13 classmates and a teacher, Brownback had been outspoken
about the depiction of violence in music, movies and video games.
Picking up the baton from Tipper Gore, who championed the issue in
the 1980s, he held a well-publicized hearing two years ago on
violence in rock and rap music.
</P>
<P>
   When he said in 1997 that the lyrics were ``a long way from
Elvis shaking his hips on the Ed Sullivan Show,'' Brownback
symbolized the kind of amazement of an over-40 generation suddenly
surprised that its own children had gone far beyond anything it had
ever considered risque.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he held two forums on the subject of violence and
kids killing kids.
</P>
<P>
   His was also a very public _ and political _ lament that
something was wrong with the culture. But the nerve he had hit
didn't really buzz until after Littleton, when he led a Senate
hearing _ one that had been scheduled two months before the
shootings _ into how violence is marketed to children by the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his life has been a steady diet of press conferences
and television interviews. He was late for his Monday press
conference because of the White House summit on youth violence. But
he held another the next day with a second cultural renewal ally
from across the aisle, Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a frequent guest on the major news shows. He even
chartered a private plane to get him from Kansas early one Sunday
morning to Washington for his maiden appearance on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' and then whisk him back home to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out early on this thing makes him somebody in
demand,'' said Nancy Nathan, the show's executive producer. ``There
is sort of a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback acknowledges the risk in possibly being seen as
exploiting the Littleton tragedy for political purposes. But both
he and others say that the shootings exposed what they think
represents an open wound in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To change the culture, you can use politics as the vehicle,
but culture is dominated by fields other than politics,'' Brownback
said. ``So you've got to go to the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his opponents in the current campaign to ``shame'' the
entertainment industry into cleaning up its act give him praise for
his style, if not his point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe people like Sen. Brownback are extremely sincere
and feel strongly about what they say,'' said Jack Valenti,
president and chief executive officer of the Motion Picture
Association of America, the film industry lobby in Washington. ``I
can't be getting upset toward someone who speaks his mind honestly,
with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said that as much as politicians like him want to do
something, the solutions would not come from legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that even his own home is not immune. He recently found
his 11-year-old son playing a video game that showed ``two guys
fighting and killing each other with axes.'' He removed it from the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you change your culture,'' Brownback said, ``by
millions of individual acts.''

HERNANDEZ, YANKS SET OFF ALARMS AS THEY FALL TO WHITE SOX, 8-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The magic has vanished for Orlando Hernandez and the
dominance has vanished for the Yankees. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had another sluggish start Friday night in which he
could not collect outs and the Yankees had another exasperating
game in which they could not produce much offense. The result of
this distressing combination was an 8-2 loss to the Chicago White
Sox at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has lost his last three starts, has one victory in his
last six starts and has been blitzed for 30 earned runs in his last
321/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost four straight games in the Bronx and have
managed a measly two runs in the last 28 innings. They had three
hits after the third inning Friday night. Just call Hernandez and
the Yankees ugly and uglier.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Yankees are 20-14 and are in first place in the
American League East. But they are dysfunctional right now. They
rumbled to the top with reliable pitching and by overwhelming teams
at home. Last night, the Yankees sputtered in both areas and now
they should have major concerns about the pitcher known as El
Duque.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was the essence of precision and consistency after
joining the Yankees last June, baffling teams with his array of
pitches and arm angles. He won 12 games in four months, and
probably won the most critical game of 1998 when he stopped
Cleveland in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series. And
he was being touted as a Cy Young Award candidate this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hernandez (3-4) has an earned run average that has
inflated to 6.55 and has already lost more games at the Stadium
(2-2) in a month and a half than he did in four months last season
(8-1).
</P>
<P>
   With a patient and opportunistic attack, the White Sox nicked El
Duque for four runs in the fourth inning. Hernandez walked four of
the first five batters in the inning and allowed the White Sox to
tie the score, 1-1, when he missed on a 3-2 pitch to McKay
Christensen the No. 9 batter, after being ahead of him 1-2. All
four White Sox batters wlked on 3-2 pitches. Hernandez was not
unbelievably wild. He was around the plate, but the White Sox were
resilient in fouling off pitches and extending at bats until
Hernandez tired and succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray Durham hit a sharp grounder to second and the Yankees
could not turn an inning-ending double play, Greg Norton scored the
second run. Mike Caruso followed by lining a shot off Hernandez's
left shin that caromed across the infield and into shallow right
field. Mark Johnson trotted home from third and Durham scampered
home from first as if it were a track meet.
</P>
<P>
   When second baseman Chuck Knoblauch picked up the ball about 180
feet from the plate and hesitated before throwing, Durham hustled
home and easily beat the wide throw. The White Sox were up by 4-1,
and Hernandez, who had thrown a stunning 47 pitches in the inning
ambled off the mound like a lost soul once again.
</P>
<P>
   It was another forgettable outing for the right-hander, who was
cuffed for seven runs in a 14-5 loss to Seattle last Saturday and
bolted the Stadium before the game ended. Hernandez tossed a pitch
behind Frank Thomas and then plunked him on the left elbow in the
third inning last night, and while it was obvious Hernandez wanted
to hit Thomas, his motives were unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (5-2) the Chicago starter, did not retaliate, but he
whiffed seven in five and one-third innings to win for the fourth
time in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 innings, the Yankees finally ended their scoreless
streak in the second when Shane Spencer singled in Bernie Williams.
It was the Yankees' first hit with runners in scoring position in
18 at-bats. But Spencer helped end the inning and throttle a
possible rally when he was doubled off first base after he did not
follow the flight of a fly ball to right field on a hit-and-run
play.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer grimaced, knowing that the lost chance could be
critical. On another shabby night for Hernandez and the Yankees, it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys now their wives better not have razor
blades around'' Zimmer said. ``They're liable to cut their throats.
They're probably trying so hard it's not getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The pitching coach MEL STOTTLEMYRE said that ROGER CLEMENS would
probably not pitch in the three-game series with Boston next week
because the Yankees want to be cautious about his strained left
hamstring. The Yankees do not feel that Clemens is 100 percent and
think it would be risky for him to return against the Red Sox, his
former team, because he could overdo it. Clemens could return
Friday in Chicago, at the earliest. &QL;

U.S. AND CHINA AGREE ON U.N. STATEMENT ON EMBASSY BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (budgeted earlier as KOSOVO-NATIONS)  (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A week after NATO missiles hit the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, China and the United States hammered out a
formal statement late Friday night expressing the Security
Council's ``deep distress and concern'' about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was struck close to midnight when China agreed to drop an
explicit statement of ``shock'' about the missile strike in
exchange for the milder language.
</P>
<P>
   China had insisted on a harsh statement that first ``condemned''
and then ``deplored'' the attack, an insistence that effectively
delayed Council action on other pending issues. Among them was a
three-week-old resolution on the plight of Kosovo refugees that
endorsed principles of a peace settlement adopted by the Western
powers and Russia earlier this month in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Furious about the strike on its embassy, China maintained that a
formal presidential statement on the embassy bombing need top
priority on the Council's agenda. ``The Council should react first
to the bombing because it is such a serious matter,'' said Chen
Ranfeng, the spokesman for the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the Council's 15 members sympathized with China's
indignation over the attack that killed three and injured 20 more,
several were irritated by Beijing's decision, in effect, to hold
the Council's business hostage to the apology it wanted. One
African nation complained vociferously that China was holding up
important business relating to Africa, specifically an extension of
the legal authorization of a peacekeeping mission in the Western
Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Five nations, including China, are permanent Council members,
and can veto any formal action. But on presidential statements, the
Council operates on consensus, making it easy for unhappy members
to disrupt or delay proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Though milder than the original version of the statement China
circulated earlier this week, China's fourth draft statement
proposed that the Council ``deplore'' the bombing rather than
``strongly condemn'' it as earlier drafts proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Even this weakened disapproval was unacceptable to the United
States and its NATO allies, however. ``We will not agree to
deplore,'' Peter Burleigh, the acting representative here, told
reporters after he had sought instructions from Washington on the
latest Chinese draft.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials objected to the formulation because they said it
suggested that NATO had intentionally attacked the embassy, a
diplomatic installation that under international law cannot be
targeted. ``Would you deplore a tornado?'' said one Western
official, explaining Washington's stance.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock was broken late Friday night after Burleigh huddled
with his counterpart, Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun, and proposed
that the Council ``strongly lament'' the incident rather than
``deplore'' it. The consultations then adjourned temporarily while
Qin tried to check the language with his foreign ministry in
Beijing. After failing to receive instructions, he told Council
members that he would assume personal responsibility for accepting
the language.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial period of confusion, U.S. and NATO officials
have repeatedly apologized for what they have called a tragic
mistake. President Clinton succeeded in getting President Jiang
Zemin of China to accept his telephone call today expressing
condolences and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing on the compromise wording, the Council members
met in a formal, televised session where they stood for a moment of
silence in memory of the three Chinese victims of the missile
strike. Then they approved the statement, the Council's first
official reaction to the embassy bombing, and adopted a series of
resolutions that had backed up during the week. A second minute of
silence was observed for the victims of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Few diplomats said that they thought China would delay
considering a peace plan for Kosovo once NATO and Russia agreed on
a proposal to restore peace in the Balkans.

MISSOURI GENERAL ASSEMBLY CUTS TAXES BY $202 MILLION ON FINAL DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL and KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY _ Prodded by Gov. Mel Carnahan, Missouri
lawmakers cut taxes by $202 million and passed a revamped pension
increase for themselves before adjourning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut cleared the Senate 34-0 after less than half an hour
of discussion. The House had backed it 126-0 earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also set up a graduated driver's license system for
young motorists and passed an economic development bill that
sponsors said would benefit Centertainment and Trans World Airlines
in Kansas City and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the two biggest issues of the final, frenzied day were the
tax cut and legislative pension increase. Both topics had triggered
unusually angry comments by Carnahan earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the governor called lawmakers ``self-serving'' and
said he would veto a pension increase they had just passed because
it was extravagant. He also had threatened to call a special
session if lawmakers failed to give him a tax cut of around $200
million, as he had proposed in January. Carnahan had opposed some
lawmakers' calls to slash taxes even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Friday's adjournment, Carnahan said he was pleased
with the revised tax measure and gratified by the session's
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts are exceedingly difficult to pass, but this one is
good public policy,'' Carnahan told reporters. ``It's broad-based,
and we can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who favors abortion rights, said the session's low
point was the lengthy debate over abortion that ``poisoned the
atmosphere over the last several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders cited the tax measure as a key
accomplishment in a 4 1/2-month session that veteran lawmakers
described as lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, said
lawmakers accomplished a lot even if much of it happened in the
final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you viewed this as a war, it was successful, and everyone
worked hard in the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP legislative leaders were less effusive.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leader Delbert Scott of Lowry City said GOP
pressure on the tax issue contributed to agreement on $202 million
package and other reductions. Scott and other Republican leaders
blamed the session's listless quality on Carnahan's early entry
into next year's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made him candidate Carnahan rather than Governor Carnahan
right from the start,'' Scott said. ``All his statements were
colored by that...and he was missing in action.''
</P>
<P>
   As the session ended Friday, all sides were congratulating
themselves on passing a tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has to return about $160 million to taxpayers to comply
with the state's revenue and spending lid, known as the Hancock
amendment. If lawmakers had failed to agree on a tax cut, the money
would have been returned through refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut will:
</P>
<P>
   - Boost the personal exemption for single filers and married
couples filing separate state returns to $2,100 from $1,200. The
exemption for married couples filing a combined return will rise to
$4,200 from $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   - Increase the exemption for a head of household or a surviving
spouse to $3,500 from $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Allow a state deduction for the self-employed on their health
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   - Trim the state's corporate franchise tax rate by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Liberalize the state deduction on pension income. Current law
allows single filers to deduct up to $6,000 if their incomes do not
exceed $25,000 and married couples to deduct up to $32,000. The new
law will gradually phase out that deduction for each dollar over
$25,000 or $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat, praised negotiators
who hammered out the plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough road,'' said Gaw, who made the issue one of
his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Gibbons, a St. Louis County Republican, said the
tax cut represented broad-based relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good settlement,'' Gibbons told the House. ``It's a
good way to reduce taxes in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons and other Republicans noted that total tax reductions
this year would be about $250 million, including tax credits in
other bills besides the $202 million cut. The governor said he
would have to review those other reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved a hotly debated state retirement plan
that will increase legislative pensions 35 percent, despite
objections from colleagues who said it would contribute to public
distrust of government.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan threatened to veto a nearly identical plan earlier in
the week. The only change from the earlier version is the
elimination of a 17 percent increase for longtime lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would increase pensions for all but a dozen
lawmakers. But it would cap pensions at 100 percent of a sitting
lawmaker's salary. However, about a dozen veteran lawmakers could
receive more under the current system, including several who are
already eligible for more than their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase for those lawmakers left out, Carnahan said he
intended to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative pension increase was tied to a bill that would
give state workers, teachers, firefighters and other government
employees about a 6 increase in retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sarah Steelman, a Rolla Republican, tried to send the bill
back to a conference committee to strip lawmakers' pensions out of
the legislation. The motion was defeated 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan was adopted in the Senate 21-12. In the House,
where a vote usually takes a couple of minutes, nearly 15 minutes
passed as members delayed voting until it was apparent that the
measure would pass. The new plan was adopted 83-67, one more vote
than the minimum needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sponsor, Democrat John Scott of St. Louis, called it
a good bill that would boost retirement benefits for thousands of
workers across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Groves Bland, a Kansas City Democrat, said the public
was not upset by the legislature's pension increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think badly about the legislature, because the media
tell only bad things about us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Kenney, a Lee's Summit Republican, criticized Carnahan
for opposing a pension increase that affected only a dozen
lawmakers while accepting a huge increase for all the rest. He said
the veto threat was little more than a public relations stunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republican Rep. Matt Bartle of Lee's Summit
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are passing is no less excessive, unreasonable and
self-serving,'' Bartle said. ``What is the difference, Mr.
Governor? If you couldn't sign (the previous bill), you shouldn't
sign this one.''
</P>
<P>
   On another key issue, efforts to make it illegal for anyone to
drive with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or higher, instead
of the current 0.10 percent, died late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the reduction earlier this year. But the bill
that the lower limit was attached to died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House backers tried to add the reduction to another measure, but
it failed.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas Friday, lawmakers approved a new, graduated
driver's license system, which backers said would give young people
more time to improve their driving skills before they drive without
any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows people 16 and older to apply for unrestricted
driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January 2001, applicants age 16 to 18 can apply for
intermediate driver's licenses. They must have had temporary
permits for at least six months and proof from a parent or guardian
that they have had 20 hours of supervised driving.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers with an intermediate license would be banned from
driving alone between 1 and 5 a.m. unless traveling to and from
school or a job. Anyone with an intermediate license who gets six
or more points for driving violations in a 12-month period would
have to complete a driver improvement program. Those who meet the
conditions could apply for a full license at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The same bill provides for auto inspections and vehicle
registration renewal every other year instead of annually. It also
provides for driver's license renewals every six years instead of
every three.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills that won approval on the final day will:
</P>
<P>
   - Provide new tax credits to TWA and Centertainment, the
multimillion-dollar project that includes hotels, shops and
theaters in southern downtown Kansas City. The bill, by Rep. Henry
Rizzo of Kansas City, also expands the list of communities that can
qualify to be enterprise zones, which can be a key financial tool
in attracting industries.
</P>
<P>
   - Revamp a variety of criminal sentences, in part to trim the
state's prison population; create a new ``aggravated offender''
crime for people with more than three convictions for driving while
intoxicated within a certain timeframe; and ban the use of tobacco
products in state prisons starting July 1, 2000.

CHARISMATIC STILL GETTING NO RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It has been five years since a Kentucky Derby winner
was made the betting favorite in the Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   And today, Charismatic is getting less respect than most.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-1 long-shot winner of the Derby two weeks ago is 9-1 in
early wagering for the 1 3/16-mile second leg of horse racing's
Triple Crown at Pimlico Race Course. Many believe Charismatic
simply got lucky in the Derby, where his outside running path
around the turns kept him away from traffic trouble that hindered
many in the 19-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely going to be a lot of doubt, period,''
admits his jockey, Chris Antley. ``It was a troubled race. The best
horse doesn't always win. You have to be lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've got to be careful. ... Don't discredit this
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee finished a fast-closing second to Charismatic at
Churchill Downs, and he is the early 2-1 Preakness choice.
</P>
<P>
   The starting field is expected to include a dozen 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, winner of a
record-equaling four Preaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Menifee has a strong Maryland angle on his side, too. His
jockey, Pat Day, has ridden five Preakness winners, one shy of the
record held by the late Eddie Arcaro.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers Lukas, Bob Baffert and Nick Zito have combined to win
12 of the past 14 Triple Crown races. Lukas also has Cat Thief
running today. Baffert, who scratched Silverbulletday, will be
represented by another filly, Excellent Meeting. Zito has Stephen
Got Even and Adonis.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble caused by a crowded Kentucky Derby field has caused
many owners and trainers of also-rans to give their horses another
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 12 Preakness horses also started in the Derby, tying
a record established in 1983. Other than Charismatic and Menifee,
trying again today are Cat Thief (third in the Derby), Excellent
Meeting (fifth), Kimberlite Pipe (sixth), Worldly Manner (seventh),
Stephen Got Even (14th), Valhol (15th) and Adonis (17th).
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to the Triple Crown are Patience Game, Badge and
Torrid Sand, who was excluded from the Derby due to a lack of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly packed Kentucky Derby field forced Menifee to drop
far back in the pack early in the race from his No. 18 post
position. Despite slow early fractions that worked against them,
Day weaved the Blue Grass Stakes winner through heavy traffic
around the second turn and through the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee made up six lengths on Charismatic in the final
quarter-mile and lost by only a neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did lose position in the Derby,'' trainer Elliott Walden
said. ``We fell farther back than we had to based on the speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Menifee starts from post 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be closer this time,'' Walden said. ``If he runs that
race back, he'll be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lukas, a seasoned Triple Crown veteran, Walden, 36, is a
relative newcomer to the upper echelon of the sport. But he already
has endured a career's worth of frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Walden's first Triple Crown horse was last year's Victory
Gallop, who like Menifee finished a strong second in the Kentucky
Derby and was made the Preakness favorite. However, Victory Gallop
finished second to Real Quiet again in the Preakness, before
pulling a photo-finish upset in the Belmont Stakes that denied Real
Quiet the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   So counting Menifee's near miss in this year's Derby, Walden has
a win and three seconds with four Triple Crown starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get to you a little if you allow yourself to dwell on
it,'' Walden said. ``But then you've got to realize how fortunate
you are to be in the position in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Menifee, Preakness horses with legitimate Derby excuses
are Excellent Meeting (crowded back at the start and in traffic on
the second turn), Kimberlite Pipe (held up in traffic on both
turns), Stephen Got Even (pinballed between horses on the first
turn) and Adonis (bumped repeatedly after the start and extremely
wide into the stretch).
</P>
<P>
   Also, Worldly Manner _ owned by powerful Godolphin Racing Inc.
of Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum _ was running in the Derby after an
eight-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, who twice raced for a claiming price earlier in his
career, has had plenty of racing and wasn't bothered as much by the
large field. But Lukas points out that Charismatic is improving and
did race three- to four-wide around both turns in the Derby, so his
victory wasn't a complete fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storyline all week has been that \RCharismatic\S got
lucky,'' Antley said. ``We'll be in the run of it, and so will many
others. I don't believe he'll be 30-to-1 again, but then again, I
don't think he'll be the favorite, either.''

SIXERS' IVERSON REMAINS AN ENIGMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Spend some time chasing Allen Iverson and come
away confused whether you're famished or nauseated.
</P>
<P>
   Starving for his celestial creativity, the cobra-quick moves
that make him the NBA's most dangerous offensive player? Or fed up
with his corn-row cockiness, the ``so what?'' attitude that makes
him the league's poster boy for the me-first, hip-hop generation?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, you're not the only one struggling to find an
appetizing balance with Allen Me-Myself-and-Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   In a league long propelled by refined stars like Bird, Magic and
Michael, the NBA's next big thing brings to the hardwood table a
real, raw persona that features his trademark hairdo, untucked
jersey, a prison record, crystal doorknob earrings, endless energy
and a necklace pendant the size of Rhode Island. He also sports a
traveling posse led by a mother who wears enough gold to be Mrs. T,
sprinkles holy water on his forehead at halftime and often wears
her Philadelphia 76ers No. 3 jersey backward so ``Iverson'' is in
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a billion people who love me, but also a billion
more that hate me,'' Allen Iverson said before his team's Eastern
Conference quarterfinals series Game 2 against the Orlando Magic on
Tuesday. ``Not everybody's going to like me, and that's cool by me.
Look at Jesus Christ. People hated him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like him or hate him, be sure to watch him. In the 76ers' two
playoff wins over favored Orlando, he has attracted and distracted
the Magic's defense for 30 and 33 points, forcing guard Penny
Hardaway to constantly double-team him and coach Chuck Daly to
label him a ``genius with the basketball'' while dusting off the
physical, focused ``Jordan Rules'' defense once reserved for His
Airness.
</P>
<P>
   He added an NBA-playoff record 10 steals to the 33-point scoring
soliloquy he put up Thursday that has the 76ers in position to
advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals with a victory today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to put him in this category, but he's like Michael in
that he gets his shots no matter how you play him,'' said Magic
guard Nick Anderson, one of five defenders assigned to stop him
this series. ``The best thing is to be physical with him, bump him
and knock him off balance into picks. But to do that, you've got to
catch him first.'' \Nsubheds:Crossover appeal Despite having the
league's signature crossover dribble, Iverson's signature may be an
enigmatic personality that his him visiting owner Pat Croce's ill
god-daughter at the hospital in the morning, then showing up late
for practice that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants `Misunderstood' on his tombstone,'' said Iverson's
mother, Ann. ``Because of the way he dresses and the crowd he hangs
with, people have put him in this little category of how bad he is.
He's a good guy, but you've got to get to know him to know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess `Misunderstood' will give him his little comment at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   At only 6 feet, 165 pounds, Iverson is the NBA's biggest little
man. And with a green light to shoot and almost as many moves as
tattoos, he is the hardest player to defend since Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather go to the dentist than guard him,'' said Cleveland
Cavaliers guard Bob Sura. ``At least there aren't 20,000 people
watching you go through pain.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ability to swish 3-pointers, beat defenders off the
dribble and basically create his shot from anywhere on the court,
Iverson is the league's most unguardable guard. Despite giving away
12 inches and 150 pounds, he made enough rainbow jumpers and
electric layups to nip the robotic dunks of the Los Angeles Lakers'
Shaquille O'Neal for the 1999 scoring title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a little guy as good. You can't guard him,''
said Pacers president Donnie Walsh. ``He's too quick, with such an
assortment of shots. When he goes in with the giants he looks like
a pinball.''
</P>
<P>
   A No. 1 overall pick who led the league in turnovers as a rookie
in '96-97, Iverson this season took advantage of 76ers coach Larry
Brown moving him from point guard to shooting guard. Instead of
bringing the ball up court, Iverson now wears defenders down by
constantly moving through a maze of screens. The shortest scoring
champ in history and the first 76ers player to lead the league
since Wilt Chamberlain in '65-66, he likely will receive several
MVP votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without him, the Sixers would be the Clippers,'' said
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson put up almost 27 points per game, though he averaged a
league-leading 42 minutes and 22 shot attempts, finished with the
lowest winning average in 42 years and the worst shooting
percentage (41.2) for a scoring leader since '57-58.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't, however, among the league leaders in modesty. Listen
to Iverson, and you'd think he averaged 72 instead of 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can guard me one-on-one,'' said Iverson, whose 30-point
playoff debut bettered the postseason beginnings of every
modern-day star except Julius Erving (33). ``God decided that, not
me. I think I'm the best player in the league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, he led the 76ers to their first playoff
appearance since '91, overcoming his shoot-first mentality to give
Philly fans something to cheer about. Realizing his team was 1-7
when he scored 40 or more points, Iverson began to grasp the golden
rule: Shoot when you're open and pass if you're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands now if he scores 50 and we lose, it doesn't
matter,'' said teammate Eric Snow. ``I'm not sure he always thought
that way.'' \Nsubheds:The `Answer' is While the league is promoting
squeaky clean players like Tim Duncan and Grant Hill as its marquee
attractions, its new scoring sensation is only six years removed
from being a 17-year-old sitting in a Virginia jail for his part in
a bowling-alley brawl. After an investigation and resulting
gubernatorial pardon, Iverson missed his senior year at Hampton
High School before going on to play at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Few players _ as Iverson did last year _ have produced a
crossover move so nasty it knocked Jordan to his knees. Even fewer,
however, wear tape over their gaping earring holes, boast an
assortment of skull caps or consult former shoot-a-holic World B.
Free.
</P>
<P>
   While carrying the 76ers to the postseason and thawing a
previously chilly relationship with fans, Iverson also endured a
turbulent season. Not only did he trade dirty looks and dirtier
words with Brown, he was sued by Mercedes-Benz for $30,000 in back
payments on three cars, and he fired super-agent David Falk despite
a six-year, $71 million contract extension and the debut of his
wildly popular ``Answer'' shoe by Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   His critics point to his questionable circle of friends (which
includes Reebok executive Que Gaskins and childhood mentor Gary
Moore), his omnipresent mother who travels with the team and
brandishes her ``No. 3 is My No. 1'' sign in every arena, and his
selfish style of play. Jordan once ripped Iverson for his lack of
reverence for the game's older players and this season, Houston's
Charles Barkley said flatly, ``I can't stand him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you write the positive Iverson stuff you're not going to
sell a lot of papers,'' Iverson said. ``Write the negatives, and
those babies will be gone as soon as they're printed.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who turns 24 next month, also has irritated Brown and
his teammates by showing up late for practices, shootarounds and
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he can stay out all night and still be dominant once
he gets to the arena,'' said Brown. ``He'll learn that's not the
case. If he was a pro, and I mean that in a lot of ways, he'd be so
much better.'' \Nsubheds:Growing pains While the detractors focus
on Iverson's professional and personal immaturity, his fans squint
through the hair-triggered haze to see potentially the game's best
player. Pacers coach Larry Bird _ seemingly the
substance-over-style anti-Iverson _ is staunchly in his corner.
Pointing out that mainstream America also wasn't ready for Walt
Frazier's sideburns, Erving's Afro or Pete Maravich's saggy socks,
Bird said Iverson's play speaks louder than his peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance to be one of the greatest guards of all
time,'' said Bird. ``All the other stuff doesn't matter. Five years
from now we might all be wearing corn rows, who cares? The kid can
play on my team any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's had to referee several Brown-Iverson skirmishes and
on two occasions had to relocate Iverson's friends from complaining
season-ticket holders nearby, Croce said Iverson's maturation is in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen's really not someone you can talk to,'' said Croce, who
calls Iverson by his childhood nickname ``Bubba Chick.'' ``He has
to learn through his own experience and sometimes it's painful. But
he's growing. The first time I met him after the draft he was all
slouched over and wouldn't stand up to shake my hand. Now I get a
big hug after every game. With a guy this good, and this good at
heart, we've just got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   If Iverson does admit to a shortcoming, and it's grudgingly at
best, it's his age. It's youth, he says, that gives him the vibrant
legs to make him the league's fastest player from
baseline-to-baseline. And also youth that prompts him to naturally
rebel against authority and conformity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess over time the critics will back off, but for now I
wish they'd just let me grow,'' he said. ``Everybody wants me to be
35, but I'm not. I'm going to make more mistakes, every day. I've
matured from five years ago, even a year ago. I can deal with it. I
wish everyone else would.''

`EL NINO' GARCIA STILL GOING STRONG AT NELSON TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Just below the club manufacturer logo on Sergio
Garcia's golf bag are the words ``El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   That's only fitting considering the way the 19-year-old Spaniard
has stormed through the two courses at the Four Seasons Resort and
Club the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who has neither graduated from high school nor earned
his driver's license in his home country, dazzled the galleries at
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic again yesterday with another stellar
round. After Thursday's impressive 8-under-par 62 at the Cottonwood
Valley course had him tied for second, he dealt with much tougher
conditions yesterday on the Tournament Players Course, yet still
managed a 3-under-par 67.
</P>
<P>
   The two rounds have Garcia, the British Amateur champion, at
11-under-par 129, just a stroke back of co-leaders Steve Pate and
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very good round for today's game,'' Garcia
said. ``Today's condition was really tough, and there was a lot of
wind and was changing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather played a much bigger role in everyone's game as the
wind _ virtually nonexistent on Thursday _ gusted to more than 20
mph. Garcia also had the task of playing the TPC, considered the
more difficult of the two courses.
</P>
<P>
   However, Garcia played more like an experienced veteran than a
19-year-old, posting birdies early (on holes No. 1, 3 and 6)
combined with an eagle on the par-5 No. 7 before conditions
worsened. He then played the back nine at just 1 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to play good golf and make some birdies,'' Garcia
said. ``I always try to be calm and just enjoy myself. If I make a
bogey, bogey. If I make a birdie, birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Garcia is controlling his emotions and enjoying the
moment, he also understands what a PGA Tour victory would mean. He
has already offered to dedicate the victory _ should he win _ to
the family of Gene Sarazen, who died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was the only serious moment in a postround news
conference during which he repeatedly answered questions about
school, driving and his homeland. He also pointed out just what
kind of education he's getting here when asked what teen-age
experiences he's missing from Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably I'm missing that,'' he said. ``But the guys who are
in Spain now, they are missing this. So I wouldn't change things.''

STARS: TIME TO STOP TALK, `JUST PLAY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sergei Zubov doesn't want to talk anymore. Not
about his game-ending mistake in Game 4, not about how well he's
been playing in the NHL playoffs, not about Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   The time for talking, the Stars defenseman has decided, is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to you before and bad things happen,'' Zubov said of
softening his ``no interview'' policy this week. ``Now, I don't
talk, I just play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars hope to follow Zubov's lead tonight in Game 5 of the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series with the St.
Louis Blues. They hope to stop analyzing and stop dissecting a
series that is basically even in most statistical categories. When
the Blues and Stars meet at 6:30 tonight at Reunion Arena, talk of
power-play success, of who's winning faceoffs and whether Brett
Hull is scoring or not will become moot for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the talking can continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been analyzing everything so much and worrying about
what we're not doing well,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said of
a 3-2 overtime loss in Game 4 on Wednesday in St. Louis. ``All the
bad breaks in the last game, all the mistakes _ we have to throw
that all out. ... we need to start concentrating on all the things
that we're doing positive.'' Zubov might be the best example of
that, and he might be the key to any success the Stars have against
the Blues in the coming games. With much of the Stars' playoff
success on the line tonight _ the series is tied 2-2, and the Stars
have two of the final three games at home _ Zubov's philosophy
provides a peek into the collective mind of the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play bad, if I make mistake, I know it before anyone else
does,'' Zubov said in a prophetic moment before Game 4. ``I don't
need anyone to tell me what I did wrong, I don't need anyone to
show me. I know why I'm playing bad or good. I know how to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock agrees. He coaches the Stars so that
plays will be automatic in the playoffs. Although Zubov made a huge
mistake in sending a high-risk pass through the neutral zone in
Game 4 _ a pass Blues center Pierre Turgeon turned into an
overtime, game-winning goal _ it was one of the few playoff
mistakes Zubov has made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a great year, he's had a great playoffs, and he made
a mistake. So move on,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov is fifth in the NHL in ice time, averaging 31 minutes and
30 seconds per playoff game. He's fifth in the NHL in plus-minus at
a plus-6. So if he doesn't want to talk about it, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to him,'' Hitchcock said. ``But you know what we've
talked about _ we've talked about how important he is for our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov is the point guard, the puck-controlling pulse of a team
that thrives on puck control. His calm hand is crucial in moving
the puck against the Blues' forecheck, which thrives on knocking
down passes in the neutral zone and heading toward the net on
odd-man rushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Zubie is he makes passes like the one he made
in overtime all year, and he makes them work,'' Ludwig said.
``Obviously, that was a bad time and a bad place, but he can't
change his game because of one bad pass. If anyone can handle the
pressure of that and the challenge of that, it's that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need more positives from Zubov, coaches and players
agree. They need the positives more from Hull and Mike Modano and
Joe Nieuwendyk as well. They need that tonight more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge game, and that's what the playoffs are all
about,'' winger Mike Keane said. ``We've played this team four
times, and we're both pretty aware of what we need to do and what
we don't need to do. We have a lot of players who have been in this
situation before. Talking isn't going to change much now. We need
to go out and do it.''

AS BIG AS GAME 5 IS FOR STARS, IT'S BIGGER FOR HULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the day before Game 5 of a fitful second-round playoff
series, and Brett Hull is lathered in perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other high-priced thoroughbred of pedigree, this is
supposed to be his time. His Kodak moment. His chance to bury, once
and for all, his playoff ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the day after a draining, second overtime loss to
St. Louis, coach Ken Hitchcock's optional workout had attracted 12
Stars players. Hull had been one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Hull again had voluntarily logged overtime after the
regular practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a solid player for us all year,'' Hitchcock says,
sitting on a locker room bench circled by writers from Texas and
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the way he's played. He has the second-most
minutes played on the team. And he's going to play a lot more as we
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, tonight's Game 5 of this Stars-Blues series
marks the most consequential game that the Dallas version of this
franchise has ever played.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hull, it is even more important than that.
</P>
<P>
   Lose to his old team tonight, and Hull will certainly face a
jeering chorus when he returns to St. Louis on Monday for Game 6.
Lose the series, and Hull will hear Blues management say, ``See _
it was Hull's fault in the playoffs all along.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not fair, but who would Hull be to argue?
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis wouldn't tender him a no-trade contract, Hull
signed with the Stars for three years at $17 million, with a
reported option for a fourth year at $7 million. There were no
hidden motives here. For his $24 million, hired-gun Hull was
supposed to provide scoring depth and breathe new life into the
power play.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, he did all that, scoring 32 goals, 15
on the power play. But now it's May, hockey's unkindest month, and
Hull must finally strut where he has always stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff time. No matter what Hitchcock said yesterday, Hull has
not been a $24 million player in this second-round series. Instead
of teaming with Mike Modano, he has logged time on the third line
with Benoit Hogue and Mike Keane. His contributions on the power
play have been inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts howl.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull _ not lighting the lamp? Not putting the biscuit in
the playoff basket?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it doesn't matter,'' Hull answered. ``On this team,
all that matters is whether you won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system is a team system. It doesn't matter if I
score or if Mike scores. It's the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, grinder. Spokesman for hockey's new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your father's NHL, Brett Hull. But he knows that.
Gone are the 5-4 and 6-5 games, replaced by role players and
checking forwards. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, great as he was, hung around and tried to adapt.
Mario Lemieux tried one more time and simply went home.
</P>
<P>
   Hull remains, a dinosaur of sorts. He has one frontier left to
conquer and, one would think, a cast to help him conquer it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here he is, backed to the playoff wall by, of all people,
his former team.
</P>
<P>
   He is supposed to be out there on the ice each night, firing
away or drawing attention, creating more ice space for Modano or
Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hull said yesterday, laughing, ``I played the whole
game behind their goal line the other night _ forechecking.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, as long as the
Stars win.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock wouldn't say whether Hull's line mates tonight would
again be Hogue and Keane. ``I don't know who he's coming out \Ron
the ice\S with,'' the coach said. ``All I know is he's coming out a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The writers from St. Louis scratch their heads. They don't
recognize this guy, they say. This grinder. This new Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a real good player for us,'' Hitchcock tells them.
``To me, playoff hockey is all about how involved you are. Are you
in the middle of the battle, creating space? Because if you're on
the outside, watching, waiting for the battle to come to you, it
never comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock leaves the rhetorical riddle hanging in the air. He
doesn't name names.
</P>
<P>
   But he's talking about you, Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Time to silence the playoff ghosts. Time to show St. Louis how
much they should miss you.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, it is a game rife with significance. For Hull,
bigger. As big as it's ever been.

SPORTS COLUMN: LIKE TWO BROTHERS BATTLING IN THE BEDROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It must be the rule of their series, or the nature of
the species. These familiar teams, these feuding Knicks and
frothing Heat, play until they no longer can, like battling
brothers squaring off in their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The longer it goes, the more bitter it gets, which brings us to
the waning moments of a death-defying performance Friday night by
Miami, to Terry Porter flying downcourt on the break.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, 36 years old, the chief instrument of the Heat's 87-72
victory in Game 4, went in for the layup, with the Heat, up by 11,
pulling away. Latrell Sprewell, angling in from the lane, hammered
Porter to the floor. For the Knicks, it was a vicious punctuation
to an ugly quarter. For the Heat, it was one more reason to rush
back home in a confident rage.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Van Gundy, Pat Riley's assistant, stood up and walked down
the Heat's aroused bench. ``Remember all that,'' Van Gundy
screamed. ``Remember what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   They, of course, being the players coached by Van Gundy's
younger brother, Jeff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks and the Heat do, three years running now, is
drain from each other every last playoff drop of blood, sweat and
tears. They return to Miami tomorrow for another endgame, Game 5,
after the Knicks failed Friday night to serve out the match and
series at home.
</P>
<P>
   They took an 11-point lead early in the third quarter Friday
night at Madison Square Garden, then splattered like the apple that
was heaved onto the court by some unhappy and unstable fan just
before Sprewell's thuggish foul on Porter. The Knicks made two
field goals in the fourth quarter against a team they beat two
nights before by 24. They shot 36 percent for the game and their
leading scorers were Allan Houston and Charlie Ward with 12.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Riley for doing what he does best, lathering his team
into a defensive fury, and for finally remembering Voshon Lenard's
name. Riley was so thrilled to be going home for another game he
actually made an admission practically startling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been wrong,'' he said of his refusal to use Lenard
in anything but garbage time in the blowouts in Games 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Lenard came off the Miami bench to score 10 points,
but it was Porter who was Riley's answer to the question of how he
expected to win a series, much less a title, with the offense he
dragged into these playoffs. Direct and adept off the dribble with
either hand, Porter dribbled Sprewell and Houston into a
near-drunken stupor, his penetrations scrambling the Knicks' team
defense and freeing up Tim Hardaway for the open jumpers he needed
to compensate for his wounded right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Guys, we've got to put out heads down, take it
to the rim,''' Porter said. ``Now we go home, though I don't know
if we have an advantage. They've embarrassed us at home already in
this series. They came back and beat us during the regular season
after we were up 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens from here on out in this Kentucky Derby-like
playoff season, that game three weeks ago was the Knicks' most
significant in terms of their late-season development. They would
not have even come this far without it, so let it no longer be said
that the National Basketball Association's regular season is
virtual reality, except for the price of a courtside seat.
</P>
<P>
   Where would the winding river have taken the Knicks had they not
staged that inspiring turnaround against the Heat, the
fourth-quarter odds and the momentum of their own free fall from
playoff position? That Sunday, when the Knicks rallied from 18 down
with six minutes to play in Miami Arena, they finally appeared in a
defining moment as they had been conceived: quicker, quirkier, less
predictable than before.
</P>
<P>
   Before more rotten apples are tossed at the Knicks, remember
that they won Game 5 last season in Miami. They have that memory
and the game three weeks ago, which is the one that got Riley and
his players into this struggle in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said before the playoffs started, I didn't see any team
that I feared,'' Patrick Ewing reiterated Friday night. ``And I
feel that if we can continue to play the way we've been playing,
share the basketball, we can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Games 1 and 3, not Friday night, when the Knicks melted
again under Miami's defensive pressure, when the passive Houston
resurfaced and the wild Sprewell drained the offense of fluidity
and Larry Johnson fell in love with the 3-point line. It all came
apart in that 10-point fourth quarter, and Sprewell took out his
frustration on Porter, who said, diplomatically, ``I haven't seen
the films but I don't think he was going for the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he smiled, devilishly, and added: ``A good, hard playoff
foul. I'm sure it will be even more physical Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ewing would say, ``See you Sunday.'' Game 5. Knicks-Heat.
Battling brothers. The way it has to be. &QL;

NO. 2 SPOT WORKS FOR BELTRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Dodgers turned to their leading hitter Adrian
Beltre to take over the second spot in the order Friday and he
played a major role in the seven-run seventh inning that led to a
7-3 victory over the St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who came in with a club-high .336 average, was moved
from seventh to second because of his consistency and knowledge of
the strike zone. Beltre, whose RBI single gave the Dodgers a 4-1
lead, has 19 walks, including a league-leading six intentional
walks, although most came as a result of batting in front of the
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect those kinds of walks in the second spot,
although it would be nice,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``But he
has impressed me with his patience at the plate. He knows what he
is doing up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving Beltre to second forced Mark Grudzielanek to eighth in
the order. Grudzielanek was benched for the three-game series with
the Cubs and batted just .154 (2 for 13) during the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move is not a slap at Mark,'' Johnson said. ``He is still
my shortstop. We've talked. I talk to all my guys. Some need more
attention than others. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was back in the starting lineup Friday and had two
hits and a walk and scored the go-ahead run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling: Alan Mills, who allowed just one run in his
first 10 innings, has given up three in his last 21/3, including a
two-run homer Friday by Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Mills gave up a game-winning grand slam to
Florida pinch-hitter Bruce Aven after Darren Dreifort loaded the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was in trouble from the outset, walking Mark McGwire to
start the eighth after taking over for Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just fallen into a little rough time,'' pitching coach
Charlie Hough said. ``I liked the pop on his ball tonight and he
threw some good breaking balls. His location could have been
better. But every pitcher goes through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: There is a good chance Chan Ho Park will not face
Fernando Tatis tonight _ Tatis is one of several Cardinals to have
the flu. Tatis set a a major-league record April 23 at Dodger
Stadium when he hit two grand slams in one inning against Park....
Juan Acevedo, who opened the season as the Cardinals closer, will
start Sunday's game against Ismael Valdes. Acevedo allowed runs in
five of his last six relief appearances with an 11.74 ERA.

serious, pensive and nostalgic speech to big Democratic donors in
which he defended NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and called for
national resolve in curbing school violence.
</P>
<P>
   In sober talk not often heard at $5,000-a-head fund-raisers,
Clinton decried the atrocities committed by Serbs in the name of
``religion, ethnicity, an imagined history and old slights.'' He
also spoke of a national need to reach ``disconnected kids in
America'' before they commit acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 32-minute speech _ which often treated his
not-yet-complete presidency in the past tense _ dealt extensively
with the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Littleton happened, it broke a dam in the psyche of
America,'' the president said. ``We owe it to the families and the
kids who perished not to let this opportunity pass, and not let it
descend into finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spun off figures on the decline in crime, said the
country is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to see our attempts to save our children
turned into Chapter 57 of America's ongoing cultural war for
someone's political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to see is every single segment of our society
stand up and say, not that it's someone else's fault, but `What can
I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The president's fund-raiser was unspectacular in its proceeds.
Democratic and corporate donors ponied up about $200,000 _ less
than insurgent Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley raised
here last month.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 70 or so people who showed up at Seattle's
Rainier Club said they were moved by his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``His potential for charismatic and inspiring leadership was
never in question,'' Seattle Mayor Paul Schell said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Open and ebullient on previous Northwest visits, Clinton spent
his time Friday in the protective cocoon of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not answer questions about regional issues. His only
audience was seven tables of major donors behind closed doors at
the Rainier Club. He made a brief stop at the Elliott Bay Book Co.,
which later produced rush-hour tie-ups as traffic on Interstate 5
was held up to accommodate Clinton's motorcade on its swift passage
back to Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   The president who once loved to work crowds at Pike Place Market
rallies ducked into his limousine outside the Pioneer Square
bookstore with only a perfunctory wave to shoppers kept behind rope
lines a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle stop opened a three-day fund-raising tour devoid of
public events. Clinton moved on last night to California's Silicon
Valley for a $25,000-a-couple dinner. On Saturday night he will be
in Los Angeles for a dinner _ starting at $25,000 a couple _ held
by Hollywood moguls and Dreamworks partners David Geffen, Steven
Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The president will spend Monday
at similar events in San Diego and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was different from past Seattle stopovers in
another respect _ he was greeted by chanting demonstrators
representing multiple causes and both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, students and downtown employees on their lunch breaks
protested issues ranging from the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to the
Makah's attempts to harpoon a gray whale to the alleged leaking of
U.S. strategic weapons information to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, stop raping Serbia,'' one sign said. Another placard
said, ``By land or by sea, human or animal killing is still
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of protests focused on the bombing of targets in
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, a campaign mounted to force withdrawal
of Serbian forces from the largely ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the leaders of the countries who want the war,''
retiree Emert Browning said. ``The thing that bothers me is that we
are spending billions of dollars (on the bombings).''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at 1:20 p.m., the demonstrators erupted
with the chant ``Stop the bombing now, Bill,'' easily drowning out
the handful of onlookers clapping and cheering in support of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton and his supporters _ including
veterans of Vietnam-era anti-war protests _ defended the NATO
campaign in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims, co-chairman of the luncheon,
spoke of taking his three sons to the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., which recounts the Nazi extermination of 6
million European Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to have a president who decided that kind of
genocidal activity had to stop,'' said Sims, referring to the
ethnic cleansing in which Kosovo residents have been driven from
their homes and in some cases killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke with China's President Jiang Zemin on his
flight to Seattle, repeated his apologies for last week's
destruction of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a terrible mistake with the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy, and I regret it more than I can say,'' the president said.
Clinton noted, however, that people can see Belgrade bomb damage on
CNN _ while the Serbian atrocities in closed-off Kosovo are ``what
you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of an incident in which 15 men allegedly were
roped together and burned alive, and of mass rapes committed
against Albanian women, who then face ostracism in their Muslim
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the promise of the 21st century to be overthrown
by the oldest poison in human existence,'' said Clinton, referring
to ethnic hatreds that have claimed thousands of lives and
dislocated more than a million people in states that formerly made
up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The speech brought tears to the eyes to one listener, Maryann
Tagney Jones of Washington Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking about the fact that they (Serbs) chose to rape
young women because they were Muslim, knowing what that would do to
their lives,'' she said. ``Just the thought of that, the base
brutality, made me cry.''

<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ Eager for money to pay for the war
in Yugoslavia, the White House said it expected President Clinton
to sign a nearly $15 billion emergency spending measure that
doubles what the president had requested for the Balkan conflict,
for Central American hurricane victims and for hard-pressed
American farmers. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-GUNS (Washington) _ By a squeaker of a vote, Senate
Republicans passed a measure to promote background checks at gun
shows. Democrats, preferring a more stringent proposal of their
own, almost solidly opposed the measure. By Frank Bruni. WITH

</P>
<P>
   EPA-POLLUTE (Washington) _ A federal appeals court set aside new
air quality standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency
in 1997, handing the Clinton administration a major environmental
defeat. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   EPA-DOCTRINE (Washington) _ In voiding a clean air standard, the
appeals court focused on the `nondelegation doctrine.' The notion
that Congress can violate the constitutional separation of powers
by delegating too much legislative-like authority to another branch
of government has essentially been a dead letter since the New
Deal. By Linda Greenhouse.

   ASSASSIN-GAME (Westport, Conn.) _ Beginning next week, 35 elite
college-bound students here will arm themselves with plastic guns
and stalk classmates through town. They have elaborate plans for
staying alive, and expect the annual contest to last three weeks.
The final two survivors will shoot it out in a park, then collect
cash prizes. But some students are bowing out this year, deciding
that four weeks after the killings in a Colorado high school might
not be the best time for the spring ritual. By Mike Allen. WITH

</P>
<P>
   HAWAII-TRUST (Honolulu) _ The Bishop Estate, a powerful
institution that has long been a source of intense native pride, in
recent years has come to be seen as the embodiment of Hawaii's
brand of inbred, closed-door politics. Most of the trustees were
connected to the state's ruling political establishment, so their
dramatic ouster has led to predictions of a shakeup in institutions
from the Legislature to the state Supreme Court, whose members used
to select the Bishop trustees. By Todd S. Purdum. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-MILWAUKEE (Milwaukee) _ A decade ago, an eccentric band
of reformers here set out to guarantee every poor person a path
from poverty _ an assured job at a sufficient wage with child care
and health care. But as the program closes its offices this week,
an exhaustive volume of new research offers some disquieting
conclusions. Among the adults, only 27 percent managed to stick
with their subsidized jobs long enough to escape poverty. Their
average annual earnings were just $6,600. By Jason DeParle. WITH

hands of a private collector who is now auctioning it off in
California. By Kevin Flynn.

   NEV-GUN-LOVERS (Clark County, Nev.) _ 50 students gathered in

pit for one day so that Piazza could pitch them his plans for the
first resort community in the world for gun enthusiasts. By Evelyn

<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN (Undated) _ It has been exactly 50 years since
the death of Peter Maurin, one of the unlikeliest figures ever to
ignite a religious revolution. He helped create the Catholic Worker
movement, a mix of pacifism, anarchism and identification with the
poor that has had a great impact on American Catholicism and social
and religious radicalism of all sorts. By Peter Steinfels.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ After Belgrade charged that a
NATO warplane had fired on refugees in the southwestern Kosovo
village of Korisa, Pentagon officials said NATO warplanes were
attacking in the general area around Korisa, but that they had no
evidence so far that any of the planes had been near the village.

   KOSOVO-U.N. (United Nations) _ A week after NATO missiles hit
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, China and the U.S. hammered out a

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Washington) _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott and Russian envoy Victor Chernomyrdin agreed this week on
some ways to approach Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. They

him to accompany Chernomyrdin when the time is right to talk to
Milosevic. By Jane Perlez.

<P>
   KOSOVO-INTERNET (Belgrade) _ Internet enthusiasts were rushing
to send off last minute emails at one downtown internet cafe after
word went around that the U.S. was going to cut off Yugoslavia off

a threat, but Internet providers here are worried that a partial

   ARGENTINA-WELSH (Gaiman, Argentina) _ In this windswept corner
of Patagonia is a town of low mud-brick houses trimmed with ivy and
Protestant churches marked by signs in an ancient language that
only 600,000 people in the world speak today. The place has become
a beacon for Welsh people from Britain and the U.S. And the
lyricism and practical lessons of Celtic folklore, fables and
poetry have attracted the interest of some Argentines who have no
Welsh ancestors at all. By Clifford Krauss. WITH MAP.

DRAG RACING SCHOOL TO EXPAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE _ Frank Hawley's drag racing school at Pomona Raceway
will expand to other cities now that British firm EMAP Petersen,
which owns Petersen Publications, has purchased the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows the school to open a site in Florida,'' said Stephen
Cohen, the program coordinator for Hawley's other racing school
venture, the Evernham/Hawley Race Training Center at Irwindale
Speedway. ``It's a financial wheel and allows the company to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has operated at Pomona since 1985. The race training
center, which opened two weeks ago, was not affected by the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Move applauded: The $610 million sale of Penske Motorsports,
which operated California Speedway and three other superspeedways,
to the Bill France family-owned International Speedway Corp. is a
good move, said Irwindale CEO Jim Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right thing to do,'' said Williams, who was on
Penske's board of directors until the sale of the company,
dissolving the board. ``It's a marriage made in heaven. We'd been
in negotiations for some time and it just made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The France family is the force behind NASCAR. ICS controls
tracks in Daytona Beach, Fla., Talladega, Ala., Darlington, S.C.,
Phoenix and Watkins Glen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Penske and his son Greg and Penske vice chairman Walt
Czarnecki will become part of the ICS board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams insists the deal had nothing to do with finances and
everything to do with racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had very little debt,'' said Williams, who will retire from
his current job as head of Golden State Foods on June 1. ``We were
very well capitalized and money was not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The builders of the two short tracks were in attendance Friday
night. Williams invited Perris Speedway builders (and brothers)
Danny, Ken and Don Kazarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tracks really complement each other,'' Ken said.
``Dirt people like dirt racing and asphalt people like asphalt
racing. This is is good for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping hand: Darrell La Moure will feature the picture of Cyndi
Vanderhieden on his car in tonight's NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
series Irwindale 100.
</P>
<P>
   La Moure features pictures of missing people on his car and
transporter.
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi's family, from Clements, Calif., will attend the race. Her
sister, Kimberly Wrage, is the Cyndi Search Headquarters main
spokesperson. Also scheduled to attend are her mother, Terri, aunts
Judy Angelo and Rhonda Wardrobe, uncle Mike Angelo and her best
friend, Pamela Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Dusty McDonald of Simi Valley knocked nearly two-tenths
of a second off his class track record during Late Model qualifying
Friday night. McDonald's record of 19.074 seconds tops the previous
mark of 19.203.... When the NASCAR Winston West series comes to
Irwindale on June 19, it will be the first time pit stops will be
part of a race at Irwindale. Pits for the race, scheduled for 250
laps, will be along the third-mile track. The pit entrance and exit
will be on the backstretch.... Scott Porter of La Verne celebrated
his 30th birthday by winning the Trophy Dash in mini stocks. Porter
had the pole and held off Gerry Kenyon of Long Beach in a battle of
Pintos.

PALMEIRO LEADS RANGERS PAST ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Will Clark wanted to re-sign with the Rangers
when he became a free agent in the off-season. Instead, the club
opted to bring Rafael Palmeiro back to town.
</P>
<P>
   Clark gave the Rangers his blood and sweat for five seasons,
playing every game hard, and contributing to the first two division
winners in club history.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro showed last night why the Rangers made the right
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's two-out, two-run double off former teammate Arthur
Rhodes in the seventh inning was the big blow in the Rangers' 7-6
victory against the Baltimore Orioles at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good that I helped win a game,'' Palmeiro said. ``I
played with Arthur for such a long time, but I don't know any
particular pitching pattern. I just know he throws hard. I was just
looking for a pitch to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The hit, which scored Tom Goodwin and Ivan Rodriguez, made a
winner of reliever Tim Crabtree (2-0). John Wetteland worked the
ninth for his 11th save, despite giving up a two-run homer to Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's hit was just inside the right-field line, and just
past the glove of diving Orioles first baseman Jeff Conine.
</P>
<P>
   Conine was playing first base because Clark, who signed with
Baltimore after the Rangers got Palmeiro, is on the disabled list
with a fractured left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Clark remains a productive player when healthy, but was on the
DL five times. Palmeiro, on the other hand, has played more games
than anyone else in the majors in the '90s. He has played in 34 of
the Rangers' 35 games this season despite having two knee surgeries
during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me to play every day,'' Palmeiro said. ``It
is important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the major reasons Palmeiro was in a Rangers
uniform and able to deliver the game-winning hit last night.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was disappointed that the Rangers didn't want him, is
unable to show them they made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who played for the Orioles for five years before
departing for a free agent, has no hard feelings toward his old
team, but has hurt them badly the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   He had two doubles and the two RBI last night after going
2-for-2 with four runs and an RBI in the Rangers' 15-7 victory
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no extra incentive,'' Palmeiro said. ``I try to do the
best I can whether it's Baltimore or Oakland. I'm not trying to do
anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   As big as Palmeiro's hit was, an infield single by Goodwin
proved to be equally important after Ripken homered off Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly was on second when Goodwin grounded the ball up
the middle. Orioles second baseman Delino DeShields fielded it
behind the base, and Kelly kept running. He scored to give the
Rangers a three-run lead, which proved vital.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won despite another less-than-stellar performance by
a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark was in and out of trouble _ mostly in _ for 6 1/3
innings. He allowed four runs on nine hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   He left with one out in the seventh with a 4-2 lead, thanks
mainly to a two-run homer by Rusty Greer and a solo shot by
Rodriguez off Orioles starter Scott Erickson in the fifth, but the
Orioles tied the score on a triple by B.J. Surhoff off reliever
Mike Munoz that scored two runners Clark left on.
</P>
<P>
   The tie was broken when Palmeiro did his thing in the bottom of
the inning.

IT'S NOTHING NEW FOR ROCKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The faces along the bench have all changed, but the
Houston Rockets are showing a familiar resiliency, a common trait
among coach Rudy Tomjanovich's teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' Game 3 victory over the Lakers on Thursday saved
Houston from an early playoff exit, but that's nothing new to
Tomjanovich. In his eight seasons, Tomjanovich's teams have faced
16 elimination games _ and won 12 of them.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Rockets' remarkable string of eight
consecutive elimination-game victories through the 1994 and 1995
playoffs. Both seasons ended with NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   If he's got some kind of ancient Jedi wisdom that guides him
through adverse situations, Tomjanovich isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech (before Game 3) was, `I have no speech. I have no
Knute Rockne speech,''' Rockets guard Brent Price said. ``He's been
there before. He uses his past teams as examples all the time. He
said if we stick together, stay together through thick and thin,
through all the hype and the arrows being shot at you, we can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt all along we had the talent to win this series.... He
knew we have a great team and we knew what we needed to do. He
didn't have to say a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich's experience benefits him in more subtle ways.
Under fire, he simply exudes a calmness that his veteran team in
turns reflects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we had 10 (elimination games) in two years, and I bet
that's more than some coaches who have been around more than 20
years in the league,'' Tomjanovich said. ``So I'm used to having
this crazy feeling. I just don't get into panicky situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sort of learn. That's a hell of a situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets responded with a desperate determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, we were in the corner,'' Tomjanovich said. ``As the
game was going on, we were laying in the corner. You know what I'm
saying _ when you're getting punched out and you're back there with
your arms on the (ropes) and we have to come out swinging haymakers
or it's over. So that triggered something in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Trends: History remains on the Lakers' side. The franchise has
taken a 2-0 lead in a best-of-five series on 12 previous occasions
and won the series 11 times. The lone collapse was in 1993, when
the Phoenix Suns came back from 0-2 and beat the Lakers in overtime
of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   And the Game 3 defeat wasn't unusual. Before this series, the
Lakers were 7-5 in Game 3s after leading 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In NBA history, 12 teams have come back from 0-2 deficits to win
a series, but only five times in best-of-five series. The last team
to do so _ the Rockets, beating the Suns in the 1995 conference
semifinals.

SABRES BEAT BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ It started off so promising, this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won the opener over the Sabres at home and there was
optimism in the air. There was speculation that they could be
perhaps what the Washington Capitals were last season _ the
Cinderella club that rode a hot goalie all the way to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three games, the slipper has shrunk to the point
where there's no possibility of it fitting the Bruins. After Friday
night's truly awful 3-0 loss to the much-superior Buffalo Sabres,
the Bruins trail the Eastern Conference semifinal series three
games to one and are one defeat from elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is 0-18 in series in which it has trailed 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were outplayed, outhustled, and out-hit, and their
lack of experience showed. For far too many minutes, the team
looked completely lost. They looked like a group of tourists
dropped out of a bus halfway down the Mass. Pike and told to find
their way home. They didn't know where to start.
</P>
<P>
   As bad as it was, it would have been exceedingly worse if not
for goalie Byron Dafoe, as the Sabres came out with passion,
intensity, and a killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an old-fashioned ass-booting tonight,'' said coach Pat
Burns. ``That's what it is. There's no excuse for it. We got our
asses booted and that's exactly what it is. Now we have to react.
It's disappointing. It's not how you get put down on your ass, it's
how you get back up. We didn't get up today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a disaster it was hard to know where to begin to
break it down. One crucial spot was at the 3:35 mark of the opening
period when center Joe Thornton, clearly Boston's finest forward in
Game 3, was walloped in the head by the knee of right wing Vaclav
Varada and had his bell rung. Thornton went to the dressing room
for repairs and returned to the ice at 13:54 only to leave again,
this time for good.
</P>
<P>
   He played only four shifts for 2:51 before calling it a night.
That put a crimp in Burns's game plan. Burns had intended to bump
right wing Dmitri Khristich, a flat-out disappointment so far in
the playoffs, down to fourth-line duty. Once Thornton was lost,
however, Burns had no choice but to reinstall Khristich on the top
two lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the Sabres, who were as dominant in this period as
they had been in the third period of Game 3, held the Bruins to
four shots while peppering Dafoe with 16. Dafoe, who faced a total
of 39 shots, managed to hold the fort through the first 20 minutes
but it was clear that if he didn't get some help, and soon, that
wasn't going to be able to last.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo put some real heat on Boston during a two-man advantage
for 1:37 midway through the middle period when Landon Wilson and
Kyle McLaren were called for penalties. The Bruins and Dafoe staved
off the five-on-three but at the tail end of the five-on-four, they
could keep the lid on no longer. Two seconds after the penalty to
Wilson expired, the Sabres scored. Defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, who
was public enemy No. 1 in Boston for the hit on Ray Bourque in Game
2, put Buffalo on the board at 8:20. Defenseman Jason Woolley fired
the puck down from the right point and Zhitnik, parked along the
edge of the crease, redirected it in for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, already without defenseman Don Sweeney (back
injury), lost defenseman Darren Van Impe for a time in the second
at 12:20 when he was felled by a Geoff Sanderson shot. He went to
the locker room and returned a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were so strapped for offense, it was almost pathetic.
At the 13:30 mark, the Bruins had a total of 10 shots, while the
Sabres had 10 shots in the first 6:30 of the second alone.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing happening for Boston, and it was especially
evident on a 41-second two-man advantage during which it failed to
even fluster goalie Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Sabres' dominance, the Bruins trailed only by a
goal. But that changed in the waning seconds of the period. With
16.9 ticks left on the clock, Varada, who had already done his
share of damage by knocking Thornton out of the game, teed up a
slapper from the right circle that caromed off the goal post and
past Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-0, but it might as well have been 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   As if things weren't bad enough for Boston, center Michael Peca
only made it worse when he tallied a shorthanded goal at 11:39,
putting the finishing touch on a game that was already long over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brutal,'' said Dafoe. ``They played great, they
deserved to win. They were the better team tonight, they've been
the better team all series, and that's why they're up, 3-1.''

THORNTON CRASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The end to the Bruins' season came when Joe Thornton
crashed awkwardly into Vaclav Varada early in the first period
Friday night. Mathematically, officially, the end will come when
they lose their fourth game to the Sabres, perhaps as early as
Sunday afternoon at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, it's over, and it ended in a thud, when
Thornton's head banged into Varada's leg with only 3:35 ticked off
the clock in the first period. Thornton returned later in the
period, but only briefly, and what already had been a struggling
Boston offense disappeared in total when Thornton didn't come out
for the start of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, we played bad the whole game,'' said the Bruins'
first-line center, Jason Allison, who again was hogtied by
Buffalo's sensational team-wide defense. ``We played bad from the
drop of the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played, it wouldn't have mattered if we had Mario
Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr in our lineup. One or two guys just aren't
going to do it for us. We didn't play as a five-man team out there,
and when we don't do that, we're not going to win. They're just too
good of a team, too good of a five-man unit to beat if you're not
playing the same kind of game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, through head coach Pat Burns, only would say that
Thornton ``got his bell rung.'' In medical terms, that would mean
he was concussed. If so, the chances of his returning to action
less than 48 hours later, for Game 5 on Causeway Street, would be
virtually nil. The increase of concussions has been a league-wide
concern the last 3-4 years and extra precautions are taken before
returning a player to action. With the series at 3-1 in Buffalo's
favor, it especially would make little sense to expose a ``bell
rung'' Thornton to more action.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was not available for comment. A team official said the
second-year center was told by Burns to make himself unavailable to
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Varada, meanwhile, stood in the triumphant Buffalo dressing room
and talked willingly of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a two-on-one (break),'' said the rock-hard winger,
who plays on the Sabres' No. 1 checking line with Michael Peca and
Dixon Ward. ``I came across to try to hit him _ and he dropped a
pass for (Sergei) Samsonov. I (went) to hit him and he fell into my
legs. He hit my knee. He fell right before the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaclav's description made it sound as if Thornton was ducking,
and in so doing made his head vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied for the previous two games, both losses, the Bruins
entered the night with some lines altered, including taking
Thornton's wingers, Steve Heinze and Anson Carter, and pairing them
with Allison. Thornton's wingmen were Samsonov and Landon Wilson, a
trio that rolled over the boards as the club's third shift of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton made it to the Boston bench under his own power after
his collision with Varada, but soon made his way down the runway
and into the dressing room. At about 13:45 he reported back to the
bench, and was back out on the ice at 13:54, this time with Dmitri
Khristich and Wilson as the siderunners. The period ended 0-0, and
it was the last ice Thornton would touch, other than perhaps a bag
of frozen cubes held to his distressed head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think what happened was, they lost Thornton early and it
hurt 'em,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``They tried to double
shift Allison a lot after that, but Thornton was out of the mix. I
don't they could execute after that.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know if they could have executed even with a healthy
Thornton. The Boston offense began to shrivel up in Game 2 at the
Vault, under a tremendous forechecking job by the Sabres. It
continued in Game 3. Allison couldn't find room to shoot.
Khristich, his right wing, continued his tiptoe through the Lost
Forest. He led the team in goals (29) in the regular season and has
the best shot of any Boston forward. All of that dropped out of his
game April 18, the Bruins' final game of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   When Thornton exited, it left the Bruins with only one true
scoring center. Khristich slipped in there as a makeshift pivot at
times. Otherwise they had Tim Taylor anchoring the checking line,
as always, and Shawn Bates as the fourth-line pivot. Bates, little
used in the postseason, showed some spark and hit Dominik Hasek
with one of Boston's few true scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to come in and play the way we've played the
last two games, we don't deserve to win,'' said Taylor, who again
took three pain-killing shots to assuage the hurt in his shoulder
and ribs just to suit up for the game. ``We have to play the way
they are _ that's with 20 guys playing, with 20 guys finishing
their checks hard and finishing on defense. Obviously, Joe's a big
part of our team, yes. It doesn't help us any when he leaves. But,
hey, it was 0-0 when he left, and we were still fightin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we played from there . . . we don't need guys going
one-on-one, trying to stickhandle through three guys. We have to go
for the rebounds, go for the jams, put the puck on net. That's the
only way we are going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The one true thing the Bruins had going for them, once more, was
Bryon Dafoe in net. Again, by virtue of the assault he faced, he
turned in a better game that Hasek. The shots were 39-24 in
Buffalo's favor, and quality chances were about 12-3 on Buffalo's
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you get more deflated than that first period?'' said
Dafoe, asked if he saw an emotional letdown upon Thornton's exit.
``He's a huge part of our offense, obviously you miss him. We all
hope he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, added the goalie, ``It was a piss-poor effort _ not
something we expected in a Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Thornton remained in the mix, maybe Allison would have found
more room. Maybe Thornton himself would have popped in a goal or
two. Maybe that Boston attack that looked so sharp against the
'Canes would have revived. But without Thornton, there wasn't a
trace of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off late tonight, that's the bottom line,'' said
defenseman Hal Gill. ``We weren't doing the things that we do well.
That's no secret. We got outplayed. We got outworked. We got
outhustled. That's not the way we play. That's not our team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Friday night, and now the end is near.

A SUBDUED CLINTON ADDRESSES SEATTLE FUND RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY AND LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton dropped into Seattle on Friday for a
serious, pensive and nostalgic speech to big Democratic donors in
which he defended NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and called for
national resolve in curbing school violence.
</P>
<P>
   In sober talk not often heard at $5,000-a-head fund-raisers,
Clinton decried the atrocities committed by Serbs in the name of
``religion, ethnicity, an imagined history and old slights.'' He
also spoke of a national need to reach ``disconnected kids in
America'' before they commit acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 32-minute speech _ which often treated his
not-yet-complete presidency in the past tense _ dealt extensively
with the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Littleton happened, it broke a dam in the psyche of
America,'' the president said. ``We owe it to the families and the
kids who perished not to let this opportunity pass, and not let it
descend into finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spun off figures on the decline in crime, said the
country is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to see our attempts to save our children
turned into Chapter 57 of America's ongoing cultural war for
someone's political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to see is every single segment of our society
stand up and say, not that it's someone else's fault, but `What can
I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The president's fund-raiser was unspectacular in its proceeds.
Democratic and corporate donors ponied up about $200,000 _ less
than insurgent Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley raised
here last month.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 70 or so people who showed up at Seattle's
Rainier Club said they were moved by his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``His potential for charismatic and inspiring leadership was
never in question,'' Seattle Mayor Paul Schell said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Open and ebullient on previous Northwest visits, Clinton spent
his time Friday in the protective cocoon of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not answer questions about regional issues. His only
audience was seven tables of major donors behind closed doors at
the Rainier Club. He made a brief stop at the Elliott Bay Book Co.,
which later produced rush-hour tie-ups as traffic on Interstate 5
was held up to accommodate Clinton's motorcade on its swift passage
back to Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   The president who once loved to work crowds at Pike Place Market
rallies ducked into his limousine outside the Pioneer Square
bookstore with only a perfunctory wave to shoppers kept behind rope
lines a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle stop opened a three-day fund-raising tour devoid of
public events. Clinton moved on last night to California's Silicon
Valley for a $25,000-a-couple dinner. On Saturday night he will be
in Los Angeles for a dinner _ starting at $25,000 a couple _ held
by Hollywood moguls and Dreamworks partners David Geffen, Steven
Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The president will spend Monday
at similar events in San Diego and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was different from past Seattle stopovers in
another respect _ he was greeted by chanting demonstrators
representing multiple causes and both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, students and downtown employees on their lunch breaks
protested issues ranging from the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to the
Makah's attempts to harpoon a gray whale to the alleged leaking of
U.S. strategic weapons information to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, stop raping Serbia,'' one sign said. Another placard
said, ``By land or by sea, human or animal killing is still
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of protests focused on the bombing of targets in
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, a campaign mounted to force withdrawal
of Serbian forces from the largely ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the leaders of the countries who want the war,''
retiree Emert Browning said. ``The thing that bothers me is that we
are spending billions of dollars (on the bombings).''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at 1:20 p.m., the demonstrators erupted
with the chant ``Stop the bombing now, Bill,'' easily drowning out
the handful of onlookers clapping and cheering in support of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton and his supporters _ including
veterans of Vietnam-era anti-war protests _ defended the NATO
campaign in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims, co-chairman of the luncheon,
spoke of taking his three sons to the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., which recounts the Nazi extermination of 6
million European Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to have a president who decided that kind of
genocidal activity had to stop,'' said Sims, referring to the
ethnic cleansing in which Kosovo residents have been driven from
their homes and in some cases killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke with China's President Jiang Zemin on his
flight to Seattle, repeated his apologies for last week's
destruction of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a terrible mistake with the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy, and I regret it more than I can say,'' the president said.
Clinton noted, however, that people can see Belgrade bomb damage on
CNN _ while the Serbian atrocities in closed-off Kosovo are ``what
you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of an incident in which 15 men allegedly were
roped together and burned alive, and of mass rapes committed
against Albanian women, who then face ostracism in their Muslim
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the promise of the 21st century to be overthrown
by the oldest poison in human existence,'' said Clinton, referring
to ethnic hatreds that have claimed thousands of lives and
dislocated more than a million people in states that formerly made
up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The speech brought tears to the eyes to one listener, Maryann
Tagney Jones of Washington Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking about the fact that they (Serbs) chose to rape
young women because they were Muslim, knowing what that would do to
their lives,'' she said. ``Just the thought of that, the base
brutality, made me cry.''

   BUFFALO _ Bruins president Harry Sinden didn't mince words as he
walked to the team bus after Friday night's embarrassing, 3-0,
playoff defeat at the hands of the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the (expletive) kicked out of us,'' said Sinden.
``Tonight we were good players, no team. We didn't play as a team
and we got the (expletive) kicked out of us. I don't know what
their thinking was. This is a team game and if you play as
individuals, you're dead in the water. And that's all we do. That's
what it was tonight. No team. Buffalo _ they're a team.''
</P>
<P>
   So now the series returns to Boston Sunday and we find out if
Pat Burns is really Tuna-on-Skates. Can he coach and motivate young
players like Bill Parcells? Can he rally his troops against
impossible odds? Can he make these individuals play as a team?
</P>
<P>
   Burns expected his guys to show some fire-on-ice at Marine
Midland Arena, but there was no Bruins spark in Game 4. Don Sweeney
was out with a bad back, and Joe Thornton spent most of the night
in the dressing room after almost getting knocked out by a knee to
the head. Meanwhile, erstwhile snipers/playmakers Dmitri Khristich
and Jason Allison were harder to find than Tom Finneran at a
Save-the-Pats rally.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Patriots, this Bruins season is starting to feel
like the Fall of Foxborough we witnessed early last January when
all the Patriots were hurt and armed with excuses as they went to
Jacksonville for their playoff execution.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for a Bruins team to play without heart, but at least
the coach and his players had no alibis for the
mistake-by-the-lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an old-fashioned ass-booting,'' admitted Burns.
``There's no excuse for it . . . We have to feel defeated. But it's
not how you get put down on your ass, it's how you get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuse,'' said bewildered captain Ray Bourque. ``You think
you're ready to play and come out hard, but they had the jump on us
all night. We got beat pretty good. We've got to play a lot better
and we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe kept the B's in it. It was 0-0 after one even
though the Bruins were outshot, 16-4, in the first period. He had
no chance on Buffalo's first goal, then finally cracked when Vaclav
Varada beat him with a slapper at the end of the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were brutal,'' admitted Dafoe. ``I don't know why we came
out the way we did. We just didn't respond all night. We didn't
have any pressure. I just try to stop the puck and I did it for as
long as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   The B's were clearly battling their postgame depression from
Wednesday. New England's Hockey Krishnas know that Game 3 was
The-One-That-Got-Away and it now has a chance to go down in the
annals as the 1999 version of the ``Toe-In-The-Crease'' game that
effectively eliminated the B's against Washington last spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to believe the black and gold could be so lifeless
in the wake of Wednesday's heartbreaker. But they were.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 1-0, the Bruins had their best chance with a
five-on-three for 41 seconds late in the second. Boston got
nothing. Dominik Hasek saved a couple of weak efforts by Steve
Heinze and Anson Carter as Buffalo fans chanted ``Ray Bourque
Sucks.'' Meanwhile, Thornton was in the locker room after taking a
knee to the face from Varada.
</P>
<P>
   With 16.9 seconds left in the second period, Varada (as if he
hadn't done enough damage already) made it 2-0 with a wide-open
slap shot that beat Dafoe to the far side.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks earlier in Greensboro, the Bruins had trailed the
Hurricanes, two games to one, and trailed, 2-0, after two periods.
Those guys rallied with three quick goals at the start of the third
and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be a major adjustment in our game,''
admitted Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to find it in yourself to come out and play hard,''
said Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost as a team,'' said Burns. ``Now we have to regroup.
It's disappointing. We have to make them believe it's possible.
This was disappointing. Now it depends on how we come back for the
next game in front of our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better be better than Friday night. Bruins fans are a
discerning lot and will not tolerate another dog like Friday
night's.

   TORONTO _ Two starts, two countries, two wins.
</P>
<P>
   The math doesn't get any simpler than that.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the geography.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Pena, born in the Dominican Republic, matured in Miami, and
made for Boston, won't be going back to Pawtucket any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old righthander, displaying the same unflappable
poise on this side of the border as he possessed in his major
league debut on Yawkey Way, shut out the Toronto Blue Jays on six
hits through seven innings in a 5-0 win before a modest gathering
of 22,186 in SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is easy out there,'' Pena said, betraying less
expression after the game than the one small gesture he allowed
himself as he came off the field, a barely discernible double pump
of his fists and a quick glance skyward. ``You have to work hard,
have to play the game, and leave all you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   With batterymate Jason Varitek hitting a two-run shot for his
first homer of the season and driving in another run with a double,
Pena struck out seven, walked two, and allowed just four balls to
reach the outfield in pitching the Sox to their seventh win in
their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Blue Jays' six hits off Pena were infield hits,
including a bunt single. He was dismissed only because he'd already
thrown 115 pitches, and had made it abundantly clear that he'd be
needed again in another five days. Lefty Rheal Cormier made swift
work of the last five Blue Jay hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really picked us up,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams,
who in the absence of the injured Bret Saberhagen, the pitcher who
last season was the linchpin of the entire staff, has found an
unlikely candidate to stanch the bleeding. ``The (two starts) have
been special. Special just because of the kid. That's a youngster
out there that's pitching. He's really pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who paid little heed to the Mo Vaughn circus when he held
the Angels to a run on three hits in six innings last Saturday,
similarly showed no signs of being intimidated by his mound
opponent Friday night: David Wells, less than a year removed from
folk-hero status with the Yankees after being shipped back across
the border in the Roger Clemens deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid pitches in a vacuum,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
said. ``It doesn't matter if it's home or away, grass or turf,
night or day. It doesn't matter. The kid is going to play his own
elevated game of throw and catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about making pitches, and this kid is fun to watch
because he's a pitcher. He's not a blower. He doesn't have a
dominating pitch. But he throws five pitches with location and
command, which is unusual for a young pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the MVP of the American League Championship Series,
didn't allow a hit until Troy O'Leary's ground ball off third
baseman Tony Fernandez's glove in the fifth. But Boomer went belly
up before the kid did.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Varitek doubled into the left-field corner to
score O'Leary, giving the Sox a 1-0 lead. With Jose Cruz Jr.
playing a shallow center field, Darren Lewis then drove a ball into
the left-center-field gap for a triple, scoring Varitek to make it
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Jeff Frye beat out an infield hit and Varitek
followed with a drive that just cleared the left-field wall. When
Varitek singled off the shin of reliever Tom Davey in the ninth, he
had his second three-hit game in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm swinging the bat any better or worse,'' said
Varitek, who raised his average to .270. ``We've been constantly
working on keeping my swing short and more compact.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pena wasn't being deceptively clever, keeping Blue Jays
hitters off-balance with a street vendor's assortment of breaking
pitches, he was smart enough to be lucky, too. The Blue Jays hit
several balls hard Friday night, but usually right at someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come out unfazed by the big leagues,'' first baseman Mike
Stanley said. ``He doesn't seem to be nervous. He just doesn't
allow anything to show.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of exquisite defense by the Sox, starting with
Garciaparra's on-the-run throw from the hole to nab Toronto leadoff
hitter Shannon Stewart. Second baseman Frye made a diving stop to
throw out Mike Matheny in the third, then nabbed Stewart's liner
with a backhand catch and flipped to Garciaparra to double up Pat
Kelly with two on and no out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all was the catch by Buford in the ninth, when he
sprinted almost to Buffalo before hauling in Fernandez's bid for
extra bases in front of the right-center-field wall in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the night was about the tall young Dominican
whose eyes betray anxiety only when he has to speak. Never when he
has a ball in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get rattled some time,'' Varitek said. ``Everybody does.
He'll give up some runs. Pedro (Martinez) gives up runs. But he's
not going to get intimidated.''
</P>

DUNSTON DOES DODGERS A FAVOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Shawon Dunston had the ball and the game in his
hands Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about how the St. Louis Cardinals had the rare
opportunity to beat Kevin Brown. He thought about how his slumping
team would get a boost from shutting down the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   And then he didn't think.
</P>
<P>
   His throw to an empty bag at third with the bases loaded touched
off a seven-run seventh inning that gave the Dodgers a 7-3 victory
in front of 48,036 at Busch Stadium. If that wasn't enough, Dunston
got doubled off first one inning later after forgetting the number
of outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing this game was my responsibility and that is not a nice
feeling,'' Dunston said. ``You don't get many chances to beat Kevin
Brown and I let that slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   The scorebook will show that Eric Young's slow roller would have
scored Todd Hollandsworth with the tying run. The pitching charts
will show that one batter earlier Cardinals starter Jose Jimenez
walked Brown on four pitches with two outs and two on.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dunston's heart, none of that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave this to them and it hurts me,'' Dunston said. ``Do you
know how much confidence you get beating a guy like Brown? He's one
of the best. We've been struggling and this would have gone a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had just two hits against Jimenez, who defeated the
Dodgers on April 23 in Los Angeles. In six of the previous nine
games, Cardinals starters did not get out of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But after Jimenez (2-4) retired the first two batters in the
seventh, Hollandsworth and Mark Grudzielanek singled. Then Brown
walked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' said Brown (4-2). ``The way I've been hitting,
I couldn't have hit it with a paddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa added: ``Walking the pitcher
like that hurt a lot. Jose was starting to get his pitches up, but
I thought he was still OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he was just trying to make contact when his full
swing produced a perfect bunt up the third-base line. Dunston, a
longtime shortstop who is trying to stick around as a utility
player, thought he saw shortstop Edgar Renteria break for third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I saw was what I would have done as a
shortstop,'' Dunston said. ``All of a sudden the ball is rolling
down the left-field line and the lead is gone. I felt so bad for
Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   As Renteria raced to retrieve the ball, Grudzielanek and Brown
scored. Adrian Beltre made it 4-1 with an RBI single and Gary
Sheffield followed with a base hit to center. Clint Sadowsky took
over for Jimenez and Raul Mondesi, 9 for 21 on the recent home
stand with four homers and nine RBI, then doubled home two more.
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers were happy to get a win in the first of
three games against the Cardinals, they also felt for Dunston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I seen that play?'' pitching coach Charlie Hough said.
``Hell, I've  &UR; !ital! &LR; made &UR; !off! &LR;  that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who slid into first, didn't see Dunston's throw. He
didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has made that throw in their career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said he would have pinch hit in the
pitcher's spot for anyone but Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my ace,'' Johnson said. ``He pitched a gritty game and I
was going to let him try to win it. Almost anyone else would have
gotten pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, coming off his best outing, an 8-1 victory over Florida,
limited the Cardinals to five hits and a second-inning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better, but I still have some things to work
on,'' Brown said. ``It was a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown turned the game over to Alan Mills in the eighth. Mills,
who allowed a game-winning grand slam last Friday against Florida,
walked Mark McGwire, then gave up a two-run homer to Ray Lankford.
Dunston followed with a single. One out later, Eli Marrero flied to
right and Mondesi picked Dunston off first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was distracted, still thinking about that play in the
seventh,'' Dunston said. ``We had Kevin Brown on the ropes and I
fell apart.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

ANALYSIS: KNICKS HAUNTED BY OLD LIABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They became younger and more athletic at several
positions during the off season, but the New York Knicks failed to
address one glaring weakness on their roster. And as their offense
imploded in the second half of Game 4 on Friday night, the decision
to stay the course with their point guards may be prove to be a
major factor if they fall short of their post-season goals.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ward played one of his better games for more than two
quarters, but after he left with a cut over his right eye with less
than 10 minutes left in the third period, Chris Childs was erratic
and the Knicks had no one to make good decisions and run the
offense efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ward re-entered the game, the Miami Heat was on its
way to a resounding 87-72 victory. Ward was just as much a culprit
as anyone during a disastrous 10-point fourth quarter in which the
Knicks again became the dysfunctional offensive unit they often
resembled in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Ward finished with 3 turnovers. Childs finished with no assists
in 20 minutes. The Knicks followed their disastrous lead. For all
their tenacious defense on Tim Hardaway in the first three games,
the backcourt duo self-destructed when it mattered most. Entrusted
with keeping the Knicks cohesive, they broke apart at crucial
junctures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going well and then, you know, we relied
too much on jump shots,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``We were in
the fourth quarter, up four at home, and we didn't get the job
done. I mean, it's as simple as that. We lost our poise, and played
frustrated and got run over like they got run over in Games 1 and
3.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the fault of Ward and Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell dribbled the ball off his knee and forced shot
after shot. Larry Johnson fell in love with the 3-point line and
forgot about working his way inside. And a meek Allan Houston could
not create any open space for himself.
</P>
<P>
   These were the misguided voyages of the Knick offense Friday
night at Madison Square Garden. In a series that keeps swinging
like a pendulum, they brought all their old regular-season
liabilities to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Little movement. Careless passes. A paltry 9 assists in 48
minutes. And 16 of the most disturbing turnovers this team has made
over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   They threw away an 11-point lead in the second half. They were
outscored by 35-15 over an awful stretch in the third and fourth
periods. That stretch featured one field goal in seven minutes,
four turnovers and several ill-advised shots.
</P>
<P>
   For their awful effort, they earned an all-expense paid trip to
Miami Arena for a deciding Game 5. This is not where they wanted to
go, but it should suffice as punishment after what they put the
Garden's fans through.
</P>
<P>
   The game started to get away from the Knicks when Ward left the
floor with 9 minutes 49 seconds left in the third quarter.
Scrambling for a loose ball, he banged his head into Dan Majerle's
knee. Before Ward retreated to the locker room to have the cut
tended to, he had steadily directed the offense for three quarters,
converting three 3-pointers and delivering timely passes to his
teammates on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward returned with 3:59 left in the quarter, the Heat had
cut the lead to 55-51.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was down to his last point guard after Childs came out
with a bruised ankle and Ward picked up his fifth foul with 10:16
left in the game. Rick Brunson, the reserve point guard, came in
for 2 minutes. In his brief stint, he looked like a nervous
freshman trying to cut it on the varsity. Childs quickly went back
in, but he could not settle the offense down, either.
</P>
<P>
   The signs that it was going to be a long night for the Knicks
had begun earlier, when Ewing voiced his displeasure with Sprewell
in the second quarter, letting the sixth man know that he had been
open on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who shot 4 of 9 from the field, offered this analysis:
``I know when the ball moves, we get good shots and I play well,
the Knicks play well. I look at it as a challenge and an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to miss shots, but you have to stay together. We
kind of fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks seemed to be on the cusp in Game 3, blending the
talents of Sprewell, Houston and Ewing into an offensive explosion
that produced a rout and seemed to signify a hurdle cleared in
their development.
</P>
<P>
   They shared the basketball. They cared about finding the open
man. But like a lot of other runaway games recently, it was a
facade. Friday night, without a floor leader, the Knicks were
clueless.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Christine Nakano was gulping air.
</P>
<P>
   Just seconds earlier she had completed a difficult obstacle
course Friday at James Monroe High School during the first-ever
Toughest Cadet Alive competition among 15 boys and 15 girls from
the Los Angeles Unified School District's five Police Academy
magnet schools.
</P>
<P>
   Christine scaled a 6-foot wooden fence, climbed over a smaller
wire fence, scrambled over a bar, ran through a maze, clambered
through a window-like gap in a wall, hopped over several short
obstacles, rounded two posts, pulled herself up a rope, maneuvered
a descending set of monkey bars and dragged a heavy sack dummy 25
feet before sprinting to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intense,'' said the 16-year-old girl as she recovered
her breath.
</P>
<P>
   Other girls and boys failed to finish the obstacle course,
finding it impossible to get up the rope.
</P>
<P>
   Was she the toughest cadet alive? ``We won't know till the end
of the day,'' said Christine, a junior at Monroe in the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of a winner would come only after other
physical tests _ the 50-yard dash, push-ups, two minutes of jumping
rope, a stretching test and a one-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes in the morning, the 30 students also had to write
persuasive essays on one of six statements about the American
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the day, Christine knew: She won the trophy
for the toughest female cadet.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Flores of San Pedro High School was toughest male cadet
and Monroe took the trophy for the toughest team.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's event was meant ``to promote excellence in academics
and physical ability and to set up a competing environment for the
best'' students in the program, said Roberta Weintraub, executive
director of the 3-year-old Los Angeles Police Academy Magnet
Schools, which attract students from all over the city for a
specialized curriculum in preparation for carreers in law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure 40 &UR;  &LR; percent from the neck up, 60 &UR;  &LR; percent from the
neck down,'' said Joan Martin, a consultant to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful opportunity,'' said Capt. Earl Paysinger, commanding
officer of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education division of the Los
Angeles Police Department. ``Helps build character, teamwork and
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five high schools in the program _ Monroe, Reseda,
San Pedro, Dorsey and Wilson _ sent three girls and three boys.
</P>
<P>
   The competition invigorated Angel Yanez, 14, of Reseda. ``I feel
like doing it again,'' he said after it ended.
</P>
<P>
   A few parents came to encourage their children. ``They're so
hard on themselves,'' said Maggie Baccarini of Reseda, watching her
daughter, Heather.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was one more good experience in a program that
has given her daughter renewed drive, she said. ``She's definitely
got that since she joined,'' Baccarini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made her more of a leader,'' said the girl's father, Tony
Baccarini.
</P>
<P>
   Heather is in her first year in the program, which only started
at Reseda High this school year. ``I want to be a homicide
detective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Nakano looks forward to working in forensics, either
gathering clues at crime scenes or examining corpses. ``It's
interesting how a dead body can conceal so much evidence,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother also came to cheer her on. ``She was nervous'' in the
morning, Cathy Nakano said of Christine. ``I was nervous for her,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nerves turned to determination and the determination
paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named toughest female cadet, Nakano won third place
in the essay competition and a medallion for being the top female
cadet from Monroe High.
</P>
<P>
   But she seemed just as pleased to have met a new group of fellow
cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about killing the other team, it's about making
friends,'' she said.

FORMER POW TALKS OF SUSTAINING POWER OF FAITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After a month in captivity, U.S. Army Sgt. Andrew
Ramirez said he was never more happy than when he saw Rabbi Steven
Jacobs walk into the Yugoslavian prison where he was kept to tell
him he was going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked into that room and saw somebody from my home, I
never had that much happiness,'' Ramirez said Friday night during
services at Temple Kol Tikvah in suburban Woodland Hills, across
the city from his native East Los Angeles. ``He told me the Dodgers
were in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to speak by Jacobs about his experiences as a prisoner
of war, Ramirez told the audience of several hundred he had never
been in a situation where his freedom had been taken away before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have faith in my country, faith in God and faith in
the people of the United States. Every day I prayed for a miracle.
I thank the delegation for putting themselves in that dangerous
situation. I myself was waiting for a Tomahawk cruise missile to
come flying into my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, 24, was captured along with two other Americans on
March 31 near the Kosovo-Macedonia border. Jacobs, rabbi at the
temple, was part of the delegation that met with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to help secure the release of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson invited Jacobs to be part of the
delegation after they met in April at a memorial service in
Mississippi for three slain civil rights leaders. Representatives
from numerous faiths took part in the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never doubted for a moment even when the world told us
these boys wouldn't be released. They said we were foolish or
naive, but we believed,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation secured the release of the men May 1, including
Ramirez; Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek,
Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, Ramirez arrived at Los Angeles International Airport
to a hero's welcome and has spent the last week savoring his
favorite foods, visiting with his family in Baldwin Park, attending
rallies and parades, and talking about his experience.
</P>
<P>
   Members of several area churches attended the service Friday,
including a gospel choir. The audience gave Ramirez a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this evening say about America?'' Jacobs asked.
``What does it say about our lives. I believe passionately we want
to celebrate life, not death.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Ramirez's family for their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a message about what happened. What his mother
taught us. They taught us not only about hope, but they taught us
how to cope.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said before the service that he struck up a friendship
with Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first week, his condition was terrible,'' Jacobs said.
``He was really beat up, and a bag was kept over his head. He was
in solitary confinement. They got by on their prayers, and their
faith brought them through.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs attributed Milosevic's decision to release the men to the
perseverance of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the art of not demonizing the enemy,'' Jacobs
said. ``Rev. Jackson has that ability. He told them (the soldiers)
are not trophies and they were no good to them in Yugoslavia. We
were determined not to be used, and we got them out.''
</P>
<P>
   After having been put in jail, suffering isolation, Ramirez
survived to teach us the great lesson of humility, Jacobs said at
the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no hero. He doesn't pretend to be a hero,'' Jacobs said.
``But he's a hero because he loves life, he loves his family and
he's willing to stand up for America.''

THE LOVE/HATE SONG OF THE EVERLYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All brothers fight. But few do it in such a public fashion as
Phil and Don Everly.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1973, rock and roll's most influential duo called it
quits. Phil smashed his guitar on a Knotts Berry Farm stage and
stormed off. His older brother was left to sadly tell the crowd,
``The Everly Brothers died 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, the Everlys talked to each other exactly
once. It was at their father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, of course, the pair that sang such timeless hits as
``All I Have to Do Is Dream'' and ``Wake Up Little Susie''
reunited. Sunday they will play a public concert in Phoenix for the
first time since their headline-grabbing 1983 reunion. But they
remain a prime example of the dangerous pitfalls that exist for
siblings who perform together.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's like taking a Sun Devil and a Wildcat, tying them
up in a bag and shaking the whole thing violently _ I wouldn't
recommend it,'' says Kevin Leman, a Tucson psychologist who wrote
``The New Birth Order Book: Why You Are the Way You Are.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers in the music biz often have rocky histories. Oasis'
Liam and Noel Gallagher probably are more famous for their constant
feuding than for any of the music they created. For two years in
the '70s, Robin Gibb didn't speak to either of his siblings in the
Bee Gees.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes between Ray and Dave Davies of the Kinks are legendary.
John and Tom Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival constantly
battled during the life of their band. When Tom died in 1990, the
two hadn't resolved their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs intensified the relationship between Cris and Curt
Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets. More recently, funk star Roger
Troutman of Zapp was shot to death by his brother, Larry. The elder
Troutman handled business affairs for his younger sibling and used
to be in the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you work together with family, there are simply these
big, added stresses to deal with,'' Leman says. ``It's never going
to be an easy road.''
</P>
<P>
   Leman should know. He's a regular on the talk-show circuit,
discussing his theories on siblings. Not only does he not recommend
that brothers work together, he thinks brothers in music face an
even higher rate of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're talking about being a Rhodes Scholar or being a
lead singer, it's tough,'' he says. ``But imagine the pressures of
being brothers and being famous and being on the road _ would you
want that?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Mark Zubia of the Pistoleros are aware of the
simmering tempers that can explode between siblings. The night the
Valley band signed a deal with Hollywood Records, a time when the
brothers should have been at their happiest, the two wound up in an
ugly row at Tempe's Long Wong's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a huge blowout on stage,'' recalled Lawrence, lead
singer and the eldest of the two. ``I can't even remember why it
happened. It was part of that family thing _ someone gives you a
weird look, and you're off. We were both lunging for each other. I
actually think I spit on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zubias can laugh about it now, but that
sometimes-frightening intensity is typical when brothers join
forces in business. It's amplified if it's in a field such as
music, a creative outlet that often forces people to expose their
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for people to get a little bit hurt,'' says Ben
Phillips, who is in a band with his two brothers. ``If I come up
with a song and my brother doesn't think it's any good, it's really
easy to get mad. If I was laying tile and he said it was crooked,
that's no big deal. But a song is more personal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Egos are on the line,'' says Leman, who studies relationships
between siblings. ``It's tough. Look at the Mandrell Sisters. You
know Barbara is the lead singer, but who can name the other ones?''
</P>
<P>
   Ben and his brother Nathan could probably relate. Along with
Randy Stowe, they make up zackphillipsband, a Glendale group built
around their oldest brother, Zack. And with Zack being the lead
singer, he's the obvious focal point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch us play, people are always staring at Zack,'' Ben
says. At age 23, he's the youngest member of the group. ``He's got
that ability to make people look at him. You want to see what he's
going to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great. I almost feel like it's a wave, and I'm
getting to ride along.''
</P>
<P>
   It's different for Nathan, however. Like Zack, he plays guitar.
The only reason he picked up the instrument as a child was because
Zack played it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that I wanted to be like him,'' says Nathan, who is
three years younger than Zack. ``It was that I wanted to be
``better'' than him.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't surprise Leman. He says siblings normally compete,
but a business relationship intensifies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, it's king of the hill,'' he says. ``The
whole point is supremacy. And the first born always has that. Think
of England: We've got the heir and the spare. The first born always
gets more than his fair due. Those second borns tend to want to get
their place in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Zack knows that. In the case of the Phillips brothers, the band
actually was formed around him when he needed a backing group. And
he acknowledges there's a competitive streak that exists between
him and Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like that with Ben,'' he muses. ``I think it's
because there's a few more years between Ben and me, but Nathan and
me kind of push each other's buttons sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer the kids are in years, there's going to be more
competition,'' Leman explains. ``If the age spread is bigger, it's
more of a `big brother/little brother' relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors exist in sibling relationships. On the positive
side, brothers know each others' sore spots, so they can tread
carefully around sensitive issues. On the negative side, that
information often is used to hit people in their weakest areas and
create a world of hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know each other ``too'' well,'' Leman says. ``You know
each other's spots. Fighting becomes an act of cooperation. You
know exactly what to say to escalate the battle further, and you
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zubia agrees. His brother may understand better than other
band members, but he also can annoy him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it makes things easier,'' Mark says. ``I know my
brother, so I kind of know what he's going to say about certain
things. At the same time, when we disagree . . . well, your brother
can piss you off worse than about anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the saddest, most inevitable aspect of the whole thing
is that business often begins to override the familial
relationship. It's a constant danger when siblings work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamic with Mark and me is different than it is with my
other brothers and sisters,'' Lawrence offers. ``A lot of times, I
will ask them how Mark is doing, even though I see him more than
they do. We kind of stay out of each other's personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better that way. A lot of our time is spent with each
other, more than with any other family member. It's like we're
business partners and our relationship as brothers kind of falls by
the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Phillips knows that feeling. When there's a family barbecue,
they talk about band business. When the band is together, they talk
about band business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The band is almost the only reason we see each other as much
as we do,'' Ben says. ``I don't talk to Zack on the phone. If
there's two weeks with nothing going on in the band, we don't see
each other, because we've all got other things going on. It's
almost like the band makes us personable to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a corporation,'' Leman says. ``You need to have
lots of meetings and lots of communication. If you don't,
everything becomes off center.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett and Brad Warner sing Everly-influenced harmony songs as
the Warren Brothers. The Tampa duo believe that by keeping their
business in order, the family ties won't be strained to the
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't share money,'' says Brett, the lead singer. ``We
don't have a joint account. But that's the only thing we don't
share: We split publishing, sales and royalties right down the
middle. Nobody gets more than the other one. When we win, we both
win. When we lose, we both lose.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are still signs of change in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay out of each other's space,'' Brett says. ``We
have talent on our own. We can do things on our own. But when you
work with someone, it just gets different.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing business may not be the key to survival, however.
Leman says money should never be the driving issue when brothers
work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds as corny as ``Leave It to Beaver,'' but never
let money be the rule,'' he says. ``People are more important than
things.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has been both a casualty and a survivor, Don
Everly has his own ideas about how brothers can last in the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the normal rivalries that exist in a family: Older,
younger, all that,'' he says. ``It's not easy _ it never has been.
But with a brother act, you have to bend over backwards, because
there's nothing equal. There just isn't. It's a hard thing, but
it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe how well people handle the strains can be traced back to
their families. For instance, all the Phillips brothers cite being
raised in a Christian household as a stabilizing influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up learning how to resolve conflicts,'' Zack says.
``We just couldn't stay mad at each other. It wasn't allowed. Now,
I don't think I've ever stayed mad at one of them for more than a
day. It just can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad lives a block away from his brother,'' Nathan says.
``That's just how our family is.''
</P>
<P>
   And the opposite could be true, too. Don Everly almost seems
bemused when he discusses the 10 years of silence that existed
between him and his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not that unusual in our family,'' he says amiably.
``Mother didn't speak to our grandmother for 25 years. It's just
one of those things that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Everlys' split was one of the most public sibling tussles in
rock and roll history. Starting in the '50s, the brothers were
constantly seen on TV and heard on radio: Two similarly dressed,
similarly featured guys who sang gorgeous, amazingly tight
harmonies into one microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Don and Phil were never as close as the public believed,
it's hard to imagine they weren't at least very good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that Phil and I had been working together
since I was 8 years old,'' Don says. ``We just got sick of each
other. I didn't have any feeling of self, of who I was as an
individual. I'd be alone in a room and people would say, `Where's
Phil?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a competitive streak between the brothers. Also, the
partnership was intrinsically lop-sided: Don always sang lead and
wrote more songs that the brothers recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were inborn, difficult things there,'' Don says.
``Also, there's the thing with being in a band. It's not an easy
thing. McCartney and Lennon had major problems. It's like a
marriage, and you're lucky if you have a marriage that works.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers reunited in 1983. Privately, they reunited with a
hug. Publicly, it was with two sold-out shows at the Royal Albert
Hall in London, then a series of concerts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the brothers tour a few months out of the year. Don,
62, lives in Nashville; Phil, 60, in Los Angeles. They only see
each other on the road, Don says, and they travel in separate
buses. They prefer separate dressing rooms. But it's working out
well for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good now,'' Don says. ``I think we sing closer than we
ever did, but now we have our own lives. Really, it's just easier
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices don't sound much different from when they were
younger. Onstage, in fact, things seem pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, each brother has his own microphone. &QL;

SHOW LOW MAN ANTES UP TO SAVE SENIOR LOBSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, it takes a big lobster to remind us that we have
feelers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Crusty the Crustacean is thousands of miles away, swimming
inside a tank at a Niagara Falls seafood restaurant. But the
20-pound lobster's fate has become the concern of a Show Low man
who is offering $1,000 to keep the marine life from becoming
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good humanitarian thing to do,'' said George Morin, an
insurance broker, who saw a story about the large lobster air on
CNN on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of the senior shellfish softened Morin's heart like so
much melted butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing should be out enjoying his old age,'' Morin said.
</P>
<P>
   Crusty was delivered to the restaurant on Thursday, crawling
amid his fishy friends from the Nova Scotia shore, said Gloria
Wall, co-owner of Fine Kettle of Fish in Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this one came out of the crate, we were a little
surprised,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster caught the antenna of the local newspaper, which
came out for photographs. Television stations followed, and the
restaurant started getting calls from people who wanted Crusty
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't doing anything with him at the moment,'' Wall said.
``He's our prize right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not a boiling debate about Crusty's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband (is) falling in love with him,'' Wall said. ``I
can't get rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall said local oceanography experts have estimated the
lobster's age at 65 to 75 years. Typical lobsters, weighing a pound
or two, are only a few years old, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take a while to get to that size,'' Wall said.
``Usually, they're eaten by that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Market price at the restaurant is $14.99 a pound, Wall said. At
that rate, Crusty is worth a cool $300 boiled.
</P>
<P>
   Wall said most callers want to set up a Save Crusty fund or just
voice that they don't want Crusty to come out of his shell. She
said Morin's offer might be the only serious money that's been
floated.
</P>
<P>
   Morin said he just returned from a vacation in Hawaii, where he
felt attuned to ocean life. He wants to send Crusty to the Maui
Ocean Center for study.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy deserves a good retirement plan,'' Morin said.
``That's what I`m trying to give him.'' &QL;

SECURITY COUNCIL VOICES DISTRESS OVER EMBASSY ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to update with Council's adoption of resolution, refinements
and additional details)   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A week after NATO missiles hit the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, China and the United States hammered out a
formal statement late Friday night expressing the Security
Council's ``deep distress and concern'' about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was struck shortly before midnight when China agreed to
drop an explicit statement of ``shock'' about the missile strike in
exchange for the milder language.
</P>
<P>
   China had initially insisted on a harsh statement that
``condemned'' and later ``deplored'' the attack. The United States
and other NATO nations objected, arguing that such wording
suggested the embassy bombing was intentional, not an accident, as
NATO maintains.
</P>
<P>
   China's insistence on a statement effectively delayed Council
action on other pending issues. Among them was a three-week-old
resolution on the plight of Kosovo refugees that endorsed
principles of a peace settlement adopted by the Western powers and
Russia earlier this month in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, the Council finally adopted that
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Furious about the strike on its embassy, China maintained that a
formal statement on the embassy bombing needed top priority on the
Council's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While many Council members sympathized with China's indignation
over the attack that killed three and injured 20 more, several were
exasperated by Beijing's decision, in effect, to hold the Council's
business hostage to the apology it wanted. One African nation
complained that China was holding up an extension of the
authorization of a peacekeeping mission in the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   Five nations, including China, are permanent Council members,
and can veto any formal action. But on presidential statements,
like this one, the Council operates on consensus, making it easy
for unhappy members to disrupt or delay proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Even the weakened wording to ``deplore'' the bombing had been
unacceptable to the United States and its NATO allies. ``We will
not agree to deplore,'' Peter Burleigh, the acting representative
here, told reporters after he had sought instructions from
Washington on the latest Chinese draft.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials objected because they said it suggested that NATO
had intentionally attacked the embassy, a diplomatic installation
that under international law cannot be targeted. ``Would you
deplore a tornado?'' said one Western official, explaining
Washington's stance.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock was broken late Friday night after Burleigh huddled
with his counterpart, Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun, Friday evening
and proposed that the Council regret the incident rather than
``deplore'' it.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial period of confusion, U.S. and NATO officials
have repeatedly apologized for what they have called a tragic
mistake. President Clinton succeeded in getting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to accept his telephone call Friday expressing
condolences and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing on the compromise wording, the Council members
met in a formal, televised session where they stood for a moment of
silence in memory of the three Chinese victims of the missile
strike. Then they approved the statement, the Council's first
official reaction to the embassy bombing. A second minute of
silence was observed for the victims of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Few diplomats said that they thought China would delay
considering a peace plan for Kosovo once NATO and Russia agreed on
a proposal to restore peace in the Balkans and return the Kosovar
Albanian refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But China earlier in the week blocked the resolution about the
refugees, which endorsed the principles adopted for peace in
Yugoslavia adopted earlier this month by the G-8 nations. The
resolution passed early Saturday with Russia and China abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO wanted the Council to approve that
resolution because it was sponsored by influential developing
countries and Islamic states.

A SUBDUED CLINTON ADDRESSES SEATTLE FUND RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY AND LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton dropped into Seattle on Friday for a
serious, pensive and nostalgic speech to big Democratic donors in
which he defended NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and called for
national resolve in curbing school violence.
</P>
<P>
   In sober talk not often heard at $5,000-a-head fund-raisers,
Clinton decried the atrocities committed by Serbs in the name of
``religion, ethnicity, an imagined history and old slights.'' He
also spoke of a national need to reach ``disconnected kids in
America'' before they commit acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 32-minute speech _ which often treated his
not-yet-complete presidency in the past tense _ dealt extensively
with the aftermath of the Littleton, Colo., school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Littleton happened, it broke a dam in the psyche of
America,'' the president said. ``We owe it to the families and the
kids who perished not to let this opportunity pass, and not let it
descend into finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spun off figures on the decline in crime, said the
country is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to see our attempts to save our children
turned into Chapter 57 of America's ongoing cultural war for
someone's political advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to see is every single segment of our society
stand up and say, not that it's someone else's fault, but `What can
I do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The president's fund-raiser was unspectacular in its proceeds.
Democratic and corporate donors ponied up about $200,000 _ less
than insurgent Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley raised
here last month.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the 70 or so people who showed up at Seattle's
Rainier Club said they were moved by his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``His potential for charismatic and inspiring leadership was
never in question,'' Seattle Mayor Paul Schell said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Open and ebullient on previous Northwest visits, Clinton spent
his time Friday in the protective cocoon of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He did not answer questions about regional issues. His only
audience was seven tables of major donors behind closed doors at
the Rainier Club. He made a brief stop at the Elliott Bay Book Co.,
which later produced rush-hour tie-ups as traffic on Interstate 5
was held up to accommodate Clinton's motorcade on its swift passage
back to Boeing Field.
</P>
<P>
   The president who once loved to work crowds at Pike Place Market
rallies ducked into his limousine outside the Pioneer Square
bookstore with only a perfunctory wave to shoppers kept behind rope
lines a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle stop opened a three-day fund-raising tour devoid of
public events. Clinton moved on last night to California's Silicon
Valley for a $25,000-a-couple dinner. On Saturday night he will be
in Los Angeles for a dinner _ starting at $25,000 a couple _ held
by Hollywood moguls and Dreamworks partners David Geffen, Steven
Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The president will spend Monday
at similar events in San Diego and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was different from past Seattle stopovers in
another respect _ he was greeted by chanting demonstrators
representing multiple causes and both ends of the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, students and downtown employees on their lunch breaks
protested issues ranging from the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to the
Makah's attempts to harpoon a gray whale to the alleged leaking of
U.S. strategic weapons information to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton, stop raping Serbia,'' one sign said. Another placard
said, ``By land or by sea, human or animal killing is still
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of protests focused on the bombing of targets in
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, a campaign mounted to force withdrawal
of Serbian forces from the largely ethnic Albanian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the leaders of the countries who want the war,''
retiree Emert Browning said. ``The thing that bothers me is that we
are spending billions of dollars (on the bombings).''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived at 1:20 p.m., the demonstrators erupted
with the chant ``Stop the bombing now, Bill,'' easily drowning out
the handful of onlookers clapping and cheering in support of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton and his supporters _ including
veterans of Vietnam-era anti-war protests _ defended the NATO
campaign in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims, co-chairman of the luncheon,
spoke of taking his three sons to the Holocaust Museum in
Washington, D.C., which recounts the Nazi extermination of 6
million European Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to have a president who decided that kind of
genocidal activity had to stop,'' said Sims, referring to the
ethnic cleansing in which Kosovo residents have been driven from
their homes and in some cases killed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spoke with China's President Jiang Zemin on his
flight to Seattle, repeated his apologies for last week's
destruction of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a terrible mistake with the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy, and I regret it more than I can say,'' the president said.
Clinton noted, however, that people can see Belgrade bomb damage on
CNN _ while the Serbian atrocities in closed-off Kosovo are ``what
you can't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of an incident in which 15 men allegedly were
roped together and burned alive, and of mass rapes committed
against Albanian women, who then face ostracism in their Muslim
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the promise of the 21st century to be overthrown
by the oldest poison in human existence,'' said Clinton, referring
to ethnic hatreds that have claimed thousands of lives and
dislocated more than a million people in states that formerly made
up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The speech brought tears to the eyes to one listener, Maryann
Tagney Jones of Washington Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking about the fact that they (Serbs) chose to rape
young women because they were Muslim, knowing what that would do to
their lives,'' she said. ``Just the thought of that, the base
brutality, made me cry.''

LONG BEACH STATE SHUTS OUT NO. 1 FULLERTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Snow, Long Beach State's baseball coach, was worried all
week how to get his Dirtbags sufficiently motivated following two
agonizing one-run Big West Conference losses earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   All he had to do, it turned out, was mention the ``F'' word.
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags' Jeff Leuenberger and Jeremy Ward combined to shut
out the No. 1-ranked Cal State Fullerton Titans, 4-0, Friday night
before 1,575 at Titan Field.
</P>
<P>
   It's only the second time in 119 games the Titans have been shut
out, both times by Long Beach State the only times in the long
series the 49ers have blanked Fullerton. Mike Gallo shut out the
Titans, 12-0, in last year's Big West tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Leuenberger, in just his third start, restricted the
heavy-hitting (.349) Titans to just one hit over the first five
innings. He pitched out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the sixth
and allowed just five hits a season low for Fullerton before
leaving after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ward pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, 49er coach Dave Snow became the Big West's
all-time winningest coach. It was Snow's 188th conference victory,
one more than Fresno State's Bob Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeme Leal slugged his 20th home run, a two-run blow in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton's Adam Johnson (9-3) absorbed the loss, his second
this season against Long Beach State, and his first in seven
decisions at home despite striking out 11 in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags are 31-20, 18-10 in Big West play. Fullerton, which
clinched its 17th Big West crown last weekend, is 43-10, 24-4.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struggled with his control early on, issuing two walks
and hitting a batter, Leal, in the first two innings. He was wild
again in the third inning, and this time it cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Redfox started the third by reaching first on a fielding
error by third baseman Ryan Owens. Johnson struck out A.J.
LaBarbera, but Chris Wright singled to center and Terrmel Sledge
walked, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then hit Leal a second time, forcing home Redfox. It was
the 20th time Leal has been hit this season, and he was hit again
in the ninth. He's only three shy of Bryan Kennedy's school record,
established last season. Remarkably, Leal has been hit by a pitch
more times than he's walked (20).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Dobbs followed with a bloop single to left, that barely
eluded shortstop Murph Norris. Wright scored easily. But Sledge,
who held up until he was certain Norris wouldn't make the catch,
was thrown out at the plate on a strong throw by left fielder
Spencer Oborn.
</P>
<P>
   Leal's two-run homer in the fifth, which followed a leadoff
single by Sledge, jumped the Dirtbags' lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Fullerton, meantime, managed to get only two runners get as far
as second base the first five innings against Leuenberger. But in
the sixth the Titans loaded the bases with one out on two walks and
a single.
</P>
<P>
   Leuenberger escaped by getting pinch hitter Sean Bischofberger
who replaced Chris Beck, a .421 hitter who was hit on the wrist by
a pitch his previous at-bat to foul out, then got Aaron Rifkin to
ground out.

USC'S ZITO STAYS UNBEATEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC ace Barry Zito hardly had his best stuff Friday night, but
he didn't need it to keep the Trojans' slim hopes for the
Pacific-10 Conference title alive at least one more day.
</P>
<P>
   Zito allowed six runs in the first five innings, but with the
Trojans' offense scoring at will he managed to earn the victory as
16th-ranked USC defeated Washington 13-6 in front of 659 at Dedeaux
Field.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Zito (11-2) completed Pac-10 play with a
perfect 8-0 record, the first pitcher to go undefeated in
conference play since USC's Seth Etherton went 10-0 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Zito allowed nine hits in 61/3 innings but had his usual heat,
striking out nine. He has 37 strikeouts in his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (32-22, 16-6) remained two games behind conference
leader Stanford, which defeated host UCLA 8-7 in extra innings
Friday. USC must win its final two games this weekend and the
Cardinal must lose both games for the Trojans to win the Pac-10
title.
</P>
<P>
   USC would win a tiebreaker with the Cardinal if the teams finish
with identical records.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Zito might not earn a decision until the Trojans
broke the game open in the sixth by scoring four runs.
</P>
<P>
   USC held a 7-6 lead when second baseman Dominic Correa hit a
two-run single and third baseman Beau Craig followed with a two-run
homer to right field that gave the Trojans an 11-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's sacrifice fly had given the Trojans their 7-6 lead in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   If there weren't so much at stake in the conference race, the
game might be remembered for the 4-6-3-2 triple play that USC
catcher Eric Munson hit into in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, who also homered, played his first game at catcher since
March 27, when he injured his hand against Washington State. He
demonstrated he had recovered in the second inning when he threw
out a runner attempting to steal third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans took their first lead in the fourth inning, but it
didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded, USC designated hitter Carlos Casillas
singled home a run to give the Trojans a 5-4 lead. Washington
starter Travis Anderson then walked Justin Gemoll to force in
another run and extend USC's lead to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's Nick Stefonick homered in the fifth inning to
trim the margin to 6-5 and the Huskies (31-20, 11-11) tied the game
for the fourth time on Todd Linden's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Zito started off poorly, allowing a two-run homer to Huskies
catcher Dominic Woody in the first inning. It was Woody's 17th home
run, setting a Washington single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   USC cut the lead to 2-1 when Munson homered over the
center-field fence in the second inning. Correa followed with a
double and scored on a fielder's choice by Brad Ticehurst. USC took
the lead when Ticehurst scored on a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies took a 4-3 lead in the third when Bryan Williamson
had an RBI single and scored on Todd Linden's bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   In the same inning, USC tied the game again after Greg Hanoian
doubled and scored on a wild pitch by Anderson.

MARINER EYES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES ON RODRIGUEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This is why Alex Rodriguez is going to cost some lucky
team all that money: Because he is so smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing the last 32 games recovering from knee surgery
and despite feeling nervous about his comeback Friday night,
Rodriguez helped turn a double-play in the first inning on the very
first ball he handled.
</P>
<P>
   Guess watching Derek Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra this past week
made the Mariner shortstop antsy to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kansas City leadoff hitter Carlos Beltran was sliding into
second and heading right toward that leg that Rodriguez knows will
take three more weeks before it's 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was A-Rod, gracefully stepping back out of the way and
looping that sidearm throw to first for the 4-6-3 that felt oh so
good for him and all his adoring fans.
</P>
<P>
   And this, too, is why Alex Rodriguez is going to cost some lucky
team all that money: Because he is the master of the big moment,
almost as much as his superstar counterpart in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not having faced major league pitching in five long
weeks, Rodriguez stood in the batter's box in the bottom of the
first Friday and lifted a 2-0 pitch down and away for an opposite
field home run.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the diving stop he made in the seventh on
Jermaine Dyes' grounder between short and third. Ball in glove,
A-Rod pushed up onto his good knee and got off a throw to get Dye
out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, power, style, confidence. Speed, too, although top speed
may be several weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was thrown out stealing in a strike `em out, throw `em
out double play in the third. But by the sixth, Rodriguez was
already a notch higher on the octane when he ran out a grounder and
wound up on first base, clapping his hands and laughing in relief
that the leg felt so sound.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stole second. Take that, torn medial meniscus!
</P>
<P>
   You know this guy can blow around the bases like he wants to get
to Cooperstown tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But in case you're still wondering if everyone was ecstatic that
Alex Rodriguez is back, consider this scene:
</P>
<P>
   When Rodriguez and his surgically repaired knee stood at short
during batting practice for the first time since the second game of
the season, this is what happened.
</P>
<P>
   First came Jay Buhner. The right fielder wandered over to the
infield and stood next to the latest arrival off the disabled list.
It was the unofficial welcome. It was Buhner's way of noting things
are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Russ Davis, David Segui and Edgar Martinez. They all
but swarmed Rodriguez, making it look like it was going to be
shortstop by committee for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, David Bell joined the party _ everyone joking and
clustered around Rodriguez, who looked at Friday night's comeback
like it was opening day only without spring training.
</P>
<P>
   You bet the Mariners are thrilled to have their 23-year-old
40/40 man back, hitting in front of Ken Griffey and Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   And in the stands, the early arriving boys clamored for
autographs from their favorite player and the girls all screamed at
the ballplayer with the matinee idol looks and a growing list of
Hall of Fame credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners and their fans aren't the only ones interested
in seeing young Alex back at work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are probably taking note of A-Rod's return. The
Mets, too. Maybe even Atlanta or Cleveland, despite the fact that
Rodriguez despises that team because of all the times Cleveland has
beaten the M's.
</P>
<P>
   But this is baseball in the high-rolling '90s. A few teams can
look at A-Rod and wonder how and when to make a bid because the M's
certainly will have to listen.
</P>
<P>
   And the way Jeff Fassero threw gasoline on the fire Friday with
another homer-plagued outing, the Mariners will have to take note
of any interest, if only to be smart, because by now they know they
are beyond desperate for pitching.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more than a handful of Mariner players were willing to
speculate that scouts from one or more of the big-money, big-time
teams might find their way to the Kingdome soon to watch Rodriguez,
just to get a glimpse of what their futures might hold, because the
M's will have to do something, one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets can afford to dream of having Rodriguez in their
lineup, batting in front of Mike Piazza and John Olerud. Meanwhile,
money is no object for anyone Rupert Murdoch wants to dress in
Dodger blue.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that is getting ahead of the game. For now, young
Alex belongs to the M's and the good citizens of Marinerville.
</P>
<P>
   The M's say it would be heresy for Rodriguez to never set foot
in the new stadium, even as monied teams like the Mets and Dodgers
might already be looking into a trade.
</P>
<P>
   For now, and through this season, A-Rod's place is with Griffey
and Martinez, Buhner and Segui.
</P>
<P>
   That much the Mariners have made clear, even when so many other
things seem up in the air, including the longballs the Mariners
shortstop can launch and the offensive numbers Rodriguez will post
in a career where the sky's the limit and the money he will command
will be even loftier.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too bad A-Rod can't throw a slider, too.
</P>

VAUGHN, BELCHER LEAD ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It was the power of the almighty Disney dollar, and it
was on display Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mo Vaughn hitting, Tim Belcher pitching, and just as
general manager Bill Bavasi planned it over his Christmas egg nog,
it was the Angels winning, 8-3 over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels shelled out $90.2 million on those two players over
the winter. Belcher has been slow to deliver returns but stemmed
the tide of an awful April with six quality innings. Vaughn
provided the offense, breaking a scoreless tie with a grand slam in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also had a chance to become the third player in the
majors this season _ and the 12th in major-league history _ to hit
two grand slams in a game when he came up with the bases loaded in
the seventh. But reliever Al Newman balked in a run before he could
deliver a pitch, and Vaughn settled for a two-run single, bringing
his RBI total on the night to six.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's slam, his first as an Angel, was received ecstatically
by the Edison Field crowd of 35,515. But it was Belcher who made
the Angels beam the brightest.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher left before reporters were allowed in the Angels
clubhouse, but Vaughn made sure his slam didn't overshadow the
right-hander's clutch outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest story (Friday night) was Tim Belcher,'' Vaughn
said. ``I'm just glad the guy pitched the way he did. Whoever gets
him the runs... we've all got to do our part. I was happy to help
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Angels manager Terry Collins: ``We got big innings from Tim
and the big hit from Mo. We keep doing that, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays held a lengthy meeting before the game. They
couldn't have been going over how to face Belcher. That's barely a
discussion these days.
</P>
<P>
   He throws a fastball? Hit it. He throws a change? Hit it. He
misses over the plate? Hit it hard.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher entered with an ERA of 9.89. He had allowed at least
five runs in six of seven starts and had survived past the sixth
inning just once. Left-handers were hitting .427 against him, and
the Devil Rays' lefty-laden lineup was 16-12 against right-handed
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Not a good omen.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash had gotten so bad, Collins was forced to defend
himself on the street for sticking with Belcher in the rotation. He
couldn't sit down to breakfast at an Anaheim coffee shop without
hearing at least one snide remark from an adjacent table.
</P>
<P>
   Collins won't need to defend Belcher when he goes for his
morning latte today. Belcher's outing said enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's hit was huge for us. It got us on the board,'' Collins
said. ``But the night belonged to Tim Belcher. He hit his spots and
pitched a heck of a game. He needed it and we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has typically come unglued in fifth innings. But he
emerged unscathed for once, again getting help from Troy Glaus.
Aaron Ledesma led off with a rocket that a diving Glaus stabbed on
the short-hop. Belcher then struck out Kevin Stocker and got
Quinton McCracken to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (2-3) took a one-hitter into the seventh, extending the
scoreless streak by Angels pitchers to 25 consecutive innings. The
streak _ and Belcher's day _ ended after he gave up a Paul Sorrento
single and a two-run homer to John Flaherty that skipped off the
top of the short fence down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's final tally: six innings, three hits, two runs, four
strikeouts, four walks. At long last, a quality start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets madder at themselves than Tim Belcher,'' Collins
said. ``So you know he was taking it hard. Now he knows that it
won't last forever. He's going to start giving us some good
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' injury-depleted offense didn't get a baserunner
until the third inning and didn't get a hit off Devil Rays starter
Bobby Witt (3-1) until the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Witt ran into trouble in the sixth, when Andy Sheets and
Darin Erstad hit consecutive singles, then Randy Velarde walked to
load the bases for Vaughn. Vaughn unloaded them with his seventh
homer of the season, a 408-foot low liner that cleared the
right-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vaughn's eighth career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean we celebrate,'' said Vaughn, in the
aftermath of the Angels' fourth consecutive victory. ``Momentum
doesn't last if you don't try to maintain it.''

MICHELS RALLIES TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE _ Rip Michels did his best Alex Zanardi impression
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Michels, like Zanardi did so often in winning the last two CART
titles, roared from the back and finished with a victory and donuts
at Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Starting fifth in the Grand American 30-lap main event, Michels
passed Thousand Oaks' Larry Kreiger for the lead midway through the
race and then used a lapped car to pull away. He put circular tire
marks across the finish line with three donuts, just like Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just putting old tires down,'' said Michels. ``I hadn't
thought about it until I just did it. We're racing new tires next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   After the donuts, Michels got out of his car, took off his
helmet and raised both hands triumphantly, drawing the largest
cheer of the night from the 2,247 in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better not charge me,'' Michels said of the paint that
will have to be added to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Gerritt Cromsigt of Pine Mountain won the 40-lap main
event in Late Model and La Verne's Scott Porter celebrated his 30th
birthday by winning the 20-lap Mini Stock feature race.
</P>
<P>
   Michels took the lead on lap 16 from Kreiger. A spin by Aaron
Staudinger brought out the caution on lap 25, just after Michels
had lapped Scott Bartels. Michels then used Bartels as a blocker to
pull away on the restart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when they put the lapped car between us that the race
was over,'' said Kreiger. ``What could I do? Rip was running really
fast and he used his experience, and luck, to get by that car right
at the yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Kreiger said the car was perfect during qualifying he was less
than a tenth of a second faster than Michels but it quickly became
loose.
</P>
<P>
   In Late Model, Cromsigt and Dusty McDonald who bettered his own
class track record during qualifying easily pulled away from the
rest of the 13-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Passing lapped traffic on Lap 27, Cromsigt went inside, McDonald
tried to pass Rossell White in the middle and the pair touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never touched, Cromsigt said. ``He kept looking, looking
and looking in his mirror and I wasn't there, Cromsigt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cromsigt said his oil temperature ran high while trailing Canyon
Country resident McDonald, who finished fourth. He would take the
car inside to try and cool it off. He said it is one of the reasons
he was able to pass make the winning pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got in front, it really cooled off, he said. ``It ran
really good.
</P>
<P>
   Rochard Hooper of Palmdale finished second 2.796 seconds behind
Cromsigt.

A-ROD RETURNS FOR ROYAL BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alex Rodriguez needed two hitters to turn a crisp
double play, three pitches to crack an emphatic home run. He was
back after a 32-game layoff, reclaiming what was once his.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the Mariner shortstop could just convince a few of his
teammates to try a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodriguez came off the disabled list in inspired fashion,
Fassero was pushed further into baseball oblivion, largely
responsible for a 12-7 defeat to the Kansas City Royals Friday
night at the Kingdome. Thus a six-game homestand began with a
resounding thud, dropping Seattle to 15-20.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a regular occurrence this season, the veteran
Mariner pitcher didn't have it. Nothing. Nada. Zippo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to figure it out all season long, and nothing has
worked at all,'' the lefty said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (1-5) couldn't get through the fifth inning, the third
time that's happened in 1999. He served up a season-high 11 hits
and seven runs, one shy of his worst effort. A pair of unsung
Carloses, Beltran and Febles, each tagged him for a pair of
doubles. Equally unassuming Mike Sweeney slugged his first career
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere to be found is the Fassero of two previous seasons, the
guy who won 30 games, including a playoff matchup at Baltimore. Or
the Fassero the Mariners traded for, a 28-game winner his last two
seasons with the lowly Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hit around,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``I really
don't have any answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero couldn't pinpoint his troubles either, other than to say
it's not velocity. Batters are hitting good pitches as well as the
bad.
</P>
<P>
   He's given up five runs in all but two of his nine starts. Even
in his lone victory over Cleveland last week, he served up nine
hits and five runs in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Royals, he gave up homers to Sweeney and former
Mariner Chad Kreuter, giving Fassero a major league-high 15.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he's sure of, Fassero has never endured a stretch like
this in his eight seasons at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had one this bad that I can remember,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner relievers Brett Hinchliffe and Eric Weaver didn't fare
much better than the first man on the hill. The Royals collectively
punched out a season-high 19 hits against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the pitchers,'' Piniella said. ``I hurt for
them. But I can't pitch for them. They've got to get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner pitching wasn't there Friday night, but the
shortstop was.
</P>
<P>
   Mention of Rodriguez's name over the public address system drew
loud cheers from the 25,445 in attendance. For his first time
at-bat, he was greeted by the theme song from the old sitcom
``Welcome back, Kotter.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned late Thursday night after a three-day rehab
assignment at the Mariners' training complex in Peoria, Ariz. He
went 11-for-20 in three contests that allowed him excess at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he recognized any of the pitchers on his rehab,
Rodriguez told reporters, ``I didn't know any of them. It was
probably one of your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Rodriguez said he was going to pretend it was
Opening Night. Other than that, he was unsure what to expect.
Arthroscopic knee surgery no doubt had robbed him of speed and
explosiveness. The bat and glove might be there, but stolen bases
definitely were out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new beginning for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I can't tell
you how happy I am to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   He was two-for-three on pregame forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez reached base his first four times up, homering to
right, singling to center, walking and capitalizing on a fielding
error.
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Rodriguez twice polished off double plays,
standing tough on aggressive slides to rifle relay throws. He also
dove to his right to spear a seventh-inning grounder hit by
Jermaine Dye and throw him out from a kneeling position.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also stole a base, though it took him two tries.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he was put in motion on double-steal attempts, drawing the
throw each time, but at different bases. He got tagged out at third
base in the third inning, but beat the ball to second in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Before the contest, Piniella said this of his supposedly rusty
shortstop: ``We'll bring him along as slowly as possible. He might
need a day off here and there. He'll probably feel his way for a
week or two.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant minutes.

<P>
   ISRAEL-ELECTION-ARABS (Cairo) _ With just days to go before the
Israeli election, the Arab world is watching with a pretense of
neutrality, although Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, is plainly
the favorite. The apparent reason for the caution is concern that
overt Arab cheerleading for Barak or criticism of the current prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, could backfire. By Douglas Jehl.

   U.S.-CHINA (Washington) _ The Clinton administration, which once

generation. By Roger Cohen.

   TURKEY-KURDS (Diyarbakir, Turkey) _ The Turkish government says

that the opposite may be true. By Stephen Kinzer.

<P>
   VIETNAM-AGENT-ORANGE (Ho Chi Minh City) _ Officials here are
convinced that tens of thousands of deformed children of war
veterans and exposed civilians are the victims of the herbicide
Agent Orange, used by the United States during the war to deprive
its enemy of forest cover and food crops. But Vietnam's scientific
studies have been sketchy and its evidence is often anecdotal.
Until there is firm proof that chemical herbicides are to blame,
the United States says it cannot take responsibility. By Seth
Mydans.

Larry Rohter.

   DRUG-TRIALS (Undated) _ Once clinical research was a staid
enterprise primarily administered by academic researchers driven by
a desire for knowledge, fame or career advancement. Now, it is a
multibillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of testing and drug
companies working with thousands of private doctors. And in this
new industry, patients have become commodities. By Kurt Eichenwald

   U.S.-CHINA-SCIENTISTS (Undated) _ Many Chinese scientists and
engineers in the United States fear that they are being unfairly
tarnished and their careers threatened by charges against another

of America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88, and providing
it to China. By Fox Butterfield and Joseph Kahn.

<P>
   DENVER-GOATS (Denver) _ A sign at Babi Yar Park here says it
all: ``Goats at Work.'' The herd of about 100 Cashmere goats that
has been munching at the park since April is working for the city
of Denver this year as part of a program to fight invasive weeds
that have taken over native plants and wildlife habitats in the
park's natural areas. By Mindy Sink.

   N.C.-TRAFFIC (Research Triangle Park, N.C.) _ The traffic
problem is so worrisome here that top executives of Glaxo Wellcome

But any potential solution appears to face a dim future in the
state Legislature. By David J. Morrow.

   WRESTLERS-POLITICS (Glastonbury, Conn.) _ When Bob Backlund hits
the campaign trail as a Republican candidate for Congress in
greater Hartford, he is not asked about school vouchers or abortion
or Kosovo, but about the ``cross-face chicken wing.'' Backlund, the
inventor of the chicken-wing move and a champion of the World
Wrestling Federation, is leading a parade of professional wrestlers
who are turning to politics, hoping to duplicate last fall's upset
victory by Jesse Ventura, formerly ``the Body'' of the WWF and now
the governor of Minnesota. By Mike Allen.

Johnston.

   PENN-STATION (New York) _ Beaux-Arts on the rebound? No. A great
act of civic vandalism undone? That was never in the cards. But if
you can set such golden platitudes aside, you may begin to

the historic James A. Farley Building, the old general post office
on Eighth Avenue between 31st and 33rd streets, into a future home

DESPITE ITS APPEAL FOR KIDS, `STAR WARS' MOVIES' BODY COUNT
ALARMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- On the surface, the new ``Star Wars'' movie,
``The Phantom Menace,'' is no ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fantasy for children that, through three earlier films as
well as the new prequel that comes out Wednesday, has avoided
graphic gore even in its scariest moments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you want to bash movies for desensitizing children to
violence in an age when kids massacre kids in our schools, like
they did in Littleton, Colo., a month ago, ``Star Wars'' may be a
starting point.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of body count, the original 1977 space opera was the
most violent movie of its era.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, an entire, heavily populated planet was vaporized just
to demonstrate the Death Star's destructive capacity. The Death
Star itself, which was the size of a city with equivalent
habitation, was blown to bits as well.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its pseudo-spirituality and philosophical
pretensions, the central ethic of ``Star Wars'' is point and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional lightsaber duel, laser-gun exchanges
and outer-space dogfights are the series' main methods for solving
problems.
</P>
<P>
   More than any film before or since, ``Star Wars'' glorified the
video game aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   The object was to knock out as many enemy targets _ TIE fighters
or stormtroopers _ as possible, without a thought for the sentient,
presumably soul-bearing entity inside that spaceship or white
plastic armor. Indeed, the stormtrooper uniform was specially
designed to obscure the wearer's face, the better to turn them into
dehumanized action figures rather than real men who felt real pain.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker George Lucas can hardly be accused of creating
anything like the brutal cinematic excesses that have punctuated
American cinema throughout the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But he is nonetheless well aware of his science fiction saga's
fundamental violence ... and by his way of thinking, is responsible
about how he presents it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that the key issue about violence in the media
is the context in which it's portrayed,'' the 55-year-old filmmaker
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a violent world and we always will live in a
violent world. Life is violent, and to deny that would be almost as
dangerous as glorifying it and making it an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has to do more with the context. I definitely think
that hurting people for fun, for enjoyment, is the central issue
here.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be an accident of history that ``Star Wars'' appeared at
about the same time that playing video games became a popular
childhood pastime. But it doesn't seem all that coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lucas' movies, games have a simultaneously interactive and
detached quality; you're more engaged with objects on the screen on
a sensory level but less empathetically than you would be with
fully fleshed-out movie characters.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make them easier to destroy without considering
consequences? The psychiatric jury is still out on that one, but
one thing's more certain: The four new video games that are being
spun off of ``Phantom Menace'' are expected to be monster hits.
</P>
<P>
   And let's face it: The series is called ``Star Wars'' for a
reason, and not because the less aggressive-sounding ``Star Trek''
was already taken. Creator Lucas also named its essential energy
the Force; not the, well, Energy, or the Spirit or the Stuff or
even something as comparatively neutral as the Power.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Star Wars'' didn't start any of this.
</P>
<P>
   Violent movies have been as much a fixture on the American
landscape as violence itself for nearly a century now. The first
real narrative film, 1903's ``The Great Train Robbery,'' climaxed
with an outlaw firing a gun straight out of the screen at the
audience (some of whom, mostly in Western theaters, reportedly shot
back at the then-shocking image). Hollywood has demonized and
dispatched countless Indians, gangsters, Axis soldiers and other
enemies in the decades since then. There were even a couple of
worlds destroyed in cheesy '50s sci-fi movies.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of those years, even the most detached, sanitized
killings were usually done in a man-to-man, face-to-face manner.
There was almost always an opportunity, however faked or fleeting,
to see and share a dying man's agony.

LOS ANGELES:dying man's agony.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the decade before ``Star Wars'' appeared, the violence in
movies became much more graphic and shocking than ever before (and
certainly more so than in anything Lucas has imagined since).
</P>
<P>
   But directors in that mid-'60s-to-mid-'70s period, such as Sam
Peckinpah (``The Wild Bunch,'' ``Straw Dogs''), Stanley Kubrick
(``A Clockwork Orange''), Francis Ford Coppola (The ``Godfather''
saga) and Martin Scorsese (``Taxi Driver'') weren't just pushing
the envelope to see how much they could get away with. They were
exploring the nature and meaning of violence, trying to figure out
why it was still such a fundamental part of human behavior at our
supposedly advanced stage of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Their movies, however outrageous they might have gotten, were
all about the ugliness and consequences of violence. Following the
unprecedented popular success of ``Star Wars,'' however, filmmakers
started using violence as something to be enjoyed for its
excitement, shock and fantasy value.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas believes there must be more to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight for freedom, you have to sometimes fight for
your rights, you have to fight for self-defense and you have to
stand up for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, to torture other people, to make them
feel bad, to belittle them. ... Whether you're simply being
impolite and have bad manners or are making fun of somebody just
because it's a fun thing to do or whether you're getting guns and
bombs out and trying to kill people, it ultimately is the same kind
of mean-spiritedness.''
</P>
<P>
   An even knottier contradiction lies in the distinction between
rationalized and sadistic violence. Were the teen-age killers in
Columbine High School simply out to torment and murder their
victims, or did they feel they were taking righteous vengeance on
people who had hurt and oppressed them? Once you've taken the step
toward acting out violence, do such fine distinctions really
matter?
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson, who has done his share of '90s-style action
blasts (``Die Hard With a Vengeance,'' ``The Long Kiss
Goodnight''), portrayed a hit man on the verge of a spiritual
epiphany in the widely misunderstood, influential and decried
``Pulp Fiction'' and a wise Jedi Council member in the new ``Star
Wars'' prequel _ who, significantly, never raises a lightsaber.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly one to be alarmed by any kind of violent filmed
image, Jackson feels that ``Star Wars'' delivers an underlying,
anti-violent message that indeed justifies all the slashing and
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Star Wars' is a pure morality tale, good vs. evil,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can't see that, then fine. George has couched it in
entertainment, chase scenes and things blowing up, but it's
basically about good vs. evil, about how people deal with those two
things and how to overcome things _ and it's not always with
violence. Sometimes it's about having a thought process and
understanding what it is so you can deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' dramatizes the barest handful of human (or
humanoid) deaths. The vast majority of things that get zapped are
battle droids, machines that look like metal ostrich skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic ground battle is fought exclusively between the
droids and amphibian creatures called Gungans, who speak, think and
feel but are noticeably more animal than manlike. This is all quite
calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The droids really are the precursors to the stormtroopers,''
Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the same technique that I've used in all of the
movies. There's obviously an issue in the fact that I've got laser
swords in this one and I only had laser pistols in the other ones.
I was aware of the fact that I wasn't about to cut stormtroopers in
half.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the people-resembling bad guys that Keanu Reeves blows
away in ``The Matrix'' are, according to the film's scenario, just
computer-generated illusions with no more real life implied to them
than ``Phantom's'' larger number of blasted battle droids possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' was criticized as gratuitously ultraviolent.
Critics complain ``The Phantom Menace'' is too juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `The Matrix' comes out on video, I might be able to see
it,'' said an indignant Jake Lloyd, who plays the 9-year-old hero
Anakin Skywalker in ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're 18,'' his mother, Lisa, added without missing a
beat. But by then, Jake and most of his contemporaries will have
seen the new batch of ``Star Wars'' movies over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Lucas is turning out a new generation of violent
teen-agers with the second ``Star Wars'' trilogy is to overhype the
potential.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the hype that's going to make the films must-sees
for kids of all ages, if the influence is there, could it possibly
be stopped?

CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO BE ASKED TO EXPAND DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- Two initiatives that would expand death penalty
provisions will be put before California voters on the March 2000
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment opponents say they will aggressively work
toward defeating both measures, viewing the fight as their first
step toward eliminating state-sanctioned executions in California.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, however, say state voters
overwhelmingly support the death penalty and are likely to embrace
the tougher laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing on the horizon would bring about a change in that
position,'' said Pete Kossoris, senior attorney for the Ventura
County District Attorney's Office, a sponsor of one of the
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   His initiative would amend the penal code to broaden the
circumstances when the death penalty may be sought in murders that
include kidnapping, arson or lying in wait.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was prompted by a Ventura County case in which Diana
Haun was convicted of kidnapping Sherri Dally, a mother of two, and
killing her and leaving her body in a rural area. Evidence showed
that Haun, who was having an affair with the victim's husband,
planned the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Kossoris said Haun was exempted from the death penalty because
of an odd twist in the law: she kidnapped the victim for the
purpose of killing her. If she had abducted the woman for another
reason, she could face execution, Kossoris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would talk to people who said this was absolutely crazy, and
they were absolutely right,'' Kossoris said. ``The law is totally
backward and needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several civil liberties groups have gone on record in opposition
to the measure. The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the
death penalty in all circumstances, charging that execution is a
violation of the U.S. Constitution because it denies equal
protection under the law, is cruel and unusual punishment, and
removes guarantees of due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Birdlebough, legislative advocate for the Friends
Committee on Legislation of California, said the death penalty is
unjust because of the arbitrary way it is applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The O.J. Simpson case is a perfect example,'' Birdlebough
said. ``It was clear he was getting a defense that most defendants
don't get. Two people were killed and no one sought the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   A state analysis of the fiscal impact of the initiative
concluded that it is unclear how much the state's costs would
increase for housing more prisoners and funding more death penalty
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The second initiative on the March ballot would allow
prosecutors to seek the death penalty in a gang-related killing, as
part of a larger juvenile crime measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by former Gov. Pete Wilson, the measure would result
in ``unknown major net costs to the state of at least hundreds of
millions of dollars annually and one-time costs of at least several
hundreds of millions of dollars,'' according to a Legislative
Analyst's Office report.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not address the death penalty provisions
specifically, the report finds that the tougher gang laws would
mean ``gang members staying in prison longer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report notes that the cost of the measure could be
offset somewhat ``from unknown, potential savings to state and
local governments'' because offenders are off the streets.

SACRAMENTO: personally,'' Zimring said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the end of the year, law enforcement officials believe that
another man _ Darrell Keith Rich of Redding _ could face execution
for kidnappings, murders and sexual offenses against several young
women in Northern California in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of two other cases that
have been argued in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the
last legal venues for condemned prisoners, said Dane Gillette,
senior assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony Jackson of Los Angeles fatally shot a police
officer in the head in West Covina in 1983. Demetrie Ladon Mayfield
of San Bernardino killed a man and woman in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year, we are going to see a substantially
larger number of cases going to the 9th Circuit,'' Gillette said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis clearly voiced support for the death penalty during his
campaign for governor, breaking ranks with some of his fellow
Democrats. Davis flatly stated his belief that people convicted of
murder should serve, at minimum, a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the governor's hard-line approach has come as somewhat of
a surprise to capital punishment critics, Birdlebough said. Many
hoped that a Democratic governor would impose a bigger shift in
policy following 16 years of Republicans in the Governor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   In his first months at the helm, Davis ignored an invitation to
meet with religious leaders to discuss his process for evaluating
clemency appeals. And he did not withdraw any of predecessor Pete
Wilson's unconfirmed appointments to the Board of Prison Terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are realizing that the governor wasn't
kidding,'' Birdlebough said. Capital punishment opponents hoped
that Davis would at least look closely at the issue, but ``we now
see he's not interested in putting his own stamp on the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Davis has supported an initiative that would expand the
types of murders that would carry death penalty sentences,
including those with kidnapping, arson and lying in wait as
extenuating circumstances. The measure will appear on the March
2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Kossoris, senior attorney for the Ventura County District
Attorney's Office, who helped draft the initiative, applauds the
governor's position on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   California residents overwhelmingly support the death penalty _
polls show approval rates of between 75 percent and 80 percent _
and the governor is wise to uphold their wishes, Kossoris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to Davis' credit that his actions support his public
stance that he believes in capital punishment and will not coddle
criminals,'' Kossoris said. ``He made the right decision on the two
clemency cases; they weren't even borderline. It's about time that
people start taking responsibility for what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kossoris said his biggest fear is that Davis will be pressured
by other Democrats to appoint liberal judges who could overturn
death penalty convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Birdlebough said it had been the practice of governors to
commute about one-third of all clemency requests. But Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, who was elected in 1982 on a tough-on-crime
platform, changed that pattern. He was followed in 1990 by another
member of the GOP, Wilson, whose aspirations for the presidency,
according to his critics, prevented him from going against public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Because politics is intertwined with the death penalty, said
Birdlebough, opponents will launch an intensive lobbying effort to
defeat two capital punishment measures on the March ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis may not be swayed, but it's essential in getting any
change to have the public wake up,'' Birdlebough said.

CALIFORNIA FACES SKYROCKET EXECUTION RATE AS APPEALS COME TO CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- California is on the verge of an explosion of
state-sanctioned executions, with 523 people on Death Row, a dozen
cases running out of appeals and a hard-line governor in the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, two men have been put to death under Gov.
Gray Davis' watch in a state that has seen only five other
executions since 1978, when capital punishment was reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters of the death penalty say the death penalty
reflects the public's no-nonsense attitude on crime, foes of
capital punishment are increasingly troubled by estimates that as
many as a dozen condemned prisoners are nearing the end of their
appeals. Davis has given no indication he will soften his attitude
and grant clemency except in unusual circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the crime rate continues to fall and the governor
doesn't have to carry around his load of being a serial killer,''
said Steve Birdlebough, legislative advocate for the Friends
Committee on Legislation, a group opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the governor is successful in plans to raise the
bar for people through education and is not just relying on
punishment and retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, the governor's spokesman, said Davis makes
no apologies for being a supporter of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is who he is and what he believes,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has carefully reviewed the two death penalty cases to come
before him, and found they did not merit clemency, Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something he looks forward to, but it's something
that comes with the job,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Babbitt, a Purple Heart recipient with a history of
mental illness who was convicted of murdering an elderly woman in
1980, was executed May 4 despite pleas from thousands of military
veterans to spare his life. The situation was a delicate one for
Davis, who during his gubernatorial campaign repeatedly highlighted
his own service in the U.S. Army in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Babbit was executed three months after Jaturun Siripongs, a Thai
Buddhist priest, was put to death on Feb. 9 for a 1981 double
murder. It was argued that at the time of his arrest he was not
advised of his rights to consult with officials from his country
and was not given fair representation by his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts and political observers say Davis had no other
choice politically but to deny clemency in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it was a case of factual innocence, it wouldn't have
mattered much at all,'' said Franklin Zimring, a professor of law
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst, said Davis had to
establish his law-and-order credentials and couldn't risk the
backlash suffered by other politicians who were viewed as soft on
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politically astute thing for the governor to do right out
of the box is to confirm his credibility as a supporter of the
death penalty,'' Jeffe said. ``If Manny Babbitt had been the fourth
or fifth person to come before Davis, he may well have had a chance
for his sentence to be commuted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, the governor's spokesman, said to claim that Davis'
decisions on clemency have been steered by politics was ``utter
folly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an issue of politics; it's an issue of law,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimring, however, said clemency is what happens ``after legal
actions have ended'' and is an act of mercy triggered by personal
belief and, often, by political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   He said it will not be politically feasible for the governor to
commute a death sentence for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of telling the next few guys up for clemency
that they shouldn't take it personally,'' Zimring said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ During a bitter, protracted election campaign,
Israelis have grown weary of the way the candidates advocate unity,
yet underscore the many divisions in this small, complex society.
</P>
<P>
   This race, like many Israeli elections, has brought out the
blood passions in a country that sometimes operates like a large
extended family, complicated by intense sibling rivalries,
intermarriage and generational disputes.
</P>
<P>
   There were routine cries of ``traitor'' as political mates
jumped ship, and nasty name-calling battles between Jewish
immigrants of different national origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a time of healing, that's for sure,'' said
Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist and fellow at the Israel
Democracy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Israelis finally vote on Monday, choosing between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his key rival, Ehud Barak, many
will do so with the expectation that a coalition government will
eventually be forged _ perhaps even one that joins the major
parties these two men represent.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a race is one thing, after all, and governing Israel is
another.
</P>
<P>
   For the new government will face not only a stagnant economy and
roiling social tensions, especially between secular and religious
Jews, but also difficult, potentially destabilizing, diplomatic
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israelis cast two ballots. One is for prime minister,
the other for parliament, in which 33 parties are competing for 120
seats. The leading candidate for prime minister must win more than
50 percent of the votes to avoid a runoff election on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Barak, the Labor Party leader, was ahead in the polls
by a substantial margin over Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader, in
what has been a five-way race. Barak, a highly decorated former
general who is running at the head of the One Israel coalition, has
been gaining ground so steadily that it seems probable he will
capture more votes than Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the elections, then, the key question is not whether
Barak will lead on Monday, but whether he will win outright,
eliminating the need for an unprecedented, costly second round.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure mounted late last week on three minor-party candidates
to withdraw from the race. Asmi Bishara, an Israeli-Arab candidate,
seemed most likely to do so, and polls indicated that this would
push Barak very close to a win.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli electorate is unpredictable, which is why many
repeatedly cite a local political adage: Israelis tell the truth to
the pollsters but lie at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   To Netanyahu's disadvantage, furthermore, Israelis are also
impatient, traditionally unwilling to give their leaders a second
chance. Since Menachem Begin won re-election to a second term in
1981, no incumbent prime minister has ever won re-election
outright. There were some draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most countries, holding power confers a clear advantage,
worth some 5 to 10 percentage points, to whoever has it,'' said
Nachum Barnea, a leading political columnist. ``In Israel, holding
power is an electoral liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu's conservative coalition dissolved prematurely
in December, the country has been in a state of suspended
animation. The Israeli-Palestinian peace effort has been frozen,
and important social and economic decisions have been deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyhau has continued to lead the country while fighting an
uphill battle for his re-election. He has been running Israel at
the same time as his supposed flaws have been dissected daily on
the public stage.
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, it has been an uncomfortable, dispiriting
dynamic. The election race has turned into a referendum on the
polarizing personality of their prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running on the issues, but they are running against my
character,'' Netanyahu said in an April interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis say they do not see a big difference between the
two leading candidates _ both raised in elite Ashkenazi families,
both secular Jews, both educated in the United States, both
fighters in the same elite army unit at a critical time in Israeli
history, and both headstrong, ambitious men.
</P>
<P>
   And both men are leaning toward the political center that most
Israelis occupy. Barak, a former army chief of staff, does so from
a leftist party, and Netanyahu from a rightist one.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they support continuing the Israeli-Palestinian peace
effort from a point of pragmatism, as does Yitzhak Mordechai, the
former defense minister and Center Party leader, who is also
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering all three because I can't tell them apart,''
Yarden Ben Harush, 24, an education student in Beersheva, said .
``It's all a blur. The class I go to, we're 120 young people, and
we all feel that same way.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, stunning the country's political establishment,
Netanyahu won election by a mere 30,000 votes, or 1 percent, over
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader. It was a tense time.
</P>
<P>
   The country had not yet begun to recover from the assassination
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Peres' predecessor as the Labor
Party leader, by an extremist religious Jew. Israel was enduring a
spate of Palestinian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was the first prime minister elected directly in a
separate ballot. Until 1996, Israelis cast only one vote, for their
party, and the party's leader ran the government.
</P>
<P>
   To stitch together a majority government, he built a coalition
of unlikely bedfellows: Sephardic Jews, Russian immigrants,
ultra-Orthodox Jews and Jewish settlers from the West Bank. He
linked them together by appealing to their shared feeling that they
were shut outside the gates of power by the Ashkenazi elite.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping them together was another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the direct election system, one political personality
needs to embody all the different parts of the Israeli political
soul,'' Ezrahi, the political scientist, said. ``In order to
function well, he has to be ambiguous, or he risks his own
downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   That is partly what happened to Netanyahu. He led his
conservative Likud Party to betray its founding principle when it
decided last fall to support territorial concessions to the
Palestinians. Approaching the American-brokered peace negotiations
slowly, cautiously and with a blustery and suspicious attitude
toward the Palestinians, he brought many Israelis into the peace
camp.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, he alienated his far-right supporters. And to
win them back, he distanced himself from his own accomplishment. He
declared the Palestinians to be violating their obligations, and,
in defiance of the American government, suspended Israeli
compliance with the most recent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, Netanyahu managed to antagonize
personally many of his followers and his political associates. And
by the end, although close associates believe him to be a highly
principled man, he had led many Israelis to believe the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, Netanyahu had received no endorsement from his
trade minister, Natan Sharansky, and did not expect one.
Sharansky's constituency, Russian immigrants, is considered the
only large bloc of swing votes. Barak has courted them furiously,
making steady inroads, and the latest polls showed the two
candidates splitting the Russian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has run a professional campaign, with little opposition
from within his own coalition, making few mistakes. Netanyahu, on
the other hand, has feuded with his associates in Likud, and may
have miscalculated what would appeal to his voters, repeating the
themes of his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this election race without two leading Sephardic
politicians by his side: David Levy, his former foreign minister,
who has joined forces with Barak, and Mordechai, his former defense
minister, who is running against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, whose persistence in the race represents the surest
obstacle to an outright victory by Barak, has played a pivotal
role. While his now doomed candidacy has been a somewhat quixotic
affair, Mordechai has served as a steppingstone.
</P>
<P>
   He has given die-hard Likudniks a way to walk away from the
party they were practically born into without betraying their
identities by going straight to the left. Now, however, many are
abandoning him for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Netanyahu's party say that their goal is to
survive the first round, assuming that Netanyahu will fare better
in a one-on-one runoff. If a solid center-left majority wins
control of the parliament on Monday, it could galvanize swing
voters to return to Netanyahu. And the prime minister is presumed
to be the master of focused political combat.
</P>
<P>
   But many Israelis, even some who do not back Barak, are hoping
that the race ends Monday. They anticipate that whoever wins will
need to form some kind of coalition government, given that as many
as 20 parties could be elected to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And they want the country to start moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   What is on the immediate horizon are critical negotiations with
the Palestinians and the Syrians that will help define Israel's
size, its place in the Mideast and its identity as a secure or
threatened state _ a country at war or at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in front of us one of the most critical years in Israeli
history,'' Barak said in an interview.

Sharansky's constituency, Russian immigrants, is considered the
only large bloc of swing votes. Barak has courted them furiously,
making steady inroads, and the latest polls showed the two
candidates splitting the Russian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has run a professional campaign, with little opposition
from within his own coalition, making few mistakes. Netanyahu, on
the other hand, has feuded with his associates in Likud, and may
have miscalculated what would appeal to his voters, repeating the
themes of his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this election race without two leading Sephardic
politicians by his side: David Levy, his former foreign minister,
who has joined forces with Barak, and Mordechai, his former defense
minister, who is running against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, whose persistence in the race represents the surest
obstacle to an outright victory by Barak, has played a pivotal
role. While his now doomed candidacy has been a somewhat quixotic
affair, Mordechai has served as a steppingstone.
</P>
<P>
   He has given die-hard Likudniks a way to walk away from the
party they were practically born into without betraying their
identities by going straight to the left. Now, however, many are
abandoning him for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Netanyahu's party say that their goal is to
survive the first round, assuming that Netanyahu will fare better
in a one-on-one runoff. If a solid center-left majority wins
control of the parliament on Monday, it could galvanize swing
voters to return to Netanyahu. And the prime minister is presumed
to be the master of focused political combat.
</P>
<P>
   But many Israelis, even some who do not back Barak, are hoping
that the race ends Monday. They anticipate that whoever wins will
need to form some kind of coalition government, given that as many
as 20 parties could be elected to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And they want the country to start moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   What is on the immediate horizon are critical negotiations with
the Palestinians and the Syrians that will help define Israel's
size, its place in the Mideast and its identity as a secure or
threatened state _ a country at war or at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in front of us one of the most critical years in Israeli
history,'' Barak said in an interview.

   About 35,000 feet above the Great Plains late last year, Diane
Samples and her husband, Mark Snyder, noticed that their
2{-year-old son, Jacob, was engrossed in ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' the
movie on the overhead video screen a few feet from their seats.
Jacob, even without headphones, was giving the blow-'em-up,
shoot-'em-down thriller an enthusiastic thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified,'' said Ms. Samples, a computer-industry
marketing executive from New Fairfield, Conn. ``Airplane screens
are right in your face. Our son doesn't even watch television, let
alone movies like that. He'd never before seen so much as a
fistfight. We tried everything we could to distract him, but really
_ on an airplane you're a captive audience crammed into a tight
space with nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After the high school shootings last month in Littleton, Colo.,
and the ensuing debate over media violence, Ms. Samples began
forming a network of parents and educators to persuade airlines
that young children should not be casually exposed to lurid movie
imagery of guns, bombs and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere in society, parents are told they have a choice,''
she said. ``Change the channel, don't buy the kid the record or the
movie ticket or the video game. The idea of choice is the
entertainment industry's paramount defense against censorship. But
on an airplane, you have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For months after her ``Lethal Weapon 4'' incident, Ms. Samples
called airline officials to discuss her concerns, and she said she
was met with a list of boiler-plate responses: In-flight movies are
always edited _ at a minimum to standards used by broadcast
television. It's impossible to please everyone. Surveys show that
the weary business travelers who pay the top fares demand the
latest hit movies, including action-thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't seem to hear what I was saying,'' Ms. Samples
said. ``The airlines don't seem to be interested in talking about
guidelines for excessively violent films _ the kind where if you
edited the violence out, you'd have no movie left to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials say violent movies are not very common, though
a survey of the top in-flight rentals from 1991 to 1997 showed that
about one-third were action-adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genres that work best are light adventure, comedy and
particularly romantic comedy,'' said Rob Brookler, a spokesman for
the World Airline Entertainment Association, a trade group that
represents more than 100 major airlines. ```You've Got Mail,' now
that was the perfect in-flight movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do consider that there are children, not to mention a
broader variety of people and cultural attitudes,'' Brookler added.
``The northern Europeans are very forgiving of adult sex matter but
are very sensitive to violence, whereas in the Mideast and the
East, they're more sensitive to adult matter and less to
violence.'' As a result, extra edits are made in some regions to
avoid giving offense.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, he said, also have to deal with temperamental
directors and producers who say, ``Whoa, you're not going to cut
that scene just to show it on an airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are extra vigilant in editing out at least one kind of
movie violence: airplane crashes. ``Don't forget, you are in fact
flying through the air when you're watching the movie,'' Brookler
said. ``A certain number of people are fearful about flying, and in
a confined space you really don't want to excite that fear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The airline industry isn't the only one to edit movies for
travelers. ``Titanic'' was a big hit on airplanes, but most cruise
lines declined to show it. Airlines showed ``Lethal Weapon 4,''
which has a scene of a speeding freight train smashing into a car.
But Amtrak frowns on train wrecks in movies shown in lounge cars on
some long-haul trips, said Rick Remington, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 thriller ``Speed,'' about a hijacked runaway bus, was
the second-most-popular in-flight movie that year (after the comedy
``Mrs. Doubtfire''), according to the airline entertainment
association. But airline passengers who saw it missed one of the
most spectacular scenes, in which the bus plows into a taxiing
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry spent $1.7 billion last year on high-tech
equipment like individual in-seat video screens, now available in
many first-class and business-class cabins and on some
international flights, which allow passengers to choose from a
variety of films and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, the airlines expect to have in-seat video
screens in nearly all first- and business-class cabins, and in
about 75 percent of all coach seats for international flights. But
the industry is less certain about when this expensive technology
will turn up in coach seats on domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the basic issue unaddressed for most coach
travelers. ``The airlines keep saying that their surveys show
business travelers like these kinds of movies,'' said Ms. Samples,
who calls her new group Parents Against Violent Airline
Entertainment. ``But ask the right questions and the business
traveler who never thought of this before might say: `Oh, that's a
good idea. I will gladly give up my right to see ``Die Hard'' or
``Lethal Weapon'' on an airplane. I have kids myself.'''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a moment in David Hare's ``Via Dolorosa''
when it becomes clear that the playwright's personal meditation on
Israel's emotional state also expresses something that is happening
in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a painting, a painting of a starving man?'' Hare says,
replaying his reactions to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem. ``What is a painting of a corpse? It's the facts we
want! Give us the facts!''
</P>
<P>
   It's the facts Americans are getting, more and more, not only in
traditional places like newspapers and television but also in the
arts _ ``a kind of headlong rush toward more and more reality,''
says Mark Rosenthal, curator of 20th-century art at the Guggenheim
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Via Dolorosa,'' Hare himself holds forth for 90 minutes on
his encounters with men and women on all sides of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Unaided by scenery or props,
literally acting on his interviews and notes, he is the protagonist
in his own drama.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote:
``Nothing Mr. Hare has done before prepares you for `Via Dolorosa'
and its discoveries, including the demonstrated fact that he can be
such seriously invigorating company. But, then, there are no exact
precedents for what he is doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Deavere Smith's two theater successes, ``Fires in the
Mirror'' and ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' were also based on
her reports of real-life events. But unlike Hare, she portrays the
people she incorporates into her work. ``Via Dolorosa'' is strictly
the theater of the observed, Broadway's answer to the memoir,
publishing's hottest genre.
</P>
<P>
   In the musical theater, ``The Civil War'' lays claim to what is
arguably the first score based entirely on authentic historical
documents, letters and newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   Documentary films are proliferating, particularly in cable
television, says Michelle Satter, founding director of the feature
film program at the Sundance Festival. So are network television
news magazines like ``48 Hours'' and ``20/20'' and real-life action
programs like ``Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the visual arts, even Chaim Soutine, whose slaughterhouse
still lifes seem to drip blood, not paint, could not have foreseen
the visceral reality of Damien Hirst, Britain's
artist-of-the-moment, who saws livestock in half and displays the
carcasses in formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   On view at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Conn.,
is a slightly tamer Hirst installation that displays real
butterflies impaled on house-painted canvases and ashtrays filled
with cigarette butts.
</P>
<P>
   The arts are no longer imitating life. They are appropriating
it. And the reason seems obvious: the sheer scale of current
events, amplified by the 24-hour magnifying mirror of television,
which operates in a continual state of repetition compulsion that
can make even the worst catastrophe feel unreal. In order to react,
jaded audiences need reality in larger, stronger concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the artists respond to that,'' Rosenthal says. ``You could
say it's in the air coming from both directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Or yet another direction. The present surfeit of reality in the
arts could be a response, Hare says, to a surfeit of fiction _ bad
fiction. Today's narratives are too often unreal, he said in a
telephone interview, citing ``these endless films with angels'' and
``films where the hero in the third act encounters the difficulty
in the ninth reel, which he resolves in the tenth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All art forms drift away from reality and become
self-absorbed,'' he adds. ``The revolutionary artist is always the
one who comes along and says: `Hang on! It doesn't look like that!
It doesn't feel like that! On the street that is not what is going
on.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reality has always been popular on the street. Michael Roth,
associate director of the Getty Research Institute for the History
of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles, who is the curator of the
Sigmund Freud exhibition now at the Jewish Museum in New York City,
says it's not just the facts people want but also the genuine
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would line up to see an original document from the
founding years of the United States,'' Roth says. ``But put in a
perfect facsimile that no one can recognize as a facsimile _ if you
tell people it's a facsimile, the lines disappear immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museum goers have an intense desire to be in physical
proximity to original materials that are connected to someone who
interests them,'' Roth says of the exhibition of Freud's
manuscripts, family pictures, favorite antiquities and other
Freudiana.
</P>
<P>
   So it doesn't matter to most visitors to the Jewish Museum that
they can't read either the German language or Freud's handwriting.
These are the real things. Freud's manuscripts, intact, right here,
iconlike, provide contact with him and, says Roth, the immensely
reassuring proof that death does not erase everything.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, the filmed image, is always ``reality once
removed,'' says the photojournalist Steve Lehman, author of ``The
Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive'' (Umbrage Editions, 1998). In art,
as with the news, it could be argued, all reality is virtual. You
are not really there. If you were, it would mean enduring a lot of
dead time, which would be boring, which must be edited out _
unless, as with Andy Warhol, one of your favorite subjects is
boredom itself.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously `Via Dolorosa' is completely artificial,'' Hare says.
``It is as highly wrought as any of my plays. But basically all the
artifice is to disguise itself so you don't feel it's there. You're
attempting to make the artifice like a pane of glass that simply
leads you through to the subject _ not to decorate the bloody
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how real things get, abstraction and fantasy will
endure in art for the simple reason that artists respond to
different subject matter in different ways. Hare, for instance,
wouldn't have dreamed of a nonfiction treatment for ``Amy's View,''
his other current Broadway play, which is about ``questions of the
heart,'' he says. It had to be a work of the imagination, performed
by actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be absolutely horrified to stand up on a stage and
talk about love and all these things,'' he says. ``You know, you do
that through the old methods.''

``films where the hero in the third act encounters the difficulty
in the ninth reel, which he resolves in the tenth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All art forms drift away from reality and become
self-absorbed,'' he adds. ``The revolutionary artist is always the
one who comes along and says: `Hang on! It doesn't look like that!
It doesn't feel like that! On the street that is not what is going
on.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reality has always been popular on the street. Michael Roth,
associate director of the Getty Research Institute for the History
of Art and the Humanities in Los Angeles, who is the curator of the
Sigmund Freud exhibition now at the Jewish Museum in New York City,
says it's not just the facts people want but also the genuine
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would line up to see an original document from the
founding years of the United States,'' Roth says. ``But put in a
perfect facsimile that no one can recognize as a facsimile _ if you
tell people it's a facsimile, the lines disappear immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museum goers have an intense desire to be in physical
proximity to original materials that are connected to someone who
interests them,'' Roth says of the exhibition of Freud's
manuscripts, family pictures, favorite antiquities and other
Freudiana.
</P>
<P>
   So it doesn't matter to most visitors to the Jewish Museum that
they can't read either the German language or Freud's handwriting.
These are the real things. Freud's manuscripts, intact, right here,
iconlike, provide contact with him and, says Roth, the immensely
reassuring proof that death does not erase everything.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, the filmed image, is always ``reality once
removed,'' says the photojournalist Steve Lehman, author of ``The
Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive'' (Umbrage Editions, 1998). In art,
as with the news, it could be argued, all reality is virtual. You
are not really there. If you were, it would mean enduring a lot of
dead time, which would be boring, which must be edited out _
unless, as with Andy Warhol, one of your favorite subjects is
boredom itself.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously `Via Dolorosa' is completely artificial,'' Hare says.
``It is as highly wrought as any of my plays. But basically all the
artifice is to disguise itself so you don't feel it's there. You're
attempting to make the artifice like a pane of glass that simply
leads you through to the subject _ not to decorate the bloody
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how real things get, abstraction and fantasy will
endure in art for the simple reason that artists respond to
different subject matter in different ways. Hare, for instance,
wouldn't have dreamed of a nonfiction treatment for ``Amy's View,''
his other current Broadway play, which is about ``questions of the
heart,'' he says. It had to be a work of the imagination, performed
by actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be absolutely horrified to stand up on a stage and
talk about love and all these things,'' he says. ``You know, you do
that through the old methods.''

<P>
   The antitrust authorities barely whimpered last month when AT&AMP;T,
the United States' largest long-distance company, acquired
Tele-Communications Inc., the second-largest cable company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal advanced AT&AMP;T's audacious plan to feed phone calls and
Internet data over the same wire that carries video channels _
offering customers a svelte package of every electronic service
they can imagine. And this month AT&AMP;T moved to buy another large
cable company, Mediaone, and to bring Microsoft into its cable and
Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, predicts little
regulatory interference. And who knows? He may be right. Fifteen
years after the government split AT&AMP;T into pieces _ and even as it
is asking the courts to break Microsoft's stranglehold over
personal computing _ these two giants nevertheless are rushing to
dominate phone, cable and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Has antitrust regulation been futile? Consumer advocates think
so. Others point out that existing antitrust standards are not
well-suited to handle telecommunications mergers. In such deals,
higher prices, the ordinary province of antitrust enforcement,
aren't as big a problem as the threat to diverse expression and
sources of information.
</P>
<P>
   So regulators have to learn to deal with decisions that could
concentrate control over the entertainment and information pouring
into the home. And right now they are groping for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Already critics are pressing them to act against AT&AMP;T. Gene
Kimmelman, the consumer advocate at Consumers Union, says,
``Regulatory cowardice could turn AT&AMP;T into a behemoth that
dictates what we see on the Web and watch on television.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T seeks to control cable systems that serve between 25
percent and 40 percent of the nation's cable customers, and to own
minority interests in systems that serve another 20 percent.
Kimmelman says no cable network could expect to thrive if it
couldn't buy its way into AT&AMP;T's systems.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project,
another advocacy group, worries that AT&AMP;T could wall itself off
from competition by refusing to sell popular cable offerings that
it controls to satellite services, or by refusing to carry
programming owned by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Werbach, managing editor of Release 1.0, a technology
magazine, points to a graver threat. ``The plan threatens to give
AT&AMP;T excessive control over the future high-speed Internet,'' he
says. Under AT&AMP;T's cable contracts, customers would be required to
connect to the Internet using AT&AMP;T's online service, At Home, if
they want high-speed connections. Customers who prefer to use the
content offered by America Online or some other service would be
forced to pay more money and suffer inferior service.
</P>
<P>
   This, says Werbach, ``threatens the crowning feature of the
Internet, an open network that allows anyone to do business with
anyone else without interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the looming presence of Microsoft. It will
write the software that provides electronic services for some of
AT&AMP;T's customers. And that could give Microsoft the toehold it
needs to dominate the cable world, much as it does the world of
personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the doomsayers are missing the larger picture.
Its complexities make it difficult for regulators to figure out how
to act, or even whether to act.
</P>
<P>
   John Rose of McKinsey &AMP; Co., a consulting firm, says AT&AMP;T's plan
would be ``a transforming event,'' giving customers the option to
drop the local phone company. Besides, Rose says, ``once AT&AMP;T
upgrades its cable service to provide snazzy digital features, so
too will all the other cable companies.'' In other words, there
would be greater competition and improved service.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sunshine, a former antitrust official at the Department
of Justice, points out that the antitrust authorities have been
right to proceed cautiously, because the AT&AMP;T cable purchases do
not violate the antitrust laws in any simple way. They replaced one
cable monopolist, TCI or Mediaone, with another, AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cicconi, general counsel of AT&AMP;T, says the critics see
threats of dominance where there are none. AT&AMP;T would own and
operate systems serving only about 25 percent of the market, he
says _ far short of a stranglehold. And, he argues, AT&AMP;T will face
competition from the regional phone companies and satellite
services that will make it ``impossible for any one company to
control programming.''
</P>
<P>
   So is AT&AMP;T destined to bring a fabulous array of inexpensive
electronic services? Or is AT&AMP;T about to squash competition in
video programming and crush some of the voices that communicate
over the Internet? The simple answer is that no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, for example, whether the phone companies have a
technology that can provide comparable Internet service or whether
satellite services will ever reach beyond a small, wealthy niche.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment of daunting uncertainty and real or imagined
threats to free expression, there are two options: watchful waiting
and preventive detention.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who was once an
antitrust official in the Justice Department, preaches watchful
waiting. ``Premature reaction by regulators could needlessly stunt
innovation,'' he says, so the smart strategy is to wait, watch and
pounce when something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman and Schwartzman counsel preventive detention: Block
AT&AMP;T's purchase of Mediaone. Waiting to react would give AT&AMP;T time
to design its cable systems in ways that would make it virtually
impossible to pry them open to competition in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine preaches a middle ground. ``There are many steps that
regulators can take short of stopping a merger outright,'' he says.
They could insist that AT&AMP;T open up its cable wires to America
Online and other Internet services if technically possible. Or
regulators might insist that cable operators lease their popular
networks for a fee to satellite services and other potential
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunshine offers a more challenging point. ``The antitrust
laws protect a company's right to bring forth new technologies
unless there is solid evidence of a threat to competition,'' he
says. That is the right standard for guaranteeing low prices for
shoelaces, cameras and other ordinary consumer goods. But it may be
the wrong standard, he says, when issues other than economic
efficiency are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives the Federal Communications Commission the right to
hold up mergers to protect the public interest even in those cases
where the Justice Department decides there are no serious antitrust
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With the AT&AMP;T-Mediaone merger pending, the commission does not
have much time to figure out how to factor the information needs of
a democracy into its decision.

<P>
   A decade ago, Americans watched the United Nations' entry into
the Gulf war almost as if it were a video game, distant and unreal.
Each night's newscast brought a fresh batch of satellite pictures
of Iraqi targets exploding as smart bombs zeroed in.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were seldom seen, and
the greatest moral issue for most Americans was probably that of
controlling the supply of oil or protecting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Kosovo Albanian refugees are all too real. Their
stories of mass rapes and massacres echo a level of brutality that
evokes the death camps of World War II. Washington is engaged in a
war where the overwhelming feature is not oil or geopolitics but
the morality of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many young Americans enlisted to fight Iraq in the Gulf
war.
</P>
<P>
   Today they have been sitting out the Balkan conflict, according
to military recruitment experts like John Sibley Butler, a
sociologist who is the Reserve Officer Training Corps faculty
adviser at the University of Texas. For a few years, the Gulf war
helped stem the steady decline in enlistment since the end of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to a healthy economy that has increased the
choices available to those entering the job market, the Army and
the Air Force have fallen short in their recruitment goals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 1.36 million Americans serving in the military, the
United States for the moment runs no risk of a shortfall in troops
to face down the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the dearth of recruits limits U.S. options, suggesting that
a long war may be problematical. And it raises intriguing questions
about attitudes toward military service and the meaning of modern
warfare to young people.
</P>
<P>
   The apathy of young people toward the conflict in the Balkans
comes at a moment when war is paradoxically at its most intimate
and most distant.
</P>
<P>
   Through television, Americans have access to virtually
continuous coverage of the war, be it NATO bombings in Belgrade or
briefings in Brussels, or the live reports from crowded refugee
camps in Macedonia and Albania. Through the Internet, they can
communicate directly with Serbs or Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the U.S. military wages war at a distance,
using methods that reduce the likelihood of casualties. Planes fly
higher to cut the chances that they will be shot down by Serb
forces, even if that means mistaking a civilian target for a
military one.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people, such ``safe'' strategies drain war of its
very meaning, said David R. Siegel, author of ``Recruiting for
Uncle Sam'' (University Press of Kansas, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Although the military has relied on increasing pay and benefits
to draw recruits, Siegel's previous research suggests that young
people enlist for patriotic reasons, or to build character. A war
that carries risk to only one side strikes many of them as unfair,
or at least unworthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're saying, `I'm willing to lay my life on the
line, but my country won't let me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nonwar in Kosovo,'' which batters Yugoslavia from the air
but does not risk troops, may be precisely what is keeping young
people away, Siegel said. They sense they are not needed, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that continuous television coverage of the
conflict has prompted people to tune out rather than tune in to the
war. ``War has become a movie that other people do, and something
we watch rather than something we engage in,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans reason that abominations ``are going on everywhere,''
he said, and they ask, ``But do we go everywhere to fight them?''

that carries risk to only one side strikes many of them as unfair,
or at least unworthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're saying, `I'm willing to lay my life on the
line, but my country won't let me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nonwar in Kosovo,'' which batters Yugoslavia from the air
but does not risk troops, may be precisely what is keeping young
people away, Siegel said. They sense they are not needed, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that continuous television coverage of the
conflict has prompted people to tune out rather than tune in to the
war. ``War has become a movie that other people do, and something
we watch rather than something we engage in,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans reason that abominations ``are going on everywhere,''
he said, and they ask, ``But do we go everywhere to fight them?''

   NEW YORK _ The once-and-future queen of our tabloid domain was
released from a prison in upstate New York last week. After a
seven-year hiatus, Amy Fisher is among us again, and it seems that
since we cannot escape her, we may have no recourse but to pursue,
analyze and perhaps even worship her.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Fisher played her role to perfection, like
some ex-con Garbo. Her eyes shaded by sunglasses, her lips set in
that squirrel-cheek pout, she brushed past two dozen reporters
yearning for her to say something, anything.
</P>
<P>
   But she did deign to pose for a photograph in the chartered
airplane that returned her to her rightful place, Long Island, and
even released a statement suggesting that this was one paroled
felon Who Has Learned Her Lesson. She revealed that she wants to do
something positive with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Fisher's release, her lawyer has shared heartwarming
tidbits about the young woman's embrace of freedom, including
details about the long-awaited reunion with Muffin, her Yorkshire
terrier. ``The dog remembered her,'' the lawyer told the Daily News
(in an article carrying the headline ``Free Fisher Reunited With
Beloved Pooch''). ``She was pleased at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us able to regain composure after imagining that
poignant scene must be wondering:
</P>
<P>
   Why do we care?
</P>
<P>
   Why did we ever care?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, say students and scholars of popular culture,
include the nature of the crime she committed, sex, the Lolita-like
elements of her relationship with a middle-aged man, sex, the
melodious surname of her paramour, sex, the self-promotional
tendencies of its principal characters, and sex.
</P>
<P>
   The story drew in everyone with its shameless tawdriness _
including the analysts and journalists who pondered its deeper
truths while fancying themselves somehow above it all. There have,
after all, been 233 articles in The New York Times mentioning Amy
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's implicated in it,'' says Neal Gabler, the author of
``Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality'' (Alfred A.
Knopf, 1998). ``Those of us who consume it, those of us who analyze
it. It's a voracious maw.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who sniff that they have no time for such trash are
kidding themselves, he says, ``because what they are saying is `I'm
defining myself in relationship to Amy Fisher and Joey
Buttafuoco.''' He added: ``You live in a tabloid culture. This idea
that you can somehow escape _ escape it where? By going to the end
of the universe?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York
University, says cases like l'affaire Fisher expose the pundit's
dilemma. ``I don't think any of us can pretend to be immune to the
appeal of these images,'' he said. ``And if we were, we wouldn't be
qualified to talk about them. You have to understand the appeal in
order to comment on it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After all, the basic appeal of the Amy Fisher saga is
self-evident. Long Island. 1992. Sixteen-year-old girl finds love
and understanding in Popeye arms of 38-year-old auto-body-shop
owner. Dabbles in prostitution, becomes obsessed with her lover,
shoots his wife in the face. She gets five-to-15 for assault. He
gets six months for statutory rape. And the ever-loyal wife is left
with a partly paralyzed face.
</P>
<P>
   The general narrative has been told so many times, in
newspapers, books and three made-for-television movies, that
incidental details linger, from the white Dodge Daytona that Ms.
Fisher smashed up _ leading her to Buttafuoco's shop in the first
place _ to the name of the Long Island-based prostitution service
that briefly employed Ms. Fisher, ABBA Escorts. A Web site called
``Aimee: The Official Amy Fisher Organization'' even includes a
trivia section.
</P>
<P>
   How deeply the Fisher case has insinuated itself into the
collective consciousness was revealed to Gabler during a recent
trip to Los Angeles. A livery driver there told the author that he
was driving down Sunset Boulevard a few weeks ago when he spotted a
minor mob scene on the sidewalk. He pulled over and asked one of
the gawkers what the commotion was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Came the answer: ``Joey Buttafuoco.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher, now 24, and her supporting cast can proudly take
their place in the pantheon of the salacious, somewhere ahead of
the Bobbitts of dismemberment fame, but assuredly behind O.J.
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   And the Fisher ensemble continues to distinguish itself with
sheer shamelessness. Ms. Fisher did not allow cold prison walls to
prevent her from leveling lurid allegations against others, from
her first lawyer to the corrections officers who guarded her. And
rather than disappear into the fog of humiliation at a time when
his surname alone was a David Letterman punch line, Buttafuoco
moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a major shift in our sense of shame and guilt and
celebrity in our culture,'' says Joshua Meyrowitz, a professor of
communication at the University of New Hampshire who explored that
shift in ``No Sense of Place'' (Oxford University Press, 1985).
``The parading of all these people who have exhibited very negative
behavior normally would be pushed out of our social spheres, but
instead are pulled in.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the inverse is true: People are sucked into the
Fisher-Buttafuoco sphere by developments that surpass the most
outlandish subplots of daytime television, and by the vaguely
unsettling sense that Amy, Joey and Mary Jo long ago determined
that the public glare provided them with a more natural light.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing last month, Ms. Buttafuoco provided the
ingredient necessary to secure Ms. Fisher's conditional freedom by
announcing that she had forgiven the young woman. Ms. Fisher wept
and reportedly mouthed the words ``I'm sorry.'' The wounded wife
and the chastened hussy reached out to touch each other, but an
officer stepped in to prevent any physical healing from taking
place in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The scene will surely be included in any sequel, one that would
also probably explore various allegations that she was raped in
prison, exploited by her lawyer and abused by her father. Indeed, a
family friend who is acting as her spokeswoman has said that Ms.
Fisher is being inundated with book offers and requests for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York's ``Son of Sam'' law, a felon generally cannot
benefit financially from a crime. Fortunately for those not yet
sated, there is a provision that allows for profit if the victim
grants permission. And Mary Jo Buttafuoco's lawyer recently told
The New York Post that the woman who still carries a bullet in her
neck would be open to ``a major deal.''

   Gertrude Stein put it best: ``There never will be anything more
interesting in America than that Civil War never.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the war rarely wanes, but it definitely waxes around
this time of year. After Memorial Day (which evolved from mourning
rituals for the Civil War's 620,000 dead), hardly a week will pass
this summer without a battle anniversary, a combat re-enactment or
a rite of remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   As Civil War buffs trek to battlefields and monuments, they can
bone up on the details from among 60,000 titles on the Civil War _
about a quarter of all shelf space devoted to American history at
the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, writers have approached the war with reverential
awe. But there is a large and growing body of material _ books,
magazines, Web sites _ that treats the war and its landscape not
only as hallowed ground but also as fertile soil for levity,
fantasy, fringe scholarship, even romance. Who says war is hell?

<P>
   (Begin italics)Many Civil War re-enactors go to extremes to
duplicate the look of 1860s soldiers. The most popular re-enactors'
magazine, the Camp Chase Gazette, named after a Union prison camp,
offers tips on how to achieve authentic Civil War hair, including
``hathead'':(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks before the event, give yourself a haircut
following these rules:
</P>
<P>
   a) You cannot look in the mirror while you cut your hair.
</P>
<P>
   b) Your hair must be dry when you cut it (for more dead ends).
</P>
<P>
   c) Try to use the dullest scissors you can find. A pocket knife
is even better.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin italics)Once at the event:(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   Go to the nearest water source. A horse trough is great, but
your canteen will be adequate. Soak your head. Then, pull your hat
down real tight and let dry.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin italics)Now for the beard:(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   Chew tobacco. Don't spit; drool instead.
</P>
<P>
   Eat a lot of cornbread, allowing the crumbs to collect in the
tobacco juice. This provides a nice textured look, plus it makes a
great snack on the march.
</P>
<P>
   Comb your beard with your fingers. Be sure to wash your hands
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Eatin' and Cussin'
</P>
<P>
   (Begin italics)A true re-enactor must not only resemble a
soldier, but also eat like one. The Watchdog, another re-enactors'
publication, tells how:(End italics)
</P>
<P>
   Looking for foraged items? You can try corn-on-the-cob (in the
shuck, and white corn only, as yellow corn was considered animal
feed) ... apples in season, country ham, eggs (will keep a week
without refrigeration). ...
</P>
<P>
   Confederate soldiers often made do with substitutes. Make corn
bread in place of soft or hard bread. Their snacks were not as
fancy and included such items as goober peas (nuts) or parched
corn. Look for ``roasted corn'' in Hispanic food stores or make
your own by parching organic (no pesticides or herbicides) seed
corn in bacon fat in a hot skillet. The end result should look and
taste like unflavored Corn Nuts.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin italics)Eat like a soldier, and also talk like one. These
suggestions come from a re-enactors' chat group on ``period
cursing,'' complete with definitions:(End italics)

   About two weeks before the event, give yourself a haircut

<P>
   a) You cannot look in the mirror while you cut your hair.
</P>
<P>
   b) Your hair must be dry when you cut it (for more dead ends).

is even better.

   Eat a lot of cornbread, allowing the crumbs to collect in the
tobacco juice. This provides a nice textured look, plus it makes a
great snack on the march.
</P>
<P>
   Comb your beard with your fingers. Be sure to wash your hands
afterwards.

   Looking for foraged items? You can try corn-on-the-cob (in the

</P>
<P>
   Confederate soldiers often made do with substitutes. Make corn
bread in place of soft or hard bread. Their snacks were not as
fancy and included such items as goober peas (nuts) or parched
corn. Look for ``roasted corn'' in Hispanic food stores or make
your own by parching organic (no pesticides or herbicides) seed
corn in bacon fat in a hot skillet. The end result should look and
taste like unflavored Corn Nuts.

   BEIJING _ If a space traveler had returned to Earth last week
after 35 years, he could have been excused for thinking that
nothing had changed. Russia and China hated the West. Their leaders
and citizens were angrily flinging words like ``imperialism'' and
``hegemony.'' A strange war in an obscure corner of the planet
seemed to be the occasion for mounting global tension.
</P>
<P>
   No world leaders were seen banging any shoes, but a Chinese
president, after allowing jeering crowds to stone the American
Embassy, hinted darkly that if the United States did not mend its
ways, it would ``face doom.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the space traveler would have to be told that the Cold
War really was over, and that for 10 years the Americans, the
Russians and the Chinese had agreed that their most vital interest
was in the common pursuit of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, was how many Americans had come to understand
the new world.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia and China, as events have shown, the picture was
not quite so straightforward. Whatever goals Russia and China share
with the United States, the crisis in Kosovo _ and especially the
mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia _
has revealed the degree to which these former enemies still
distrust Americans, and also the blinders that Americans wear as
they imagine how Russia and China perceive their own vital
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans might well believe that these two needy behemoths
are shooting themselves in their economic feet, with their
fulminating hostility over events in an inconsequential place
called Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But posing the issue this way, Chinese people say, reveals the
problem. There can be no doubt that China really wants to open up
and become part of the Western-led world economy. But it has other
profound interests and fears as well. And many people here have
felt with growing force that the United States simply doesn't take
China seriously _ that it blithely ignores China's vital security
concerns as it constructs a Pax Americana.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, dependent on the International Monetary Fund's
huge loans and suffering a political meltdown that includes an
impeachment drama and successive shuffles of the government, have
likewise stewed about what they regard as ignorant and
disrespectful treatment from the West.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders, having long been lectured by the Russians about
NATO expansion, knew the Russians would hate the decision to
bombard Yugoslavia, though they may have underestimated the
long-term damage to relations if the war persisted. China's vitriol
about the intervention in Yugoslavia was another matter. Though
surprisingly harsh, it didn't seem very important at first, because
it was only oratory. And Kosovo was so far away from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't make the connection between Kosovo and China;
they just don't see it,'' observed Jonathan Pollack, a military
expert at Rand Corp. in California.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Chinese, it is now clear, the decision by what it
pointedly called ``U.S.-led NATO'' to bomb Yugoslavia without U.N.
sanction was highly significant. Culminating with the attack on
their own embassy in Belgrade, the bombing campaign has ignited a
major reassessment here of global politics and relations with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing in Yugoslavia showed us that the United States can
do anything it wants to do,'' said Zhang Yunling, director of
Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
which advises the government. ``We see that the United States will
use its supreme position, its high technology and its allies to
dominate the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Kosovo is far away, this has alerted the Chinese,''
Zhang added, noting that China could face similar demands for
international military intervention some day in Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing in Yugoslavia followed other perceived signs of
hostility _ including what is regarded as politically driven
opposition to China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
rumbles of major military support for the renegade province of
Taiwan and a broadened defense agreement with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   These created a powerful sense here that the United States was
worse than a neglectful friend. The United States, many people
feared, wants to stamp China down, just as it emerges as the world
power it was always meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   That fear turned into a certainty last week, after NATO bombs
killed three journalists in the embassy in Belgrade. However
outlandish the idea seems to Americans, almost everyone in Beijing
thinks the attack was deliberate, a belief encouraged by official
propaganda. The most common theory voiced by demonstrators was
simple: The United States wants to test the upstart China.
</P>
<P>
   So a Westernized generation of Chinese youths, the same people
who normally crowd any of Beijing's 44 McDonald's outlets and yearn
to attend UCLA, unleashed a fury of anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   And this raised the possibility of real hostility growing
between the two countries. For however distant the old Cold War
hostilities have become, frictions are nevertheless inevitable as
China's growing power rubs against longstanding U.S. partnerships
and interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For now, U.S. diplomats here feel their own sense of betrayal.
From Ambassador James Sasser on down, they had devoted the last few
years to building a web of friendly ties with China, trying to wall
off the obvious disputes over human rights. Last year, President
Clinton and President Jiang even inaugurated a hot line.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using the hot line last week, Jiang initially
refused to take a call from Washington. The leaders pushed the
United States to the limit, busing in students and letting them
pelt the U.S. Embassy here for four days while the controlled media
fanned hatred.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, the popular furies had subsided to a slow burn,
and Clinton and Jiang had talked. But both sides knew that
Chinese-American relations could never be quite the same and both
governments were feeling their way toward new terms.
</P>
<P>
   China was clearly trying to turn down the temperature _ not only
by halting the demonstrations but also by making surprisingly
minimal demands for redress, including apologies, a public
investigation and punishment of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkably, Chinese officials insisted that their economic
engagement with the West should not be affected by politics and
said negotiations for entry to the World Trade Organization should
pick up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   In a monumental misperception of U.S. political realities, some
officials even suggested that the United States should now, in a
kind of reparation, relax its negotiating stance.

<P>
   Zhang, the scholar and adviser, said the embassy attack had
spawned a changing view of Chinese-American relations among foreign
policy specialists here.
</P>
<P>
   Many, he said, had believed that a generally cooperative
relationship with the United States was possible. ``But now it
seems the United States will dominate the relationship, and where
there are disagreements it may resort to military force,'' he
continued. ``China might even become a target some time in the
future,'' he said, noting possible conflicts in Taiwan or the
Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   In the new circumstances, China may well increase military
spending, Zhang said, although economic development would remain
the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   How deeply this new perspective would be entrenched, Zhang said,
would depend on how well the two governments manage their
relationship in the months ahead and how the Kosovo crisis is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of the embassy has had the ironic effect of
thrusting China into the center of the search for a diplomatic
solution in Yugoslavia. The approach Russia developed with the NATO
powers involves sending troops under a U.N. flag into Kosovo. This
would require China's assent, something likely to be given only
grudgingly.

   Long before the current crisis, the one-time enemies China and
Russia had realized that it was in their strategic interest to
foster better ties. Now more than ever, China the emerging power
and Russia the flailing one have been brought together by a shared
sense of exclusion.

<P>
   There is no basis for a serious strategic alliance, but ``China
has used friendly sniffs to remind the United States that they can
shift northward,'' said Richard Baum, an expert on Chinese politics
at the University of California at Los Angeles. ``Russia can't
offer what China needs for modernization,'' Baum said. What it does
offer is weaponry in exchange for cash.

<P>
   Chinese leaders are gambling that even as political relations
with the United States go through the grinder, Western trade and
investment will continue unaffected.

   ``Capital and technology are now beyond political control,''
Zhang said. ``As long as the social situation here is stable and
the economy is open, capital will come.''

 BEIJING: negotiating stance.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zhang, the scholar and adviser, said the embassy attack had
spawned a changing view of Chinese-American relations among foreign
policy specialists here.
</P>
<P>
   Many, he said, had believed that a generally cooperative
relationship with the United States was possible. ``But now it
seems the United States will dominate the relationship, and where
there are disagreements it may resort to military force,'' he
continued. ``China might even become a target some time in the
future,'' he said, noting possible conflicts in Taiwan or the
Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   In the new circumstances, China may well increase military
spending, Zhang said, although economic development would remain
the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   How deeply this new perspective would be entrenched, Zhang said,
would depend on how well the two governments manage their
relationship in the months ahead and how the Kosovo crisis is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing of the embassy has had the ironic effect of
thrusting China into the center of the search for a diplomatic
solution in Yugoslavia. The approach Russia developed with the NATO
powers involves sending troops under a U.N. flag into Kosovo. This
would require China's assent, something likely to be given only
grudgingly.

IN ISRAELI VOTE, ARABS HOLD THEIR BREATH AND THEIR TONGUES
</HEADLINE>
   (See also ISRAEL-ELECTION) 
(rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ With just days to go before the Israeli election,
the Arab world is watching with a pretense of neutrality, although
Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, is plainly the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent reason for the caution is concern that overt Arab
cheerleading for Barak or criticism of the current prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has long been seen around the Arab world as a major
obstacle to a broader peace between Israel and the Arabs. In
private conversations most Arab officials do not disguise their
hope that his tenure may come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks against him that are a usual staple of the Arab
press have been muffled lately, apparently out of an aversion to
handing Netanyahu anything he might use as ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to be seen as standing tough against the Arabs, so
the last thing we want to do is to reinforce that view,'' a
Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an odd period of politesse. In the past
Netanyahu has routinely been vilified in the Arab press with titles
like ``Netanyahu, enemy of peace.'' Suddenly, even in newspapers
that have been among his fiercest critics, he is `` Netanyahu, the
Israeli prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu's attempt last week to shut down Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem was mildly described in an editorial in
The Jordan Times as an ``election gimmick,'' even though similar
attempts have prompted cries of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, now
leading in opinion polls before the voting on Monday, a faint sense
of excitement can be felt among Arab officials and commentators who
have begun to suggest that the election may well prove to be a
watershed that will give way to broader peace.
</P>
<P>
   While governments are feigning neutrality, a Jordanian
columnist, Fahed Fanek, wrote recently in the newspaper Al Rai that
only the ``mentally lazy'' would say there was no difference
between Labor and Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabs will interpret the result as whether the Jewish state
wants peace or not,'' wrote Fanek, who remained careful not to
state a preference of his own.
</P>
<P>
   A television program broadcast in Egypt stoked the sense of
hopefulness, with Netanyahu's opponents emphasizing their
determination to reinvigorate the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Beilin, a top adviser to Barak, said on the broadcast that
the Labor Party leader was determined to make peace with all of the
Arabs within a year, while Yitzhak Mordechai, the third main
candidate, said he had left Likud in part because he wanted ``to
develop cooperation with neighbors of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tone of coverage here and across the Arab world has
remained mild. Likud representatives were invited to appear on the
Egyptian broadcast but declined.
</P>
<P>
   And with most election news relegated to the inside pages, some
commentators have accused governments of being too cautious, saying
it is important to drive home to Israelis the message of just how
much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arab countries seem determined to win ``an American
certificate of good manners,'' a commentator, Abdel Wahab Badran,
wrote recently in the London-based Arabic newspaper Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   In steering around the question of what candidate they prefer,
those Arab leaders who have addressed the issue have tried to turn
the focus on what may lie beyond the election.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah of Jordan, the new leader of a country whose peace
with Israel remains unpopular among its citizens, called for the
next Israeli government to show ``a sense of urgency'' in tackling
stalled peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to move forward _ the Israelis and the
Palestinians _ I think it will have a cascade effect throughout the
Middle East,'' the king told reporters in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, most Arab commentators are counseling
against the belief that a new day may be at hand. Not only might
Netanyahu hold on to power, they say, but Barak, if elected, might
prove an equally tough adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arabs ``expect miracles from Barak, as if he is the savior
of peace process, and that is mere imagination based on unrealistic
wishes,'' Badran wrote in Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded readers that current peace agreements would remain
the same whether under Labor or Likud rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same peace,'' Badran wrote, ``but with Labor it
smells better!''

NATIONALISM IS MOOD IN TURKEY'S KURDISH ENCLAVES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey _ An elderly man who is among the most
respected denizens of Diyarbakir's twisting bazaar sat speaking
about his memories of Kurdish struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1930s, he told of rebellions he has seen,
villages he once knew that have been burned by military patrols,
friends he has lost to unknown assassins and what he said was the
fatal torture of his son.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of young men were sitting silently nearby, taking it
all in. They are the new generation of Kurds, eagerly absorbing
stories that fire their political commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government says that few Kurds support the idea of
Kurdish nationalism and that nearly all are happy with the life
Turkey offers them. But a four-day tour through Kurdish provinces
of the southeast indicated that the opposite may be true.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the region, Kurds appear more conscious of their
identity than ever. It is difficult to find any who do not support
the nationalist cause and even the armed rebellion that has been
under way since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   This public mood suggests that unless the government accepts at
least some Kurdish demands, violence could continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The growing support for Kurdish nationalism comes at a time when
the rebel group known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or _ more
commonly _ by its initials PKK, has suffered heavy losses,
including the capture of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan. These
reverses seem, if anything, to have emboldened ordinary people
here, many of whom revere Ocalan as ``our leader'' _ a vivid
contrast to language used elsewhere in Turkey, where he is normally
described as a terrorist and baby-killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother never had any particular sympathy for Ocalan or his
organization,'' said a businessman in his mid-30s. ``But when she
saw the pictures of him in handcuffs, she cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of nationalist sentiment here is evidently a product,
at least in part, of Ocalan's rebellion. Even Kurds who expressed
doubts about his tactics said he had awakened a new generation to a
sense of common identity that their forefathers never felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish conflict has led to much criticism of Turkey abroad,
and has been cited as one of the main obstacles to Turkish
membership in the European Union. In recent weeks, commentators in
several countries have suggested that if the ethnic Albanian
majority in Serbia's Kosovo province deserves international
protection, so does the Kurdish majority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Turkey's estimated 10 million Kurds come from this
region. They constitute 90 percent of the population here, although
in the last decade many have migrated westward to large cities like
Istanbul. Turkish officials reject any comparison between Kosovo
and the southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any relationship between the two issues,'' Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said when asked about it at a news conference
during NATO's summit meeting in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, voters in seven provincial capitals in the Kurdish
region dealt the government a sharp blow by electing leaders of the
Kurdish nationalist party as mayors. Here in Diyarbakir, the
largest city in the region, the nationalist candidate won an
astonishing 62 percent of the vote despite police harassment that
included banning and attacking his rallies and arresting many who
campaigned for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won because we talked about identity, about the fact that
there is a Kurdish population in this country that cannot be
ignored,'' said the mayor, Feridun Celik. ``Nothing can be achieved
by refusing to recognize us. This problem has existed since the
founding of the Turkish Republic, and it has to be confronted.
There is a great fear of diversity and the expression of diversity
in this country. That is the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Celik rejected government assertions that he and his party,
People's Democracy, support separatism and terrorism. But a case to
close the party is pending, based on the government's assertion
that it maintains ``organic links'' with the guerrillas. After the
recent elections, a senior prosecutor said he would seek to remove
all People's Democracy mayors from office because their elections
constituted ``terrorist takeovers'' of city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newly elected mayors realize that they must speak
cautiously, many ordinary people feel no such constraints as long
as they are promised anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support this party because I'm a Kurd,'' said a woman in
Diyarbakir. ``What we demand is our identity. We want it to say in
our identity cards that we are Kurds. We want schools and
television stations in our language. We're happy under the Turkish
flag, but the government is still very afraid of us. They say that
if they accept our identity, we will want to govern ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bingol, another provincial capital where a People's Democracy
candidate was elected mayor last month, a well-dressed businessman
said: ``The state can't keep us down. They have to realize that
millions of Kurds want to be recognized as Kurds, and that we
support every organization that fights for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government fears that compromise with the nationalist
movement would ultimately lead to the region's secession. Even
suggesting peace talks with the rebel group is a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PKK's claim to be fighting for Kurdish rights is nothing
but a preposterous and outrageous deception,'' the government
asserted in a recent statement. ``The PKK is not a popular
movement, but simply a terrorist organization operating through
intimidation, coercion and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the government in Ankara were not available
here, but at one of the many military checkpoints in the southeast,
several army officers eloquently expressed the official viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no political or social basis to this conflict,'' said
a major on his third tour of duty in the southeast. ``It is all
fomented by foreign countries. You say it is a war, but I have to
correct you. This is not a war. It is a peace operation. We are
defending the country from terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant scoffed at the suggestion that People's Democracy
should be welcomed into the political system. ``This is not just a
radical party,'' he said. ``It is a party connected to Ocalan, a
man who is responsible for killing 30,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of People's Democracy strenuously deny that their party
is linked to the guerrillas. But many voters here agree with the
government's assertion that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they are connected to our leader and his
organization,'' said one shopkeeper. ``That's why we voted for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about accusations that guerrillas have killed
schoolteachers and committed acts of terror, the shopkeeper
replied, ``Unfortunately that is true, but what we have suffered at
the hands of the Turkish army is much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kurdish towns, it is no longer forbidden to
use the Kurdish language, and cassettes of Kurdish music, once
banned, are now widely available. But in dozens of interviews, no
Kurd could be found who did not believe that security forces here
are guilty of repression, torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the conflict in 1984 until the end of 1998,
according to President Suleyman Demirel, 23,638 guerrillas, 5,555
soldiers and 5,302 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has long denied the Kurdish population, located
largely in the southeast, basic political, cultural and linguistic
rights,'' the State Department said in its most recent human rights
report. ``As part of its fight against the PKK, the government
forcibly displaced noncombatants, failed to resolve extra-judicial
killings, tortured civilians, and abridged freedom of expression.
The number of villagers forcibly evacuated from their homes since
the conflict began is credibly estimated to be about 560,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Though people in the southeast now speak more freely than
before, they are still circumspect. Asked if he knew of youths who
have joined the militants, man smoking a water pipe replied: ``We
wouldn't know about that. How could we know?''
</P>
<P>
   A friend sitting nearby smiled and said, ``That's a man who
knows how to survive in Diyarbakir.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent figure who publicly encourages a change in
government policy is Mehmet Sirin Yigit, a Kurd who heads the
Diyarbakir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He sees the recent
election as a positive step that could open new dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two different opinions live without contact with each
other, there is trouble,'' Yigit said. ``But if there is a chance
for the two opinions to communicate, which is going to happen now,
that's better. People from both sides are going to be sitting
together in meetings, talking to each other and learning to respect
each other's sensitivities. You can't resolve problems by using
pressure.''

   On a back alley in Diyarbakir, a schoolboy wearing a jacket
several sizes too big for him said he thought People's Democracy
was ``very good'' and that the guerrillas were ``also very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain what was good about the guerrilla army, the
youth paused for a moment and then replied: ``I don't exactly know.
But I know it's good.''

MEXICO MEASURES IDENTITY IN DOLLARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ A Mexican conference speaker exploring the
possibility that his country might adopt the dollar as its currency
displayed a slide of a 50 peso bill alongside a single American
greenback. George Washington's benign gaze was fixed on his
fierce-looking counterpart, Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we talk to American officials about dollarizing
Mexico, we always ask them when they are going to print Miguel
Hidalgo's face right there next to the other one,'' said the
speaker, Francisco Gil Diaz, a former senior official of Mexico's
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The audience chuckled. But Gil's comment pointed up a major
sticking point that has emerged in an intense debate in Latin
American about whether to abandon local currencies and embrace the
legal tender of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of economists agree that the dollar's stability
would do much to cure the chronic inflation and volatility that
undermines growth in many Latin economies, especially Mexico. But
political leaders in the region are reluctant to give up the policy
powers and sense of national identity that go along with trading in
their own money, no matter how unpredictable it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Latin policymakers are quick to point out that the European
Union countries achieved monetary accord by agreeing to add a new
currency, the euro. But in the Americas the choice that nations
must weigh is whether to take on the money of the United States, an
overpowering neighbor with which most of them have had uneven
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate gained new urgency in January when President Carlos
Saul Menem of Argentina announced he was considering dropping the
peso for the dollar and entered into informal talks with American
Treasury and Federal Reserve officials.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Eugenio Clariond Reyes, leader of the Mexican
Businessmen's Council, the most influential private-sector
association, startled President Ernesto Zedillo by pressing him at
a public meeting to allow dollars to flow more easily in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mexican business leader, Alfonso Romo Garza, the
chairman of Pulsar International, was host of a gathering here in
recent days of economists and businessmen from both sides of the
border to build momentum for dollarization.
</P>
<P>
   To the chiefs of big Mexican industry, whose capital is
Monterrey, being legally authorized to do business in dollars would
merely ratify well-established de facto practice. Already their
costs and prices are quoted in dollar terms and they finance
investments with dollar loans from foreign banks. Only workers'
wages continue to be based on pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's economy already runs on dollars at the bottom as well,
especially in regions where workers maintain their families by
migrating across the border to jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But mid-range Mexican enterprises must seek financing from
Mexican banks where, because of the peso's persistent ups and
downs, interest rates remain around a crippling 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustaining a currency like Mexico's has an enormous cost,''
Clariond, chairman of Grupo Imsa, a manufacturing conglomerate,
said in an interview. ``Living with its fluctuations is a luxury we
can no longer afford.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mexicans are asked if they would like to see dollars move
freely in the economy, they invariably express overwhelming
support. In a poll this month by El Economista newspaper, 86
percent said they would like to be able to open dollar bank
accounts in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But when the question is whether to do away with the peso,
Mexicans are more ambivalent. One financial titan in Mexico who
came out against dollarization was Carlos Slim Helu, chairman of
Telefonos de Mexico and one of the wealthiest men in Latin America.
He argued that switching currencies could not substitute for
government fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you have to stop inflation is by cleaning up your
financial house,'' Slim said. ``Besides, the idea that the Federal
Reserve would want to take responsibility for our financial system
is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Action Party, a conservative but nationalistic
opposition party, proposed a bill in Congress recently that would
rule out dollarization by hardening into law the current policy of
a floating peso with some intervention by the Banco de Mexico, the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of dollarization argue that what they call ``the
sovereignty factor'' should not trouble Mexicans. Under any plan to
dollarize, the central bank would relinquish its authority to
manipulate the peso in the event of unexpected shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Steve H. Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins
University, told Mexican business leaders here that if they were
allowed to pick and choose freely among currencies for business
they would not have to worry about ``blowing away the central
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing to give up monetary policy sovereignty,''
Hanke said. That kind of decision-making power, he said, ``only
gets you into a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican finance officials acknowledge that a brisk debate is
under way among them over the issue. Guillermo Ortiz, head of
Mexico's central bank, has said that the North American Free Trade
Agreement could one day be a natural vehicle for a plan to adopt a
single currency. ``We happen to live in the right neighborhood,''
Ortiz said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials also recognize that a serious proposal to sideline
the peso would provoke the fury of nationalist Mexicans. Zedillo,
an economist who has suffered painful setbacks with sound economic
policies that were politically unpalatable, does not seem eager to
be the president who replaced Miguel Hidalgo with George
Washington.

COLOMBIA REBELS REIGN IN CEDED AREA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ There are no immigration or
customs controls at the rustic landing strip that passes for an
airport here. But in most other ways, this muddy cattle town and a
sizable swath of jungle and savanna around it have ceased to be a
part of Colombia and are instead, with the government's blessing, a
dominion ruled by Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   At the main square here, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as FARC from its Spanish initials, has taken over
what used to be the local Institute of Culture and Tourism and made
it a headquarters. Rebel commanders in dark green uniforms move
about the streets, heavily armed bodyguards trailing behind, and
conduct document checks, summon residents to ideological meetings,
or stride into the mayor's office at will to confer with municipal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farclandia'' is the name some local residents have given to
this odd new state-within-a-state, created when the central
government in Bogota ceded an area of roughly 15,000 square miles _
larger than New Jersey and Connecticut combined _ to guerrilla
control as an inducement to peace talks that might end Colombia's
35-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was envisioned as temporary, but signs abound
that the guerrillas, who have informally but effectively collected
taxes around here for 25 years, are cementing their control and
taking steps to insure they cannot be expelled if the process
breaks down. Less clear, however, is whether the experience gained
has given the rebels a real taste for governance, rather than
insurgency against a democratically elected Colombian government
that they maintain serves only a domestic elite and foreign
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several Latin American countries, the latest of
them Guatemala, have negotiated settlements to their long civil
wars. But it is unprecedented for a government to hand over a swath
of territory to its adversary. Local residents are not pleased that
they have been made guinea pigs in a political experiment while
being excluded from the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if a couple of guests have come to stay in your
house, and they decide to throw a party,'' said Omar Garcia
Castillo, the mayor here. ``Not only do they not consult you, they
don't invite you.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90,000 residents of the area have had to live with this
unusual arrangement since last November. After much maneuvering,
the Colombian government and the rebel group agreed early in May to
begin formal peace talks, which are expected to get under way by
the end of the month and to prolong guerrilla control of the region
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement for the withdrawal of the government
supposedly applied only to its military and security presence,
including the national police, who have been replaced by a
60-member ``civic police'' that has half of its personnel appointed
by the mayor and the other half by the guerrillas. But the
guerrilla group recently expelled a government prosecutor they
found troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made mistakes, and we have complained to them about
those mistakes,'' Victor G. Ricardo, the government's chief peace
negotiator, said when asked about the incident. ``What they did
with the prosecutor was one of those mistakes, and they recognize
it as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, no replacement has been sent here, and only a
handful of officials from the ombudsman's office remain as
representatives of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla leadership has also demanded that the Roman
Catholic Church remove two parish priests who have objected to the
rebels' behavior and policies. One of the priests has now been
reassigned, for reasons the church hierarchy maintains are
unrelated to his dispute with the rebels. The other, Miguel Angel
Serna, remains an outspoken critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in Colombia right now, but in something that is the
prelude to an independent state,'' Serna said in an interview at
the rectory here. He said that the rebel movement had ``imposed its
law'' on people here, creating a militia called ``Citizen
Vigilance'' to intimidate potential opponents and ``to spy on
civic, religious and business groups,'' while ``accusing anyone who
does not agree with them of being an enemy of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Colombian news magazine Semana, the
Roman Catholic bishop for most of the region, Hector Lopez, said
the rebel group had also engaged in ``forced recruitment'' of
children as young as 13. In some rural areas he regularly visits,
he added, the guerrillas were ``bringing together the whole
population between the ages of 13 and 60 for two or three days'' at
their encampments, where ``they train them in the use of heavy
weapons'' and indoctrinate them in Marxist-Leninist theory.
</P>
<P>
   Local people said the guerrillas have also imposed labor duty in
rural areas, either to repair existing roads, most of which are in
precarious shape, or to build new ones. Better roads are a boon to
ranchers and farmers who have had difficulty getting crops to
market, but have a military use as well.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts say that the guerrillas have reconditioned
airstrips in the bush and have organized several flights,
presumably of weapons and ammunition but perhaps also of drugs,
which have been an important source of income for years. Colombian
government officials acknowledge that such activities have been
taking place, but minimize their importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been doing that all along,'' Minister of Defense
Rodrigo Lloreda said in an interview in Bogota. ``They may have
taken some advantage, but not so dramatically. What worries me most
is not this, but that the civilian population may have been
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the mayor, said that he was aware of about six instances
in which residents had been ``detained'' by the rebels and held
illegally. He added that he was powerless to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents now seem resigned to the presence of the
guerrillas, and indeed worry more about when they leave. ``Our
greatest fear is that the peace process falls apart, the
paramilitaries come in here and accuse us all of being
collaborators and kill a lot of people,'' said the middle-aged
owner of a beauty salon as she trimmed a customer's hair.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is way down. According to local authorities, only four
killings have occurred in the six months since the guerrillas took
control, compared with about 10 a week in the months before their
arrival. Robbery, theft and rape have dropped almost as sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are highly centralized and it is difficult to obtain
information about their policies or a response to complaints made
by religious and civic leaders here and in Bogota. Three guerrilla
commanders assigned here declined to discuss these issues, saying
comment would have to come from superiors, who were at a base in
the jungle and therefore unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate matter and a very delicate time,
especially here in town,'' Comandante Juan Pablo, a guerrilla
official, said as he stood outside the rebel group's headquarters,
decorated with photographs of Lenin and Simon Bolivar. He
maintained, though, that many of the complaints were exaggerated,
an assertion contradicted in several interviews with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the priests are saying is correct, but I would not say
that out loud,'' one store owner here said. ``Nobody wants trouble
with these people, so they keep quiet. You know what they say: keep
your mouth shut, and flies won't enter.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the guerrillas assigned to duty in town seem to
enjoy life out of the bush. Teen-age soldiers flirt with local
girls when their superiors are not looking, and other rebel leaders
are using the respite to learn to play musical instruments or
acquire other skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost 40, and have been a guerrilla for 19 years,'' said
Mauricio, the rebels' community liaison officer, breaking off a
conversation to head for his first driving lesson. ``I never
learned how to drive a car, so now I am going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Governance is hazier, not extending much beyond paving a few
streets, painting some revolutionary murals and holding many
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guerrillas have learned from this experience that
they are not prepared to run the country,'' said a European relief
official who spends much of his time here. ``Their senior leaders
are very intelligent, but they lack the midlevel cadres they
need.''

 &HT;    Tiant teaching his brand of baseball
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ At 58, Luis Tiant's trademark Fu Manchu mustache
is full of gray, and his black pullover jersey strains to hold his
ample belly. But the former Boston Red Sox cult figure still can
baffle hitters with his corkscrew delivery, the number on his back
visible as always before every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for his Savannah College of Art and Design hitters,
Tiant's right arm is tender, limiting him to only rare
batting-practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season, I throw all the time,'' said Tiant, who won 20
games four times in his 19-year major-league career and finished
with 229 victories. ``This year, my arm is not so good.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean this hasn't been a special season for
Tiant, in his second year as the unlikely coach of an unlikely
college baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   When Tiant can't throw batting practice, another Tiant does _
oldest son Luis IV. At home games, a third Luis Tiant often
attends. The littlest Louie is Tiant's five-year-old grandson, Luis
V.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family is everything,'' the elder Tiant said. ``It is even
more important than baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was baseball that took Tiant _ the winningest major-league
pitcher from Cuba _ away from his parents, and for many years it
kept him away from his three children for long stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has reunited him with his oldest son, who was running an
air-freight company in Miami before agreeing to join his father as
an assistant coach at SCAD this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a special time for both of us,'' the son said.
``It's given us a chance to get close. Baseball used to take him
away. Now it has brought us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiant spent nearly all of his pitching career separated from his
own father, a former Negro leagues standout in the 1930s and '40s.
Luis Tiant II was not allowed to leave Cuba to see his son pitch
until the 1975 World Series. He died the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of time has not lessened Tiant's bitterness toward
Cuban leader Fidel Castro. When he talks about the Cuban
government, the usually jovial Tiant's words come in angry bursts
laced with profanities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal relations, (never)'' Tiant says in his heavy Cuban
accent. ``We should never forget what has happened to the people in
Cuba for 40 years. . . . All baseball cares about is getting
players out of Cuba. It doesn't care about the suffering, just
money. . . . The Orioles shouldn't have gone to Cuba. This is a
free county, but that's the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiant, who pitched in the majors until 1982, faced his native
Cuba in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, when he was the pitching
coach for Nicaragua. He was a minor-league instructor for the
Chicago White Sox in 1997, then was hired by SCAD last year.
</P>
<P>
   SCAD President Richard Rowan had lured former college and NBA
star Cazzie Russell to head the school's NCAA Division III
basketball program the year before, but his hiring of Tiant was
even more stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dreamed about being a college coach for a long time,''
Tiant said. ``But with no education, I never thought I would get a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bees were only 14-22 in 1998, but were assured of a winning
season this year with a 4-2 victory over nationally ranked Emory
last weekend. SCAD was 19-17 going into its season finale Saturday
at Methodist College in North Carolina despite only 10 home games
and no practice field to call its own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the minor-league Savannah Sand Gnats took over Grayson
Stadium in early April with the start of the South Atlantic League
season, SCAD's practices have been held at batting cages run by
former Atlanta Braves second baseman Felix Millan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get our own field,'' said Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   But with El Tiante as an attraction, SCAD has no trouble
scheduling road games. This season, the Bees made a six-game trip
to California and twice visited New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in Boston, I always feel like I'm home,'' said Tiant,
who proudly wears his 1975 American League championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   Tiant and his players were guests at a Boston Celtics game and
the Fleet Center crowd rose and broke into chants of ``Louie,
Louie, Louie'' when Tiant's presence was announced and he was shown
on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost cry, I feel so good,'' Tiant admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played up there, he couldn't go anywhere without
someone stopping him,'' SCAD shortstop Tony Blankenship said. ``It
was obvious how much they still love him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, no Red Sox pitcher is likely to match Tiant's
popularity. Certainly, no one will duplicate Tiant's funky
delivery, in which he released the ball from all angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing he hasn't tried to teach anyone,'' freshman
pitcher Josh Lane said. ``Only one person could pitch like that.
And it was him.''

 &HT;    Jordan not buying Hornets result of Shinn's latest folly
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A collective groan could be heard throughout North
Carolina _ and in the New York office of commissioner David Stern _
when Michael Jordan ended negotiations last week to buy the
Charlotte Hornets from George Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   Hornet fans and Stern were hoping quietly for Jordan to take
over, not only because he's Jordan but also because it would remove
Shinn from the picture. Shinn has legal troubles on a sexual
misconduct allegation from a young woman and a messy divorce, along
with a reputation for being a tightwad. He confirmed his reputation
as irrational when he blew an opportunity to become business
partners with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown was over autonomy. Jordan wanted total control.
Shinn reportedly offered 100 percent control of basketball
decisions and 50 percent of business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Jordan ante up $80 million and then allow business
decisions to be made by a man who has run a once-viable franchise
into the ground? Jordan showed that by ending negotiations he's a
more keen businessman than Shinn.
</P>
<P>
   Beam Scotty up
</P>
<P>
   Bet Dennis Scott now wishes that he had taken the advice of his
buddy Shaquille O'Neal, who urged the former Georgia Tech star to
sign with the Lakers in the offseason. Scott wanted the Hawks, who
didn't want him, and ended up with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually got cut and signed with Minnesota. However, the
Timberwolves did not include him on the playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say I'm disappointed,'' said Scott, who averaged 9.1
points in 21 games. ``I wouldn't want to say frustrated. I'd rather
be playing to help the guys out. But they decided to go a different
direction. It's part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott wants to stay in Minnesota, but it's likely he'll be
searching for a new team in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Not-so-easy Rider
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider played well in the Trail Blazers' domination of
Phoenix in the first round and showed a modicum of restraint. But
he hardly was humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the reason why we started playing good again,'' Rider
said of Portland's decisive charge in Game 3. ``Our bodies were
looking scared, tentative. I cheered on my team and got in the
huddle and told guys to buckle down. I got us hyped. I kept us
together. I was the motivator. Yes, I was.''
</P>
<P>
   He did dominate the key matchup against Rex Chapman. He came
back from a sprained right knee in the third quarter. And he did
not fight Danny Manning when the Suns forward took him out on a
hard foul. Accomplishments, all, for Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Major star on the rise: forward Brian Grant, who shot 23-for-32
in the series. In the euphoric locker room, the Blazers, who hadn't
gotten out of the first round in seven years, loudly rooted for
Sacramento over Utah.Portland beat the Kings four times without a
loss this season.
</P>
<P>
   This 'n' that
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Tim Hardaway said that even though his knee is bothering
him he plans to participate in the Olympic qualifying tournament in
July in Puerto Rico. He missed the 1994 World Championships because
of knee surgery and the '98 World Championships because of the
lockout. . . . The Bulls will have at least $22.5 million under the
salary cap to spend next season _ and a lottery pick in the draft.
. . . The Cleveland Cavaliers plan a uniform change. ``It won't be
dramatic,'' owner Gordon Gund said, ``but it will bring it
current.''

 &HT;    Muzzlers unleashed: Georgia can expect its first black-powder
deer season to be a quick hit
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By the time Georgia is into its second muzzle-loading
season in 2000, the state should have 150,000 licensed black-powder
hunters, according to one of the industry's ``big three,'' and the
Wildlife Resources Division of the state Department of Natural
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hickey, CEO and owner of Connecticut Valley Arms, made his
prediction based on what has happened in other states inaugurating
new hunting seasons for primitive weapons.
</P>
<P>
   WRD's figure of 152,600 was derived from a 1992 survey studying
the feasibility of a muzzle-loading season. The survey also
projected a $50 million economic impact statewide, plus the
possible additional income of $1 million in new license sales. A
primitive-weapons license costs $8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is the last state east of the Rockies to the party,''
CVA President Dudley McGarity said. ``When the word gets out,
there's going to be an explosion _ pardon my pun _ of black-powder
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Sporting Goods Association,
muzzle-loading is ranked 12th among 59 sports in growth rate with
5.4 percent during 1998 and 3.1 million participants.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's first muzzle-loader season will be Oct. 16-22.
</P>
<P>
   WRD Director David Waller said Georgia had to find a place for a
muzzle-loading season. That didn't come about until last year, when
deer season was allowed to run from September to January without a
break in the Northern Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest sealed the deal. ``We think it has the potential
to create a lot of excitement over a new way to hunt,'' Waller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia, ever conservative, won't allow scopes on
muzzle-loaders, as other states did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of using primitive weapons is it's more
difficult, more of a challenge to use, and the idea of putting a
scope on a muzzle-loading flintlock just defies logic,'' Waller
said. The same goes for the inline muzzle-loaders. Even though they
look modern, Waller said they're still muzzle-loaders.
</P>
<P>
   So, predictions are that a substantial number of hunters will
make the decision to get into muzzle-loading even though it is a
pastime that requires more work _ loading and reloading, having to
get closer to game, just as bowhunters do, and not having a scope
to help on long shots. But black-powder arms makers have made
millions selling the same rifles and pistols carried by Daniel
Boone, Davey Crockett, Kit Carson and Jeremiah Johnson, because of
a huge attachment to America's past.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious to anyone in Dahlonega last weekend for the Long
Branch Buckskinners Spring Frolic, where people dressed in antique
clothing, carried antique guns and knives, competed in shooting
contests and traded wares _ including some beautiful handmade
muzzle-loading rifles _ and celebrated the way our ancestors lived
before the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   These traditionalists _ the buckskinners _ make up most of the
muzzle-loading crowd right now. But retailers think the new
muzzle-loading season will bring on a new breed.
</P>
<P>
   They will be modern deer hunters in every way except for their
rifles, which will get them an extra week of deer season.
</P>
<P>
   It starts that way, but in bowhunting, people started buying
compound bows and then moved into traditional longbows and
recurves.
</P>
<P>
   Some will be lured back to the basics, get a Pennsylvania
flintlock, a tomahawk, buckskin clothing, flint and steel for fire,
and become frontiersmen and women.

 &HT;    Time and money tighten for remaining free agents
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Reviews have been terrific so far for 321 Courtland,
the restaurant recently opened by former Georgia Tech defensive end
Marco Coleman and agent Brian Ransom. Given that Coleman is one of
the few quality free agent players remaining and that few teams
have sufficient salary-cap room, here's hoping business stays good
at the eatery.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman last week rejected a three-year, $4.5 million offer that
would have kept him in San Diego. The contract wasn't the free
agency windfall Coleman had hoped to land, and it included
compensation of just $1 million for this year.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out even faster than money and Coleman is
among the 125 unrestricted free agents still trying to secure a
paycheck for 1999. Not many of them turned down the kind of $3.2
milllion-a-year deal Coleman could have had with Bobby Ross in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman still could land a deal more in line with his abilities,
but it could be difficult in this tight market. Once the most
feared pass-rusher in the college game, he has just 33 1/2 sacks in
seven seasons. Since collecting a career-best 6 1/2 sacks in 1995,
he has just 9 1/2 more.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is one of the Chargers' veteran leaders and a good
player to have in the locker room, GM Bobby Beathard desperately
wanted Coleman back. But just hours after Coleman turned thumbs
down on the team's latest offer, Beathard signed defensive end Al
Fontenot instead.
</P>
<P>
   During every free agent signing period, some players and agents
overplay their hand or erroneously gauge their bargaining position,
and they eventually see the market go away from them. The group
this year includes WR Eric Metcalf (Arizona), CB Ashley Ambrose
(Cincinnati), LB Anthony Davis (Kansas City), CB Ryan McNeil (St.
Louis), OG Matt O'Dwyer (New York Jets), LB Kurt Gouveia (San
Diego), LB Jeff Brady (Carolina), CB Darrien Gordon (Denver) and SS
Stanley Richard (Washington).
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose or McNeil might benefit from the toe injury to Cowboys
cornerback Deion Sanders, but Dallas owner Jerry Jones has given no
indication yet that he is ready to make such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona linebacker Jamir Miller turned down a two-year,
$6 million offer to return to the Cards and had to settle last week
for a one-year, $1.3 million deal from Cleveland. Seven of the last
18 veterans to sign received the minimum salary of just $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not by accident that the biggest deals in free agency
typically get done in the first weeks of the signing period,'' said
agent Ralph Cindrich, whose preference for quick deals is well
known. ``That's when teams have cap room and agents have the
ability to actually negotiate, rather than have something jammed
down their throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   To collect most of his $68 million contract, Heisman Trophy
tailback Ricky Williams must average 1,600 yards for his first four
seasons in New Orleans. ... Tennessee GM Floyd Reese restructured
the contracts of offensive tackle Brad Hopkins and wide receiver
Yancey Thigpen last week. That created enough cap room for the
Titans to finish a deal with center Bruce Matthews, who months ago
agreed to a four-year contract worth $14.65 million. ... Agent Tank
Black, under investigation by the state of Florida and the NFL
Players Association for alleged recruiting violations, has enlisted
the aid of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ... The Falcons still have some
interest in free agent offensive guard Ian Beckles. ... Cable
television magnate Charles Dolan, who also owns the New York Knicks
and New York Rangers, is the early-line favorite to land the Jets.
The list of potential owners, though, will be a long one. Whoever
gets the franchise will want to move the Jets back to New York once
the lease at Giants Stadium expires after the 2007 season. ...
Former Auburn fullback Tony Richardson is having an impressive
offseason in Kansas City and could supplant Pro Bowler Kimble
Anders as the starter. ... Carolina probably will release guard
Corbin Lacina after June 1.

 &HT;    Medical mentors help boost learning
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eugene Semple reached into the white plastic tub of
body parts and pulled out another puzzle for the students from
Renfroe Middle School in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone know what this is?'' he asked, holding a weird,
red, saucer-shaped organ in his gloved right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A placenta?'' seventh-grader Jessica Rowland tentatively
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' Semple replied, pointing to the umbilical cord before
explaining its function in the uterus. ``We examine the placenta
just like all other tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Semple, an assistant pathologist, easily was the highlight of a
recent Saturday morning for students participating in their
``Health Adventures'' lesson at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur.
Repeatedly, they asked Semple to show another post-surgical organ
from the pile he was examining for signs of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heart. Do you have a heart in there?'' one boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, but let's see what I can find,'' Semple said.
</P>
<P>
   He produced a tiny brown stone, then a moldy gallbladder. His
audience winced, curled noses and managed to ``eew-yuck'' in
unison.
</P>
<P>
   The only such program of its kind in Georgia, Health Adventures
is a national initiative designed to reach vital terrain: young
people's brains. While learning about the medical field, they
improve mathematical and science skills. And, through a mission
statement and one-on-one adult mentors, they learn what it takes to
become a heart surgeon, a pediatrician, a physical therapist or
another specialist in the health field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to see the labor and delivery floor, and after that I
was inspired to become an obstetrician,'' said Zaneta Johnson, an
eighth-grader at Renfroe. She's paired with Dr. Caroline
Charles-May, a pediatrician in private practice. About half the
mentors are DeKalb Medical Center employees.
</P>
<P>
   The program is one of the many mentoring programs of ``America's
Promise'' Alliance for Youth, endorsed by former Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Colin Powell. The program was developed three years
ago by the American Society of Directors of Volunteer Services.
</P>
<P>
   Theresia Snelling, education coordinator for DeKalb Medical
Center laboratories, presented the most recent lesson with an
hour-long lecture and slide show about what goes on in a hospital
laboratory. Part of the slide show: what parasites, red blood
cells, sperm cells and yeast cells look like under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   That led to discussions of disease and some practical advice:
``I'm telling you young ladies, if you're wearing your bluejeans
really tight in August in Georgia, you will get a yeast
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with explicit, repeated ``do not touch anything''
instructions, the children walked through the numerous labs,
watching white-coated microbiologists and blood bank technicians in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say those who take part in the program always talk
about the weekend adventure come Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four of my students are in the program, and it's really
helped,'' said Beverly Cockerham, a reading and math teacher at
Renfroe. She also assists with the Saturday-morning sessions, which
are held once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their self-esteem has flourished and they feel good about
themselves,'' Cockerham said. ``They appreciate the T-shirts, the
lunches and the special attention paid to them.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, the 15 middle schoolers in the program will
``graduate'' with a cookout and trip to the Sci-Trek science
museum.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb Medical Center pays for all the educational supplies, the
red-and-blue Health Adventure shirts and the box lunches that end
the four-hour sessions. A bus deposits them at the hospital at 9:30
a.m., prime Saturday snooze time for most adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to give up the sleep at first,'' admitted Dylan
Foley, 13. ``But I got to like it because they're not just telling
you. You get to see where people work and you get involved.''

 &HT;    Church is reaching out to those abused in its school
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Decades later and half a world away from the defunct
West African boarding school where they suffered abuse as children,
dozens of adult offspring of Christian missionaries are meeting
this weekend in Gwinnett County to confront the anger, fear and
pain of the past and to move toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   They have been invited to Simpsonwood Conference and Retreat
Center by the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the denomination
that ran Mamou Alliance Academy, the school where, as young as 6,
they were beaten, fondled and forced to sit in their own waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to attempt some healing and reconciliation and
closure,'' said Robert Niklaus, director of communications for the
alliance, a conservative denomination of about 300,000 members with
missions in more than 50 countries. ``The basic premise is that
although the school is closed and these events took place years
ago, we do feel a responsibility to those who have been injured. We
want to do the right thing by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamou (Mah-MOO) Alliance Academy in Mamou, Guinea, operated from
the 1920s until 1971 in the fertile mountains of West Africa,
educating the children of missionaries serving in four countries
for the alliance and other evangelical groups.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the alliance has spent more than $400,000
investigating allegations of mistreatment of children at Mamou
during the 1950s and 1960s, providing therapy for former students,
disciplining former staff and establishing procedures to prevent
future abuse. After considering the testimony of about 80
witnesses, a six-member Independent Commission of Inquiry, made up
of mostly non-alliance members, found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Staff members beat children, sometimes to the point of
bruising or bleeding, with their hands, belts, a strap and, in the
case of one staff member, a rubber slipper, for offenses as minor
as ``getting his Sunday shoes wet.'' Among the victims was a child
whose arm had just been broken in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   _ A female teacher routinely turned over desks with students in
them, pulled hair, stabbed children with a pencil and shook,
pinched, slapped and scratched her pupils. She withheld permission
to go to the bathroom and forced children to sit in their own urine
and feces. A report by the independent commission described her
presence in the classroom as an ``ongoing reign of terror and
sadistic behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A male staff member fondled elementary school girls and
invoked public humiliation for children who were incontinent.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one staff member made children eat their own vomit.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission found seven former staff members and
two former students committed some form of abuse. Three of the
people were dead, two had left the CMA, and four had retired when
the commission made its report. Of the accused people who were
confronted by a disciplinary committee, one confessed, apologized
to students on videotape and agreed to a psycho-sexual evaluation
and recommended treatment. One was excused from disciplinary
hearings because of advanced Alzheimer's disease. Two were found
guilty, and a disciplinary committee was unable to render judgment
of another.
</P>
<P>
   In response to recommendations by the independent commission,
the alliance issued formal apologies to victims of abuse, reviewed
policies for evaluation of missionary school personnel, and is
establishing an Advocacy Network for Missionary Children and a
Sensitive Issues Team to deal with any future allegations of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission also suggested the Simpsonwood
retreat. Officials expect about 80 Mamou alumni and 50 of their
spouses and parents to attend. Some whole families will come _
parents, grown children and their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry, really angry,'' said Beverly Shellrude-Thompson,
47, a Toronto language school director who attended Mamou from age
6 until age 16, and says she was psychologically and sexually
abused there. ``But I want to at least give them the chance to do
this right. I want there to be at this retreat enough space for
people to be able to tell our stories to one another for parents,
for alumni, for spouses to connect with one another and have the
impetus to move on in our journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Shellrude-Thompson, her older sister, her younger brother and
their father will be at Simpsonwood.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Beardslee, 72; his wife, Ann, 70; and their two sons will
also be there. The Beardslees' boys both attended Mamou briefly in
the late 1950s but changed schools after the Beardslees left the
Christian and Missionary Alliance because of theological
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left them when they were little,'' said their mother. ``Now
we can be by their sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The older Beardslees, now retired and living in New Hampshire,
learned of problems at Mamou only last year after an article about
the investigation appeared in Christianity Today magazine. When
asked, their sons, Keith, now 48, and Howard, 46, confirmed the
details of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live with those regrets,'' said their father, who went on
to spend years in the mission field with the American Bible Society
and last worked as a pastoral psychotherapist before retiring. ``So
do a lot of parents, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a hard time forgiving myself for having sent them to
that school,'' said their mother, who served as associate director
of Church World Service, a disaster relief and refugee resettlement
program of the National Council of Churches. ``It never occurred to
me in those days that I could say `no,''' she said. ``Obedience to
God for me meant obedience to the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   When children were mistreated, or even when they struggled with
their studies, they were not allowed to let their parents know.
Mail was censored, the students were told, to make sure they were
not distracting their parents from their duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents would not be able to do the work of the Lord, and
then people would go to hell,'' said Shellrude-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   She said she blotted out the abuse she was subjected to at Mamou
until the 1980s, ``when I was 30 and falling apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the worst part was and always will be separation at
age 6,'' she said. ``Being away eight months a year for a
6-year-old is very destructive. Also, within evangelical and
fundamental communities, people have difficulty with expression of
emotion. Normal grieving was turned into something evil and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents went on about their work, trusting their colleagues at
Mamou to care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression then was good,'' said Doloris Burns Bandy, 75,
who sent four children to Mamou while she and her husband worked
among people in Mali. The school, she said, ``provided an education
for my children. It provided peer interaction that I could not have
given them on an isolated bush station.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago, Bandy, who now lives in Florida, learned
three of her four children had been abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were beaten on a routine basis,'' said her son, Stan Burns,
50, a wedding and family photographer living in Lawrenceville.
``Not hanging up a washcloth after a shower. Not taking a shower.
Leaving articles of clothing out of place in the room.'' Bandy and
her children, who will attend the retreat, have dealt with the
abuse, she said. ``I'm very grateful that it's all come out, and
they were able to express their hurts with me. We've talked about
it. We've prayed about it. We've asked forgiveness of each other.
It's been difficult, but every experience makes us stronger in our
walk with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the adults who spent time at Mamou as children, the
abuse has caused long-ranging effects. The independent commission
cited numbed emotions, accentuated or diminished memory, wariness,
difficulty with authority, sexual addiction, fear of intimacy,
spiritual insecurity and alienation from God as some of the results
reported by Mamou alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stan Burns nor Shellrude-Thompson is involved with a
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got too much of it when I was a kid,'' says Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in God,'' said Shellrude-Thompson. ``I actually am
quite spiritual. I've tried not to be, but I can't get away from
it. But I'm not sure I will ever again be able to be part of an
organized community.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Mamou alumni have stayed with the church and become
theologians, pastors, denomination officials and missionaries. One
of Burns' three sisters is a missionary on medical leave. Another
now works at a missionary school in the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Burns and his mother praise the Christian and Missionary
Alliance for its handling of the Mamou allegations, which began to
come to light in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The denomination has openly, publicly acknowledged that this
happened, that the things that happened were wrong,'' said Bandy.
``I feel they have gone the second, third and fourth mile to
rectify the situation. I greatly appreciate what the Christian and
Missionary Alliance has done.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Mamou alumni say the denomination should go further and
that other denominations who had children at Mamou and other
missionary schools should examine their effects on children.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Darr, 44, who was a leader in drawing attention
to abuse at Mamou, is now one of the founders of a new organization
called the Missionary Kids Safety Net. Darr, his two brothers and
his sister attended Mamou while their parents did mission work for
the Gospel Missionary Union, an independent missionary-sending
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Since word began to spread about the Mamou investigation, he
said, former students have come forward to tell of abuse at other
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Darr, a United Methodist minister in Illinois, said his group
sees the Simpsonwood retreat ``as a beginning, really, to open up
allegations of abuse at four or five other boarding schools.'' He
rattled off the names of schools in Ecuador, Gabon, Malaysia and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 evangelical denominations and organizations send
missionaries out today, said Darr. Those missionaries have about
12,000 children in about 120 schools. Since many of the
missionary-sending groups cooperate on other projects, they should
work together to address past wrongs and protect their children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge, huge problem,'' he said. ``They need to reach
out to these missionary kids who were so grievously wounded. Their
failure to do so, when these missionary kids come to them, in my
estimation is a repudiation of the very Gospel they repute to be
spreading around the world.''

 &HT;    Thrashers hope for first pick in lottery
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the odds generally are stacked against expansion
teams for immediate success, today the Thrashers have a chance to
overcome their first hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of five NHL teams in today's 12-team lottery with
a chance to secure the No. 1 pick in the June 26 entry draft in
Boston. Tampa Bay, which had the worst record in the league this
season, has a 26 percent chance in the weighted lottery to secure
the first pick, followed by the Thrashers and Vancouver at 16.9
percent, the New York Islanders at 10.8 and Nashville at 8.3.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will pick no lower than third in the first round
and will be slotted second in all other rounds. Teams can move up
no more than four spots from their current seeding and drop no more
than one. Each team will be assigned an allotment of numbers, and
hope that one matches the one on pingpong balls. The contest will
take place at NHL headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting excited about this,'' said Thrashers general
manager Don Waddell, who recently returned from the World
Championships in Norway. ``I wasn't going to go originally, but now
I'm glad I am. If we finish third, I'll be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus two best players available in the draft are Czech
center Patrick Stefan and right wing Pavel Brendl from Calgary,
although Stefan's series of concussions has clouded his status.
</P>
<P>
   The entry draft will come one day after the Thrashers' begin to
stock their roster in the expansion draft by selecting one player
off each of the existing 27 teams.

 &HT;    GM Waddell hits the road to scout talent
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Last June, Don Waddell was entrusted with the
responsibility of building a hockey team. The expansion Atlanta
Thrashers named Waddell, an assistant general manager of the
Detroit Red Wings, as their GM and primary architect, giving him
the authority to hire the coaching and scouting staffs and draft
the players.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the job, Waddell has been running a race against
the draft deadlines of June 25 and 26, when the original Thrashers
will be formed by the expansion and amateur drafts, respectively.
He has traveled through the U.S., Canada and Europe, scouting
thousands of players in hundreds of games in the NHL, minor
leagues, juniors, colleges and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Jeff Schultz
accompanied Waddell on a scouting trip to Milwaukee; Calgary;
Medicine Hat, Alberta; and Red Deer, Alberta; to gain some insight
into the general manager's task.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Chicago . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Where there is hockey, there is a tooth story, and it seems like
an appropriate time for Don Waddell to tell his.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers is behind
the wheel of a rental car heading north along Lake Michigan. But
thoughts of scouting the evening's minor-league hockey game between
the Milwaukee Admirals and Detroit Vipers do not warm him on a
chilly evening.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like somebody is operating a jackhammer in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killing me _ we've gotta stop for some aspirin,'' Waddell
says, trying not to sound like a chipmunk as he touches the back of
his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, his problems will be the defenseman who won't take the
body or the winger who would lose a match race with a Zamboni. But
now, the problem is a bridge that dates back to Waddell's playing
days. It has given him problems off and on, but the pain peaked the
night before in Calgary, where Thrashers scouts congregated at the
annual NHL Prospects Game.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get for winning your dental work in a football
wager. So the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing in Saginaw one year and I bet the team dentist
on the Super Bowl,'' Waddell said. ``I had my jaw broken and lost a
tooth in a game, so I needed a bridge. If I lost the bet, I
would've had to pay for the bridge, not that I had the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Waddell was rewarded with defective bridgework.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, he would have flown from Calgary to Atlanta to
visit a dentist had he not committed to meeting a reporter in
Chicago for the last four days of his latest marathon scouting
trip. An IHL game in Milwaukee; a juniors game in Medicine Hat,
Alberta; an NHL game in Calgary; another juniors game in Red Deer,
Alberta; then back to Calgary for a flight home. Four days, four
games, three leagues, two currencies and enough coffee to keep
several generations of Folgers children in silk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've cut down _ no more than three pots a day,'' Waddell says,
proud of his accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   He is serious. When Waddell is in Atlanta, rare these days,
office employees regularly bring him a fresh cup if they happen to
be near a coffee stand. On the road, he's on his own. The
coffee-maker in his hotel room never goes unused. The two-hour
drives from civilizations to frozen arena towns invariably includes
a stop at Tim Horton's Donuts, Canada's Krispy Kreme.
</P>
<P>
   The last stretch of this trip isn't considered hellish on the
Waddell scale of road swings. He has been home two days in the last
24, one week in the last eight. He estimates that he and his staff
of 12 will have at least eight reports on each of as many as 300
amateur prospects, 400 to 600 NHL players and 200 AHL and IHL
players. The GM and a dozen scouts will fly, drive, eat and stay in
enough motels to account for approximately $1 million in
expenditures by the time the bulk of the Thrashers' inaugural
roster is formed with the June 25-26 drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell probably doesn't need to see as many games in person as
he has. As team president Harvey Schiller told him, ``That's what
you have scouts for.'' But Waddell says, ``I want to see the
players for myself.'' He puts down his cell phone, having returned
two messages from other league GMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I figured this out before Christmas. I have
something like 500,000 air miles in my account. And if I ever lose
my job, I can stay at a hotel for six months, and I can rent a car
for over two years. So we'll be OK for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   Why an IHL game in Milwaukee? ``Milwaukee is Nashville's farm
team,'' Waddell says. ``This allows me to get a feel for their
depth and whether they made the right decisions in their expansion
draft when they got all those compensatory picks (for not drafting
certain veterans). It could affect our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a chance one of Detroit's unattached players might
be worth signing for the Thrashers' farm team. But when it's time
for the opening faceoff in the Bradley Center, Waddell is standing
in a corridor behind the Milwaukee bench, talking to the Admirals'
team dentist, who gives the NHL's newest executive two options:
take a prescription for painkillers until he gets back home or have
minor surgery _ now.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell chooses the latter, and accompanies the dentist to his
office a few blocks from the arena. As far as anybody knows, he
becomes the first general manager of an NHL expansion team to have
his gums cut into and a tooth drilled during a scouting trip. It
causes him to miss most of the game, but he makes it back for the
third period. Hey, he's tough _ he's a hockey executive. When he
returns to the press box, he is wearing a crooked smile as he says
what sounds like, ``Feels a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   He returns in time to see Detroit rally for a 4-3 win in a
shootout and takes a few mental notes, right down to what player
the Vipers choose to take their final faceoff in regulation. ``You
know those famous seven words in hockey: `Final minute of play in
the period.' Some scouts never hear those because they leave early.
Now I know who Detroit's best faceoff man is.'' He drives back to
Chicago. An early morning flight to Calgary awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is used to the travel, but he says: ``This is worse than
normal because we don't have any home games yet. Normally, I
wouldn't be running all over the world trying to catch these guys
for the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Canada
</P>
<P>
   Waddell spots a Tim Horton's in the Calgary airport and
pronounces, ``That'll be our stop on the way to Medicine Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Medicine Hat. Not to be confused with Saskatoon or Regina
or Kamloops or Red Deer or Prince Albert, some of the outposts that
make up the junior leagues. There are 53 teams in three leagues _
Western, Ontario and Quebec Major _ spread out mostly over the
Canadian provinces, with some in the United States, everything from
the Moose Jaw Warriors to Les Mooseheads de Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   The system is significantly different from baseball's. In
baseball, players are drafted out of high school or college. In
Canada _ where kids skate almost from the time they can walk _ boys
are playing organized hockey from the time they are five, are
scouted by junior teams at 12 and can be drafted as young as 14.
Most players in the league are 17 to 19, and they often remain in
the juniors even after being drafted in the NHL. But because the
junior teams are not affiliated with NHL clubs, a player's future
pro team has no control over how he is coached in the amateurs.
Players live with local families, receive a weekly stipend and have
their education arranged by the team. They play a schedule nearly
as long (70 games) as an NHL team's (82). They also can be traded.
</P>
<P>
   In Alberta, the towns are small and remote, separated by miles
of natural gas fields or farmland or nothing. For variety, there
are snowdrifts.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine Hat is known as ``The Gas City'' because of it's
reserves of natural gas. According to legend, the Cree's medicine
man deserted the tribe during a war with the Blackfoot and lost his
headdress as he tried to cross a steam. The Cree were slaughtered
and the site was named, ``Saamis,'' an Indian word meaning
``Medicine Man's Hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is less interested in the legend or ``The World's
Tallest Tepee'' off Highway 1 than he is in Jamie Lundmark, a
player for Moose Jaw, which faces the Medicine Hat Tigers in a
Western League game. Fights are so prevalent in this league that
two teams are not allowed to take their pregame skate at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Moose Jaw and Medicine Hat play a rather uninspired
game. But Lundmark notches a goal and two assists in a 7-3 win,
showing the quick hands and decision-making that impress Waddell
and John Gill, the Thrashers' West-based scout.
</P>
<P>
   Lundmark is from Edmonton and grew up watching Wayne Gretzky,
Mark Messier and Jari Kurri. He is asked if he's ever been to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but I've been to Seattle,'' he says. ``Is Atlanta on the
West Coast?''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near Detroit?''
</P>
<P>
   Keep going south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell smiles later when told about it. A knowledge of world
geography won't affect his selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't draft a guy we haven't interviewed,'' he said. ``Some
of these kids leave home when they're 15 or 16. It's tough for a
lot of them to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to project where a youth will play at the NHL level
in five or six years. The majority, if not all, of the Thrashers'
amateur draft picks won't play in the league next year. The player
most likely to make an immediate impact is Czech native Patrik
Stefan, who already is playing among older and stronger athletes in
the IHL. But Stefan has had injury problems, and making him the
first pick of a new franchise could be risky.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will draft first, second or third in the first
round. The team's personnel department is 12 deep, not including
Waddell. At the amateur level, there are about 40 teams in Europe
and 40 in U.S. colleges with players. All are graded on a scale of
1.0 to 5.0, and reports are filed via laptop computers into a
mainframe in Waddell's offices in CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell can access the reports at any time and does _ in the
early morning, late night or midday between flights, with a coffee
cup at his side. His computer includes software enabling him to
narrow a search for a certain type of player: a left winger at
least 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get anything I want without talking to my (scouts),''
Waddell said. ``I can see what each scout is doing, but they can't
see what the other scouts' reports are, and they can't see my
stuff. I want their own opinions. If five guys tell me the same
thing about No. 20 for Medicine Hat, we have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Calgary
</P>
<P>
   The focus shifts to the expansion draft as Waddell heads back to
civilization for an NHL game between the Flames and Los Angeles.
The Thrashers will draft for the present the day before they draft
for the future, selecting one player from each of 26 teams;
first-year Nashville is exempt.
</P>
<P>
   One fact is plain: The original Atlanta Thrashers will be
leftovers. First- and second-year players are exempt, and then
teams will protect 15 more players from their 24-man rosters. The
Thrashers must choose at least three goalies, eight defenseman and
12 forwards. Of the remaining three players, Waddell said, two will
be goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's roster's early fortunes will hinge on hockey's great
equalizer _ goaltending. Goaltending is a strength in the league,
and because they come into the league alone next season, they don't
have to worry about the selections of another team. The next
season, 2000-01, Minnesota and Columbus come in together.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell already has a pretty good fix on teams' protected lists.
And as the Flames and Kings are two nonplayoff teams, neither will
be providing the Thrashers with a centerpiece, particularly in
goal. The Kings are one of five teams exempt from losing a goalie
because it had one selected by Nashville. Calgary, because of
injuries and inadequacies, played a league-high six goalies this
year. In other words, any potential Atlanta player from these teams
is likely to be a fourth-line forward or minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Only one player stands out as the Kings and Flames play to a 2-2
tie: Flames goalie Fred Brathwaite, who stops 31 of 33 shots. But
5-foot-7 goalies seldom excite general managers. The game was worth
seeing for one reason, though. Afterward, Los Angeles coach Larry
Robinson vents to the media about the game's officiating, calling
it, ``The worst I've ever seen in my career.'' It's merely the
latest sign that Robinson, a Hall of Fame player, might not be cut
out for head coaching, hurting his potential candidacy for a job in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On to Red Deer
</P>
<P>
   The caravan grows. Waddell and Gill meet with another scout,
John Perpich, before making the 90-minute drive north to Red Deer.
(Worth noting: In 1992, a contest was held in England to determine
the world's dullest postcard. The winner among 382 entries was a
picture of the Red Deer museum.) Gill and Perpich live a scout's
life. They typically see five to seven games per week and are home
no more than a week out of a month.
</P>
<P>
   There are other places Perpich would rather be _ such as
Southern California. The schedule originally called for him to
watch Stefan, playing with the IHL's Long Beach Ice Dogs, for a few
home games. But a concussion knocked the player out of the lineup
and Perpich out of the sun and into Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to that trip,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is in the driver's seat for the drive to Red Deer. He
won't be a passenger if he can help it. Don't get between Don
Waddell and a coffee pot or a steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   During the drive to Red Deer, somebody mentions that Erie (Pa.)
forward Tim Connolly suffered a broken leg the other night.
Connolly is rated by the NHL's Central Scouting as the fourth-best
player in the juniors, behind only Stefan, Calgary's Pavel Brendl
and Lundmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you have to see these guys early,'' Waddell says.
</P>
<P>
   Team Thrasher pulls into the parking lot at the Centrium, a new
6,000-seat arena, in contrast with some of the barns on the
circuit. At least two dozen scouts are in attendance, mostly to see
Moose Jaw's Lundmark or another touted prospect, forward Justin
Mapletoft of the Red Deer Rebels (Web site: www.ripsnort.com).
</P>
<P>
   After his pregame coffee and separate chats with Gill and
Perpich, the three leave the scouts room and head into the stands,
sitting in different sections. Gill, in fact, is seated nowhere
near another scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys hang around together, travel together,
even talk to each other about players,'' Waddell says. ``It's
scouting by consensus. John has a reputation of being kind of a
loner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill has an impressive resume _ 11 years with Pittsburgh, three
with Colorado. He didn't know Waddell until seeing the new GM's
name on a news ticker along the bottom of his TV. ``I sent him a
resume the next day,'' Gill said. ``I wanted the chance to work
with an expansion team.''
</P>
<P>
   Moose Jaw travels well. The Warriors, with a significant
cheering section for the second game in a row, win 3-2. Lundmark
looks tired and goes pointless, but Mapletoft scores one of Red
Deer's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gill and Perpich speak in generics when asked if the Thrashers
are looking for a certain type of player. But Waddell makes it no
secret that he loves speed. If you are looking for a model for the
team, look at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But this amateur draft is getting more confusing than ever.
Stefan is out with his second concussion of the year. Lundmark is
talented but inconsistent. Brendl is on a scoring tear but some
scouts think that he ``floats'' too much. The top-two-rated
Europeans are Swedish twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin. But some
question their ability to play apart. Now word is that Henrik will
not declare himself eligible in June, keeping alive the chances he
can be drafted by his brother's team in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell met with his staff recently at a Prospects Game in
Calgary. ``We talked about five players for two hours,'' he said,
``because we all see things differently. There's still legitimately
six guys who can go No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Home alone
</P>
<P>
   Waddell, Gill and Perpich return to Calgary. The scouts have
flights the next day to different ponds. Waddell is returning to
Atlanta to see a man about a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the guy in Milwaukee did was temporary until I got back
to Atlanta,'' he said. ``I've never been so glad to get home just
so I can have root canal.''

COMMENTARY: HAUNTED BY SEGREGATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Miss.)  By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNICA COUNTY, Miss. _ I was ushered into the modest office of
C. Penn Owen Jr., the most powerful plantation owner and all-around
operator in this rural county in northern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke slowly. ``I'm sure I'll get fair treatment from you,''
he said. He managed to smile without smiling.
</P>
<P>
   We were in his office on Old Highway 61, an ancient two-lane
road that runs beside the Mississippi River. Owen is anxiously
trying to cash in on the casino boom in the county. He is already
building the first few houses of a large upscale development in an
unincorporated area called Robinsonville. But he has some problems.
The private homes and rental units he plans for the site have
deliberately been priced out of the reach of the overwhelmingly
black inhabitants of Tunica.
</P>
<P>
   The buyers will have to come from elsewhere, and by all accounts
most of them would be white. Big problem No. 1: The public schools
in Tunica County, woefully neglected for decades, are filled with
black students. Owen, in a reference to one of the schools, summed
up the matter nicely:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some fear and concern about the Rosa Fort
campus. The percentages, I guess, would be frightening to some
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is no chance the wealthy white families he
is trying to lure to his development would be willing to send their
kids to the nearly all-black public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Owen thought he had a solution. He planned to have his housing
development anchored by a brand new multimillion-dollar
state-of-the art elementary school. He sold the land for the school
to the Board of Education at a cut-rate price and for a while it
looked as if there was going to be a great new school for the
spiffy new families coming to Robinsonville.
</P>
<P>
   Except that some black people in the county, many of them
desperately poor and tired of doing the back-breaking work in the
cotton fields and elsewhere while watching a handful of exploitive
whites reap all the benefits, objected. Two local groups, Southern
Echo and Concerned Citizens for a Better Tunica County, challenged
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that the county was ordered to desegregate its
schools nearly three decades ago by the federal government. Whites
responded to that order by pulling their children out of the public
schools and setting up a vile system of private academies for white
children only. In Tunica County the white academy is called the
Tunica Institute of Learning. A large slave bell sits proudly on
its front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Owen and other plantation owners and developers now find their
grand plans for Robinsonville jeopardized by the persistence of a
segregated system they thought was just fine until now. Because the
Tunica school board is operating under a desegregation order, it
has to get approval from the Department of Justice in Washington
before it can build a new school. Justice officials, after
listening to local objections, have refused so far to approve the
plan. They noted several months ago that there ``is virtually no
student population in Robinsonville'' and they agreed that the
children moving into Owen's development would most likely be white.
</P>
<P>
   Owen and his allies, frustrated, now insist that there is no
chance the proposed school would be predominantly white. They are
prepared to scour the county for black children to enroll in the
school. Owen's houses are not selling very quickly and one way or
another he needs that school to go up.
</P>
<P>
   Penda Hair, co-director of the Advancement Project, a national
civil rights advocacy organization that is working with the local
groups in Tunica, said black students may be funneled into the
school initially but that they would soon be numerically
overwhelmed by white students from the development. ``The families
that move there will see it as their neighborhood school,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would have been a problem if whites in Tunica and
the rest of Mississippi had at any time over the last half-century
dealt fairly with the black population and with the issue of
segregated schools. Bigotry always cuts two ways, which is why
Mississippi has for so long been one of the most backward states in
the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why this race issue has to come into it at all,''
said Penn Owen. ``When I go into the casinos I see colored people,
I see Hispanics, I see Orientals in very top positions. I don't get
it.''

COMMENTARY: BILL SAYS CHILL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The pressure's on for Al Gore to relax.
</P>
<P>
   I bet he is in a room somewhere right now playing Barry White
CDs and struggling to get mellow.
</P>
<P>
   It's painful to picture the coiled vice president trying to
uncoil.
</P>
<P>
   Will the father of the Internet soak in a soothing aromatherapy
bath or ask those Buddhist monks for a mantra? Will the hero of
``Love Story'' try reflexology on his feet? Will Farmer Al darken
his West Wing office and get daily 90-minute massages with that New
Age music that sounds like whales mating?
</P>
<P>
   He has no choice. He has to loosen up and dress down. It's a
presidential directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told him to go out and have a good time, talk about
what he would do in the next four years, just enjoy himself and let
people see him the way I see him,'' President Clinton told Richard
Berke, the chief political correspondent of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy himself? That's easy for Clinton to say. After all, a new
Fox poll asked, ``Who do you think would be more fun to hang out
with, the president or the vice president?'' Forty-nine percent
chose Bill and only 19 percent chose Al.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the reasons are piling up for Gore to stay uptight.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassingly, he is losing the women's vote to W., the same
vote that Saturday Night Bill kept solid despite sexual harassment
charges, despite an affair with an intern, despite humiliating his
wife, despite a rape accusation. Gore, ever the faithful husband,
ever the champion of diversity, shows up with posies and chocolates
and women voters slam the door in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassingly, W. has already raised $13 million sitting on his
porch in Austin, while the vice president has endured a
cross-country marathon and reported only $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassingly, Gore, who got in trouble over money, recruits as
his campaign chairman Tony Coelho, who got in trouble over money.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, the president rushes in to infantilize his
vice president, calling Berke to offer an extremely rare interview.
The president meant to praise his friend but ended up broadcasting
his fears that Gore's rigor mortis could be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's idea of shoring up his vice president is to say the
Gore campaign is not as bad as it was eight weeks ago. He notes
that his partner is ``smart'' to put distance between them on the
campaign trail, and be his own man. But at the same time, he plays
the puppeteer, Gore's Dick Morris. It's classic Bill Clinton. By
endorsing the distancing tactic on the front page, he undercuts it.
That'll teach Al to try to escape Bill's embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The call to the Times was remarkably revealing. You'd think _ or
hope _ that the commander in chief would have something more
important to do than Lanny Davis-style deadline spinning for Al
Gore. Doesn't he have enough problems? Shouldn't he be focusing on
bombing the Serbs instead of the Chinese _ who could soon have a
warhead they stole from us aimed at us?
</P>
<P>
   Clintonites say that getting advice on politics from Bill
Clinton is like getting advice on basketball from Michael Jordan.
But with his rescue-spin call the president's shot a brick.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's counsel for Gore to get casual and lose the blue suit
illustrates the box Gore finds himself in. The next time Gore
saunters out in his khakis and a polo shirt, he'll just look like a
tight guy who had his clothes laid out by a loose guy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is in a spiral of self-consciousness. He's also in a bind.
On the one hand, his numbers are depressed by the fact that people
are holding him accountable for an administration that has
exhausted everyone with its big and small scandals. That is why on
the campaign trail, the vice president never mentions the
president's name. On the other hand, he needs the Clintons' help.
</P>
<P>
   The president is determined to have Gore succeed him because he
is convinced _ wrongly, I think _ that it will validate his own
legacy. Also, Clinton's two loves are campaigning and being the
center of attention. Without a campaign of his own, it is
inevitable that he will try to inject himself as campaign
strategist, for either Al or Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore crowd is livid about the president's interview. The
vice president himself is unhappy that his inevitability has become
evitable. He must be steamed at the president.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it even harder for Al to chill.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Oh, for the want of a good map. So went the lament
last week from Pentagon and CIA analysts in the wake of NATO's
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, an accident blamed
largely on the use by targeting experts of a faulty map.
</P>
<P>
   The air war over Yugoslavia is now almost solely reliant on
bombs dropped with pinpoint precision. But the hundreds of cruise
missiles and satellite-steered 2,000-pound bombs, including three
from a stealthy B-2 bomber that ripped into a building the CIA
confused with a Yugoslav arms agency down the street, are only as
accurate as the information on which they are based.
</P>
<P>
   And as Pentagon planners unleash the full fury of air power not
only on isolated Yugoslav military bases but on headquarters
buildings in downtown Belgrade, pressure is mounting on military
mapmakers to be more precise than ever in identifying which targets
are fair game and which definitely are not.
</P>
<P>
   To avert another such mishap, Defense Secretary William Cohen
announced a series of corrective steps last week, including
speedier updates from government analysts to the military's
so-called no-strike list: churches, schools, embassies and cultural
shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the billions poured into building B-2 bombers or
launching secret spy satellites, the art of military mapmaking and
analyzing reconnaissance photographs has been given short shrift in
the post-Cold War budget battles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big sexy things are easier to convince people to buy than
the infrastructure to support them,'' a senior intelligence
official said..
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the number of mapmakers at the National
Imagery and Mapping Agency, the military's chartmaker, has dropped
by about one-third, and the number of photographic analysts is down
by nearly half. Meanwhile, the workload has escalated. ``It's a
reaping of the harvest of the underinvestment in our intelligence
capabilities,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the House
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Cold War, the Pentagon and Congress thought
the country could afford fewer experts tracking Soviet missile
silos.
</P>
<P>
   But with today's diplomacy more often than not enforced by
laser-guided bombs, targeters demand enough exactness to put those
bombs down the air shafts of buildings in Baghdad, Khartoum or
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with fast-paced events and unpredictable hot spots is
tough on cartographers, a painstakingly studious bunch who normally
take months to churn out a detailed paper map.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it's no surprise that just a few months ago, the
federal mapping agency awarded a $600 million contract to 15
commercial mapmakers and imagery companies to help keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cohen noted another problem last week: Other
government agencies, including the State Department, apparently
failed to alert the mapping agency of the Chinese Embassy's new
location. Which only underscores that the mapmakers, like the smart
bombs themselves, are only as good as the information they get.

 &HT;    Legislators glad contrary Mississippi governor must go
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ He has been called a bulldog who taunts his
enemies with nicknames, speaks to legislators in vetoes and touts
Christian family values while having public battles with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As Kirk Fordice finishes out his final term as Mississippi's
first Republican governor since Reconstruction, he has been exactly
what he said he would be: thequintessential anti-politician,
uncoached and uncoachable. And while his straightforward style may
play well with voters _ some observers say he would win a third
term if the law allowed _ it has been a dismal failure with the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just doesn't talk to legislators, period,'' said state Sen.
W.L. Rayborn, a Democrat. ``The Mississippi Legis- lature works
like this: You come in with your hat in your hand and say, `Please
do this.' His mentality was, `Do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   During this year's session, Fordice brought his dog to the state
Capitol and played fetch with it in the halls, prompting a lawmaker
to propose a resolution banning pets in the building. The bill
died, but not without some debate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his standoff with the Democratic-controlled
Legislature, Fordice's agenda died year after year. And major bills
in the last eight years, many of which were designed to improve the
state's schools, have passed over his vetoes. The veto overrides
often were initiated by Republicans, who then suffered public
harangues by the governor. During this year's legislative session,
Fordice invited the Republican lawmakers to the Governor's Mansion
for a social event, then blasted them as ``traitors'' for
overriding one of his many vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Farmer's Almanac, there's Leaf Day and Flower Day.
Fordice was born on Contrary Day,'' said Joseph Parker, a political
science professor at the University of Southern Mississippi. ``He's
just a contentious, difficult guy, and he'll be that way until the
end. There is no sign of him mellowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordice, 65, who refused to be interviewed for this article, has
offended everyone from his wife to entire racial groups. He refers
to Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, as ``that pencil-neck
guy'' and calls state Attorney General Mike Moore ``Flashbulb''
because of his highly publicized lawsuit against the tobacco
industry. Fordice passionately opposed Moore's lawsuit, which was
the first of its kind and led to a national settlement between the
states and the tobacco industry over public health spending to
treat sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice has offended blacks on several occasions. He wore a
Confederate tie when he blocked funding for a minority business
loan program. He invoked dark civil rights-era memories when he
said he would call out the National Guard if the courts ordered the
state to spend more on Mississippi's historically black colleges.
And he is an outspoken supporter of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, a Southern organization widely considered to be racist.
</P>
<P>
   On at least three occasions, Fordice has humiliated his wife of
43 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he announced he and his wife had ``irreconcilable
marital differences'' and implied divorce was imminent. Pat
Fordice, in turn, announced that she had no intention of getting a
divorce. The couple made a public show of reconciling a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, on Election Day, Fordice was driving alone on
Interstate 55 from Memphis to Jackson when his Jeep Cherokee veered
off the road, flipped and caught fire. The crash was called a
``mystery'' by authorities, but even more mysterious was the
governor's whereabouts before the crash. He was seen at a Memphis
restaurant with a middle-aged woman. Fordice offered no
explanation, saying only that he had no memory of that day. He went
on to condemn President Clinton when his affair with intern Monica
Lewinsky became public.
</P>
<P>
   In April, several Jackson media outlets revealed that Fordice
had bought a house in a Jackson suburb _ a house his wife said she
knew nothing about. ``I know it is not for me,'' Pat Fordice told a
television station.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Fordice's relationship with the Legislature that has
stirred the most controversy. He quickly developed a reputation for
answering legislative proposals with a veto and no discussion or
alternative. He has vetoed 126 bills, more than the last two
governors combined. Early in his first term, the Legistature
overrode his veto of a sales tax increase for education, in large
part because the governor offered no alternative to aid the state's
notoriously poor-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature overrode a veto in order to pass a politically
risky sales tax increase _ in an election year,'' Parker pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mike Chaney, a Republican, is an old friend of
Fordice's, but admitted that Fordice ``jumps'' on the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been kind in his remarks to the Legislature,'' said
Chaney, who led the charge to override Fordice's veto of a major
education bill. That bill, passed in 1997, gives more state money
to schools in poor areas where local funds are short. Mississippi
was the first state to pass an ``adequate education'' program.
Seventeen states have been forced to do so by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor may not agree with me, but we are still
friends,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators are not so forgiving. During Fordice's final
State of the State address in January, not a single person clapped
during or after his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice has led the state through times of unprecedented
prosperity. Thanks to the booming casino industry, the state is
enjoying a budget surplus and has more jobs than people to fill
them. But critics say his inability to come up with progressive
ideas have hurt the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he missed some great opportunities,'' Rayborn said.
``We've been a little flush with money and having good times. If
we'd had a governor with some good ideas, maybe Mississippi could
have caught up to the rest of the country. We're always so far
behind on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   How Fordice's eight years will affect this year's governor's
race is unclear. Observers say that historically Mississippians
vote for a candidate, not a party. Neither of the front-runners for
the Aug. 3 primaries _ former U.S. Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican,
and Musgrove, the Democratic lieutenant governor _ has the
in-your-face style of Fordice, but both have extensive experience
in government, also unlike Fordice.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who served in Congress for 10 years, first as a Democrat
then as a Republican, says he is not as confrontational as Fordice
and that he has the experience of working with legislators,
something Fordice lacked. But he praises the governor for leading
the state through good economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fordice brought business principles to play in state
government,'' he said. ``He made state agencies more accountable.
We're on the cusp of some really fantastic changes and we're
looking forward to continued growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove, who as a state legislator helped write the adequate
education legislation, says he will work with the Legislature, not
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Fordice because he speaks his mind,'' he said.
``But I also believe they want someone who has been taught to
respect other people and who believes other people's opinions are
valid.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas Parham visited his doctor in the summer of 1995, he
expected just another routine checkup. But his doctor had something
else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Peter Arcan, suggested that Parham might want to
join a study of a new drug to shrink enlarged prostates, according
to records of the encounter. Parham was puzzled _ his prostate was
fine. But Arcan brushed aside the retired metal worker's questions,
saying the experimental drug might prevent future problems.
Satisfied, Parham, a 64-year-old resident of La Habra, Calif.,
agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   There was one question Parham did not ask: What was in it for
Arcan?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was money. The drug's maker, SmithKline Beecham PLC,
was paying $1,610 for each patient that doctors signed up _ money
that covered study expenses while allowing a portion to end up as
profit for Arcan and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Parham had no idea. ``Nothing was mentioned about money,'' he
said in an interview. ``It's a situation where you have faith in
your doctor.'' Through his secretary, Arcan declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   With his decision, Parham had unwittingly joined hundreds of
thousands of other patients recruited by their personal physicians
into a booming venture: the business of testing experimental drugs
on people.
</P>
<P>
   Once clinical research was a staid enterprise primarily
administered by academic researchers driven by a desire for
knowledge, fame or career advancement. Now, it is a
multibillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of testing and drug
companies working with thousands of private doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In this new industry, patients have become commodities, bought
and traded by testing companies and doctors. Almost daily, the
industry urges doctors to join the gold rush, bombarding them with
faxes and letters blaring such come-ons as ``Improve Your Cash
Flow'' and ``Discover the Secret For Obtaining More Funded
Studies.'' In an era of managed care, the pleas are seductive: The
number of private doctors in research since 1990 has almost
tripled, and top recruiters can earn as much as $500,000 to $1
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   This new system is a boon for drug companies because it reaches
out to a vast pool of test subjects who have never before been
available for experimentation. But it also injects the interests of
a giant industry into the delicate doctor-patient relationship,
usually without the patient realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   These changes have prompted little public debate, mostly because
the full scope of what is happening is hidden. The industry treats
research agreements as corporate secrets and contractually forbids
doctors to disclose them. As a result, few people outside the
industry, including government officials, have seen the contracts
or know the magnitude of the money involved.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-month investigation, The New York Times obtained
such contracts and thousands of other confidential documents that
present a view of the research industry that has never before been
available.
</P>
<P>
   These records, and interviews with participants, reveal a system
fueling a pharmaceutical renaissance, but fraught with conflicts of
interest; that places a premium on speed and meeting quotas; that
relies on government and private monitoring that can be easily
fooled and that some researchers said is inadequate; and that
secretly offers a share of the cash to other health professionals
who might influence patients to join a study. At bottom, the only
thing separating a trusting patient from a study that could be
inappropriate or potentially harmful is the judgment of a doctor
torn by these unseen conflicts and pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, including contracts, protocols or related
financial records from more than 300 recent drug studies, were
provided by a number of people in the industry concerned about its
direction. The Times also conducted a computer analysis of more
than 200,000 filings with the government and related data submitted
by doctors who want to conduct research, and interviewed doctors,
patients, ethicists, industry executives and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the specific findings of The Times'
investigation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drug companies and their contractors offer large payments to
doctors, nurses and other medical staff to encourage them to
recruit patients quickly. And doctors do not even have to conduct
trials to get paid: There are finder's fees for those who refer
their patients to other doctors conducting research.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors who recruit the most patients receive additional
perquisites, such as the right to claim a coveted authorship of
published papers about the studies _ even though the true author is
a ghostwriter using analysis from the drug company. Those who fail
to meet the recruitment goals are usually dropped from future
studies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Testing companies often use doctors as clinical investigators
regardless of their specialty, at times leaving patients in the
care of doctors who know little about their condition. For example,
psychiatrists have conducted Pap smears and asthma specialists have
dispensed experimental psychiatric drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing number of doctors conducting drug research have
limited experience as clinical investigators, raising questions
among some experts about the quality of their data.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, industry officials and researchers said the
emerging drug-approval system was dedicated to quality and offers
significant benefits. Since patients are seeing their own doctors,
researchers said, it adds a level of continuity and personal
contact to the process _ something unavailable from full-time
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, industry officials said, the new pool of test subjects
is a resource of incalculable value that is allowing the
development of an avalanche of new compounds. Drug tests ``can get
delayed if the patients aren't out there and available,'' said
Chris Kuebler, the chairman and chief executive at Covance Inc., a
giant testing company.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said patients were being pushed to participate
in the studies because of the financial interests of their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors working as researchers ``are enticing and cajoling
patients who are in no position to resist their blandishments to
enter clinical studies,'' said Dr. David Shimm, a member of the
ethics committee at Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver who has
written about research conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the patients are not seeing is that the clinical
investigator is really a dual agent with divided loyalties between
the patient and the pharmaceutical company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While patients must sign detailed consent forms to enroll in
drug studies, they are often in no position to question their
doctor's suggestion that they join.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician has enormous power over you,'' said Uwe
Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, who
himself recently agreed to participate in a clinical trial run by
his doctor _ in part because he feared annoying him _ and who had
no idea that money might be involved. ``You want to keep his favor.
If you say no, you'll worry that he may not like you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with Parham and Arcan. In joining the
study, Parham said: ``I just followed his advice, just like if he
said to take two aspirin instead of one. He's a doctor and I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Parham should never have been signed up for the
prostate study. According to his medical records, he had been
hospitalized the previous year with a chronic slow heart rate, a
condition that specifically disqualified him for the study. But,
saying that Parham's heart rate was only mildly slow, an
administrator handling the paperwork for Arcan sought an exemption
from SmithKline. Based on those representations, the drug company
granted the exemption; it was not told about Parham's earlier
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after joining, Parham complained of fatigue, a symptom of
his slow heart rate. Arcan dismissed the complaints as emotional.
Within weeks, Parham asked to be dropped from the study. Days later
he was hospitalized and given a pacemaker; Parham never brought
legal action and it is impossible to know whether his participation
in the study affected his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   His experience underscores a potential danger of the emerging
drug-testing system: Doctors with money at stake may persuade
patients to take drugs that are inappropriate or even unsafe. Under
the current system of monitoring, such actions are almost
impossible to catch and no statistics are collected on such events.
Within the industry, most of the planning focuses on conducting
studies quickly. Patient issues, some researchers said, are often
lost in the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the trade meetings on clinical research; you go for
two entire days, and patients are not mentioned,'' said Dr. Robert
Califf, the director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, an
academic drug-testing center in Durham, N.C., affiliated with Duke
University. ``The patient is an object to make money. Having
patients is just the dirty price for doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter sent out last July by Merck &AMP; Co. was nothing if not
sympathetic. The company recognized that doctors involved in its
study of a hypertension medication were having trouble finding
qualified patients. And so, with the letter, Merck offered a little
encouragement for them to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying $2,955 for each test subject enrolled, Merck
offered $500 more in the study comparing the drug Losartan with a
placebo. For those doctors who enrolled their quota of 14 patients
by Sept. 30, the company would kick in an additional $2,000 _
making that 14th patient worth $5,455 if recruited in time, and the
entire group potentially worth more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will forward the first check as soon as the first four
additional patients are enrolled,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering how effective paying doctors to recruit
patients can be, the drug industry has opened the financial
floodgates. Special cash bonuses for signing up specified numbers
of people by a given date, a practice once unheard of in clinical
research, are becoming part of the landscape. Moreover, those
payments _ to private doctors, research firms and even to
university medical centers _ are only one of a number of incentives
dangled by drug and testing companies to entice the medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   There are payments to everyone in the system who can come up
with a patient, from other doctors who refer them for research to
the study coordinators in the researcher's office who screen
patients to see if they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   None of these benefits are scrutinized by government regulators,
who said in interviews that they saw no difference between
providing grants for university research and paying doctors
directly. For academics ``the money is just as important as with
the internal medicine guy trying to beat the HMO,'' said Dr. Murray
Lumpkin, the deputy director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research at the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike block grants, today's incentives can grow almost day
by day, if the doctor works the way the drug companies want. And
the variety of the incentives is almost endless.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic form of compensation is a flat fee paid for each
patient enrolled. The amount of money paid to the researchers
varies widely, depending on the complexity of the study, the number
of tests involved and the difficulty in finding patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1996, a study of a migraine drug sponsored by
Janssen Pharmaceutica, a unit of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, paid doctors
$3,600 for each enrollment. Another study that year sponsored by
Organon Inc. on a new birth control pill paid $1,100 for each
patient. And a Wyeth-Ayerst study of drugs for hormone replacement
in women paid $4,581.
</P>
<P>
   While all of these payments were made to specific clinics, the
exact amounts on a single test could vary slightly by region, or
even by clinic.

   ISRAEL-ELECTIONS _ JERUSALEM _ From Gaza to Washington to

in tiny Israel. For months, the region has been on hold _ Arafat
has held off his declaration of statehood, Syria held off
negotiations over the Golan Heights, Bill Clinton has set aside
efforts to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The
Israeli choice comes down to consummate politician Benjamin
Netanyahu against decorated general Ehud Barak. Most world leaders
want Barak, because they see him as more flexible on the peace
process. That might be exactly why most of Israel, still nervous
about its future among hostile neighbors, could choose hard-line
Netanyahu. Will wrap in recent news in the election and touch on

   MISSIONARY-ABUSE _ From 1950 until 1971, children in the Mamou
Alliance Academy were routinely abused, physically, sexually and
psychologically. The African school served about 200 children of
missionaries from the U.S.-based Missionary Alliance (now the
Christian and Missionary Alliance) and other missionary
organizations until it was closed in 1971. When, decades later,
accusations of the long-grown children came to light, the Christian
and Missionary Alliance, which had run the boarding school, did not
take legal advice to deny and ignore the whole scandal, but ordered
a full-scale, independent investigation that confirmed many of the
allegations. Reports made public in late 1998 concluded that scores
of acts of repeated abuse occurred at the school _ from children
being forced to eat their own vomit, to bloody beatings with a
piece of rubber tire to repeated molestation by both male and
female staff members of both male and female students. Many of
those former children and some denominational officials are

publicly come out in full support of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, the group that got Trent Lott in so much trouble. The
Legislature tried to pass a law banning dogs in the capitol because
Fordice kept walking his through. And what about that mysterious

 UNDATED: by clinic. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many executives from drug or testing companies refused to
discuss their research programs, citing confidentiality. Those who
did grant interviews gave consistent explanations of their
payments: They are necessary compensation for the doctors' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up contracts that hopefully reimburse investigators
adequately for the time they put in to screen patients, bring them
in, and provide data to us that is as clean as possible,'' Dr.
Elizabeth Stoner, the vice president for clinical research and
contract management at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional payments can be made, she said, when there is
``additional effort above and beyond what they anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who are particularly successful in recruiting study
patients and keeping down their costs can make huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physicians who can net about $500,000 to $1 million
a year doing clinical research,'' said Ismail Shalaby, the chief
executive of Nema Research Inc., a network of doctors and hospitals
in the Baltimore area performing clinical research. ``And that is
not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to the doctors who conduct research are not simply
financial. Once, researchers said, the names that appeared on
papers describing drug studies were those of the actual authors.
That is no longer always the case. Today, the coveted right to
claim authorship is often just another reward for doctors who
recruit the most patients _ even if they wrote nothing and analyzed
no data.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to ask you to write,'' said Dr. Thierry Le Jemtel, a
cardiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., who
is a longtime academic researcher. ``Now, they send you a paper all
written by a medical writer'' hired by the drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Grossman, a private-practice doctor who is an allergy
and respiratory specialist with Vivra Asthma and Allergy Inc. in
Tucson, Ariz., said he was often a lead author on publications
because he had been a top patient recruiter in the clinical trials,
even though he rarely did much _ if any _ of the actual writing.
``That's common,'' he said. ``It's orchestrated by the drug
company's medical writer.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Grossman cited a study for a SmithKline Beecham
asthma medication that was published in The Journal of Asthma and
another on an allergy medication sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharmaceutical published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology. While the articles are written by a drug company
writer, Grossman said, he often suggests modifications.
</P>
<P>
   As drug companies compete for top study doctors who will quickly
accrue patients, a financial arms race has developed, with each
company seeking new ways to use cash and benefits to spur the
research.
</P>
<P>
   One practice is to offer finder's fees to doctors who are not
conducting studies for referring patients to doctors who are. For
example, a letter from a testing company handling the research on a
vaginal suppository for Bayer Corp. in 1996 promised ``a $75
referral fee for physicians and area/federally funded clinics,
i.e., Planned Parenthood, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Even study coordinators _ the nurses and medical assistants who
oversee the administrative details of a study and screen patients
to see if they qualify _ are offered fees for finding test
subjects. In 1995, for example, Pharmaceutical Product Development
Inc. of Wilmington, N.C., which coordinates drug tests, needed a
way to speed up enrollment in a study of a drug developed by Zambon
Corp. in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   So the company sent a fax to medical staff members who were
screening patients around the country, offering them bonuses for
fast enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``EVERY study coordinator has the chance to receive $750 just by
reaching the enrollment goal of 30 evaluable patients,'' the fax
said. ``So GET BUSY!''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up competition among drug companies for the services
of doctors led to the development of cash bonuses for them, one of
the most controversial incentives now offered. But even companies
that were uncomfortable with the idea found it hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue,'' said Dr. Cynthia Dunn, the director of
the Clinical Research Institute at the University of Rochester and
a former drug industry executive. ``On one hand, many companies
recognize it's part of what we have to do to be competitive. On the
other hand, they recognize they are setting up potential conflicts
of interest'' for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Some large drug companies have refused to offer bonuses out of
ethical concerns. ``You don't want to provide an advantage that can
be misinterpreted,'' said Dr. Joseph Camardo, the senior vice
president of clinical research and development for Wyeth-Ayerst
Research in Radnor, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses all reward the same behavior: enrolling patients
fast. For example, a contract last year by Ibah Inc., a testing
company owned by Omnicare Inc., provided a $750 bonus for each
patient enrolled by June 15 or $500 for those enrolled between June
15 and July 16 _ upping the ante for doctors whose enrollments were
lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Such incentives outrage some experts. Bonuses in clinical
research are ``inappropriate, potentially illegal and certainly
unethical,'' Dr. Robert Tenery, a Dallas doctor who is the chairman
of the council on ethical and judicial affairs for the American
Medical Association, said of such payments in general. ``Why would
you get an extra $500? How can you explain the rationale? Maybe you
took a patient who really didn't need to be enrolled.''
</P>
<P>
   If something goes wrong, doctors might never be able to escape
the nagging doubt that the bonus program was to blame. ``How would
you like to confront the family when a family member got hurt, and
you got a bonus for enrolling?'' asked Michael Leahey, the director
of the office of clinical trials at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York.

 UNDATED: New York. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A system that offers so much cash and benefits for quick
recruitment assumes that doctors would never allow money to distort
their judgment _ in this case by causing them to put undue pressure
on reluctant patients or to include patients who do not qualify.
But the assumption that doctors can resist financial temptations
has been proved wrong repeatedly in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, throughout much of the 1980s, doctors could refer
patients to treatment centers _ such as physical or radiation
therapy sites _ in which they had a stake. The practice was
outlawed after studies found that doctors were overusing treatments
and tests when they had financial interests in the centers that
provided them. A 1992 study published in The New England Journal of
Medicine found that doctors with investments in radiation sites
prescribed such treatment as much as 60 percent more often than
those without the financial conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With such studies demonstrating the effects of financial
incentives on doctors, experts who have studied these conflicts
said they were troubled by the emergence of research for hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a recipe for trouble or abuse,'' said Marc Rodwin, an
associate professor of law and public policy at the School of
Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University and the
author of a book on financial conflicts in medicine. ``The risk is
that the doctor will subconsciously downplay the risks or overplay
the benefits'' of a particular study in order to persuade a patient
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, companies sometimes fail to consider how
difficult it will be to find patients to meet the requirements they
set for admission into a study. Then, when recruitment falls short
of expectations, they offer to pay more to meet an unrealistic goal
_ looking, for example, for patients with a disease that their drug
can treat but who have no other health problems that could affect
the study.
</P>

   ``The simplest solution that inexperienced people think of first
is to increase the number of sites or to increase the amount of
money you're offering,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, the senior vice
president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade
group for large drug companies. ``You can offer to triple the
amount of money and it will make zero difference if the doctors are
doing everything they can do. It may be that the patients don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with so much money dangling in front of them, doctors could
be tempted to bend the rules to get patients into studies, and
could get away with it, according to Dr. Martha Elks, an associate
dean at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. ``Let's say you're
dealing with an angina study where the requirement for entry is a
certain level of pain on a certain number of days of the week,''
Elks said. And ``suppose the patient's history is not quite that
but is borderline.''
</P>
<P>
   Elks said she overheard two doctors talking recently about
bonuses. One was telling the other that he would get $500 if he
could sign up some patients in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this guy,'' Elks said. ``He is a practitioner of the
highest ethics.'' But, she said, ``he was talking about how to
massage entry criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Elks said she then noisily cleared her throat. ``I sort of
a-hummed,'' she said, at which point the doctors ``stepped back for
a minute,'' suddenly realizing what one of them had been saying.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next, she said, she was not privy to know.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dr. Stuart Weiss was bored with private practice. To
liven up his work, the San Diego endocrinologist tried his hand at
drug studies. It was an audacious idea _ at the time most trials
were conducted by university scientists. But Weiss worked hard to
persuade a skeptical drug industry to take a chance on someone with
his background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat the bushes,'' he said. ``I lobbied long and hard with
several organizations to give me a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he focused on a Merck study of a new drug to treat
osteoporosis, a degenerative bone disease. To show his eagerness,
he offered to fly to New Jersey to meet with Merck executives at
their world headquarters. Then Weiss went further, spending his own
money to buy an expensive piece of equipment that measures bone
density. Merck finally gave in, asking him to find 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with 40.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in the entrepreneurial spirit displayed by Weiss, lay
the solution to a problem that was suddenly dogging the
pharmaceutical industry _ the slow pace of research in university
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, drug companies had been able to increase their
prices almost at will, and thus had little incentive to develop new
products. For the comparatively small number of drugs the companies
did test, they turned to a trusted group of medical school
researchers who dictated how trials were conducted. And the drug
companies had to wait in line: Research financed by government
grants was far more prestigious; in the eyes of many academics,
drug-company trials were to research what McDonald's hamburgers
were to food.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, researchers were reimbursed much differently than
they are today. Payments went to the university, not to the
investigator. The university doctors were often paid a flat fee for
their work, no matter how many patients they actually enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 1990s, the economics of drug development
changed. Managed care put the squeeze on drug prices, leaving
companies one option: to increase the number of drugs they were
selling. As a result, the companies began a rush to drug
development, something that was aided by reforms at the FDA that
speeded up the approval process for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies at first turned to their coterie of medical school
researchers, but found the academic world was incapable of adapting
rapidly to the increasingly intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had concretized bureaucracies,'' Dr. David Bickers, the
chairman of the dermatology department at Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Surgeons, said of the academic response.
``And for companies, time is money. Companies figure that out.''

 UNDATED: that out.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quickly, the drug companies began recruiting a new breed of
private-practice doctors like Weiss, willing to mine their patient
base for research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation is evident in a Times computer analysis of
thousands of forms submitted each year to the FDA from doctors
wanting to conduct research. According to the analysis, 11,662
private doctors conducted drug studies in 1997, almost three times
the number in 1990, when 4,307 doctors conducted such studies. And
while the number of researchers and medical schools also grew in
that period, their share of the business dropped from a third to a
quarter of the total, according to the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Private-practice doctors in research said the change was for the
better, because the doctor was not simply tending to the patient's
needs for the few weeks of a study, but often for a lifetime.
``Even though the physician may want to make money, the moment he
sits across from the patient, he is not only responsible to
himself, he is responsible to that patient,'' said Dr. Norman
Zinner, a Los Angeles doctor who in 1994 formed Affiliated Research
Centers, an organization of private-practice urologists who conduct
drug studies. ``I have got to look you in the eye. I have got to
see you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, these doctors said, but participation in research
allows them to know the latest ideas for treatment. ``I really feel
I can offer my patients more,'' said Grossman of Vivra Asthma and
Allergy. ``I know more what the cutting edge is. I know what will
be the recommended therapy two years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because anyone licensed to practice medicine is eligible to be a
researcher, medical communities have been transformed in towns
where the onslaught of managed care spawned legions of doctors
scrambling to replace lost income. In 1980, when clinical research
was the fief of medical schools, there were only eight projects in
Tucson, Ariz., and all but two were at hospitals affiliated with
the University of Arizona. Today, researchers are scattered in
offices dotting the city _ in places like the sun-baked barrios and
the homely strip malls _ conducting 157 studies in 1997 alone. Drug
studies, and with them the competition for patients, have become as
common in Tucson as the towering saguaro cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with federally financed research on the wane, it is the
academic researchers who are banging on the doors of the drug
companies, asking for a second chance. But they are finding it hard
to keep up with the private doctors, who have shown themselves more
willing to sign contracts overnight, advertise widely, offer
financial incentives for patients and open their offices at unusual
times to accommodate patient schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to conduct drug studies at the medical
school because of the competition'' from private doctors, said Dr.
Mark Brown, a pediatric asthma specialist at the University of
Arizona. ``It's difficult to find patients.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the competition from private doctors, some
academic medical centers have recently begun setting up research
divisions to draw on their own private patients for drug studies.
But it is a fledgling effort, limited to a handful of universities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some junior faculty members are now abandoning academia
to get into the drug-study business. Dr. Andrew Cutler, a
psychiatrist, left the faculty at the University of Chicago to join
the Psychiatric Institute of Florida in Orlando, a private practice
with a research business. Then last year, he formed his own
company, Coordinated Research of Florida, to perform drug studies
full time.
</P>
<P>
   Without a patient base to draw from for studies, Cutler found
other ways to recruit subjects, including serving as a nursing home
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will strategically pick a nursing home that has a large
population that meets the criteria for a study,'' he said. ``If
there is a large community practice in town, I may work out a
referral arrangement, or make them a co-investigator, and the
arrangement is that they would be providing the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is not passively waiting for doctors to knock
on its door. Instead, over the last few years it has been
aggressively recruiting doctors with the lure of cash. Every day,
in hundreds of medical offices around the country, blandishments
arrive by fax, mail and e-mail, encouraging doctors to grab their
piece of the research pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover the secret for obtaining more funded studies,'' says
a 1992 letter to doctors from Research Investigator's Source, which
charges $275 to place doctors' profiles on lists of researchers
consulted by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 letter from Clinmark Dotcom, an online listing service
for researchers based in Irvine, Calif., offered to list doctors
for $350 the first year and $195 the second. But the letter made no
secret about the reasons to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigator grants average $43,000 per study,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ubiquitous seminars, sponsored by the
industry, with enticing titles to attract doctors, both fledgling
and experienced in studies. Some teach the basics, with such titles
as ``How to Find Clinical Trials: A Physician's Perspective'' and
``How to Develop or Evaluate a Patient Recruitment Media Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing captured the transformation of research more than a
seminar on clinical trials in Nashville, Tenn., sponsored in 1996
by Associates of Clinical Pharmacology, a professional association.
</P>
<P>
   The title? ``Successful Patient Recruitment: The Heart and Soul
of Your Business.''

 UNDATED: Your Business.''

<P>
   Doctors and drug company executives milled around a racing car
parked on the floor of the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial
Convention Center in Boston last year, waiting their turn to be
photographed at the wheel. Nearby, other images of speed dotted the
exhibit hall at the annual meeting of the Drug Information
Association, an industry trade group. Checkered flags appeared on
corporate booths and T-shirts. One exhibit featured a giant
photograph of a cheetah; another showed a mural of a horse race.
</P>
<P>
   To some at the meeting on drug development in the global
marketplace, the images were a perfect metaphor for the industry
today: The push to finish trials quickly and move the drugs onto
the market has overshadowed every other goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago it was `better, faster, cheaper,' '' said M.
Jane Ganter, the editor in chief of Applied Clinical Trials, an
industry publication. ``Nobody is saying `better' or `cheaper'
anymore. The big emphasis is on speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The driving forces behind the desire for faster studies are the
industry's financial stakes. With the clock ticking on a new drug's
patent even as it is being tested, every day's delay is revenue
that will never be earned. ``Time is money,'' said James
Patricelli, an analyst of the drug-testing industry with Dain
Rauscher Wessels. ``Speed is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the industry worry that such singlemindedness has
led testing companies to tap an increasing number of doctors with
little or no experience in drug testing and only a fuzzy
understanding of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis showed that during the 1990s, 70 percent of
the doctors conducting human experiments had been involved in three
or fewer previous drug studies, a number unlikely to give them
mastery over the process. A quarter of all doctors who did human
experiments in 1997, the last year for which complete data are
available, conducted only one experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the companies would be embarrassed if they saw the
quality of the people doing the research,'' said Dr. Angela Bowen,
the president of the Western Institutional Review Board, a private
ethics board based in Olympia, Wash., that reviews proposed
research on human subjects. ``I call them clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the predominance of generalists taking part in
the studies. The studies test drugs for particular diseases, like
asthma, in which a doctor's experience and specialized training are
crucial in making assessments such as distinguishing between drug
reactions and disease symptoms. But doctors conducting clinical
trials often have no particular expertise in the disease they are
treating. The Times computer analysis showed that the largest
single group of doctors conducting investigations was general
internists; one in five was either a general internist or a family
practitioner. These, of course, are the doctors most Americans see
for checkups and are thus the industry's most efficient recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors who do clinical research say that they often
are offered studies that would require them to stretch far beyond
their areas of medical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do studies for hematology or neurology or lung
disease or epilepsy,'' said Dr. Roy Fleischmann, the chief
executive of Rheumatology Research International, a national
network of clinical research sites that specialize in arthritis and
skeletal diseases. But, he said, ``We get calls about them all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every doctor has the power to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure for me to do things I did not feel
comfortable doing,'' said Dr. Claudia Baldassano, a psychiatrist
and neurologist who worked for a commercial research center on the
East Coast. ``They thought because I have an MD, I should be
comfortable doing all studies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, for example, that she was asked to do Pap smears as
part of a study of hormone replacement and was asked to treat
patients with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I hadn't done a Pap smear since medical school, and I
didn't feel comfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the diabetes study, ``I said how could you expect a
physician who is not trained'' as a diabetes specialist to run the
trials, she said. ``I was told by a vice president of operations
that I could do diabetic studies with my eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Baldassano stood her ground on the diabetes study,
but participated in the one on hormone replacement. She resigned
from the business after just a few months, and now works in
academic research.

 UNDATED: academic research. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why would drug companies accept research even from doctors who
doubt their own expertise? Because, experts said, the industry has
grown so quickly that no one has yet developed a good measurement
of quality. Drug companies are left to review two factors: speed
and cost. Systems of measurement for quality ``haven't been
established to differentiate these companies,'' said Patricelli of
Dain Rauscher.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the quality of data and patients, the
government and industry have put into effect some means of
oversight. The first line of defense for the integrity of the data
is the dispatch of study monitors employed by the testing companies
to the doctors' offices to pore over the test results.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosive growth of the industry has left experienced
monitors in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``They utilize some people who have very little
experience in the disease entity, or the drug, or in
pharmacology,'' said Fleischmann of Rheumatology Research
International. The monitors ``don't understand what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for boxes to fill in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the most common form of arthritis,
osteoarthritis, is also called ``degenerative joint disease.'' A
testing company monitor who came to examine his data announced that
his patients were not qualified for the study because she did not
know the two terms meant the same thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have that knowledge,'' Fleischmann asked, ``how
can they read a chart and know what is real and what is not real?''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said there was a decided difference between the
quality of monitors who work for the drug industry and those who
work for the testing companies. Monitors sent by testing companies
can be so unknowledgeable, said Margaret Chokreff, the president of
Margaret Chokreff &AMP; Associates, which works with a network of
private doctors conducting research in Ohio, that she and her
nursing staff must sometimes train them about their own studies.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' sole task is protecting data, not patients. That
job falls largely to the patchwork system of ethics boards, bodies
that are required by federal law to approve research proposals
involving humans. The main responsibility of these panels is to
insure that test candidates are fully informed of the benefits and
risks of a particular study and that they are not coerced to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   But the review boards last year fell under criticism from
government officials for reviewing too many studies too quickly and
for lacking expertise. And while these boards will get involved in
deciding the appropriate language to be used for an advertisement
for patients, they do not consider whether patients should be told
of their doctors' financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   Shimm of Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver recalled that when
he served on an ethics board at a university medical school, a good
deal of time was spent discussing whether payments to patient
volunteers were coercive. The concern was that patients might enter
studies for the money rather than out of altruism, the ideal that
is sought. But, immediately after such a discussion at one meeting,
another proposal came up in which a doctor stood to receive
thousands of dollars from the drug company for each patient
recruited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait a minute,' '' Shimm said. ``If it is coercive to
pay a patient $500, why is it not coercive to pay the clinical
investigator $5,000?''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of the research board were not interested in
the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told,'' Shimm said, ``to sit down and shut up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas Parham visited his doctor in the summer of 1995, he
expected just another routine checkup. But his doctor had something
else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Peter Arcan, suggested that Parham might want to
join a study of a new drug to shrink enlarged prostates, according
to records of the encounter. Parham was puzzled _ his prostate was
fine. But Arcan brushed aside the retired metal worker's questions,
saying the experimental drug might prevent future problems.
Satisfied, Parham, a 64-year-old resident of La Habra, Calif.,
agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   There was one question Parham did not ask: What was in it for
Arcan?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was money. The drug's maker, SmithKline Beecham PLC,
was paying $1,610 for each patient that doctors signed up _ money
that covered study expenses while allowing a portion to end up as
profit for Arcan and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Parham had no idea. ``Nothing was mentioned about money,'' he
said in an interview. ``It's a situation where you have faith in
your doctor.'' Through his secretary, Arcan declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   With his decision, Parham had unwittingly joined hundreds of
thousands of other patients recruited by their personal physicians
into a booming venture: the business of testing experimental drugs
on people.
</P>
<P>
   Once clinical research was a staid enterprise primarily
administered by academic researchers driven by a desire for
knowledge, fame or career advancement. Now, it is a
multibillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of testing and drug
companies working with thousands of private doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In this new industry, patients have become commodities, bought
and traded by testing companies and doctors. Almost daily, the
industry urges doctors to join the gold rush, bombarding them with
faxes and letters blaring such come-ons as ``Improve Your Cash
Flow'' and ``Discover the Secret For Obtaining More Funded
Studies.'' In an era of managed care, the pleas are seductive: The
number of private doctors in research since 1990 has almost
tripled, and top recruiters can earn as much as $500,000 to $1
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   This new system is a boon for drug companies because it reaches
out to a vast pool of test subjects who have never before been
available for experimentation. But it also injects the interests of
a giant industry into the delicate doctor-patient relationship,
usually without the patient realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   These changes have prompted little public debate, mostly because
the full scope of what is happening is hidden. The industry treats
research agreements as corporate secrets and contractually forbids
doctors to disclose them. As a result, few people outside the
industry, including government officials, have seen the contracts
or know the magnitude of the money involved.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-month investigation, The New York Times obtained
such contracts and thousands of other confidential documents that
present a view of the research industry that has never before been
available.
</P>
<P>
   These records, and interviews with participants, reveal a system
fueling a pharmaceutical renaissance, but fraught with conflicts of
interest; that places a premium on speed and meeting quotas; that
relies on government and private monitoring that can be easily
fooled and that some researchers said is inadequate; and that
secretly offers a share of the cash to other health professionals
who might influence patients to join a study. At bottom, the only
thing separating a trusting patient from a study that could be
inappropriate or potentially harmful is the judgment of a doctor
torn by these unseen conflicts and pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, including contracts, protocols or related
financial records from more than 300 recent drug studies, were
provided by a number of people in the industry concerned about its
direction. The Times also conducted a computer analysis of more
than 200,000 filings with the government and related data submitted
by doctors who want to conduct research, and interviewed doctors,
patients, ethicists, industry executives and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the specific findings of The Times'
investigation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drug companies and their contractors offer large payments to
doctors, nurses and other medical staff to encourage them to
recruit patients quickly. And doctors do not even have to conduct
trials to get paid: There are finder's fees for those who refer
their patients to other doctors conducting research.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctors who recruit the most patients receive additional
perquisites, such as the right to claim a coveted authorship of
published papers about the studies _ even though the true author is
a ghostwriter using analysis from the drug company. Those who fail
to meet the recruitment goals are usually dropped from future
studies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Testing companies often use doctors as clinical investigators
regardless of their specialty, at times leaving patients in the
care of doctors who know little about their condition. For example,
psychiatrists have conducted Pap smears and asthma specialists have
dispensed experimental psychiatric drugs.
</P>
<P>
   _ A growing number of doctors conducting drug research have
limited experience as clinical investigators, raising questions
among some experts about the quality of their data.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, industry officials and researchers said the
emerging drug-approval system was dedicated to quality and offers
significant benefits. Since patients are seeing their own doctors,
researchers said, it adds a level of continuity and personal
contact to the process _ something unavailable from full-time
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, industry officials said, the new pool of test subjects
is a resource of incalculable value that is allowing the
development of an avalanche of new compounds. Drug tests ``can get
delayed if the patients aren't out there and available,'' said
Chris Kuebler, the chairman and chief executive at Covance Inc., a
giant testing company.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts said patients were being pushed to participate
in the studies because of the financial interests of their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors working as researchers ``are enticing and cajoling
patients who are in no position to resist their blandishments to
enter clinical studies,'' said Dr. David Shimm, a member of the
ethics committee at Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver who has
written about research conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the patients are not seeing is that the clinical
investigator is really a dual agent with divided loyalties between
the patient and the pharmaceutical company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While patients must sign detailed consent forms to enroll in
drug studies, they are often in no position to question their
doctor's suggestion that they join.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician has enormous power over you,'' said Uwe
Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, who
himself recently agreed to participate in a clinical trial run by
his doctor _ in part because he feared annoying him _ and who had
no idea that money might be involved. ``You want to keep his favor.
If you say no, you'll worry that he may not like you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with Parham and Arcan. In joining the
study, Parham said: ``I just followed his advice, just like if he
said to take two aspirin instead of one. He's a doctor and I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Parham should never have been signed up for the
prostate study. According to his medical records, he had been
hospitalized the previous year with a chronic slow heart rate, a
condition that specifically disqualified him for the study. But,
saying that Parham's heart rate was only mildly slow, an
administrator handling the paperwork for Arcan sought an exemption
from SmithKline. Based on those representations, the drug company
granted the exemption; it was not told about Parham's earlier
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after joining, Parham complained of fatigue, a symptom of
his slow heart rate. Arcan dismissed the complaints as emotional.
Within weeks, Parham asked to be dropped from the study. Days later
he was hospitalized and given a pacemaker; Parham never brought
legal action and it is impossible to know whether his participation
in the study affected his heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   His experience underscores a potential danger of the emerging
drug-testing system: Doctors with money at stake may persuade
patients to take drugs that are inappropriate or even unsafe. Under
the current system of monitoring, such actions are almost
impossible to catch and no statistics are collected on such events.
Within the industry, most of the planning focuses on conducting
studies quickly. Patient issues, some researchers said, are often
lost in the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the trade meetings on clinical research; you go for
two entire days, and patients are not mentioned,'' said Dr. Robert
Califf, the director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, an
academic drug-testing center in Durham, N.C., affiliated with Duke
University. ``The patient is an object to make money. Having
patients is just the dirty price for doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   A letter sent out last July by Merck &AMP; Co. was nothing if not
sympathetic. The company recognized that doctors involved in its
study of a hypertension medication were having trouble finding
qualified patients. And so, with the letter, Merck offered a little
encouragement for them to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying $2,955 for each test subject enrolled, Merck
offered $500 more in the study comparing the drug Losartan with a
placebo. For those doctors who enrolled their quota of 14 patients
by Sept. 30, the company would kick in an additional $2,000 _
making that 14th patient worth $5,455 if recruited in time, and the
entire group potentially worth more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will forward the first check as soon as the first four
additional patients are enrolled,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering how effective paying doctors to recruit
patients can be, the drug industry has opened the financial
floodgates. Special cash bonuses for signing up specified numbers
of people by a given date, a practice once unheard of in clinical
research, are becoming part of the landscape. Moreover, those
payments _ to private doctors, research firms and even to
university medical centers _ are only one of a number of incentives
dangled by drug and testing companies to entice the medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   There are payments to everyone in the system who can come up
with a patient, from other doctors who refer them for research to
the study coordinators in the researcher's office who screen
patients to see if they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   None of these benefits are scrutinized by government regulators,
who said in interviews that they saw no difference between
providing grants for university research and paying doctors
directly. For academics ``the money is just as important as with
the internal medicine guy trying to beat the HMO,'' said Dr. Murray
Lumpkin, the deputy director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research at the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike block grants, today's incentives can grow almost day
by day, if the doctor works the way the drug companies want. And
the variety of the incentives is almost endless.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic form of compensation is a flat fee paid for each
patient enrolled. The amount of money paid to the researchers
varies widely, depending on the complexity of the study, the number
of tests involved and the difficulty in finding patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1996, a study of a migraine drug sponsored by
Janssen Pharmaceutica, a unit of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, paid doctors
$3,600 for each enrollment. Another study that year sponsored by
Organon Inc. on a new birth control pill paid $1,100 for each
patient. And a Wyeth-Ayerst study of drugs for hormone replacement
in women paid $4,581.
</P>
<P>
   While all of these payments were made to specific clinics, the
exact amounts on a single test could vary slightly by region, or
even by clinic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many executives from drug or testing companies refused to
discuss their research programs, citing confidentiality. Those who
did grant interviews gave consistent explanations of their
payments: They are necessary compensation for the doctors' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up contracts that hopefully reimburse investigators
adequately for the time they put in to screen patients, bring them
in, and provide data to us that is as clean as possible,'' Dr.
Elizabeth Stoner, the vice president for clinical research and
contract management at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional payments can be made, she said, when there is
``additional effort above and beyond what they anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors who are particularly successful in recruiting study
patients and keeping down their costs can make huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physicians who can net about $500,000 to $1 million
a year doing clinical research,'' said Ismail Shalaby, the chief
executive of Nema Research Inc., a network of doctors and hospitals
in the Baltimore area performing clinical research. ``And that is
not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits to the doctors who conduct research are not simply
financial. Once, researchers said, the names that appeared on
papers describing drug studies were those of the actual authors.
That is no longer always the case. Today, the coveted right to
claim authorship is often just another reward for doctors who
recruit the most patients _ even if they wrote nothing and analyzed
no data.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to ask you to write,'' said Dr. Thierry Le Jemtel, a
cardiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., who
is a longtime academic researcher. ``Now, they send you a paper all
written by a medical writer'' hired by the drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Grossman, a private-practice doctor who is an allergy
and respiratory specialist with Vivra Asthma and Allergy Inc. in
Tucson, Ariz., said he was often a lead author on publications
because he had been a top patient recruiter in the clinical trials,
even though he rarely did much _ if any _ of the actual writing.
``That's common,'' he said. ``It's orchestrated by the drug
company's medical writer.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Grossman cited a study for a SmithKline Beecham
asthma medication that was published in The Journal of Asthma and
another on an allergy medication sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharmaceutical published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology. While the articles are written by a drug company
writer, Grossman said, he often suggests modifications.
</P>
<P>
   As drug companies compete for top study doctors who will quickly
accrue patients, a financial arms race has developed, with each
company seeking new ways to use cash and benefits to spur the
research.
</P>
<P>
   One practice is to offer finder's fees to doctors who are not
conducting studies for referring patients to doctors who are. For
example, a letter from a testing company handling the research on a
vaginal suppository for Bayer Corp. in 1996 promised ``a $75
referral fee for physicians and area/federally funded clinics,
i.e., Planned Parenthood, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Even study coordinators _ the nurses and medical assistants who
oversee the administrative details of a study and screen patients
to see if they qualify _ are offered fees for finding test
subjects. In 1995, for example, Pharmaceutical Product Development
Inc. of Wilmington, N.C., which coordinates drug tests, needed a
way to speed up enrollment in a study of a drug developed by Zambon
Corp. in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   So the company sent a fax to medical staff members who were
screening patients around the country, offering them bonuses for
fast enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``EVERY study coordinator has the chance to receive $750 just by
reaching the enrollment goal of 30 evaluable patients,'' the fax
said. ``So GET BUSY!''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up competition among drug companies for the services
of doctors led to the development of cash bonuses for them, one of
the most controversial incentives now offered. But even companies
that were uncomfortable with the idea found it hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue,'' said Dr. Cynthia Dunn, the director of
the Clinical Research Institute at the University of Rochester and
a former drug industry executive. ``On one hand, many companies
recognize it's part of what we have to do to be competitive. On the
other hand, they recognize they are setting up potential conflicts
of interest'' for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Some large drug companies have refused to offer bonuses out of
ethical concerns. ``You don't want to provide an advantage that can
be misinterpreted,'' said Dr. Joseph Camardo, the senior vice
president of clinical research and development for Wyeth-Ayerst
Research in Radnor, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses all reward the same behavior: enrolling patients
fast. For example, a contract last year by Ibah Inc., a testing
company owned by Omnicare Inc., provided a $750 bonus for each
patient enrolled by June 15 or $500 for those enrolled between June
15 and July 16 _ upping the ante for doctors whose enrollments were
lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Such incentives outrage some experts. Bonuses in clinical
research are ``inappropriate, potentially illegal and certainly
unethical,'' Dr. Robert Tenery, a Dallas doctor who is the chairman
of the council on ethical and judicial affairs for the American
Medical Association, said of such payments in general. ``Why would
you get an extra $500? How can you explain the rationale? Maybe you
took a patient who really didn't need to be enrolled.''
</P>
<P>
   If something goes wrong, doctors might never be able to escape
the nagging doubt that the bonus program was to blame. ``How would
you like to confront the family when a family member got hurt, and
you got a bonus for enrolling?'' asked Michael Leahey, the director
of the office of clinical trials at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A system that offers so much cash and benefits for quick
recruitment assumes that doctors would never allow money to distort
their judgment _ in this case by causing them to put undue pressure
on reluctant patients or to include patients who do not qualify.
But the assumption that doctors can resist financial temptations
has been proved wrong repeatedly in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, throughout much of the 1980s, doctors could refer
patients to treatment centers _ such as physical or radiation
therapy sites _ in which they had a stake. The practice was
outlawed after studies found that doctors were overusing treatments
and tests when they had financial interests in the centers that
provided them. A 1992 study published in The New England Journal of
Medicine found that doctors with investments in radiation sites
prescribed such treatment as much as 60 percent more often than
those without the financial conflict.
</P>
<P>
   With such studies demonstrating the effects of financial
incentives on doctors, experts who have studied these conflicts
said they were troubled by the emergence of research for hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a recipe for trouble or abuse,'' said Marc Rodwin, an
associate professor of law and public policy at the School of
Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University and the
author of a book on financial conflicts in medicine. ``The risk is
that the doctor will subconsciously downplay the risks or overplay
the benefits'' of a particular study in order to persuade a patient
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, companies sometimes fail to consider how
difficult it will be to find patients to meet the requirements they
set for admission into a study. Then, when recruitment falls short
of expectations, they offer to pay more to meet an unrealistic goal
_ looking, for example, for patients with a disease that their drug
can treat but who have no other health problems that could affect
the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest solution that inexperienced people think of first
is to increase the number of sites or to increase the amount of
money you're offering,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, the senior vice
president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade
group for large drug companies. ``You can offer to triple the
amount of money and it will make zero difference if the doctors are
doing everything they can do. It may be that the patients don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with so much money dangling in front of them, doctors could
be tempted to bend the rules to get patients into studies, and
could get away with it, according to Dr. Martha Elks, an associate
dean at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. ``Let's say you're
dealing with an angina study where the requirement for entry is a
certain level of pain on a certain number of days of the week,''
Elks said. And ``suppose the patient's history is not quite that
but is borderline.''
</P>
<P>
   Elks said she overheard two doctors talking recently about
bonuses. One was telling the other that he would get $500 if he
could sign up some patients in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this guy,'' Elks said. ``He is a practitioner of the
highest ethics.'' But, she said, ``he was talking about how to
massage entry criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Elks said she then noisily cleared her throat. ``I sort of
a-hummed,'' she said, at which point the doctors ``stepped back for
a minute,'' suddenly realizing what one of them had been saying.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next, she said, she was not privy to know.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Dr. Stuart Weiss was bored with private practice. To
liven up his work, the San Diego endocrinologist tried his hand at
drug studies. It was an audacious idea _ at the time most trials
were conducted by university scientists. But Weiss worked hard to
persuade a skeptical drug industry to take a chance on someone with
his background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat the bushes,'' he said. ``I lobbied long and hard with
several organizations to give me a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he focused on a Merck study of a new drug to treat
osteoporosis, a degenerative bone disease. To show his eagerness,
he offered to fly to New Jersey to meet with Merck executives at
their world headquarters. Then Weiss went further, spending his own
money to buy an expensive piece of equipment that measures bone
density. Merck finally gave in, asking him to find 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with 40.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in the entrepreneurial spirit displayed by Weiss, lay
the solution to a problem that was suddenly dogging the
pharmaceutical industry _ the slow pace of research in university
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, drug companies had been able to increase their
prices almost at will, and thus had little incentive to develop new
products. For the comparatively small number of drugs the companies
did test, they turned to a trusted group of medical school
researchers who dictated how trials were conducted. And the drug
companies had to wait in line: Research financed by government
grants was far more prestigious; in the eyes of many academics,
drug-company trials were to research what McDonald's hamburgers
were to food.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, researchers were reimbursed much differently than
they are today. Payments went to the university, not to the
investigator. The university doctors were often paid a flat fee for
their work, no matter how many patients they actually enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the early 1990s, the economics of drug development
changed. Managed care put the squeeze on drug prices, leaving
companies one option: to increase the number of drugs they were
selling. As a result, the companies began a rush to drug
development, something that was aided by reforms at the FDA that
speeded up the approval process for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies at first turned to their coterie of medical school
researchers, but found the academic world was incapable of adapting
rapidly to the increasingly intense competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had concretized bureaucracies,'' Dr. David Bickers, the
chairman of the dermatology department at Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Surgeons, said of the academic response.
``And for companies, time is money. Companies figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the drug companies began recruiting a new breed of
private-practice doctors like Weiss, willing to mine their patient
base for research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation is evident in a Times computer analysis of
thousands of forms submitted each year to the FDA from doctors
wanting to conduct research. According to the analysis, 11,662
private doctors conducted drug studies in 1997, almost three times
the number in 1990, when 4,307 doctors conducted such studies. And
while the number of researchers and medical schools also grew in
that period, their share of the business dropped from a third to a
quarter of the total, according to the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Private-practice doctors in research said the change was for the
better, because the doctor was not simply tending to the patient's
needs for the few weeks of a study, but often for a lifetime.
``Even though the physician may want to make money, the moment he
sits across from the patient, he is not only responsible to
himself, he is responsible to that patient,'' said Dr. Norman
Zinner, a Los Angeles doctor who in 1994 formed Affiliated Research
Centers, an organization of private-practice urologists who conduct
drug studies. ``I have got to look you in the eye. I have got to
see you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, these doctors said, but participation in research
allows them to know the latest ideas for treatment. ``I really feel
I can offer my patients more,'' said Grossman of Vivra Asthma and
Allergy. ``I know more what the cutting edge is. I know what will
be the recommended therapy two years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because anyone licensed to practice medicine is eligible to be a
researcher, medical communities have been transformed in towns
where the onslaught of managed care spawned legions of doctors
scrambling to replace lost income. In 1980, when clinical research
was the fief of medical schools, there were only eight projects in
Tucson, Ariz., and all but two were at hospitals affiliated with
the University of Arizona. Today, researchers are scattered in
offices dotting the city _ in places like the sun-baked barrios and
the homely strip malls _ conducting 157 studies in 1997 alone. Drug
studies, and with them the competition for patients, have become as
common in Tucson as the towering saguaro cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with federally financed research on the wane, it is the
academic researchers who are banging on the doors of the drug
companies, asking for a second chance. But they are finding it hard
to keep up with the private doctors, who have shown themselves more
willing to sign contracts overnight, advertise widely, offer
financial incentives for patients and open their offices at unusual
times to accommodate patient schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to conduct drug studies at the medical
school because of the competition'' from private doctors, said Dr.
Mark Brown, a pediatric asthma specialist at the University of
Arizona. ``It's difficult to find patients.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the competition from private doctors, some
academic medical centers have recently begun setting up research
divisions to draw on their own private patients for drug studies.
But it is a fledgling effort, limited to a handful of universities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some junior faculty members are now abandoning academia
to get into the drug-study business. Dr. Andrew Cutler, a
psychiatrist, left the faculty at the University of Chicago to join
the Psychiatric Institute of Florida in Orlando, a private practice
with a research business. Then last year, he formed his own
company, Coordinated Research of Florida, to perform drug studies
full time.
</P>
<P>
   Without a patient base to draw from for studies, Cutler found
other ways to recruit subjects, including serving as a nursing home
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will strategically pick a nursing home that has a large
population that meets the criteria for a study,'' he said. ``If
there is a large community practice in town, I may work out a
referral arrangement, or make them a co-investigator, and the
arrangement is that they would be providing the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But the industry is not passively waiting for doctors to knock
on its door. Instead, over the last few years it has been
aggressively recruiting doctors with the lure of cash. Every day,
in hundreds of medical offices around the country, blandishments
arrive by fax, mail and e-mail, encouraging doctors to grab their
piece of the research pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover the secret for obtaining more funded studies,'' says
a 1992 letter to doctors from Research Investigator's Source, which
charges $275 to place doctors' profiles on lists of researchers
consulted by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 letter from Clinmark Dotcom, an online listing service
for researchers based in Irvine, Calif., offered to list doctors
for $350 the first year and $195 the second. But the letter made no
secret about the reasons to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigator grants average $43,000 per study,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the ubiquitous seminars, sponsored by the
industry, with enticing titles to attract doctors, both fledgling
and experienced in studies. Some teach the basics, with such titles
as ``How to Find Clinical Trials: A Physician's Perspective'' and
``How to Develop or Evaluate a Patient Recruitment Media Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing captured the transformation of research more than a
seminar on clinical trials in Nashville, Tenn., sponsored in 1996
by Associates of Clinical Pharmacology, a professional association.
</P>
<P>
   The title? ``Successful Patient Recruitment: The Heart and Soul
of Your Business.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Doctors and drug company executives milled around a racing car
parked on the floor of the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial
Convention Center in Boston last year, waiting their turn to be
photographed at the wheel. Nearby, other images of speed dotted the
exhibit hall at the annual meeting of the Drug Information
Association, an industry trade group. Checkered flags appeared on
corporate booths and T-shirts. One exhibit featured a giant
photograph of a cheetah; another showed a mural of a horse race.
</P>
<P>
   To some at the meeting on drug development in the global
marketplace, the images were a perfect metaphor for the industry
today: The push to finish trials quickly and move the drugs onto
the market has overshadowed every other goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago it was `better, faster, cheaper,' '' said M.
Jane Ganter, the editor in chief of Applied Clinical Trials, an
industry publication. ``Nobody is saying `better' or `cheaper'
anymore. The big emphasis is on speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The driving forces behind the desire for faster studies are the
industry's financial stakes. With the clock ticking on a new drug's
patent even as it is being tested, every day's delay is revenue
that will never be earned. ``Time is money,'' said James
Patricelli, an analyst of the drug-testing industry with Dain
Rauscher Wessels. ``Speed is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in the industry worry that such singlemindedness has
led testing companies to tap an increasing number of doctors with
little or no experience in drug testing and only a fuzzy
understanding of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Times analysis showed that during the 1990s, 70 percent of
the doctors conducting human experiments had been involved in three
or fewer previous drug studies, a number unlikely to give them
mastery over the process. A quarter of all doctors who did human
experiments in 1997, the last year for which complete data are
available, conducted only one experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the companies would be embarrassed if they saw the
quality of the people doing the research,'' said Dr. Angela Bowen,
the president of the Western Institutional Review Board, a private
ethics board based in Olympia, Wash., that reviews proposed
research on human subjects. ``I call them clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the predominance of generalists taking part in
the studies. The studies test drugs for particular diseases, like
asthma, in which a doctor's experience and specialized training are
crucial in making assessments such as distinguishing between drug
reactions and disease symptoms. But doctors conducting clinical
trials often have no particular expertise in the disease they are
treating. The Times computer analysis showed that the largest
single group of doctors conducting investigations was general
internists; one in five was either a general internist or a family
practitioner. These, of course, are the doctors most Americans see
for checkups and are thus the industry's most efficient recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   But some doctors who do clinical research say that they often
are offered studies that would require them to stretch far beyond
their areas of medical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do studies for hematology or neurology or lung
disease or epilepsy,'' said Dr. Roy Fleischmann, the chief
executive of Rheumatology Research International, a national
network of clinical research sites that specialize in arthritis and
skeletal diseases. But, he said, ``We get calls about them all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every doctor has the power to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure for me to do things I did not feel
comfortable doing,'' said Dr. Claudia Baldassano, a psychiatrist
and neurologist who worked for a commercial research center on the
East Coast. ``They thought because I have an MD, I should be
comfortable doing all studies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, for example, that she was asked to do Pap smears as
part of a study of hormone replacement and was asked to treat
patients with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I hadn't done a Pap smear since medical school, and I
didn't feel comfortable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the diabetes study, ``I said how could you expect a
physician who is not trained'' as a diabetes specialist to run the
trials, she said. ``I was told by a vice president of operations
that I could do diabetic studies with my eyes closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Baldassano stood her ground on the diabetes study,
but participated in the one on hormone replacement. She resigned
from the business after just a few months, and now works in
academic research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why would drug companies accept research even from doctors who
doubt their own expertise? Because, experts said, the industry has
grown so quickly that no one has yet developed a good measurement
of quality. Drug companies are left to review two factors: speed
and cost. Systems of measurement for quality ``haven't been
established to differentiate these companies,'' said Patricelli of
Dain Rauscher.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to protect the quality of data and patients, the
government and industry have put into effect some means of
oversight. The first line of defense for the integrity of the data
is the dispatch of study monitors employed by the testing companies
to the doctors' offices to pore over the test results.
</P>
<P>
   But the explosive growth of the industry has left experienced
monitors in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``They utilize some people who have very little
experience in the disease entity, or the drug, or in
pharmacology,'' said Fleischmann of Rheumatology Research
International. The monitors ``don't understand what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for boxes to fill in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the most common form of arthritis,
osteoarthritis, is also called ``degenerative joint disease.'' A
testing company monitor who came to examine his data announced that
his patients were not qualified for the study because she did not
know the two terms meant the same thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have that knowledge,'' Fleischmann asked, ``how
can they read a chart and know what is real and what is not real?''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said there was a decided difference between the
quality of monitors who work for the drug industry and those who
work for the testing companies. Monitors sent by testing companies
can be so unknowledgeable, said Margaret Chokreff, the president of
Margaret Chokreff &AMP; Associates, which works with a network of
private doctors conducting research in Ohio, that she and her
nursing staff must sometimes train them about their own studies.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' sole task is protecting data, not patients. That
job falls largely to the patchwork system of ethics boards, bodies
that are required by federal law to approve research proposals
involving humans. The main responsibility of these panels is to
insure that test candidates are fully informed of the benefits and
risks of a particular study and that they are not coerced to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   But the review boards last year fell under criticism from
government officials for reviewing too many studies too quickly and
for lacking expertise. And while these boards will get involved in
deciding the appropriate language to be used for an advertisement
for patients, they do not consider whether patients should be told
of their doctors' financial stake.
</P>
<P>
   Shimm of Porter Adventist Hospital in Denver recalled that when
he served on an ethics board at a university medical school, a good
deal of time was spent discussing whether payments to patient
volunteers were coercive. The concern was that patients might enter
studies for the money rather than out of altruism, the ideal that
is sought. But, immediately after such a discussion at one meeting,
another proposal came up in which a doctor stood to receive
thousands of dollars from the drug company for each patient
recruited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait a minute,' '' Shimm said. ``If it is coercive to
pay a patient $500, why is it not coercive to pay the clinical
investigator $5,000?''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of the research board were not interested in
the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told,'' Shimm said, ``to sit down and shut up.''

   NEW YORK _ On the Upper West Side of Manhattan the other
evening, Jonathan Jacoby, an expert on Israeli politics, ended an
hourlong forum on the fractious national campaign going on in
Israel with a question to his audience: How much interest was there
among American Jews in the contest for prime minister?
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby really didn't have to ask. The answer was right in front
of him, in the empty chairs and unimpressive number of people (19)
who turned out to hear about Israeli politics five days before the
election, in the heart of a patch of real estate that is as
politically passionate, and as Jewish, as any part of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   There is a five-way contest under way for prime minister, and by
all indications it could end _ with Monday's vote or a run-off in
three weeks _ with the defeat of Benjamin Netanyahu, the
belligerent Likud Party figure who has led the nation since 1996,
by Ehud Barak, the Labor Party challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the notable exception of people like Jacoby and the
religious Jews in the United States who have long kept closer tabs
on Jerusalem than they have on Washington, there is surprisingly
little interest among many American Jews about what is taking place
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume seems to be turned down,'' said Ronald Lauder, the
chairman-elect of the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   New York state Assemblyman Dov Hikind said he was startled by
the subdued attention to the campaign in his own back yard: Borough
Park in Brooklyn, where the sidewalks are filled with men with
flowing beards and black hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that the level of enthusiasm and excitement is similar
to what it was three years ago would be lying to you,'' said
Hikind, a Democrat and one of Netanyahu's most prominent American
supporters. ``There is less, period. Even in the Orthodox
community. Isn't that interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   The muted reaction to the Israeli elections of 1999 is evidence
of the increasing distance that many American Jews, especially
younger ones, have put between themselves and the country that for
so long has had such a strong emotional draw for say, their parents
and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   But the lukewarm U.S. involvement is partly mirrored in Israel,
suggesting there is not enough to this campaign to merit the kind
of trans-Atlantic attention that Israeli politics has typically
commanded in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For many American Jews, the current contest is a shadow of most
of the elections that have gripped the country since the 1967 Yom
Kippur war _ particularly the contest of 1996, when Netanyahu was
elected.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign was viewed as a political watershed for a nation
whose very existence seemed once again in peril. It was fought in
the aftermath of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister who made peace with Yasser Arafat, and was shadowed by
random Arab terrorist bombings that Netanyahu incorporated into his
nightly television advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The relative merits of the tough-talking Netanyahu and the
dovish Labor candidate Shimon Peres was, along with the future of
the Arab peace process, the subject of vigorous debate in Jewish
community centers, synagogues and Jewish neighborhoods in New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy Jews found ways to circumvent Israeli laws barring
foreign contributions to Israeli campaigns, while in Orthodox
neighborhoods, hundreds of Jews who held dual citizenship traveled
on chartered planes to vote for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is going on in the 1999 contest. But many Jewish
leaders say such intensity is relegated to corners of American
Jewish life and is the exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons for this. The political
maneuvering by Netanyahu and Barak _ following, not incidentally,
the advice of U.S. political consultants who have decamped there
for the election _ has served to blur the distinctions between the
Likud and Labor candidates, and their supporters. While that might
make political sense in Israel, it has dampened passions in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last race was more a battle about issues, with competing
concepts of security dominating the debate,'' Lauder said. ``This
year's election has been more a clash of personalities. And
frankly, a personality contest doesn't inflame interests the way
issues do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, Netanyahu, under the tutelage of Arthur
Finkelstein, the Republican consultant from Irvington, stirred
conservative support in Israel and America by asserting that Peres
``will divide Jerusalem,'' or cede part of Israel's capital to the
Palestinians. This time, Barak outflanked Netanyahu by declaring
his fealty to a unified Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with both candidates moving to the center, it is often
difficult to determine, from their words at least, how different
they are on the question of peace, one of the issues of most
concern to American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Even the debate in Israel that has so concerned many American
Jews _ over whether those who converted to Judaism under
non-Orthodox auspices should be recognized by the state as Jews _
has not drawn the attention that many Israelis expected from the
United States, where most of the Jewish population is reform or
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Although Netanyahu has strong ties to the religious community,
and Barak to secular Jews, neither has emphasized the issue. In the
United States, several Jewish leaders and journalists suggested,
the whole discussion may have nudged Americans away from Israel
altogether.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `Who is a Jew?' issue has created a sense of
distance,'' said J.J. Goldberg, a syndicated columnist who writes
for Jewish newspapers in the United States and has written on the
declining interest he has found in his travels within the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, all of this has seemed to sap much of the
enthusiasm of supporters who live 5,000 miles away from the
election. Religious Jews in New York were elated when Netanyahu won
the election in 1996. But they have turned suspicious after three
years in which Netanyahu has made the kind of centrist peace
gestures that his Orthodox supporters had not expected when they
boarded planes to vote for him. ``People feel disappointment,''
Hikind said.
</P>
<P>
   If Netanyahu's following in the United States is disheartened,
Barak's is largely nonexistent. He has rarely visited America,
unlike such former Israeli leaders as Rabin, or appeared on
television. ``He doesn't have a lot of charisma and television
presence, and he has relatively low name recognition,'' said Rabbi
Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The low interest comes amid an overall decline in interest in
Israeli affairs among American Jews, especially younger ones. ``The
trends are unmistakable, supported both by survey evidence and
direct interviews with rank-and-file American Jews,'' said Steven
Cohen, a sociologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the ties between American Jews and Israel, it would
be risky to draw too many long-term conclusions. At another time,
with different candidates, the dynamics could surely be different.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Fein, director of the Commission on Social Action of the
Reform Jewish Movement, said he had also seen a ``fairly dramatic
distance from intimate involvement with the intricacies of Israeli
politics and society.''
</P>
<P>
   But not, he added, in his own circle. ``It is probably an
indication of nothing at all that I have three invitations to
election parties on the 17th,'' he said.

IN DETROIT, A SEX CHANGE

   DETROIT _ Run your eyes over the Dodge Durango, one of the
newest sport utility vehicles on the road. Muscles seem to ripple
under its shiny sheet metal, causing its fenders to bulge. Its hood
is lifted above the brawn, like the short neck of a wrestler rising
from beefy trapezius muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers imagine the Durango whispering huskily that it is strong
and dependable. And many of its brother trucks at the forefront of
Detroit's design efforts are even burlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now think back to Detroit's design heyday in the 1950s. Then as
now, cars were big. But they were Eves to today's Adams, Marilyn
Monroes to our Hulk Hogans. In the '50s ``there were hood ornaments
and bumpers that were bulbous and busty,'' said David Lewis, a
professor of business history at the University of Michigan.
``Nowadays there is no question that a lot of these sport utility
vehicles are masculine.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, cars looked like women. Now they look like men.
</P>
<P>
   Auto historians and designers puzzle over why. Some say the
booming economy gives Americans a go-anywhere, do-anything
confidence represented by brawny sport utility vehicles and trucks.
Or perhaps the designs have changed because more women are buying
cars. Others believe the world feels less safe, causing people to
look to their cars for protection, as if their daily commutes
require bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it is as if Detroit's metal has had a
sex-change operation. Today's design kings are nothing like the
voluptuous Chevrolet Corvettes built between 1968 and 1982, the
ones with the sultry silhouette of an hourglass on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s Cadillacs had chrome bumper guards in the shape of
breasts _ the 1953 model was a real looker. Here in Detroit they
are still known as ``Dagmar'' Cadillacs, after the tall, blonde
television starlet who went by the single name Dagmar and was known
for her ample chest.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, machismo filled the air at General Motors. ``It was
certainly sexual, but it was the sexual fantasies of men,'' said
Jerry Hirshberg, a GM designer in the '60s and '70s who is now
president of North American design for Nissan. ``When we lapsed, we
were doing design pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone suspected. ``The psychologists have thought
for years that the automakers, subliminally or otherwise, would
build cars with sex appeal, mostly to appeal to men,'' said Lewis,
the historian. Women in tight sweaters appeared in television ads
for cars, and men got the point: ``Here you have a curvy model and
a curvy fender.'' No more. Today, we have muscle cars. Back in the
'60s, of course, ``muscle'' referred to horsepower, not design.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's first sport utility vehicle, the Pathfinder, was
nicknamed the ``hardbody,'' and designers described the ``triceps''
around each wheel. There are the square-shouldered Jeeps, born of
the battlefields, with a look DaimlerChrysler calls ``chiseled.''
Other sport utility vehicles have been growing bigger and bigger,
as if the highways have become a survival-of-the-fittest contest:
The Ford Explorer spawned the Ford Expedition, and it evolved into
the enormous, soon-to-come Ford Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Each designer or auto historian seems to have a theory about the
changes. ``In the '90s, people started moving away from the
weaker-looking cars to the stronger-looking trucks,'' said Edward
Golden, Ford's truck-design director. ``It has to do with the end
of the Cold War and people feeling more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Or more endangered. ``I don't think there were drive-by
shootings in the 1950s,'' said Neil Walling, design vice president
at DaimlerChrysler, which builds the Dodge Durango. ``One of the
allures or attractions to trucks and sport utility vehicles is that
they carry a very protective image.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now that women buy about half of all new vehicles, they
are objectifying men just as men objectify women. ``Women would
really rather have a vehicle that's more masculine than a vehicle
that is more feminine,'' said Jerry Palmer, director of design for
GM's North American Design Center. ``People still like vehicles
that are sexy,'' he said, and today's popular models ``are
masculine but they still have that sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it sex or is it power? ``A lot of women are buying trucks and
sport utility vehicles, and I believe that they don't want to be
seen as the weaker sex,'' said Golden, the Ford designer. ``They
want to be seen as equals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, not all the latest models get such expressive
designs. The nation's best sellers are midsized cars like the Honda
Accord, the Ford Taurus and the Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Designers say those boy-next-door cars still carry messages.
Walling of DaimlerChrysler said cars like the Camry are saying,
```I'm not trying to be powerful, I'm not trying to be fashionable,
I'm not trying to be leading-edge. I'm the friend who is always
here _ I'm not the Arnold Schwarzenegger.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even sports cars seem less sexy now. Today's Corvettes have
just a slight air of femininity _ they are nothing like the
Playboy-magazines-on-wheels of the 1960s. The latest Corvettes and
other sports cars are more like the ``boys with breasts'' of Tom
Wolfe's latest novel, ``A Man in Full'' _ the thin, fit, females
found climbing stair machines at the neighborhood gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s and '60s, just when I was fantasizing about
Dagmar, automobiles were not only a status symbol but a sex
symbol,'' said Clive Chajet, a corporate-identity consultant in New
York. ``Driving is no longer sexy,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Why have bulging metal muscles replaced soft steel curves? The
men in the auto industry are still puzzling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a sports car is a man's mistress, what is a pickup truck?''
asks Robert Casey, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford
Museum in Dearborn, Mich. ``Is it his buddy?''

   Whatever the reason, it is as if Detroit's metal has had a
sex-change operation. Today's design kings are nothing like the
voluptuous Chevrolet Corvettes built between 1968 and 1982, the
ones with the sultry silhouette of an hourglass on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s Cadillacs had chrome bumper guards in the shape of
breasts _ the 1953 model was a real looker. Here in Detroit they
are still known as ``Dagmar'' Cadillacs, after the tall, blonde
television starlet who went by the single name Dagmar and was known
for her ample chest.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, machismo filled the air at General Motors. ``It was
certainly sexual, but it was the sexual fantasies of men,'' said
Jerry Hirshberg, a GM designer in the '60s and '70s who is now
president of North American design for Nissan. ``When we lapsed, we
were doing design pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what everyone suspected. ``The psychologists have thought
for years that the automakers, subliminally or otherwise, would
build cars with sex appeal, mostly to appeal to men,'' said Lewis,
the historian. Women in tight sweaters appeared in television ads
for cars, and men got the point: ``Here you have a curvy model and
a curvy fender.'' No more. Today, we have muscle cars. Back in the
'60s, of course, ``muscle'' referred to horsepower, not design.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's first sport utility vehicle, the Pathfinder, was
nicknamed the ``hardbody,'' and designers described the ``triceps''
around each wheel. There are the square-shouldered Jeeps, born of
the battlefields, with a look DaimlerChrysler calls ``chiseled.''
Other sport utility vehicles have been growing bigger and bigger,
as if the highways have become a survival-of-the-fittest contest:
The Ford Explorer spawned the Ford Expedition, and it evolved into
the enormous, soon-to-come Ford Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Each designer or auto historian seems to have a theory about the
changes. ``In the '90s, people started moving away from the
weaker-looking cars to the stronger-looking trucks,'' said Edward
Golden, Ford's truck-design director. ``It has to do with the end
of the Cold War and people feeling more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Or more endangered. ``I don't think there were drive-by
shootings in the 1950s,'' said Neil Walling, design vice president
at DaimlerChrysler, which builds the Dodge Durango. ``One of the
allures or attractions to trucks and sport utility vehicles is that
they carry a very protective image.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now that women buy about half of all new vehicles, they
are objectifying men just as men objectify women. ``Women would
really rather have a vehicle that's more masculine than a vehicle
that is more feminine,'' said Jerry Palmer, director of design for
GM's North American Design Center. ``People still like vehicles
that are sexy,'' he said, and today's popular models ``are
masculine but they still have that sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it sex or is it power? ``A lot of women are buying trucks and
sport utility vehicles, and I believe that they don't want to be
seen as the weaker sex,'' said Golden, the Ford designer. ``They
want to be seen as equals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, not all the latest models get such expressive
designs. The nation's best sellers are midsized cars like the Honda
Accord, the Ford Taurus and the Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Designers say those boy-next-door cars still carry messages.
Walling of DaimlerChrysler said cars like the Camry are saying,
```I'm not trying to be powerful, I'm not trying to be fashionable,
I'm not trying to be leading-edge. I'm the friend who is always
here _ I'm not the Arnold Schwarzenegger.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even sports cars seem less sexy now. Today's Corvettes have
just a slight air of femininity _ they are nothing like the
Playboy-magazines-on-wheels of the 1960s. The latest Corvettes and
other sports cars are more like the ``boys with breasts'' of Tom
Wolfe's latest novel, ``A Man in Full'' _ the thin, fit, females
found climbing stair machines at the neighborhood gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '50s and '60s, just when I was fantasizing about
Dagmar, automobiles were not only a status symbol but a sex
symbol,'' said Clive Chajet, a corporate-identity consultant in New
York. ``Driving is no longer sexy,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Why have bulging metal muscles replaced soft steel curves? The
men in the auto industry are still puzzling it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a sports car is a man's mistress, what is a pickup truck?''
asks Robert Casey, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford
Museum in Dearborn, Mich. ``Is it his buddy?''

   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey _ An elderly man who is among the most
respected denizens of Diyarbakir's twisting bazaar sat speaking
about his memories of Kurdish struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the 1930s, he told of rebellions he has seen,
villages he once knew that have been burned by military patrols,
friends he has lost to unknown assassins and what he said was the
fatal torture of his son.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of young men were sitting silently nearby, taking it
all in. They are the new generation of Kurds, eagerly absorbing
stories that fire their political commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government says that few Kurds support the idea of
Kurdish nationalism and that nearly all are happy with the life
Turkey offers them. But a four-day tour through Kurdish provinces
of the southeast indicated that the opposite may be true.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the region, Kurds appear more conscious of their
identity than ever. It is difficult to find any who do not support
the nationalist cause and even the armed rebellion that has been
under way since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   This public mood suggests that unless the government accepts at
least some Kurdish demands, violence could continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The growing support for Kurdish nationalism comes at a time when
the rebel group known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or _ more
commonly _ by its initials PKK, has suffered heavy losses,
including the capture of its leader, Abdullah Ocalan. These
reverses seem, if anything, to have emboldened ordinary people
here, many of whom revere Ocalan as ``our leader'' _ a vivid
contrast to language used elsewhere in Turkey, where he is normally
described as a terrorist and baby-killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother never had any particular sympathy for Ocalan or his
organization,'' said a businessman in his mid-30s. ``But when she
saw the pictures of him in handcuffs, she cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of nationalist sentiment here is evidently a product,
at least in part, of Ocalan's rebellion. Even Kurds who expressed
doubts about his tactics said he had awakened a new generation to a
sense of common identity that their forefathers never felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurdish conflict has led to much criticism of Turkey abroad,
and has been cited as one of the main obstacles to Turkish
membership in the European Union. In recent weeks, commentators in
several countries have suggested that if the ethnic Albanian
majority in Serbia's Kosovo province deserves international
protection, so does the Kurdish majority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Turkey's estimated 10 million Kurds come from this
region. They constitute 90 percent of the population here, although
in the last decade many have migrated westward to large cities like
Istanbul. Turkish officials reject any comparison between Kosovo
and the southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any relationship between the two issues,'' Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem said when asked about it at a news conference
during NATO's summit meeting in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, voters in seven provincial capitals in the Kurdish
region dealt the government a sharp blow by electing leaders of the
Kurdish nationalist party as mayors. Here in Diyarbakir, the
largest city in the region, the nationalist candidate won an
astonishing 62 percent of the vote despite police harassment that
included banning and attacking his rallies and arresting many who
campaigned for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won because we talked about identity, about the fact that
there is a Kurdish population in this country that cannot be
ignored,'' said the mayor, Feridun Celik. ``Nothing can be achieved
by refusing to recognize us. This problem has existed since the
founding of the Turkish Republic, and it has to be confronted.
There is a great fear of diversity and the expression of diversity
in this country. That is the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Celik rejected government assertions that he and his party,
People's Democracy, support separatism and terrorism. But a case to
close the party is pending, based on the government's assertion
that it maintains ``organic links'' with the guerrillas. After the
recent elections, a senior prosecutor said he would seek to remove
all People's Democracy mayors from office because their elections
constituted ``terrorist takeovers'' of city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Although the newly elected mayors realize that they must speak
cautiously, many ordinary people feel no such constraints as long
as they are promised anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support this party because I'm a Kurd,'' said a woman in
Diyarbakir. ``What we demand is our identity. We want it to say in
our identity cards that we are Kurds. We want schools and
television stations in our language. We're happy under the Turkish
flag, but the government is still very afraid of us. They say that
if they accept our identity, we will want to govern ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bingol, another provincial capital where a People's Democracy
candidate was elected mayor last month, a well-dressed businessman
said: ``The state can't keep us down. They have to realize that
millions of Kurds want to be recognized as Kurds, and that we
support every organization that fights for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government fears that compromise with the nationalist
movement would ultimately lead to the region's secession. Even
suggesting peace talks with the rebel group is a criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PKK's claim to be fighting for Kurdish rights is nothing
but a preposterous and outrageous deception,'' the government
asserted in a recent statement. ``The PKK is not a popular
movement, but simply a terrorist organization operating through
intimidation, coercion and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the government in Ankara were not available
here, but at one of the many military checkpoints in the southeast,
several army officers eloquently expressed the official viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no political or social basis to this conflict,'' said
a major on his third tour of duty in the southeast. ``It is all
fomented by foreign countries. You say it is a war, but I have to
correct you. This is not a war. It is a peace operation. We are
defending the country from terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant scoffed at the suggestion that People's Democracy
should be welcomed into the political system. ``This is not just a
radical party,'' he said. ``It is a party connected to Ocalan, a
man who is responsible for killing 30,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of People's Democracy strenuously deny that their party
is linked to the guerrillas. But many voters here agree with the
government's assertion that it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they are connected to our leader and his
organization,'' said one shopkeeper. ``That's why we voted for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about accusations that guerrillas have killed
schoolteachers and committed acts of terror, the shopkeeper
replied, ``Unfortunately that is true, but what we have suffered at
the hands of the Turkish army is much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kurdish towns, it is no longer forbidden to
use the Kurdish language, and cassettes of Kurdish music, once
banned, are now widely available. But in dozens of interviews, no
Kurd could be found who did not believe that security forces here
are guilty of repression, torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the conflict in 1984 until the end of 1998,
according to President Suleyman Demirel, 23,638 guerrillas, 5,555
soldiers and 5,302 civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has long denied the Kurdish population, located
largely in the southeast, basic political, cultural and linguistic
rights,'' the State Department said in its most recent human rights
report. ``As part of its fight against the PKK, the government
forcibly displaced noncombatants, failed to resolve extra-judicial
killings, tortured civilians, and abridged freedom of expression.
The number of villagers forcibly evacuated from their homes since
the conflict began is credibly estimated to be about 560,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Though people in the southeast now speak more freely than
before, they are still circumspect. Asked if he knew of youths who
have joined the militants, man smoking a water pipe replied: ``We
wouldn't know about that. How could we know?''
</P>
<P>
   A friend sitting nearby smiled and said, ``That's a man who
knows how to survive in Diyarbakir.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent figure who publicly encourages a change in
government policy is Mehmet Sirin Yigit, a Kurd who heads the
Diyarbakir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He sees the recent
election as a positive step that could open new dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two different opinions live without contact with each
other, there is trouble,'' Yigit said. ``But if there is a chance
for the two opinions to communicate, which is going to happen now,
that's better. People from both sides are going to be sitting
together in meetings, talking to each other and learning to respect
each other's sensitivities. You can't resolve problems by using
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   On a back alley in Diyarbakir, a schoolboy wearing a jacket
several sizes too big for him said he thought People's Democracy
was ``very good'' and that the guerrillas were ``also very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain what was good about the guerrilla army, the
youth paused for a moment and then replied: ``I don't exactly know.
But I know it's good.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ There are no immigration or
customs controls at the rustic landing strip that passes for an
airport here. But in most other ways, this muddy cattle town and a
sizable swath of jungle and savanna around it have ceased to be a
part of Colombia and are instead, with the government's blessing, a
dominion ruled by Marxist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   At the main square here, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, known as FARC from its Spanish initials, has taken over
what used to be the local Institute of Culture and Tourism and made
it a headquarters. Rebel commanders in dark green uniforms move
about the streets, heavily armed bodyguards trailing behind, and
conduct document checks, summon residents to ideological meetings,
or stride into the mayor's office at will to confer with municipal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farclandia'' is the name some local residents have given to
this odd new state-within-a-state, created when the central
government in Bogota ceded an area of roughly 15,000 square miles _
larger than New Jersey and Connecticut combined _ to guerrilla
control as an inducement to peace talks that might end Colombia's
35-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was envisioned as temporary, but signs abound
that the guerrillas, who have informally but effectively collected
taxes around here for 25 years, are cementing their control and
taking steps to insure they cannot be expelled if the process
breaks down. Less clear, however, is whether the experience gained
has given the rebels a real taste for governance, rather than
insurgency against a democratically elected Colombian government
that they maintain serves only a domestic elite and foreign
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several Latin American countries, the latest of
them Guatemala, have negotiated settlements to their long civil
wars. But it is unprecedented for a government to hand over a swath
of territory to its adversary. Local residents are not pleased that
they have been made guinea pigs in a political experiment while
being excluded from the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if a couple of guests have come to stay in your
house, and they decide to throw a party,'' said Omar Garcia
Castillo, the mayor here. ``Not only do they not consult you, they
don't invite you.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90,000 residents of the area have had to live with this
unusual arrangement since last November. After much maneuvering,
the Colombian government and the rebel group agreed early in May to
begin formal peace talks, which are expected to get under way by
the end of the month and to prolong guerrilla control of the region
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement for the withdrawal of the government
supposedly applied only to its military and security presence,
including the national police, who have been replaced by a
60-member ``civic police'' that has half of its personnel appointed
by the mayor and the other half by the guerrillas. But the
guerrilla group recently expelled a government prosecutor they
found troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made mistakes, and we have complained to them about
those mistakes,'' Victor G. Ricardo, the government's chief peace
negotiator, said when asked about the incident. ``What they did
with the prosecutor was one of those mistakes, and they recognize
it as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, no replacement has been sent here, and only a
handful of officials from the ombudsman's office remain as
representatives of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla leadership has also demanded that the Roman
Catholic Church remove two parish priests who have objected to the
rebels' behavior and policies. One of the priests has now been
reassigned, for reasons the church hierarchy maintains are
unrelated to his dispute with the rebels. The other, Miguel Angel
Serna, remains an outspoken critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in Colombia right now, but in something that is the
prelude to an independent state,'' Serna said in an interview at
the rectory here. He said that the rebel movement had ``imposed its
law'' on people here, creating a militia called ``Citizen
Vigilance'' to intimidate potential opponents and ``to spy on
civic, religious and business groups,'' while ``accusing anyone who
does not agree with them of being an enemy of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Colombian news magazine Semana, the
Roman Catholic bishop for most of the region, Hector Lopez, said
the rebel group had also engaged in ``forced recruitment'' of
children as young as 13. In some rural areas he regularly visits,
he added, the guerrillas were ``bringing together the whole
population between the ages of 13 and 60 for two or three days'' at
their encampments, where ``they train them in the use of heavy
weapons'' and indoctrinate them in Marxist-Leninist theory.
</P>
<P>
   Local people said the guerrillas have also imposed labor duty in
rural areas, either to repair existing roads, most of which are in
precarious shape, or to build new ones. Better roads are a boon to
ranchers and farmers who have had difficulty getting crops to
market, but have a military use as well.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts say that the guerrillas have reconditioned
airstrips in the bush and have organized several flights,
presumably of weapons and ammunition but perhaps also of drugs,
which have been an important source of income for years. Colombian
government officials acknowledge that such activities have been
taking place, but minimize their importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been doing that all along,'' Minister of Defense
Rodrigo Lloreda said in an interview in Bogota. ``They may have
taken some advantage, but not so dramatically. What worries me most
is not this, but that the civilian population may have been
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the mayor, said that he was aware of about six instances
in which residents had been ``detained'' by the rebels and held
illegally. He added that he was powerless to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents now seem resigned to the presence of the
guerrillas, and indeed worry more about when they leave. ``Our
greatest fear is that the peace process falls apart, the
paramilitaries come in here and accuse us all of being
collaborators and kill a lot of people,'' said the middle-aged
owner of a beauty salon as she trimmed a customer's hair.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is way down. According to local authorities, only four
killings have occurred in the six months since the guerrillas took
control, compared with about 10 a week in the months before their
arrival. Robbery, theft and rape have dropped almost as sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are highly centralized and it is difficult to obtain
information about their policies or a response to complaints made
by religious and civic leaders here and in Bogota. Three guerrilla
commanders assigned here declined to discuss these issues, saying
comment would have to come from superiors, who were at a base in
the jungle and therefore unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate matter and a very delicate time,
especially here in town,'' Comandante Juan Pablo, a guerrilla
official, said as he stood outside the rebel group's headquarters,
decorated with photographs of Lenin and Simon Bolivar. He
maintained, though, that many of the complaints were exaggerated,
an assertion contradicted in several interviews with local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the priests are saying is correct, but I would not say
that out loud,'' one store owner here said. ``Nobody wants trouble
with these people, so they keep quiet. You know what they say: keep
your mouth shut, and flies won't enter.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the guerrillas assigned to duty in town seem to
enjoy life out of the bush. Teen-age soldiers flirt with local
girls when their superiors are not looking, and other rebel leaders
are using the respite to learn to play musical instruments or
acquire other skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost 40, and have been a guerrilla for 19 years,'' said
Mauricio, the rebels' community liaison officer, breaking off a
conversation to head for his first driving lesson. ``I never
learned how to drive a car, so now I am going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Governance is hazier, not extending much beyond paving a few
streets, painting some revolutionary murals and holding many
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guerrillas have learned from this experience that
they are not prepared to run the country,'' said a European relief
official who spends much of his time here. ``Their senior leaders
are very intelligent, but they lack the midlevel cadres they
need.''

BUSH'S NETWORK FOR CASH WAS SET UP IN '98 AT LUNCHES IN TEXAS
CAPITAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Texas, Fla., Mich., Washington, D.C., Md., Ga.,
Ariz.)   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the frontiers of presidential fund-raising, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas has shattered previous Republican records
by quickly raising $13 million with help from ``the Pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   An elite group of 150 supporters, ``the Pioneers'' have each
agreed to raise $100,000 for Bush's presidential exploratory
committee. A dozen members of the Pioneers have already met their
$100,000 goals. In just 10 weeks, they have helped collect an
unprecedented windfall for the Texas governor, who has not attended
a single fund-raising gala.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unlike his Republican and Democratic rivals, including
Vice President Al Gore, Bush has collected vast sums without ever
leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been crisscrossing the country to attend a heavy
schedule of fund-raising receptions, remaining in Austin, the Texas
capital, while the Pioneers do most of his prospecting. So many
Republican money men want to join Bush's finance team that there is
a waiting list to have lunch with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has managed to set a new early season Republican
fund-raising record without breaking his promise to the people of
Texas that he will remain focused on the state's business until the
current legislative session ends in late May. He will not begin
active national campaigning until next month, with a much
anticipated trip to Iowa. In June, his campaign will also hold its
first fund-raising banquets in Florida, Michigan and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But he has hardly played a passive role in his exploratory
committee's fund-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Bush quietly began assembling a network of
the nation's most powerful and influential Republican fund-raisers,
several supporters said in interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   He did it by inviting groups of eight or 10 fund-raisers to
Austin to have lunch with him, either in the governor's mansion or
at a local restaurant, several supporters said. Some of the invited
guests were supporters of Bush's father, former President George
Bush, the supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor usually began the lunches by bemoaning the need to
raise so much cash for his presidential bid. ``He made it very
clear to people that it was simply a necessary thing to do but not
something that he relished doing,'' recalled Shelly Kamins, a
developer and co-chairman of the Bush campaign in Maryland who
attended one of the Austin lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would then describe his vision for America and answer
questions. By the end of the lunch, most of the fund-raisers
committed themselves to raising money for Bush, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 fund-raisers have come to Austin in the last several
months. In recent weeks, the demand to attend one of Bush's Austin
lunches has outpaced the number of seats at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunches give people the chance to listen to him,'' said
Ron Weiser, one of the leaders of Bush's campaign in Michigan.
``Until you know what he stands for, it is hard to make that kind
of commitment. Most people like what they hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides demonstrating Bush's commitment to the campaign, which
has not yet formally begun, the lunches also managed to enlist most
of the Republican Party's top fund-raisers by March. The move took
his rivals completely by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very stealthy, and people did not realize it was
happening,'' said one longtime Republican fund-raiser who has not
decided yet which candidate to support. ``It was an amazing thing
to watch. While he was doing his legislative work, he has sat down
and had lunch with people from around the country _ basically
letting the money people come to him. He pulled some of the top
fund-raisers off the table, and the other Republican candidates did
not know what hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican rivals have struggled to establish strong
national fund-raising organizations. Elizabeth Dole, the Republican
hopeful who is second in the polls behind Bush, has gotten off to a
slow start raising money. In the first three months this year, Mrs.
Dole raised $685,253, although she has been much more active
raising money since early April.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, both Vice President Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey have racked up impressive numbers. Gore
raised $8.9 million in the first three months of this year, a tally
that his supporters say far exceeded their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers demonstrate that the 2000 presidential race will be
the most expensive election in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the strategy of inviting the fund-raisers and some
big-money contributors to visit Austin has paid dazzling dividends.
After announcing the formation of his exploratory committee in
early March, Bush raised $7.6 million in just 28 days, a total that
far outpaced the rest of the Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle finished second, with $2
million, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was third, with $1.8
million, in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bush's supporters said the windfall was even more
impressive because it had come in response to a single solicitation
letter that announced the formation of Bush's exploratory
committee. But in fact, his large national network of fund-raisers
had begun tapping their friends and colleagues for $1,000 checks,
the maximum allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $7.6 million raised by Bush, there were 5,237 checks for
$1,000, or 22 percent of the 23,339 contributions. More than half
of the checks were signed by Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real tributes to George Bush is that the first
seven or eight million dollars came without the benefit of a single
event,'' said Haley Barbour, a Washington lobbyist who is a member
of Bush's exploratory committee and the former national chairman of
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection of Gov. Bush's political strength and that's
a very, very positive thing that your political strength alone
generates so much financial support.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said the fund-raising efforts were driven by a campaign
that refuses to take anything for granted despite Bush's large lead
in most polls over all potential challengers, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nomination is not going to be given to him on a silver
platter,'' Barbour said. ``He is going to have to earn it. George
understands that better than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who owes some of his strong showing in the early polls to
his image as a candidate with few ties to Washington, has also
benefited from the support of some influential Republicans in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Barbour, his effort there is being assisted by business
consultant Wayne Berman, James C. Langdon Jr., a partner at Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld and an old friend of Bush's from Texas,
Joseph B. Gildenhorn, ambassador to Switzerland under President
Bush, and Ron Kauffman, a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   The first Washington gala that the governor will attend is
scheduled for June 22 at the Washington Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proceeds of this fund-raiser will make a very strong
statement,'' said Kamins, the developer and one of five chairmen
for the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said Bush hoped to break the Republican record set in
1996 by Bob Dole, who raised $31.2 million. With individual
contributions limited to $1,000 and a much larger Republican field
vying for contributions, Donald L. Evans, Bush's national finance
chairman, conceded that the goal posed a very difficult challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters said Bush's goal was to raise $45 million or
even $50 million by the end of the year. If he raised $50 million,
Bush would have the luxury to choose to forgo accepting nearly $15
million in matching funds from the presidential public campaign
financing system. Candidates who accept federal money must limit
their spending to $33.5 million in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we made a decision to go nonmatching, we'd need to raise
$50 million,'' said Evans, an oil company chief executive from
Midland, Tex., and Bush's best friend. ``Going from being able to
raise $32 million to $50 million is a significant leap. That's an
option that we are in the very, very early stages of even thinking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said that he credited Bush's early money success with a
very strong national organization, including several governors,
notably his younger brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, and Gov.
John Engler of Michigan. Supporters say the Bush campaign hopes to
raise $4 million in Florida alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also been assisted by his parents, who have both
attended what the campaign calls surrogate fund-raising events. On
May 21, his mother, Barbara Bush plans to attend a fund-raiser in
Birmingham, Ala., and the next day, she and the former president
plan to headline an event in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent campaign has had the kinds of glitches that other
candidates would probably not mind having. The governor's
exploratory committee failed to identify the occupations of 25
percent of his donors in the first quarter, as the rules require,
even though some are well-known Texans, including Allan Shivers,
who was the treasurer of Bush's 1998 campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to comply with the rules, campaign workers wrote ``Info
Requested'' next to donors' names. A campaign spokeswoman said that
with so many checks flowing in, there simply was not enough time to
complete the paperwork before the deadline for reporting
contributions.

COST-CUTTING FORGES NEW DRUG-TESTING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Md., Calif., S.C., Minn.)  (Eds: With DRUG-TRIALS) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drug companies used to supervise all their research, from the
discovery of the drugs to the animal tests to the preliminary human
tests to the large studies involving hundreds or thousands of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   No more. A multibillion-dollar industry has sprung up to take
care of all that and more, including designing the studies, finding
doctors and patients, analyzing the data, meeting with the Food and
Drug Administration, writing the scientific papers and preparing
the truckload of documents that must be submitted before a drug is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   These new companies have sliced the drug-testing business in
every possible way. Some are little more than a Rolodex of the
names of doctors willing to help test drugs. Others are major
corporations, essentially drug companies without the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It is an industry that arose to fill a need: the enormous
pressure that began around 1992 from managed care companies and
health insurers on drug companies to hold down prices, according to
industry analysts. Until then, the drug companies had been
profitable, making money mostly by increasing prices, not by
developing new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies now had to find a new way of generating profits.
``Their vulnerability became transparent to the world,'' said James
Patricelli, an industry analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels in
Minneapolis. ``What you had was a drug industry that suddenly had
to make investments in its future.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies' response was to search for blockbusters _ the
Prozacs and Viagras hidden within the laboratory chemicals. The FDA
gave the companies another incentive by speeding up its approval
process, with the median review time for new drug applications
dropping from more than 22 months in 1990 to just over 14 months in
1997, according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has flip-flopped,'' said Kim Lamon, corporate
senior vice president with Covance Inc., a giant drug-testing and
development company. ``There is a push for novel, innovative,
blockbuster drugs, and to be the first or second to market.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies found they had to put more effort and money into
finding drugs while at the same time slashing their development
costs. For many, their solution was largely to dismantle their
divisions that ran clinical trials and to turn the work over to
smaller companies that emerged to fill the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone had auditors, kids right out of college, telling us
how to do it cheaply,'' said Dr. Cynthia Dunn, a former vice
president for medical affairs at Fisons, a British drug maker later
acquired by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., and now the director of the
Clinical Research Institute at the University of Rochester. ``They
really pushed the outsourcing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new companies came a variety of new names. Contract
research organizations were composed of companies that ran parts or
all of the clinical trials. Site management organizations _ groups
of doctors willing to offer their services to conduct trials _ soon
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in this sector has been enormous. Roughly $3.2
billion was paid to the contract research organizations in 1997, up
52 percent from just two years earlier, when payments were $2.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Covance, one of the largest contract research organizations,
doubled its staff and revenues from 1994 to 1998. Today, the
Princeton, N.J., company is an industry giant, with 7,000 employees
and more than $700 million in revenues in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that has been growing and growing and
growing,'' said Ismail Shalaby, the chief executive of Nema
Research Inc., a clinical research network based in Baltimore. ``A
drug company doesn't have to invest a lot of its own time and money
to develop a drug anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some industry experts said, a drug company barely even
needs to be a drug company any more. For example, Neurobiological
Technologies Inc. in Richmond, Calif., has no factories, 11
employees, three scientists and less than $1 million in cash. Yet
it is using the new testing industry to conduct huge clinical
trials, involving dozens of research sites and doctors around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a company of one person, working out of their
home, with no office, develop a drug,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, a
senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs with the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade
association. ``You could have totally virtual companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime members of the industry marvel at the change, which has
occurred in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One called me. They had two employees,'' said Dr. Leigh
Thompson, a drug-industry consultant in Charleston, S.C., who is a
former chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. ``They have a
molecule and hope but nothing else.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ An administration plan to require cleaner gasoline and
automobiles that emit less pollution, described by officials as the
most ambitious anti-pollution initiative of the Clinton presidency,
is drawing heavy lobbying by environmentalists and industry and
strong interest by politicians eyeing next year's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that imposing the
higher standards would reduce respiratory illnesses and save the
lives of up to 2,800 Americans a year. These improvements would
come at substantial cost _ $3.5 billion annually, five times as
much as any other Clinton administration rule aimed at specific
sources of pollution, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Industry critics, particularly oil refiners, say the costs would
be far higher. Emboldened by a federal appeals court ruling on
Friday rejecting the administration's plans for tighter national
air quality standards in the future, oil industry lawyers warned
that the gasoline and auto initiative may not hold up in court. But
an EPA official said the appellate court ruling would not stop the
agency's plans.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring substantial reductions in car pollution and the
elimination of 95 percent of emissions from sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks, the gas and auto rules would drastically cut
smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest action by the Clinton administration to
protect the environment and the health of the American people,''
said Carol M. Browner, the regulatory agency's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   With such high stakes, advocates and opponents are trying to
influence the administration and Congress during the public comment
period, which ends on Aug. 2. Environmentalists and automakers
generally support the plan while seeking limited modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies are implacably opposed to the requirement for
cleaner gasoline and are encouraging Republicans in Congress to
step in, having concluded that the administration is not likely to
make any significant changes before the rules become final at the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has strongly backed the pollution
initiative. Republicans are keeping a close eye on his comments,
particularly regarding sport utility vehicles, in hopes that they
can be used against him in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of position on this kind of an issue is
tailor-made'' for television advertisements, said Gov. John Engler
of Michigan, a Republican who is one of the 10 members of Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential exploratory committee. ``I do think
it's a good issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of the administration's initiative is clouded by
Friday's decision by an appellate court in the District of
Columbia. The court rejected only the administration's plan to set
more stringent national targets for smog and soot in the air. The
plan did not specify which industries would actually reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But F. William Brownell, lead lawyer for the industry coalition
that won the case, said that unless the EPA won an appeal, it could
no longer prove a need for the stringency of the new gas and auto
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials and environmentalists disagreed, saying that
because the administration initiative was partly based on
longstanding national air quality goals predating the Clinton
administration and unaffected by Friday's decision, the court's
ruling should have no effect. EPA officials, planning an appeal,
said they would proceed with public hearings on the auto emissions
and gasoline proposal next month without modifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Sparring over the air pollution plan is likely to intensify this
summer. The Public Interest Research Group, a liberal advocacy
organization, is planning to send volunteers to knock on the doors
of four million households in a bid to muster 135,000 postcards to
federal regulators in support of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and
the Sierra Club, are backing the administration plan, although they
are calling for faster cuts in pollution by sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Oil lobbyists contend that the plan could add 6 cents a gallon
to the price of gasoline instead of the 1 or 2 cents estimated by
regulators. The lobbyists expect the administration to change the
rules little if at all after the public comments.
</P>
<P>
   So the industry is preparing for two hearings in the Senate this
week by one of their allies, Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., who is
drafting legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Top American and foreign auto executives met in Washington on
Wednesday to map out their strategy. The industry has been pleased
with the cleaner gasoline rules, which will make it easier to build
cleaner-burning engines.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly interested in improving their environmental image
and irritated by criticism of pollution by sport utility vehicles,
auto executives have been reluctant to criticize the Clinton
initiative, instead proclaiming their ``general support.'' But the
industry is asking regulators to extend by two years, to the 2011
model year, the deadline for large sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks to meet car pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he thought that the administration would prevail in
imposing tough rules this year. ``It has taken several years to get
to this stage and we of course don't have the final rule yet, but
I'm optimistic,'' he said in an interview this month.
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans win next year's presidential election, they
might be able to revise the gas and auto emissions standards,
possibly citing Friday's court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been watching Gore's comments on automotive
issues closely. President Bush ran television advertisements in
Ohio and Michigan in 1992 warning that Clinton and Gore would
tighten fuel-economy standards and force tens of thousands of
autoworkers into unemployment. Engler said similar criticisms could
be leveled against Gore next year.
</P>
<P>
   Engler, who has won three consecutive races for governor in this
fiercely contested industrial state and is a possible Republican
vice presidential candidate, said American families liked the
interior space and perceived safety of big sport utility vehicles.
Voters in general and autoworkers in particular will be leery, he
said, of a Democrat whose environmental views could be portrayed as
advocating a return to ``little tiny cars'' of the sort still seen
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Though top auto executives may see tighter rules as inevitable,
there remains an undercurrent of hostility here toward any limits
on automobiles. An editorial cartoon in The Detroit News on May 8
showed Gore in an immense 18-wheeler labeled ``Big Gov't,'' honking
the horn while tailgating a sport utility vehicle. The explanation
at the top of the cartoon read, ``Al Gore's plan to get oversized
SUV's off the road.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives have warned that large sport utility vehicles
might have to be made smaller or less powerful to comply with the
latter stages of the new rules, which will be phased in between
2004 and 2009. But Gore made a point of saying in a speech here
that he thought the new regulations provided enough flexibility to
industry to avoid reducing consumers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who has been consulted by Gore on
electoral strategy in the Upper Midwest, said he strongly doubted
that voters would hold the new regulations against the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore isn't cracking down on sport utilities _ the EPA is,''
Dingell said, also pointing out the willingness of auto executives
to go along with more stringent rules.
</P>
<P>
   Edward V. Sarpolus, a vice president of EPIC/MRA, a polling firm
in Lansing, Mich., which works for both parties and the news media,
said there was little evidence that the 1992 Republican
advertisements had been effective. Michigan workers tended to blame
corporate downsizing, rather than regulatory policy, as the main
cause of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates that beginning in 2004, the new rules will add
$100 to the cost of a car and $200 to the cost of a sport utility
vehicle or pickup truck. Auto lobbyists say those are
underestimates, but Sarpolus said the price increases were small
enough and far enough in the future to play down their political
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry studies indicate that sport utility vehicles
are not especially safe; their occupants are just as likely as
those in cars to die in crashes, while more likely to kill other
people in collisions with other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe has been trying to draft legislation that would alter the
gasoline provisions of the administration plan without starting
another broad fight over the Clean Air Act, a controversial piece
of legislation covering all aspects of air pollution that tied up
congressional leaders for months in 1990. But Dingell said it was
impossible to make any changes in the law without reopening the
whole issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to draft national air
quality standards, but the appeals court found on Friday that the
agency behaved unconstitutionally in not asking Congress for
detailed instructions on drafting the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The auto and gasoline rules do not cover fuel economy. In the
interview, Gore said he had been talking with auto executives about
ways to triple the fuel economy of sport utilities through joint
research programs with the government to explore alternative fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore advocated tighter fuel-economy rules when he was in
the Senate, he and Clinton largely abandoned that position in 1992
after the Republican television campaign, calling instead for
federal research subsidies.

DRIVE TO IMPEACH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DIES IN PARLIAMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a flood of venomous oratory, the Communist-led
drive to impeach President Boris Yeltsin failed in Russia's
parliament Saturday as nearly 100 members of the legislature
unexpectedly stayed away from the session, and some ballots were
thrown out because they carried no names or were defaced.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's opponents in the lower house of parliament, the Duma,
needed 300 votes out of the 442 active members to win impeachment
on any of the five charges against him. The count deemed most
likely to succeed was the charge that Yeltsin waged an illegal war
against the rebellious Russian republic of Chechnya in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But late Saturday afternoon parliament officials reported that
only 283 valid votes were cast in support of the Chechnya charge,
17 short of what was needed. Forty-three legislators voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other charges approached that total. Besides the
accusation involving the war in Chechnya, Yeltsin had been charged
with illegally dissolving the Soviet Union in 1991, staging a
violent 1993 coup against rebellious Communists in parliament,
destroying the Russian military and committing genocide by allowing
the nation's living standards to plummet, leading millions of
Russians to an early death.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide charge gathered 238 votes in support and 88
against. The charge of destroying the army collected 240 votes in
support and 77 against; the charge of dismantling the Soviet Union,
239 votes in support and 78 against, and the charge of staging a
coup against Parliament, 263 votes for and 60 against.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders forecast on Friday that the Duma would approve
at least the Chechnya charge, and possibly others. But their cause
was set back seriously when only 348 ballots were accepted at
Saturday's climactic vote, 94 short of the number of active
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14 ballots were thrown out on some votes, either
because they were unsigned or were defaced with a large X.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a boycott of Saturday's balloting, the Communists sought
unsuccessfully on Friday to hold the impeachment votes then, rather
than wait until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant quoted officials Saturday as saying
that an ``epidemic'' had struck parliament members and that many
had checked into Moscow's prestigious Central Clinical Hospital for
treatment. The hospital was unable to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators have been under intense pressure to vote for
impeachment because of Yeltsin's unpopularity among voters. But
many also feared retaliation from the Kremlin should they support a
failed impeachment attempt, and it was widely believed that others
were offered jobs or other inducements to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for one of the leading Communists, the chairman of
the Duma's security committee, Viktor Ilyukhin, seemed resigned to
defeat after the vote, saying that it was the symbolism of the
impeachment effort that mattered, not the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether impeachment happens or not, we have to look at things
realistically,'' the spokesman, Aleksandr Volkov, said. ``This is a
big political action, important for the entire country. The vote
itself doesn't show what it actually means, because there is a big
political game'' affecting the balloting. Volkov said that ``all
the numbers don't show reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With any result,'' he said ``this is a big achievement of the
parliament _ that it can speak out against the government and its
actions. It shows to those who come next that the people are not
without a voice. It shows to the next Duma that they have a right
to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The firebrand nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky told Interfax
news agency that the Communist loss was a signal for Yeltsin to
``crush the leftists.'' Zhirinovsky, the head of the Liberal
National Democratic Party and an opponent of impeachment, predicted
that Yeltsin would now move to ban the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before the votes, the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady
Zyuganov, said the impeachment process ``has already had a
refreshing effect in this hall and on the general situation in the
country'' by underscoring that even the highest officials are
accountable for their deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything was underscored by the three days of debate this
week, it was that the division between the Yeltsin government and
the Communists who control the parliament has evolved from fierce
political rivalry to blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov branded Yeltsin ``absolute evil'' in his closing
speech, a savaging of the president and a mournful eulogy for an
empire lost, ``a thousand-year-old power; the power that Hitler
failed to conquer but which, through the efforts of Yeltsin and his
team, was torn to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country took almost five centuries to gain access to the
seas, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea,'' he said, ``and today we
have been thrown back from these seas and we have sustained
colossal economic and moral losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all humiliated because the old people and the children,
the women and workers have been robbed. The reserves of the
strategic resources of this country amounted to more than $200
billion. Everything has been wasted _ sold and drunk away. We have
lost almost all property which was accumulated not during the 70
years of Soviet power, but during all the history of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Yeltsin's most powerful bloc of supporters in the
party, Our Russian Home, Vladimir Ryzhkov, retorted that the
charges against Yeltsin ``rest on sand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obvious to any law student in his second year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he defended Yeltsin against the impeachment
accusations _ noting, for example, that the Duma had voted to
support the same Chechen war that was the basis of a charge against
Yeltsin _ he conceded that the president has failed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, when he had the support of 97 percent of the
population, he did not use the historic opportunity to create a
truly democratic and stable state with a genuinely responsible
parliament,'' Ryzhkov said. ``In December 1993, when he had a clean
sheet of paper in front of him on which he could write any
constitution he wanted, he wrote the ugliest constitution in the
world which gave rise to a politically irresponsible parliament, a
politically helpless government and a president who was a colossus
on feet of clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, ``he brought us, after 10 years of
privation and setbacks, to a state where we have to begin
everything from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zhirinovsky condemned all sides, saying that Yeltsin was
being upbraided for a dissolution that has been under way for
hundreds of years, at the direction of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be said that the country was ruined in 1991. That
decision was made in 1717 in Paris; 280 years ago the West made a
decision to destroy the Russian empire,'' he said. ``Do you think
Napoleon invaded Russia just for kicks? That Hitler attacked Russia
just like that? That Yugoslavia is being bombed just like that? The
target is one _ the Russian empire, the Soviet Union; never mind
that we are now a democratic country. They are moving closer and
closer to the Russian borders.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Saturday's votes were mostly symbolic.
Few expected that a decision to impeach Yeltsin would actually
result in his removal, because the charges would have to survive
review by Yeltsin's appointees to constitutional and supreme
courts, and then pass the upper house of parliament, which has
often backed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment had a gravity beyond mere condemnation of the
president. Many experts believe _ and some Kremlin aides have
hinted _ that Yeltsin would strike back at the Communists should
impeachment have passed, perhaps by finding a legal excuse to
dissolve the Duma and force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Constitution prohibits dissolving the Duma while an
impeachment is in progress. An attempt by Yeltsin to sidestep that
requirement would have provoked a showdown that could well have
endangered the nation's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Communists now must decide whether they wish to rebuff Yeltsin
by rejecting his choice of Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to
succeed Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is required to dissolve the Duma if it refuses three
times to ratify the nomination of a new prime minister. Although
the Duma seemed certain to reject Stepashin earlier last week,
Communist advisers said on Friday and Saturday that they hoped the
Duma would approve the nomination, if only to provide some
continuity in the government.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beaux-Arts on the rebound? No. A great act of civic
vandalism undone? That was never in the cards. But if you can set
such golden platitudes aside, you may begin to appreciate the
intrinsic merits of the superb new plan to remodel the historic
James A. Farley Building, the old general post office on Eighth
Avenue between 31st and 33rd streets, into a future home for Penn
Station.
</P>
<P>
   It would be folly to see this plan as an attempt to resurrect
the original Penn Station, the legendary McKim, Mead &AMP; White
edifice that was torn down in the 1960s and has haunted the city's
conscience ever since. (Its former site is now occupied by Madison
Square Garden.) On the contrary, the best news about this plan is
that it should finally lay Penn Station's tired old ghost to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by David Childs of the New York office of Skidmore,
Owings &AMP; Merrill, the new plan offers a lean, sinewy architecture
that is held together, both visually and structurally, by metal
trusses. Within the Farley Building's stone wrapper of classical
columns and pilasters there are bright, airy interiors,
consistently logical patterns for passenger circulation and a
spectacular flow of space that cascades from street level down to
the train platforms four stories below.
</P>
<P>
   The design is to be unveiled by President Clinton on Wednesday
in a ceremony at the Farley Building. Gov. George Pataki, Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater,
Empire State Development Corp. president Charles Gargano and other
public officials are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The project faces several obstacles before work can proceed.
About $134 million of its estimated $484 million cost is not yet in
place. (About $350 million has already been committed from federal,
state and city sources; officials involved in the project say they
hope Clinton's appearance will spur approval of the rest.)
</P>
<P>
   The design might also face challenges from the state's historic
preservation officer, Bernadette Castro, whose approval is required
before alterations can be made on the landmark structure.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' plan deserves swift approval. But the design's esthetic
and functional virtues may well be secondary to its symbolic value.
In an era better known for the decrepitude of its infrastructure
than for inspiring new visions of the city's future, the plan comes
as proof that New York can still undertake major public works. This
is the most important transportation project undertaken in New York
City in several generations.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Station is already the nation's most heavily trafficked
transportation center. When completed in 2003 it will serve more
passengers a year than the three regional airports combined. It
will provide a hub for major transportation systems, including
Amtrak, the New Jersey Transit System, the Long Island Rail Road,
the city's subway system and new rail links to John F. Kennedy and
Newark Airports.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't Arthur Clark's sky elevator be stationed here
as well? Hot air balloons, anyone? Hang-gliding?
</P>
<P>
   The Farley Building, which covers more than eight acres, was
constructed in two stages, each part roughly the same size. Childs'
design takes advantage of this two-part configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will continue to occupy most of the
building's 1935 annex _ the western half of the site _ mainly for
trucking in the tons of unsolicited mail order catalogs that daily
clog the nation's mail boxes. The new station will be housed in the
original part of the building, completed in 1913. But the Postal
Service will continue to operate its retail office at the top of
the grand staircase that extends the full length of the Eighth
Avenue facade. New Yorkers will still have the horrible pleasure of
bounding up the stairs as midnight approaches each April 15.
</P>
<P>
   When the annex was constructed, a 90-foot roadway was installed
between it and the original building as a docking station for
trucks. Childs' plan converts this space into the station's main
entrance and ticketing hall. The hall is sheltered beneath a
soaring roof that is braced on the west side by a huge metal truss.
Despite its scale the truss makes an ethereal impression. Its
struts are thin, and Childs would like to fashion them from nickel,
perhaps in homage to the nickel silver that graced the tables in
the dining cars of yore. This metal takes the light like a star.
You want to send it a rose.
</P>
<P>
   The truss is shaped in a curve that recalls a radio antenna, an
apt piece of symbolism for an era in which the satellite has gone
far toward replacing the mail train as a communications relay. On
the east side, the truss is draped with a glass skin that tapers
down toward the edges, making a series of graceful, geometric folds
that eventually splay out to form wedge-shaped canopies. These
project out over the sidewalks at either end.
</P>
<P>
   Rising 75 feet above the Farley Building's roof line, the
curving space frame is the design's most conspicuous exterior
feature. Slicing the building neatly in two, it indicates from afar
that the station's entrances are at midblock, halfway between
Eighth and Ninth avenues. It also allows natural light to flood the
ticketing hall. This will be a great public space.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, air travelers will be able to check in and deposit
their bags at counters, located on the west side of the hall,
before boarding the train to the plane. First-class passengers will
have the option of waiting for the train in lounges on the level
below. Rail passengers will be ticketed at counters lining the east
side of the hall. They can then proceed into the station's most
spectacular space. Now called the train concourse, it is housed
within the enclosed courtyard that was once the main sorting room
for the city's mail.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, double trusses of steel have been retained from the
original design. In renderings, the trusses look heavy, even
oppressive. This should not be surprising, for they once contained
catwalks patrolled by inspectors whose job was to see that the
sorters below were not pocketing the mail. In the station the
catwalks will be gone, the trusses will support clear skylights and
their ponderousness will be considerably mitigated by the space
cascading beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   This cascade is the interior's most dramatic feature. The
descent from the ticketing hall to the trains will be made by
escalator, broken in stages by two platforms, each almost two
blocks wide. On their way to the trains, departing passengers will
command clear vistas from street level to the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The platforms, which Childs calls ``trays,'' will hold seated
waiting areas and will be ringed by shops and restaurants. The
station will include about 50,000 square feet of retail space in
all. A media wall, surrounding the departure board, can be
programmed to announce weather conditions, cultural events and
other information about travel destinations. The best place to get
short ribs in St. Louis. Land prices in the Rockies. Elvis
sightings in Memphis. Crime rates on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the train concourse is the reverse of the
fluorescent-soaked, bargain basement ambience of the present Penn
Station. It should create the monumental sense of occasion for
which the old Penn Station was justly celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists would like the metal truss to be scaled
back in size, so that it would be barely visible from the street.
There have also been calls for a small ``classical'' waiting room
to be placed on the station's street floor level.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas expose an extremely shallow view of history. What the
plan offers now is a  &UR; huge &LR;  classical waiting room. And the truss,
in its present scale, is not merely a flashy modern flourish. It is
the key to the whole design. It's a sign of recognition that
structural expression is the classicism of our time.
</P>
<P>
   This idea was implied in the platform concourse of the original
Penn Station, where columns and arches of steel echoed the Beaux
Arts design of the General Waiting Room but were left uncovered by
masonry cladding. Until the concourse's glass roof was blacked out
by wartime requirements it could be seen that this was essentially
Crystal Palace architecture. Like Joseph Paxton's 1851 London
exhibition hall this was a precursor of the metal and glass
structures later built in what would come to be called the
International Style.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Station as a whole, however, perpetuated the problem that
had perplexed architects in the 19th century and prevented that
style from coming to fruition. Throughout Europe, in fact, no
building type better embodied that problem than the metropolitan
train station. With its metal shed concealed behind a masonry
facade, the station epitomized the dichotomy between architecture
and structural engineering. And it dramatized the extent to which
engineering often exceeded architecture in expressive power.
</P>
<P>
   Victorian architects were haunted by this discrepancy. It would
take another generation before modern architects like Mies van der
Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius resolved the dichotomy. They
accomplished this by stripping away the historical styles and
allowing structural engineering to shape architectural form.
</P>
<P>
   This act of synthesis proved a mixed blessing. On the one hand,
it contributed to a discrediting of period revival architecture. It
made it possible for owners to contemplate tearing down such
glorious buildings as Penn Station, the Produce Exchange Building
and the Astor Hotel. At the same time, the fusion of architecture
and engineering gave birth to a classical style for the machine
age, as epitomized by the Seagram Building on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   No firm did more to propagate this style than Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill. New York is replete with examples, including the
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Building (now Chase Bank) on Fifth
Avenue and 44th Street. The Pepsi Cola Building on Park Avenue at
60th Street. The First National City Bank (now Citibank) branch at
Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   These exquisite buildings are machine age temples, serene
pavilions for the era of steel construction, elevators and plate
glass. With such designs, Skidmore Owings &AMP; Merrill asserted its
claim to represent the center of gravity in American architecture,
the position occupied by McKim, Mead &AMP; White a half-century before.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' Penn Station design restates his firm's commitment to
the clear architectonic principles that guided it during its
greatest years. If nothing can bring back the old station, at least
this rigorous new design can sharpen our appreciation for the
golden age of classical modern architecture that flowered 50 years
after the heyday of McKim Mead &AMP; White.
</P>
<P>
   This recognition of our strengths is a foundation New York can
build on. Childs' design does so. The urban story here may be the
birth of a great station. But the architectural angle is the
creative resurgence of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill.

   WASHINGTON _ The curse and the blessing of the global economy is
that no one's in charge.
</P>
<P>
   To those it has flattened recently _ the Russians, many Asians,
the Brazilians _ it resembles a bullet train on autopilot, roaring
across borders and barreling over slower-moving vehicles while a
bunch of wealthy Americans down champagne in the club car.
</P>
<P>
   To free-marketeers, it is the triumph of the invisible hand, a
system governed by economic laws and not meddling economic
planners, fueled by the Internet instead of ideology.
</P>
<P>
   But global economic forces are not always as faceless and
automatic as they seem. And when Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
announced his resignation last week, it was a reminder that in
matters economic, personalities and the confidence they inspire
still matter.
</P>
<P>
   Historians will debate for years whether Rubin helped spark the
amazing boom of the '90s by preaching fiscal austerity to
free-spending Democrats, or whether he just got lucky. They will
argue endlessly whether his moves to save Mexico created an
expectation that the United States would keep countries from going
under, and thus invited a far worse global panic.
</P>
<P>
   They will make a convincing case that Rubin and his colleagues
never had a workable plan to save Russia from itself as they poured
billions down a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rubin's harshest critics agree on this: Like his weekly
breakfast partner, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, he understands that markets are manic-depressive _
and that averting disaster means making sure that someone,
preferably someone in Washington, has the credibility to step in
and tame the worst mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   When crisis struck _ in Mexico in 1995, Asia in 1997 and New
York last September _ it was partly the cult of confidence in the
Rubin-Greenspan tandem that restored stability.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that was smoke and mirrors: Governments can tinker with
interest rates and budgets, of course, but in a world where a
trillion dollars changes hands daily, their firepower is
diminished. Yet one of the lessons of the past decade is that when
confidence in economic leadership is lost, the results can be
disastrous: Just ask the Japanese, who once had it and then
squandered it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the way Rubin dressed, or maybe it was his 26 years
on Wall Street _ which he was always invoking in conversation _ but
somehow he had an an uncanny sense for the words and signals that
would calm the global herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rubin was something like an old family doctor in the days
before antibiotics,'' said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``He knew that even
if there was not much he could always do, most things get better
over time. So the important thing is to have a good bedside manner
and help people through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin himself acknowledged, in a conversation last week, that
bedside manner is an important element of the job _ though it works
only with ``the credibility you establish through fiscal discipline
and an understanding of how what happens outside our borders can
affect our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of his presence paid off one afternoon in October
1997, the early days of the Asian crisis, when a huge convulsion in
the Hong Kong market led to a 554 point drop in New York _ more
than 7 percent _ and shut down the stock exchange early.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin walked out on the steps of the Treasury, faced the cameras
_ and said nothing particularly memorable. But his few lines, all
about the underlying strength of America's ``fundamentals'' and
keeping markets operating smoothly even in the face of potential
crisis, were intended, he recalled last week, to show that ``there
was a lot of focus on the issue, a lot of concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether it was Rubin's calm or something else, the
Dow's fall halted at 7,300. It has since risen another 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most important jawboning takes place in private. South
Korean officials say the only reason they avoided national default
in December 1997 was Rubin's effectiveness in arm-twisting U.S.
banks to roll over South Korea's loans _ stopping a panic that many
feared would spread to Japan and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin now counts South Korea's brush with disaster as one of the
``scariest'' moments of his tenure, along with the near-collapse of
the global financial system in the wake of Russia's default on its
loans last year.
</P>
<P>
   That was when it seemed as if the driverless train was headed
over a cliff _ and it may well have been. The panic around the
globe was so broad and deep that it was clear that no words, no
walk down the Treasury steps, would suffice. So the strategy was to
create the sense in the markets _ some would say the illusion _
that Rubin and Greenspan had temporarily taken the wheel, not only
of the U.S. economy but of all the major industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
   They coordinated a series of statements by President Clinton and
other world leaders that the biggest risk to the world was no
longer inflation but rather a global economic slowdown. And then,
over a period of weeks, came a series of interest-rate cuts that
turned the markets around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the moves were a Band-Aid, and much of the
impassioned oratory heard then about the need for remaking the
``global economic architecture'' has since died out. But the
Band-Aid stopped the bleeding. Until the next time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, no one is quite sure why it worked. ``Credibility
is born of past success,'' says Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official
at the International Monetary Fund and a key player during several
crises. So part of the Rubin-Greenspan magic, he argues, comes from
the fact that the U.S. economy has been up for so long.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who at age 78 has had
longer and deeper experience than almost any of his counterparts,
doesn't cut the same ice. That is because Japan's political
paralysis has undercut not only its own economy, but its influence
in the global economy. Europe hasn't done much better.
</P>
<P>
   But what about President Clinton's designee as the new Treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers? While Rubin and Summers have been
close partners, they could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is rail-thin and always in a banker's suit. Summers, a
44-year-old former Harvard economist, tells jokes about his weight
and often looks as if he has stayed up all night. Unlike Rubin, he
can be acerbic and cutting, although lately he has tempered his
impatience with those who don't understand the bruising dynamics of
the global forces at work.
</P>
<P>
   With an inclination to be more of an interventionist, he speaks
with greater sweep than Rubin does, with declarations like ``The
major challenge for the United States is whether it can become the
first outward-looking, continental, nonimperialist power in
history.'' But whether he can speak the language of the markets _
whether he can walk down the Treasury's steps and convey a sense of
calm _ is a test yet to come.

   In the end, whether it was Rubin's calm or something else, the
Dow's fall halted at 7,300. It has since risen another 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most important jawboning takes place in private. South
Korean officials say the only reason they avoided national default
in December 1997 was Rubin's effectiveness in arm-twisting U.S.
banks to roll over South Korea's loans _ stopping a panic that many
feared would spread to Japan and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin now counts South Korea's brush with disaster as one of the
``scariest'' moments of his tenure, along with the near-collapse of
the global financial system in the wake of Russia's default on its
loans last year.
</P>
<P>
   That was when it seemed as if the driverless train was headed
over a cliff _ and it may well have been. The panic around the
globe was so broad and deep that it was clear that no words, no
walk down the Treasury steps, would suffice. So the strategy was to
create the sense in the markets _ some would say the illusion _
that Rubin and Greenspan had temporarily taken the wheel, not only
of the U.S. economy but of all the major industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
   They coordinated a series of statements by President Clinton and
other world leaders that the biggest risk to the world was no
longer inflation but rather a global economic slowdown. And then,
over a period of weeks, came a series of interest-rate cuts that
turned the markets around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the moves were a Band-Aid, and much of the
impassioned oratory heard then about the need for remaking the
``global economic architecture'' has since died out. But the
Band-Aid stopped the bleeding. Until the next time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, no one is quite sure why it worked. ``Credibility
is born of past success,'' says Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official
at the International Monetary Fund and a key player during several
crises. So part of the Rubin-Greenspan magic, he argues, comes from
the fact that the U.S. economy has been up for so long.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who at age 78 has had
longer and deeper experience than almost any of his counterparts,
doesn't cut the same ice. That is because Japan's political
paralysis has undercut not only its own economy, but its influence
in the global economy. Europe hasn't done much better.
</P>
<P>
   But what about President Clinton's designee as the new Treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers? While Rubin and Summers have been
close partners, they could not be more different.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin is rail-thin and always in a banker's suit. Summers, a
44-year-old former Harvard economist, tells jokes about his weight
and often looks as if he has stayed up all night. Unlike Rubin, he
can be acerbic and cutting, although lately he has tempered his
impatience with those who don't understand the bruising dynamics of
the global forces at work.
</P>
<P>
   With an inclination to be more of an interventionist, he speaks
with greater sweep than Rubin does, with declarations like ``The
major challenge for the United States is whether it can become the
first outward-looking, continental, nonimperialist power in
history.'' But whether he can speak the language of the markets _
whether he can walk down the Treasury's steps and convey a sense of
calm _ is a test yet to come.

   A Fund-Raiser's Story About Chinese Money
</P>
<P>
   In his first public account of life as a globe-trotting
Democratic fund-raiser, California businessman Johnny Chung told a
House panel how a top Chinese intelligence official wired him
$300,000 for President Clinton's 1996 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   At a Hong Kong abalone restaurant, the intelligence official,
Gen. Ji Shengde, spoke of the president to Chung: ``We hope to see
him re-elected. I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give
it to the president and the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators, calling the contributions evidence
of a Beijing effort to influence U.S. elections, have traced about
$35,000 of the money to the Democratic National Committee.

   Questions About Research at Duke University

   Federal inspectors were dismayed last December when they found
sloppy record-keeping on human medical research at the Duke
University Medical Center, and angered when the problems were not
corrected. So the government suspended the center's federally
financed research, worth $175 million a year. But three days later,
on Friday, the government lifted the restrictions, saying Duke had
come up with a satisfactory plan to improve.

   A Warning on Liposuction
</P>
<P>
   Doctors warned that the United States' favorite cosmetic
surgery, liposuction, can be fatal. A review of autopsy reports in
New York City from 1993 to 1998 identified five deaths during or
shortly after the procedure, in which surgeons use a suction device
to remove fat from areas like the hips, thighs and abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the small number of deaths, the reviewers, from New York
University and the office of the chief medical examiner of New York
City, called the cases cause for serious concern, because
liposuction is not medically necessary and is performed on healthy
people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the extent of the problem is unknown, because national
statistics are not kept on deaths or complications from the
procedure.

   American Airlines became the latest target of antitrust
prosecutors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare predatory pricing case, the United States'
second-largest airline was accused of protecting its monopoly from
three low-cost carriers at its hub in the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport
by slashing prices below cost and offering bigger and more frequent
flights. After the competitors left, the government said, American
promptly raised its fares and reduced flights.

executives said what they had done was nothing more than wholesome

   Republicans Shift on Gun Measure

   Senate Republicans did a U-turn, first voting down and then
pushing through a measure to promote background checks of buyers at
gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, preferring a more stringent proposal of their own,
almost solidly opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the political tide on gun control had turned in
their favor, the Democrats were determined not to let Republicans
steal any credit for seeming to advocate stricter regulation of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure, approved in a 48-47 vote, was part of a
juvenile-justice bill whose fate in the Senate, let alone the
House, is still uncertain, as is its reception at the White House
once it clears Congress.

   Pondering the Lessons of the Roundworm
</P>
<P>
   Can longevity be engineered into our genes? Biologists can
double the life span of the roundworm, a standard laboratory
organism, by manipulating certain of its genes, but it was not
clear what these genes did.
</P>
<P>
   A new report from Columbia University shows the genes act by
turning on an enzyme that mops up free radicals, byproducts of
metabolism that can damage the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't the body protect itself better from free radicals
and live longer? Perhaps because the immune system uses free
radicals to zap bacteria. As so often, there's no free lunch.

   Marine Pilot Sentenced in Ski Gondola Case
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps pilot acquitted of manslaughter in the Italian
ski gondola accident that killed 20 people was sentenced to six
months in prison and dismissed from the corps for helping to
destroy a videotape of the flight in which his jet sliced the
gondola's cable.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif.,
was the first crew member sentenced to prison in connection with
the 1998 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was convicted by a military jury of obstruction of justice
and conspiracy for his actions after his plane sliced the cable and
sent the gondola's passengers plunging to their death. He had
argued that there was nothing incriminating on the tape, which was
shot just before the jet entered the alpine valley where it cut the
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the four crew members had already pleaded guilty to
obstruction and conspiracy and was dismissed from the Marine Corps.
Charges against the other two, who were in the back seat of the
jet, were dropped.

   Wal-Mart Won't Sell an Emergency Contraceptive
</P>
<P>
   Women seeking to fill prescriptions for an emergency
contraceptive at Wal-Mart store pharmacies will have to go
elsewhere. The United States' largest retail chain, which is also
the fifth-largest pharmaceutical distributor, said it would not
sell the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. won't say exactly why the
company has decided not to sell Preven, a high-dose birth-control
medication approved last year to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours
after unprotected sex. The company has said only that it made a
``business decision'' not to sell the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood, which has criticized the policy, said it may
stem from pressure by some anti-abortion groups that believe life
begins the moment an egg is fertilized. The drug stops ovulation
and may prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.

   No Loose Ends
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as surprising as discovering a new bone in the
human body. Biologists reported that chromosomes _ the lengthy DNA
molecules that carry our genetic instructions _ end in neatly tied
loops.
</P>
<P>
   When human cells sense the end of a DNA molecule, they assume a
chromosome has been accidentally cut, and will kill themselves if
they cannot repair it.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't the ends of normal chromosomes equally alarming to
the cell? The new discovery provides the answer: Normal chromosomes
have no ends, just the unbroken continuum of a circle.

   A Sharp Rise in Inflation
</P>
<P>
   The government reported that inflation moved up sharply at the
consumer level in April, driven in part by rising oil and gasoline
prices, and analysts said the remarkable decline in prices over the
last several years may be over.
</P>
<P>
   Still, economists are not predicting that inflation is taking
off. It is just that after the meager 1.6 percent rise in the
Consumer Price Index last year, which can be attributed largely to
plunging oil prices, inflation is now likely to return to the 2.3
percent pace of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The indication of an acceleration in prices was enough to send
stock and bond prices sharply lower and interest rates higher on
Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 193.87 points, or
1.75 percent, to 10,913.32.

   Getting Out the Vote in 90210
</P>
<P>
   Who says the voting public is apathetic?
</P>
<P>
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., fully a quarter of registered voters
turned out for a special election involving a single, seemingly
minor issue: whether a little label should be affixed to certain
items for sale in town.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of furs are sold in Beverly Hills, it seems _ don't ask
why anyone needs a fur coat in Southern California _ and
animal-rights activists chose this as a symbolic battleground,
pushing for a required tag that read, ``This product is made with
fur from animals that may have been killed by electrocution,
gassing, neck breaking, poisoning, clubbing, stomping or drowning
and may have been trapped in steel-jaw leghold traps.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple matter of truth in advertising, its backers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign got wide publicity, with some Hollywood stars
signing on and graphic videos sent to thousands of homes, but in
the end Beverly Hills said no thanks to the symbolic honor, voting
down the proposal nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to those poor Rodeo Drive boutiques, some
said, while others objected to the vagueness of the ``may have
been'' in front of that string of anything-but-vague words.
</P>
<P>
   But backers claimed victory, too. ``If our intent was to educate
people about these killing methods the fur industry uses,'' said
Luke Montgomery, campaign manager for supporters of the referendum,
``we certainly did our job.''
</P>
<P>
   _ HUBERT B. HERRING
</P>
<P>
   It's My Turn. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In his first letter to Joyce Maynard, J.D. Salinger urged her to
be ``almost inhumanly cautious'' about accepting the offers and
invitations likely to come her way in the wake of a widely read
reminiscence she wrote at the age of 18 in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they both should have followed his advice about the
virtues of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 14 letters he wrote her between April 1972 and August
1973 are being auctioned in the latest episode of a literary tale
so bleak and mordant that few writers could have thought it up.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, the celebrated author of ``A Catcher in the Rye,'' has
not published since 1965 and has spent most of his adult life doing
everything possible to protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, with whom he began a nine-month romance when he was
53 and she was 18, wrote her first memoir when she was still a
teen-ager and has chronicled her personal life ever since.
</P>
<P>
   She managed not to write about their relationship, which he
summarily ended, for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But last year she exhumed it in detail in her second memoir,
``At Home in the World'' (Picador USA, 1998). Now, saying she needs
the money more than she needs a box of old letters, Ms. Maynard is
auctioning them.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, who is now 80, was successful in 1987 in blocking a
biographer from quoting extensively from other letters.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Maynard can sell the letters she owns to whomever she
likes. Sotheby's estimates they will sell for $60,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   A recent sale of seven letters totaling 29 pages from Oscar
Wilde were estimated at $15,000 to $20,000 and went for $51,750.

signing on and graphic videos sent to thousands of homes, but in
the end Beverly Hills said no thanks to the symbolic honor, voting
down the proposal nearly 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to those poor Rodeo Drive boutiques, some
said, while others objected to the vagueness of the ``may have
been'' in front of that string of anything-but-vague words.
</P>
<P>
   But backers claimed victory, too. ``If our intent was to educate
people about these killing methods the fur industry uses,'' said
Luke Montgomery, campaign manager for supporters of the referendum,
``we certainly did our job.''

</P>
<P>
   It's My Turn. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In his first letter to Joyce Maynard, J.D. Salinger urged her to
be ``almost inhumanly cautious'' about accepting the offers and
invitations likely to come her way in the wake of a widely read
reminiscence she wrote at the age of 18 in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they both should have followed his advice about the
virtues of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 14 letters he wrote her between April 1972 and August
1973 are being auctioned in the latest episode of a literary tale
so bleak and mordant that few writers could have thought it up.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, the celebrated author of ``A Catcher in the Rye,'' has
not published since 1965 and has spent most of his adult life doing
everything possible to protect his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, with whom he began a nine-month romance when he was
53 and she was 18, wrote her first memoir when she was still a
teen-ager and has chronicled her personal life ever since.
</P>
<P>
   She managed not to write about their relationship, which he
summarily ended, for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But last year she exhumed it in detail in her second memoir,
``At Home in the World'' (Picador USA, 1998). Now, saying she needs
the money more than she needs a box of old letters, Ms. Maynard is
auctioning them.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger, who is now 80, was successful in 1987 in blocking a
biographer from quoting extensively from other letters.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Maynard can sell the letters she owns to whomever she
likes. Sotheby's estimates they will sell for $60,000 to $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   A recent sale of seven letters totaling 29 pages from Oscar
Wilde were estimated at $15,000 to $20,000 and went for $51,750.

 &HT;    Ripken's aching back
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   AL EAST
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken's back discomfort is not just disk-related, as first
diagnosed, but is the result of stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal
nerve canal. The condition might have stemmed from a herniated disk
he suffered two years ago, but his current pain emanates from a
spur that has grown into the canal.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the stenosis to flare up now might be the saddest
part of what has been a sad year for the Ripkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) could have been the time I spent in the hospital (before
his father's death), sitting and standing for hours,'' he said.
``During my dad's viewing and funeral, I stood up for about 10
hours a day. It's possible that kind of loading on your nerve
caused the irritation.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre reported vastly improved stamina in
the past two weeks and told reporters he hopes to set his date for
returning to the dugout sometime this week. ... Cuban export
Rolando Arrojo is testing Tampa Bay's patience. After starting 1998
at 10-5, Arrojo is 5-11 since, including a 1-4 start this year. ``I
do not care if you go out there and give me what you've got and you
get beat,'' Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild said after the
Twins pounded Arrojo last week. ``But don't get beat giving me less
than that.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Unknowing White Sox
</P>
<P>
   With five rookies making their major-league debuts with the
White Sox already this season, and 11 others having done the same
last year, prospects for Chicago's early success were not high. And
they still aren't, even as the Chisox took a 15-14 record into a
current string of 12 games against New York and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But in a division ruled by the Indians' iron fist, Chicago still
sees itself as a wild-card candidate. The current Sox do not seem
aware that just two seasons ago, the roster was dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we winning?'' asked catcher Brook Fordyce. ``Because
we don't know any better. We don't look series to series, we look
inning to inning. We're not stupid, but maybe a little ignorant.''
...
</P>
<P>
   Detroit manager Larry Parrish took his club apart in a half-hour
closed-door address Wednesday night. ``This ain't no beer-league
softball game where you come here and you have fun and you laugh
and talk and maybe you get some hits and maybe you don't,'' Parrish
said. ... Cleveland's amazing Manny Ramirez just emerged from a
127-game stretch during which he drove in 150 runs.
</P>
<P>
   AL WEST
</P>
<P>
   What the Mariners lack
</P>
<P>
   Seattle general manager Woody Woodward has hit the air-raid
siren, placing outfielders Butch Huskey and Matt Mieske on the
trading block and sending out feelers for an experienced starting
pitcher. The club's plan to go with five rookie pitchers is a
failure made worse by shoulder surgeries to Mark Leiter and Butch
Henry.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have been in touch with Minnesota about the
availablity of relievers, foremost Rick Aguilera, but might have a
better shot at Boston's Jim Corsi or Kip Gross. But one trade will
not cure this club, at least according to a former M, who sees the
club's struggle linked to something deeper than a taped-up bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played for the Seattle Mariners last year and they had some
super-duper stars,'' Phillies outfielder Rob Ducey said. ``But this
(Philadelphia) team has more spirit than that team will ever have.
This team wants to win at all costs.'' ... Texas' Juan Gonzalez
recorded a career first Tuesday when he went into his home-run trot
in Toronto, strained his right hamstring somewhere on the base
paths and was forced to leave the game.

 &HT;    Los Angeles languor
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a fifth of the season complete, tepid early
reviews have been posted in Los Angeles, where the hot air expended
during the winter has equated to a lukewarm spring performance.
</P>
<P>
   At 20-15 as the weekend opened, the Dodgers were testing the
results of yet another team meeting in which the players agreed
things should be better. The front-running San Francisco Giants,
13-10 since the loss of Barry Bonds, hardly have been the masters
of their domain, but the Dodgers haven't seen even a share of first
place since the season's fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Group is not shelling out $79.3 million for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been games where we played great, and there have
been games where we played poor,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``To
be truthful, I'd say we have played fair so far. It's tough to play
up to your billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a little winning streak going to keep the
talk-radio guys off my (rear). They can start talking about the
Lakers and them choking.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles last week became the first team to lose a series to
the Florida Marlins, which suggests some lack of initiative. While
the Dodgers have been worthy against winning clubs, they also are
9-11 against sub-.500 teams. Hence, second baseman Eric Young
called a team meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a good club, and we can win this
(division),'' Young said. ``But there are things we're doing that
we need to do better, stuff you can't do if you're a contending
club. It's not one guy or even one thing. It's a lot of little
things that add up.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Kevin Brown has not had the desired updraft on
the pitching staff yet. Los Angeles entered the weekend with a 4.29
ERA, fifth in the league and nearly a half-run higher than last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort, the most consistent starter in the
early stages, is fighting lower-leg pain related to offseason
surgery for shin splints. Left-hander Carlos Perez gave up three
homers Tuesday against Chicago in his first game since missing a
start because of discomfort in his right leg and knee. Perez denies
a widespread rumor that he hurt himself on a street curb while out
one night with former Montreal teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Dodgers' new profile has taken shape. With
Young leading the way, the team is on pace to steal well over 200
bases, more than the franchise record of 198 set in 1962, when
Maury Wills went for 104. The team batting average of .265 is tied
for 11th in the NL with Atlanta but still is 13 points higher than
a year ago, and the club is scoring nearly a run more a game at
4.8.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie third baseman Adrian Beltre has fit in nicely, hitting a
team-high .336, and could become the youngest Dodger to bat .300.
Raul Mondesi is on pace for a 62-homer season. Those are not
numbers indicative of a team that needs team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be playing a lot better than we are,'' right fielder
Gary Sheffield said. ``We just sit around, have one big inning,
take the next five innings off and let the other team back in it.
Then we finally play with a sense of urgency in the eighth and
ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play like it's your last game,'' Sheffield said.
``You've got to play with an intensity that intimidates the other
team, that makes the other team play flat. I know we're not
intimidating anybody now.

 &HT;    Giant steps help stomp the Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Giants apparently got the best of the Braves in
more ways than one while taking two of three from Atlanta at 3Com
Park last week. For starters, with gusty winds pushing the wind
chill into the 30s, San Francisco catcher Brent Mayne made sure the
Braves were aware of how uncomfortable they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy who came up, I said to him, `Isn't this terrible?' I
think it got into their heads,'' Mayne said. ``They said, `Yeah, I
can't believe you play here every day.' I guess I just reaffirmed
the obvious in their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Marvin Benard, the Giants' leadoff man who was
riding a 1-for-27 slump when the Braves hit town. Brett Butler, an
ex-Giant and now a Braves employee as their newest TV announcer,
had a suggestion for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he said to me was, 'When you're not swinging right, don't
forget about the bunt,' `` Benard said. `` 'It could be your bread
and butter.' He said to just keep trying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Benard had two bunt singles in leadoff at-bats, scored both
times and showed Giants the way to 12 first-inning runs during the
series.
</P>
<P>
   SHHHHHHH
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates don't want baseball people thinking they snookered
Cleveland on the Brian Giles-Ricky Rincon trade. Giles just won NL
player of the week, was hitting .314 with 27 RBIs heading into the
weekend and already has established himself as one of the league's
best right fielders. Rincon, the left-handed reliever who saved 14
games for the Pirates last year, has spent almost the entire first
six weeks on the disabled list with a tender elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like when people write that we stole Brian Giles,''
Pirates GM Cam Bonifay said. ``It's not a fair assessment.
Cleveland happens to have such a deep and talented club that it
couldn't afford Brian Giles a chance to play every day. We got
lucky in the fact he was available.''
</P>
<P>
   And luckier still that the Indians thought Rincon was worth a
future All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   STREAKING
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez's 25-game hitting streak in Arizona is the best
reminder of how often these things come around. The longest hitting
streaks in the majors since Pete Rose set the NL record in 1978:

 &HT;    First Falcons quarterback Johnson struggles to rebuild life
shattered by alcohol
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only 50 yards from Randy Johnson's room at the Banana
Bay Waterfront Motel in Port Charlotte, Fla., late-model
convertibles cruise U.S. Route 41 and onto shiny Gilchrist Bridge.
Behind the motel is a pristine beach lapped by the waves of
sparkling Charlotte Harbor. Nestled among the palm trees less than
a 10-minute drive away are a pair of championship golf courses. On
the roadside, a billboard prominently displayed by one of several
real-estate companies in the area reads: ``Paradise awaits you.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people are drawn to Charlotte County, 25 miles north of
Fort Myers on the Gulf Coast, for the fishing, the golf, the
climate or just the lifestyle of a community known for its
well-manicured lawns and tony condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the first quarterback in the history of the Atlanta
Falcons and a first-round selection in the franchise's initial
draft, went there to die.
</P>
<P>
   Out of money, out of hope, out of touch with his two daughters,
and with his insides ravaged by three decades of alcohol addiction,
Johnson, 54, decided four weeks ago to toss himself either off the
bridge or into the traffic. Sitting on the beach at 4 a.m., with
less than $20 in his pocket and his stomach on fire, Johnson
chugged-a-lugged the remains from a quart of cheap vodka, vomited
blood into the wet sand and decided that he'd had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I had hit rock bottom with a big thud,'' Johnson, who
still is unable to explain the life-saving 911 call he made on his
way out the door of the motel, said late last week. ``You reach a
point where you don't want to hurt yourself anymore, and you don't
want to hurt anyone else who's close to you. For about the past
month, I had spent my days drinking, staring out at the harbor and
feeling sorry for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, you realize that's no way to live. Your life
seems worthless and kind of lifeless, and you wonder if there's any
point continuing. When your spirit is that sapped, suddenly the
alternative doesn't seem so (unthinkable) anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That he survived his would-be suicide attempt, Johnson said, is
testament to a lot of people unfamiliar with his NFL background and
with little more reason to help him than just basic human altruism.
The one-time golden boy, admired by the earliest Falcons fans for
his on-field grit and off-field charisma, has reached a point where
his life was saved only through the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The 911 operator who prefers to remain anonymous and the
paramedics dispatched to Johnson's motel room that morning in late
April got him admitted to Bon Secours-St. Joseph Hospital. He was
diagnosed for a third time since 1981 with pancreatitis, a
condition that resulted directly from heavy drinking. Caseworkers
at the hospital attempted to find an alcohol-treatment program, but
the only one available locally required upfront payment, and
Johnson couldn't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was taken in by Judy Jones, whose double-wide
trailer in nearby Punta Gorda also serves as headquarters for the
Bread of Life Mission, the only homeless shelter in Charlotte
County.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who weighs 300 pounds, and good-naturedly refers to
herself as ``the Refrigerator's sister,'' an allusion to former
Chicago Bears defensive lineman William Perry, is equal parts
mother hen, father confessor, den mother and life-saver. Not far
from where the Peace River meanders through streets lined with palm
trees before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico, Jones has ministered
quietly to the county's homeless for the past 20 years, using
Christianity as the central theme for her mission.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, Johnson has washed dishes, answered the phone
for Jones and stacked donated food. Working in a place he described
as ``only a small step above homeless,'' he also has counseled
down-on-their-luck men and has served as a sort of public-relations
man for expansion efforts. Most importantly, Johnson is heading
into his fourth week of cold-turkey sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely,'' Jones said, ``he's getting it turned
around. But it's a process, and I think he realizes there's no
shortcut. You've got to pull yourself out of that spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved from Atlanta to Port Charlotte in late February
when a friend promised him a management position at a check-cashing
and car-loan business he hoped to start. But the sudden collapse of
the proposed business was just the latest in a string of setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played five of his 10 NFL seasons with the Falcons,
appearing in 46 games from 1966 through 1970. He completed 435 of
904 passes for 5,538 yards with 34 touchdowns and 65 interceptions.
Defining the term ``journeyman quarterback,'' he also played with
the Giants, Redskins and Packers and the Honolulu Hawaiians of the
old WFL. When he was 34, he retired, having earned $90,000 in
salary each of his final three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Johnson suffered three concussions, broken
ribs, a knee injury and had two operations on his right, throwing
shoulder. Former teammates Tommy Nobis and Jeff Van Note recalled
last week the beatings that Johnson took while playing behind a
makeshift offensive line for the expansion Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one game where I just couldn't handle the guy in
front of me,'' Van Note said. ``I actually apologized in the huddle
to Randy (for the hits he was taking). Randy was a good player, and
early on he was `The Man' in Atlanta. He was a sharp-looking guy,
dressed well, rubbed shoulders on the golf course with important
people in town. But we got that poor guy killed just about every
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the physical beatings he endured might have
contributed to his drinking, but he refused to use football as
``the convenient excuse'' for his own weakness. The only
shortcoming Nobis recalled was Johnson's inability to refuse any
person seeking his time. Nobis, the team's first draft pick, met
Johnson while they were growing up in San Antonio. The two played
against each other in junior high school but not in high school or
college. During their years with the Falcons, the men and their
wives became good friends. Johnson acknowledges an irony that Nobis
spent virtually his entire adult life working for the Falcons while
he has knocked around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys get into trouble trying to be something they're
not,'' Nobis said. ``But that wasn't Randy. Instead, he'd get
himself into jams trying to be good to people. He was a charmer,
but not a con man, and, boy, what an athlete. He had this city in
his corner. He had so much going for him, and I'm sure he regrets
he let opportunity slip by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after his retirement, Johnson filed for bankruptcy,
and his wife, Penny, divorced him. All but broke, he was forced to
take his $600-per-month league pension early. Johnson worked as a
television sportscaster in San Antonio, then went into real estate
and solar-energy development before a friend gave him a job
supervising security at the Scottish Inn in Marietta. Most of the
positions ended the same way, with Johnson dismissed because of
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Former Falcons wide receiver Alex Hawkins and NFL Players
Association executive director Gene Upshaw, a college teammate at
Texas A&AMP;I, tried on several occasions to help Johnson, but he
declined their attempts at intervention.
</P>
<P>
   He has been through alcohol-treatment programs twice, served
jail time because of what police termed a business scam, spent time
in two mental institutions and has been diagnosed as manic
depressive. Worst of all, he hasn't seen daughters Ashley, 28, and
Jennifer, 26, in 20 years. All he knows is that they live somewhere
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my wife and kids, I was about as irresponsible as a man
could be,'' Johnson said. ``Basically, I abandoned them, and
they're probably better off without me. Sometimes, I think the less
they know, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did find out four days ago that he is a grandfather. The
news that Jennifer recently gave birth to a daughter is, he
admitted, bittersweet. The experience is the latest twist from
which he must recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terribly humbling experience, and I wouldn't wish it
on anyone else,'' he said. ``But with whatever time I've got left _
and right now my health is awful _ I'm trying to make some things
right. I just want to go out with some dignity and character, and
maybe keep someone else from making these kind of mistakes. There's
no need anymore for me to be manipulative or anything. There's
nothing left for me to hide or hide from.''

 &HT;    Pressure's on Hull to deliver for Stars
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If this is the playoffs, they must be Stars no more.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has set a franchise record for points in the regular
season three years in a row and this year was the runaway winner of
the Presidents Trophy with a record of 51-19-12. After being
stopped just short of the finals by Detroit last year, the Stars _
in a move dictated by owner Thomas Hicks _ signed Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   But several personnel directors have questioned the Stars'
chemistry this season, and now we see why. Lost in the fact that
Dallas swept a severely undermanned Edmonton in the first round was
that all were narrow one-goal wins _ including a triple-overtime
game _ that could have gone either way.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas went into its second-round series against St. Louis with
an edge in goaltending, defense and depth up front. The Stars
played well in winning the opener but were outplayed in the next
three, taking Game 2 in overtime, but losing two in a row in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, expected to be the missing piece, has been just plain
missing. He was scoreless in the Edmonton series and, despite
scoring twice in the first three games against the Blues, was
demoted from the first line to the third by coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   If that move seemed a little radical by Hitchcock, he can be
excused. The Stars signed Hull thinking it would make them better
than Detroit and Colorado in the West. Hicks would not take well to
another early elimination.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Doug Jarvis would not bite the other day when
asked about possible ramifications of a series loss by the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even thinking about that,'' he said. ``Our thoughts
have to just be on our opponent and our next game. We can't afford
to think any farther ahead than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems occur when the owner is thinking ahead to the Stanley
Cup finals, and his team doesn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Money talks
</P>
<P>
   Although there's still a chance Mario Lemieux's reorganization
plan will be approved in time to save the Pittsburgh Penguins, a
possible bid by Paul Allen to buy the team changes everything.
Allen has made billions from Microsoft and represents the steady
ownership that commissioner Gary Bettman is seeking for league
franchises. The Penguins also would be moved to Portland, targeted
along with Houston by the NHL as viable for franchise relocations.
While maintaining that he still prefers that the Penguins remain in
Pittsburgh, Bettman now is opening the door to a possible move.
``In the last 10 or 14 years, these type of problems have been
epidemic of all sports leagues,'' he said. ``You've had four or
five (NFL) franchises relocated at the end of the season, be it
Cleveland, Baltimore, St. Louis or Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers update
</P>
<P>
   IceForum owner Jack Burton still thinks that the Thrashers'
practice facility in Duluth will be completed by mid-August, well
in time for training camp in September. But permit delays prevented
workers from pouring the concrete until a few days ago, and general
manager Don Waddell is concerned enough that he has held off
completing plans for camp. The Thrashers probably will open camp in
Orlando in September and spend at least one week there. After
returning from Europe last week and discovering that work had not
started, Waddell said, ``We need something to happen here soon, or
we may have to look at other alternatives.'' He then was reassured
by Burton that the project wasn't in danger. . . . Dr. Scott
Gillogly of Atlanta has been named the team's primary orthopedic
and team physician. Gillogly played football at West Point. . . .
When Colorado defenseman Adam Foote was asked who had the biggest
influence on his career, he said, ``The drive my parents had
definitely helped me. Also, Ted Nolan. I was fortunate enough to
have him as a coach for three years in junior. He really helped me
become a better character.'' Nolan might be a candidate for the
Thrashers' coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   They'll love this in Ottawa: Senators star Alexei Yashin,
playing for Russia, high-sticked his NHL teammate Daniel
Alfredsson, playing for Sweden, in a World Championships game in
Norway this past week. The result was a facial cut that required
nine stitches to close. Alfredsson later said he didn't realize it
was Yashin but added only, ``It happens.'' Yashin, meanwhile,
declined to answer questions. . . . Road teams won 30 of the first
55 playoff games (.545), the highest winning percentage since
expansion in 1967 and 16 percentage points higher than the record.
. . . Expect the NHL to officially approve the Bill Davidson
purchase of the Tampa Bay Lightning next week, clearing the way for
Davidson to decide what to do with coach/general manager Jacques
Demers. . . . Former Los Angeles coach Larry Robinson, who owns a
home in Florida, could join the Lightning as an assistant coach. .
. . Mark Recchi's new five-year, $25 million deal with Philadelphia
includes a no-trade clause. The significance is that he has been
traded three times since 1992. . . . . The Flyers probably won't
re-sign free-agent defenseman Steve Duchesne, acquired from L.A.
just before the deadline. . . . The NHL has declared Ottawa
defenseman Lance Pitlick an unrestricted free agent. The Senators,
who thought that Pitlick was restricted, now probably will lose
him. . . . It would be stunning if there's anything to rumors that
New Jersey will deal for Yashin, who is seeking an $8
million-a-year extension. Devils GM Lou Lamoriello is not known for
his shopping sprees and is more likely to let a player go for
salary reasons than to strain the payroll. Yashin would be making
double the next-highest-paid Devil, Scott Stevens ($4 million).

   ATLANTA _ NL EAST
</P>
<P>
   What it might accomplish is open to question, but Florida
manager John Boles is serious about his threatened widescale
demotions if six or seven Marlins do not improve. Without naming
names, first baseman Derrek Lee, left-hander Jesus Sanchez,
outfielders Preston Wilson and Todd Dunwoody and relievers Antonio
Alfonseca, Rafael Medina and Archie Corbin are the logical
suspects. Lee and Alfonseca, it should be noted, came to the team
from San Diego in the Kevin Brown trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't continue to spin your wheels at this level without
there being some repercussions,'' Boles said. The Fish opened the
weekend with a .273 winning percentage, which translates to a
118-loss season. It could mean good news for ex-Brave Danny
Bautista, who is hitting .316 at Class AAA Calgary. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter says there is no explaining his 1-4 start in New York.
His 5.55 ERA is more than three runs higher than during his 17-win
season a year ago, and he already has given up five homers in his
first seven starts. He served up eight in 1998. ``I'm trying to
figure out what the hell is different from last year.''

   A brutal week in Houston. Hitting coach Tom McCraw was diagnosed
with prostate cancer and left the team to begin treatment. First
base coach Jose Cruz took a leave of absense for treatment of an
irregular heartbeat. Rookie catcher Mitch Meluskey underwent
season-ending surgery to tighten up his right shoulder. And
reliever Doug Henry was placed on the DL with bone chips in his
right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Whether venting frustration or just plain venting, the Astros
proceeded to sweep three games in Pittsburgh by a combined 31-10

   To ease clubhouse anxiety, pitching coach Don Gullett found an
old crash test dummy and now stands it up at the plate when Mark
Wohlers works out. ``We call him Pitcher's Pal,'' Gullett said,
``but if he could talk, I'm sure he wouldn't think that's his name
right now.'' Wohlers has consulted with Los Angeles clinical
psychologist Richard Crowley, who worked with Steve Sax during his

<P>
   Whether San Diego's decision to claim reliever Randy Myers off
waivers last August was strictly an attempt to keep him out of
Atlanta's bullpen might never really be known. But what is sure is
that the move was one of the Padres' worst of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Pads still owe $12.5 million over the next two years of
Myers' contract, although the tear in his left rotator cuff could
mean he might not pitch again. Although this is just his first
stint on the DL, Myers turns 37 this season and will determine in
the next two weeks if he will have surgery. . . .

   Round III of the Padres-Greg Maddux rumble. After the Braves
left town last weekend, some Pads said they thought Maddux was
throwing a spitball, usually in a two-strike count. . . . Ex-Brave
Chris Brock was mostly gracious after beating Atlanta at 3Com Park
last week. The San Francisco right-hander said he knew there was no
place for him in the Braves rotation, but then added, ``They're
going to have their top four or five starters. If you're No. 5 and
don't do it after a couple of chances, you're out of there.''

SLOVAKIA CHOOSING PRESIDENT BY DIRECT ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ For the first time since Slovakia was
created in 1993 from the peaceful split of the old Czechoslovakia,
its voters Saturday chose their president by direct election.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote was new, the two leading candidates were not. The
front-runner, Rudolf Schuster, 65, is the official candidate of the
four-party coalition government, a political veteran who was once
the Communist leader of Parliament, served after the anti-Communist
revolution of 1989 as Czechoslovakia's ambassador to Canada, and is
now the widely respected mayor of the eastern Slovak town of
Kosice.
</P>
<P>
   His prime challenger is Vladimir Meciar, 57, who served as prime
minister for all but nine months from 1992 until losing
parliamentary elections last year, and who is widely blamed for
stalling Slovakia's efforts to join NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicated that Schuster had what should be a comfortable
lead of 8 percent over Meciar, whose victory would probably cast a
pall over the coalition government's so far successful efforts to
bring Slovakia back into the club of Central Europe's
post-Communist success stories _ the Czech Republic, Poland and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven other candidates, the most prominent of whom is
Magda Vasaryova, a popular former actress and successful
Czechoslovak ambassador to neighboring Austria. The former Slovak
president, Michal Kovac, whose term ended in March 1998, gave up
his candidacy on May 11 and asked his supporters to vote for
Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Saturday's election is a bellwether for Slovakia and
the efforts of its new prime minister, Mikulas Dzurinda, to restore
the reputation tarnished by Meciar. Slovakia has been without a
president since Kovac's first five-year term expired in March 1998,
and grave disagreements prevented either direct election for a
successor, or a choice made by parliament.
</P>
<P>
   After Meciar lost power, the new government was able to amend
the Constitution and hold Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
   If none of the candidates gains over 50 percent of the vote _
which local observers believe is unlikely, the top two finishers in
Saturday's vote will go forward to a second round to be held on May
29.

CHINA SELECTS LOCAL BANKER AFTER PORTUGAL CEDES 
</HEADLINE>
 (dw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ For 442 years, Portuguese officials have ruled this spit
of land on the southeast coast of China. Saturday, Macau got its
first Chinese leader. A committee appointed by Beijing chose a
local banker, Edmund Ho, to administer the colony after it reverts
to Chinese rule in December.
</P>
<P>
   Ho's ascension had been widely anticipated here. He is the de
facto leader of Macau's Chinese business community and has close,
longstanding ties to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   There was a palpable lack of suspense as the 199 committee
members _ a lone Portuguese among them _ filed to the front of a
wood-paneled auditorium and deposited their ballots in a box. After
30 minutes of counting, Ho was declared the winner with 82 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The meticulously choreographed ceremony recalled one in Hong
Kong more than two years ago in which a shipping magnate, Tung
Chee-hwa, was selected as the chief executive of the former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Hong Kong, where demonstrators burned tires to
protest Tung's selection, people here had few reservations. Most
regard Ho, the 44-year-old scion of a prominent Chinese family and
a longtime member of the legislature, as the obvious choice for
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no real alternatives,'' said Ricardo Pinto, the
editor of Ponto Final, a Portuguese-language newspaper here. ``If
you look around the local political scene, there is no one with the
same stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Macau is in a deep recession, which has been aggravated by a
violent gang war for control of its lucrative gambling trade. Many
people here believe the departing Portuguese have given up trying
to control the violence, and most are more relieved than alarmed
about returning to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully understand that the people of Macau are concerned
about law and order,'' Ho said at a news conference after his
selection. But he said it was too early to offer details on how he
would tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ho pledged to defend ``one country, two systems'' _ the
arrangement under which Macau, like Hong Kong, is supposed to
function as a semiautonomous region in China with its own legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the support of our motherland, the people of Macau shall
enjoy a high degree of autonomy and become self-governing,'' said
Ho, who switched seamlessly between Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ho's skills, people worry that Macau will be swamped by
China. Its civil service is not as well developed as that of Hong
Kong. Chinese officials have expressed anger at Macau's crime rate.
China has sent troops to the colony, ignoring the objections of
Portuguese officials, who said their agreement with China does not
provide for a military garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing down from a dais during the ballot counting were two
aging men who will arguably wield more power over Macau than Ho:
Qian Qichen, the deputy prime minister of China who is overseeing
the handover, and Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong tycoon who owns the
colony's nine casinos. (He is not related to the chief executive).
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of troops, Edmund Ho served notice that he did not
plan to provoke officials in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the stationing of troops is in total accordance with
the sovereignty of the Chinese government,'' Ho said. ``My position
is in 100 percent agreement with the central government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ng Kuok Cheong, one of Macau's few pro-democracy politicians,
said Ho's response was typical of his outlook. Ng, who said he had
lost two jobs because of his political views, predicted that under
Ho, debate about China would be even more sharply curtailed than it
is now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his allegiance to Beijing, Ho is also popular with the
Portuguese, who regard him as tactful and reliable. Macau's
governor, Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira, warmly welcomed his selection.
</P>
<P>
   While Ho is respected, his father, Ho Yin, is venerated. The
elder Ho, who died in 1983, dominated Macau society for decades,
playing middleman between the Chinese and Portuguese. When
anti-colonialist protests exploded during the Cultural Revolution
in the 1960s, Ho calmed both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, Edmund has been living under the shadow and
patronage of his father,'' said Fok Kai Cheong, a professor at the
University of Macau. ``It's time for him to prove himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fok said it was in China's interest to insure that Ho succeeds.
Macau's handover is the second act in what Chinese officials hope
will be a three-act drama, culminating with the return of Taiwan.
``This is considered another step in the ultimate reunification of
China,'' he said.

   Very pleasant weather is expected from the northern Middle
Atlantic region to the eastern Great Lakes and all of New England
on Sunday as high pressure dominates. The center of the fair
weather system will drift off the Maine coast. This will allow a
clockwise circulation from the east to transport ocean-cooled air
into coastal communities from Cape Cod to the Carolinas. Farther
inland, breezes from the south will direct rather warm air
northward.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and some rain will continue to dampen southern Virginia
and eastern North Carolina. Winds will gust to gale force at the
beaches and tides will average several feet above normal with
flooding of low-lying areas expected. Lighter winds from the north
should bring less humid air into the Southeast, but some clouds
will persist along the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico will produce
varying amounts of clouds in the Mississippi Valley and Plains. A
few thunderstorms may erupt in east Texas and southwest Arkansas.
Clusters of thunderstorms are likely in the Middle West. Jet stream
winds should guide residual moisture into the western Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A chill rain will fall in parts of the Dakotas adding to a
record wet May. The leading edge of cool air from the North Pacific
will reach the western Plains. Isolated strong storms will form in
eastern Colorado and the Texas panhandle. Colder, moist air over
the northern and central Rockies will promote rain and snow showers
Sunday afternoon. The Northwest will stay very cool while the
Southwest is seasonable and becomes windy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow King &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine 6 inches of snow falling everyday from November 1 until
May 13. Then you can conceive the magnitude of snow that fell on
Mt. Baker in northern Washington state this season. Of course, the
snow never fell with such regularity, but the accumulation totaled
the same, a remarkable 1,124 inches. The sky was stingy to release
the final 2 inches this past Wednesday, unofficially making this
peak, the snowiest place on earth with weather observations. The
record, surpassing Mt. Rainier's 1971-72 seasonal tally of 1,122
inches, will have to be validated by the National Climate Extremes
Committee.

WHITE HOUSE BRACES FOR LOSS OF BONDS WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CHINA-ZHU, U.S.-CHINA-SCIENTISTS) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, which once hoped that
stronger bonds between China and the United States would be a
centerpiece of its foreign policy legacy, is now bracing for a deep
deterioration in relations that may not improve before President
Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   From the Chinese point of view, NATO's mistaken bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade summed up almost everything that China
finds offensive about the United States: the raw exercise of
hegemonic power by Washington and its allies, ganging up on China
and its interests.
</P>
<P>
   In American eyes, China's outrage, expressed in diplomatic
demarches and in the undiplomatic marches of enraged citizens at
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, has seemed overblown, even irrational.
</P>
<P>
   As important as this heightened mutual mistrust is, a larger
casualty of the bombing could well be the administration's idea of
a ``strategic partnership' with China, the notion that the two
countries have shared interests in the Asia region, a number of
former Clinton administration officials and China experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The putative partnership, which already had been called into
question by administration critics in the last six months, may
indeed be turning abruptly into a regional rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Just one week after the bombing, the administration is cautious
in describing its long-term fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too early to tell,'' is the phrase most used by the White
House about the potential effects of the bombing on specific
administration interests, like China's membership in the World
Trade Organization. On Friday, Clinton discussed this and other
matters with President Jiang Zemin in a telephone call, their first
conversation since the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But a White House official said that the clout of Jiang and
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji _ the two leaders with whom Clinton had
closest contact _ could be undermined by the internal power
struggles that some people detect in Chinese politics since the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   These struggles pit more modernizing leaders like Jiang and Zhu
against more conservative ideologues. Because Clinton has
personalized his dealings with the two leaders, their difficulties
would present a major stumbling block to improving the chilled
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy strike came at a time of mounting quarrels between
Washington and Beijing over alleged espionage by China in the last
20 years involving nuclear secrets at American laboratories; over
the administration's enthusiasm for a theater missile defense
system that could involve Taiwan, and over human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several weeks, the congressional committee headed by
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., that investigated illicit
technology transfers to China is expected to release its
long-awaited report, an event likely to worsen the strained ties
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like us, the Chinese are beginning to ask whether the
strategic partnership is workable,'' said Robert Suettinger, until
recently the CIA's senior analyst for Asia and now a visiting
fellow at the Brookings Institution. Though never clearly defined
by the administration, Suettinger said, the basic premise of the
partnership was that China would have a ``good relationship with
the United States, build an economy and have peace in the region
and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the United States and China move toward an ``adversarial
relationship'' now hangs in the balance, Suettinger said.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the China-U.S. relationship was proving to be
like ``a bad marriage, which at the core is pretty hollow,'' said
David Shambaugh, a former member of the National Security Council
and now a China expert at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no strategic glue holding it together,'' he said.
``There is no common agreement in Asia, and I see it as a
relationship of strategic competition in Asia and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the disagreements in Asia are quarrels over Washington's
strengthening of defense ties with Japan and the administration's
recent decision to approve the sale of an early-warning radar
system to Taiwan, the island that China considers part of its
territory. The Chinese government warned last month that the actual
deployment of the radar system _ designed to detect a missile
launch by China _ would have a ``serious negative impact'' on
relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The theater missile defense system was originally intended to
protect Japan and South Korea against the threat of missiles from
North Korea. If extended to Taiwan, as some in the administration
favor, it would be designed to protect Taiwan against missiles from
China.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of theater missile defense for Taiwan has been
described by the Chinese as another example of the United States
playing the hegemonic power that wants to contain China.
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence agencies, for their part, have been
warning about Chinese efforts to deploy new and better nuclear
missiles, perhaps with stolen American technology.
</P>

<P>
   That the NATO bombing of the embassy occurred in 1999 is viewed
by some Chinese as symbolic. At the end of every decade since the
Communists took power in China in 1949, major events have occurred
that have dictated Beijing's relationship to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   To name the most recent, the United States and China normalized
relations in 1979 during the Carter presidency, and in 1989 the
West turned away from China because of the killing of civilians by
the army in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, China may turn away from the United States, China
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with Chinese officials since the Belgrade bombing, a
former American diplomat to China, Chas. W. Freeman Jr., who has
been a voice for strengthening ties, said he saw a grim outlook.
Unless there is ``miraculously deft handling'' by the two sides,
any movement on issues of importance to Washington will grind to a
standstill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Chinese government is paralyzed and can't make any
gestures,'' Freeman said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong.
``That kills human rights, nonproliferation and the World Trade
Organization. It hampers cooperation on issues like North Korea.''
Washington has tried to persuade Beijing to get North Korea to curb
the spread of nuclear technology on the Korean peninsula and to
persuade Pyongyang to seek a peaceful accommodation with Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   China's most immediate ire may be apparent at the United
Nations, an arena that Beijing sees as its most important
international platform and that it believes Washington has ignored
in favor of other instruments, like NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of the embassy bombing,
administration officials suggested that China would not block
efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis at the United Nations. As
anger mounted in Beijing, that confidence ebbed, and administration
officials now say it is quite likely that China may at least
frustrate or delay U.N. efforts to end the Balkan war as a way of
showing its rage and getting Washington to pay a price for its
actions against Yugoslavia.

PENTAGON BLOCKS HELICOPTERS FROM COMBAT IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON with ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ In a behind-the-scenes struggle over military
strategy and tactics, the Pentagon is blocking a plan by the NATO
commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, to send Apache helicopters into
combat against Serbian troops, Pentagon and NATO officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to boost allied firepower, Clark has pressed the United
States to authorize the final combat preparations for the
helicopters, which are part of a U.S. Army ground force in Albania.
Although 24 of them, along with their accompanying Army rockets and
artillery, have already been deployed, the Pentagon has balked,
fearing the mission is too risky.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute adds a new strain to the alliance's seven-week-old
air campaign. NATO's generals have often found themselves hemmed in
by political constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance this time, though, is not coming from allied
diplomats. It is coming from the Army leadership at the Pentagon,
Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that Clark is being aggressive, and there is some
resistance to doing what he wants to do,'' a senior American
official said. The Apache is the Army's premier tank-killing
weapon. It can fly low, at night, in bad weather and is equipped
with a sophisticated infrared system that generates images from the
heat of its targets.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter is armed with laser-guided Hellfire anti-tank
missiles and 30-millimeter guns.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clark first requested them 48 hours after NATO's
airstrikes began on March 24, the Apaches have been a particularly
sensitive matter for the Clinton administration, which has been
reluctant to use combat troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It took weeks for Washington to agree to Clark's request to
deploy the Apaches. Then it took weeks more to lug the men and
supplies for the helicopters and the Army units that accompanied
them to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Washington only agreed to send the Apaches and rockets
on the condition that they not be used in combat without the formal
approval of President Clinton. That approval, which Apache
commanders expected by early May, has yet to take place, largely
because top Pentagon officials have refused to recommend such a
step to the White House, fearing the possible domestic and
international consequences if the missions fail.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the Apaches allowed to conduct ``live fire'' exercises
without the Clinton administration's consent. Such exercises, in
which the helicopters fire their guns and missiles, are an
essential prerequisite for employing them in combat.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have pledged to give Clark whatever weaponry
he says he needs to wage the air war. Pentagon officials still
recall Defense Secretary Les Aspin's fateful decision in 1993 to
turn down the military's request for tanks and AC-130 gunships in
Somalia, a judgment that cost Aspin his job after 18 Army soldiers
were killed .
</P>
<P>
   But Clark wants to conduct the ``live fire'' test by shooting at
targets in Kosovo, and he still has not received permission to do
so. Two of the helicopters have already crashed during training
missions, killing two pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no concept of using the Apaches just as a feint,'' a
NATO official said. ``Clark would not have asked for them if he did
not have every intention to use them. The Serbs are using
helicopters against civilians in Kosovo. Why can't we use
helicopters against the Serbs?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clark flew to Albania Saturday to meet with the Task Force
commanders and review their tactics and preparations. He declined
to be interviewed regarding the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton indicated this week that the Pentagon was concerned
about the risks and complexity the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relatively complicated operation, very similar to
running any other type of air operation, same types of resources
required in terms of electronic warfare, support aircraft, the
suppression fire that has to be in place.'' he told the Senate
Appropriations Committee. ``And all this has to be rehearsed, and
then you weigh the risk versus the gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24 Apaches are part of Task Force Hawk, a 5,000 Army soldier
unit in Albania, which also includes surface-to-surface ATACMS
rockets, MLRS artillery, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and M1-A1 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is under the overall command of Lt. Gen. John
Walker Hendrix, who also serves as commander of the U.S. Army's V
Corps in Germany. It is very unusual for such a high-ranking
officer to head up such a small task force, and his appointment
reflects the United States' anxiety over the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache squadron is commanded by Brig. Gen. Richard A. Cody,
one of the Army's most respected helicopter officers. One of Cody's
most notable exploits took place in 1991, when he led Task Force
Normandy, the Apache helicopter unit that fired the opening shorts
of the Persian Gulf war. The Apaches blasted two clusters of Iraqi
early-warning radars, firing Hellfire missiles and 30-millimeter
guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the mission in Kosovo is far more complex and dangerous.
Serbian troops are armed with SA-7 shoulder-fired missiles,
anti-aircraft artillery and SAM surface-to-air missiles, which pose
a major threat to the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough mission that they're being asked to
perform,'' Cohen told reporters on Wednesday. ``It's very harsh
terrain under very difficult circumstances. These Apaches and their
training requires great skill and a full training measure before
they are actually employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Task Force Hawk has been developing the tactics to take
on the Yugoslav military. First, the task force would blast a path
through the Serbian air defenses, using ATACMS rockets, which have
a range of about 100 miles and rain down as many as 950 deadly
bomblets per rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Barrages of MLRS rockets, which have a range of 18 miles, would
also be fired. Each rocket carries nearly 700 armor-piercing
fragmentation bomblets.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Apaches would attack, hugging the earth and popping up
to attack Serbian troops and armored vehicles. To provide
themselves an additional measure of protection, they would attack
at night.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Clark briefed allied ambassadors on the air campaign at a
closed-door meeting Tuesday evening, several diplomats asked why
the Apaches they had heard so much about were not fighting in
Kosovo, according to two diplomats were were present. None
expressed concern about using the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clark replied that the helicopters needed to conduct ``live
fire'' exercises. The NATO commander did not say that it was the
Pentagon that was holding up those exercises.
</P>
<P>
   A major Pentagon concern is that the mission is too risky. As
long as the weather is good, NATO should rely on attacks from
combat planes that bomb from high altitude, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army's concern is that this is a very dangerous mission,''
a Pentagon official said. ``The avenues into Kosovo are limited,
and the opportunity for shoulder-held weapons is very real. We have
to really have all our act together. No one thinks the mission
can't be done, but in an age when the American people believe we're
in a zero-defects war, there's real apprehension we're going to
bring solders back in body bags.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that if attacks deep into Kosovo are too
dangerous, the Apaches could still be used to attack Serb forces
during one of their regular incursions into Albania. Or the Apaches
could fire at Serb troops just across the border while hovering
over Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pentagon objection pertains to barrages of rockets and
artillery that would precede the Apache attacks. While the rockets
would be aimed at air defenses, there are no NATO ground troops in
Kosovo to direct the fire, raising the prospect of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said, though, that the risk might be minimized by
using unmanned reconnaissance drones.
</P>
<P>
   A final Pentagon argument is that launching Apache and
surface-to-surface rocket attacks against Serb forces might prompt
the Yugoslav military to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you begin attacks with Apaches out of Albania with
artillery fire, you're escalating the conflict and inviting the VJ
to come across the border,'' said a Pentagon official, using the
acronym for the Yugoslav military. ``They're not just going to take
that kind of beating and sit still. That's at the top of the issue
list here and at the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that Serb troops are already attacking across
the border and that the risk of a major division level attack is
overstated. They assert that real concern of U.S. Army officers at
the Pentagon is to avoid being drawn into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are already attacking into Albania,'' a NATO
official said. ``We are passed that point. It does appear that the
Air Force is prepared to accept more risk than the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear if the Apaches will ever be used, NATO is
already using the helicopter threat as part of its psychological
operations against the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaflets dropped in Kosovo warn Serb troops that the
alliance will relentlessly attack them from every direction if they
stay in Kosovo. Showing a fearsome picture of an Apache swooping
down on a tank, the leaflets warn: ``Don't Wait For Me.''

NATO ADMITS VILLAGE STRIKE AND CASUALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO said Saturday that it had carried out
an attack on a military command post in southern Kosovo and
acknowledged that civlians were accidentally killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government said that more than 80 civilians were
killed in the Thursday night raid, which took place in the village
of Korisa. President Slobodan Milosevic used the incident to appeal
for an end to the allied air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers could not be verified, but if they are accurate,
the strike on Korisa would be one of the war's worst examples of
the accidental killing of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said that four U.S. F-16's were involved in the
attack, which focused on a military compound that contained
military vehicles and dug-in artillery pieces, about 1,000 yards
from the village.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it had not been aware that ethnic Albanian refugees
were in the area, and allied officials suggested that Serbian
forces might have invited them into the area to use them as ``human
shields'' against allied air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a report from KLA that says the refugees were brought
into the area where the targets were,'' a senior NATO official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials also said that Serbian soldiers and police
officers might have been among those killed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NATO attack raised the question of whether allied
targeting procedures are adequate to deal with a confusing
battlefield in which bands of refugees are often interspersed with
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless and hungry Albanians have been roaming the devastated
province. There have also been reports that Serb forces have placed
civilians on _ and in one case under _ a bridge to discourage NATO
strikes. The Yugoslav military has also parked its equipment near
villages, churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials said that they could not say definitely how the
refugees came to the target area near Korisa, but that NATO's goal
is to avoid attacks on civilians. In the case of Korisa, NATO's
targeting and intelligence procedures fell short.
</P>
<P>
   NATO official said they had received human and electronic
intelligence in recent weeks that Albanians had been forced out of
the Korisa area and that it was being used by the Serbian military.
It was also in a region of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the attack occurred _ just before midnight on
Thursday _ the refugees were back in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' night targeting system detected dug-in military
equipment, the silhouettes of armored vehicles and earthen walls,
another military preparation, but not the civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The forward air controller in the lead F-16's dropped a GBU-12
500-pound laser-guided bomb. A second pair of F-16's dropped
another GBU-12 and 6 M-82 gravity bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO identified Korisa as a military camp and command post,''
an alliance statement said. ``NATO deeply regrets accidental
civilian casualties that were caused by this attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its mistaken attack last month on a group of refugees near
Djakovica, NATO's spokesmen have made an effort to rapidly and
accurately explain mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was quick to acknowledge Saturday that it had struck
civilians. But the account its spokesmen provided was sketchy and
partly inaccurate, including erroneous information about the number
of aircraft involved and how many bombs were dropped. The Pentagon
provided a more accurate and detailed account Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO has stepped up its air strikes to pressure Milosevic to
withdraw his troops from Kosovo and meet other allied demands.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the brunt of the effort has been against
Serbian forces in Kosovo. There have been no strikes against
targets in central Belgrade since a U.S. B-2 bomber attacked the
Chinese Embassy on May 7, in a mistaken sortie guided by faulty
maps.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say they have not put new limits on strikes in
Belgrade. They say military commanders are being careful to
double-check targets in the Yugoslav capital and are concentrating
on the Serbian forces in Kosovo because of good weather.
</P>
<P>
   With 40,000 Serbian soldiers and police officers in Kosovo, the
air campaign appears to be a grinding battle of attrition. And with
Serbian units stationed near houses and churches, NATO's attacks
also carry the risk of more civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insists that it takes extensive precautions to limit
civilian casualties for moral reasons and because they have become
a major tool for Belgrade in its public relations offensive against
the alliance's military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, allied warplanes accidentally bombed a group of refugees
who were interspersed in a Serbian military column near Djakovica.
They accidentally dropped a load of cluster bombs on a marketplace
and clinic in Nis on the same day the Chinese Embassy was hit.
</P>
<P>
   It has been very difficult to determine the real extent of
civilian casualties. When NATO accidentally bombed civilian
vehicles near Djakovica, the Belgrade authorities said 75 people
had been killed. Foreign journalists who were brought to the scene
saw far fewer bodies.
</P>
<P>
   More incidents are virtually inevitable. ``This is war,'' said
Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, the operations for the Joint Chief of Staff
declared at the Pentagon briefing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO nations, however, insist they are not waging a war against
Yugoslavia but merely conducting a military campaign to pressure
the Milosevic regime to accept a settlement. Wald quickly realized
his slip of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's combat, as I said,'' he immediately corrected himself.

CHINESE IN U.S. SAY SPYING CASE CASTS DOUBT ON THEIR LOYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD and JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Chinese scientists and engineers in the United States fear
they are being tarnished and their careers threatened by
accusations that another scientist, Wen Ho Lee, stole the design of
America's most advanced nuclear warhead and gave it to China.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Lee, a computer scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, may prove to be true. But Chinese
intellectuals in the United States point out that Lee has not been
arrested despite a three-year investigation by the FBI, and many
are troubled by what they call the circumstantial nature of the
accusations, especially the suggestion that Lee had the opportunity
to divulge classified information because he traveled to scientific
conferences in China.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Chinese scientists and engineers in an awkward
position, because many of them, like Lee, hold significant jobs in
government, corporate or university laboratories, have relatives
and friends in China, and travel there regularly to maintain
contacts and participate in academic conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, little of this would have provoked suspicion.
But news reports of Chinese spying and attempts to buy political
influence have changed the political climate, and NATO's bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and subsequent
protests in Beijing have also charged the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this climate, many Chinese feel they are being watched all
the time, as if they are not full citizens,'' said Chang-Lin Tien,
the former chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   They have not forgotten the case of Qian Xueshen, a brilliant
immigrant scientist who was accused without proof during the
McCarthy era of being a Communist and held under house arrest for
five years, said Tien, the first Chinese-American to head a major
research university, and now a professor of mechanical engineering
at Berkeley. Qian, who had helped develop the American rocket
program, was finally deported to China. There, he led Beijing's
missile program and became an icon in the country's quest to build
a modern military.
</P>
<P>
   The changed climate, Tien said, ``makes many people think twice
about working for the Department of Defense, the Department of
Energy or national labs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tolerate spies,'' he said. ``But we need to be
sensitive and careful. Mistakenly blaming the whole community for
one person's action cannot be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Xenophobia was the topic this month at a meeting of prominent
Chinese-Americans and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, whose
department supervises America's nuclear research laboratories. The
meeting, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, drew a mixed
crowd of Asian-Americans, including natives of the Chinese
mainland, people who were born in Taiwan and Hong Kong and even
Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ng, a Chinese-American engineer at the Sandia National
Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., told Richardson that Americans
who trace their roots to any part of Asia, from India to Japan,
were under suspicion in their work places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the incident at Los Alamos,'' Ng said, ``promotions
are being held back, we are concerned about discrimination in
hiring, and a cloud of suspicion appears to hang over all
Asian-Pacific Americans as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson told the group that he would not allow racial
discrimination at the nuclear laboratories, but he acknowledged an
atmosphere of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Asian-Pacific Americans are concerned that
their loyalty and patriotism are being challenged,'' he said,
adding, ``I want to assure you that racial profiling will not be
permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the suspicions of spying and political
influence-buying by Chinese ``are a hangover from history,'' said
Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is writing a
book on the Asian experience in America. The Chinese Exclusion Act
of 1882, barring Chinese immigration, was the only law in American
history that singled out a nationality, Karnow said. ``We've always
had this lingering suspicion of sinister Chinese skulking about.''
</P>
<P>
   But the charges of espionage at Los Alamos also raise
uncomfortable questions about divided loyalty for some Chinese in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, when I bring it up in class, I can see my Chinese
students squirm, especially those from the mainland,'' said Merle
Goldman, a professor of history at Boston University and an expert
on Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyalty is a big dilemma for Chinese intellectuals,'' Goldman
said. ``They want to do everything to help their country regain its
greatness, and part of that involves making China a great economic
and military power.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts caution that the overwhelming majority of the 2.5
million Chinese in the United States are patriotic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One always has divided loyalties in a way, because you want
your native country to thrive, but I don't sense that I have
divided loyalties at all, because my loyalties are for the people,
the language and the art, things that don't come in conflict with
my new home in America,'' said Betty Bao Lord, the author of the
best seller ``Spring Moon,'' and wife of the former ambassador to
China, Winston Lord.
</P>
<P>
   This division of loyalties fits a traditional distinction made
by Chinese scholars in past centuries, a difference between loyalty
to China, a kind of cultural loyalty, and loyalty to the dynasty,
or political loyalty, said Weiming Tu, a professor of Chinese
history and philosophy at Harvard University and director of the
Harvard-Yenching Institute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The complex emotions of many Chinese-Americans were on display
at a banquet in Los Angeles for China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji,
during his recent visit to the United States. Many of the 1,500
Chinese-Americans there wore Chinese outfits like silk gowns or the
slit dress known as a qipao. Most speeches were in Mandarin, with
little translation. Musicians played the Chinese national anthem.
The two masters of ceremonies referred to Zhu as ``our premier.''
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions of support for China do not strike
Chinese-Americans as disloyal. Many at the banquet complained about
the accusations of spying against Lee, saying that news reports
tended to tar Chinese scientists in sensitive positions with the
same brush.
</P>
<P>
   Collin Lai, a retired aerospace engineer who was among the
guests, said he was furious about news reports on the Lee case. In
some aerospace companies, ``the unofficial language is Mandarin,''
Lai said, adding, ``What are you going to do, throw us all out?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many university physics departments are dependent on
graduate students from China. Overall, students from mainland China
account for 21 percent of foreign graduate students in physics
departments, and this year foreign students make up half of all
physics graduate students, said Roman Czujko of the American
Institute of Physics.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist from mainland China who works for Xerox Corp. in
Syracuse, N.Y., said that the espionage charges had made him and
his wife rethink their view of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here 10 years ago,'' he said, ``we thought about
staying here forever. After this incident, you really think that
maybe this is not your homeland. If people don't like you here, why
stay?''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist said he was particularly outraged at the way some
news reports described the Los Alamos accusations as ``Chinese
espionage,'' lumping together the Communist government in Beijing
and all Chinese everywhere, whatever their background, with little
hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the computer expert at Los Alamos, was born on Taiwan,
where most residents are opposed to the Communist government of
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate the situation, China does spy on the
United States, just as the United States spies on China, and some
spies for China have been caught and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Peter Lee, a naturalized citizen from Taiwan who worked
at Los Alamos, pleaded guilty to telling classified nuclear weapons
information to Chinese scientists during a conference in Beijing, a
set of facts much like the current accusations against Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   And China painstakingly trains spies for missions in the United
States, according to a book to be published this year by Larry
Engelman and his wife, Meihong Xu, a former lieutenant in
intelligence in the Chinese army. In the book, ``Daughter of China:
A True Story of Love and Betrayal'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons), Ms. Xu
describes how she and other attractive young women were selected to
be sent abroad, adopt new identities, get jobs, marry and then,
years later, surface as spies for China.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that contributes to misunderstanding, Chinese
say, is the inability of the American public, politicians and the
news media to distinguish among different groups of Chinese in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The first immigrants from China were poor peasants who came in
the 1850s to work in the gold mines or build the transcontinental
railroads. Better-educated Chinese came as students in the 1930s,
or as refugees from the Communists in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Johnson changed the immigration law in 1965, the
total number of Chinese in the United States remained small, about
a quarter of a million, according to the Census Bureau. But since
then there has been an explosion of immigration _ graduate students
from Taiwan, intellectuals from the mainland and working-class
people from southern China, near Hong Kong _ so that the total is
now about 2.5 million, the Population Reference Bureau says.
</P>
<P>
   Tien and others are concerned that Washington and the news media
have been too quick to conclude that all of these people are
subject to pressure from the Communist government in Beijing, just
because they are ethnically Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   In both the campaign finance scandal, involving John Huang and
Johnny Chung, and the Wen Ho Lee spy case, Tien said, Americans
have made the assumption that these individual Chinese were part of
a plot orchestrated by top authorities in Beijing, despite a lack
of hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Tien also sees some progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the United States as a poor, penniless student, and
I made it to become chancellor of the University of California at
Berkeley,'' he said. ``There has been tremendous improvement in
civil rights in America. So we should be careful not to draw too
sweeping a conclusion from those incidents.''

A GENERATION OF GERMAN PACIFISTS AT ODDS OVER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIELEFELD, Germany _ Like many Germans of the generation born at
the end of World War II, Heidi Bauer has spent much of her life
opposing war, driven by an intimate sense of its horror and its
indelible scars.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1944, Ms. Bauer, a schoolteacher, campaigned in the
Peace Movement in the 1970s to protest the Vietnam War, fought
against the deployment in Germany of U.S. Pershing II missiles
during the 1980s, joined the Green Party in 1984 to express her
pacifism, and rejoiced in 1989 at the Cold War's quiet end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had won at last,'' she said. ``We had contributed
to the end of the Cold War without a big bang. I believed there was
no more need for NATO because there was no more mission. To me, a
lot of what is happening in Kosovo is about trying to prove that
NATO is still relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bauer was one of many party members in an indignant mood
during a Green Party congress here last week. In government office
for the first time since the party was founded two decades ago, the
pacifist Greens have quickly found themselves backing a war. In so
doing, for some, they have betrayed the long struggle of a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   That generation is the one in power today, born at war's end or
just afterward, driven to ask their parents, if they were alive,
what they did under Hitler between 1933 and 1945, suffocated and
pushed to protest by the rigid conformity of postwar Germany,
living for most of their lives at the explosive fulcrum of the
East-West conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the Green foreign minister, is another member
of that generation. He was born four years after Ms. Bauer, and his
career followed a similar arc of interrogation and protest. For
many years, his answers were similar, based on anti-war agitation,
pacifism and the defense of human rights through international law.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1994, three years into the Bosnian war, Fischer was
still entrenched in such positions. The idea of sending German
forces to combat was still abhorrent to him. ``To send German
soldiers to the Balkans, where the forces of Hitler went crazy in
World War II, would not appease the conflict but worsen it,'' he
said that year.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, the Serbian massacre of Bosnian Muslims at
Srebrenica completed Fischer's conversion to the idea, now
passionately held, that pacifism was no answer to crimes of
religious, ethnic and racial killing on European soil. Those
crimes, Fischer decided, had ultimately to be met with force.
</P>
<P>
   He became an advocate of what Ulrich Beck, a German
intellectual, has called ``NATO's new military humanism'' _ the
notion, defended by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, that the
defense of human rights is a form of mission.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Fischer and Ms. Bauer, a composed and thoughtful
woman from the Hesse region, found themselves on opposing sides
during the Greens' tumultuous congress. The split clearly ran right
through the party, and may in the long term cause many defections
by members who feel betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing can never be a means to impose human rights,'' Ms.
Bauer said. ``It is a clear violation of international law, and
over seven weeks it has only made matters worse. I am nervous,
nervous for my children. I have a sense we may be embarking on
World War III. How long can Russia tolerate being ignored?''
</P>
<P>
   But Fischer defended bombing as the only answer to what he
called the evil of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. His
arguments were similar to those of Rudolf Scharping, the Social
Democratic defense minister, who has said that to turn away from
combating the brutal ethnic purges in Kosovo would suggest that
Germany has not learned from its own history.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the differences in the Green Party lie two views of NATO.
The first, that of the German government and the Green ministers in
it, portrays the alliance spreading the human rights and rule of
law on which Europe must now base its identity.
</P>
<P>
   The second, that of Ms. Bauer and many other Green Party
members, sees NATO arrogantly attempting to extend the domain of
free markets and capitalism under the mask of a universal mission
to defend human rights. They are deeply suspicious of the way
military humanism, in Beck's words, ``fills a vacuum by giving
enemy-free institutions a cosmopolitan mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on these issues is particularly intense at the heart
of the Green Party, but it is also a reflection of tensions
throughout Germany as the Kosovo war changes the country's
self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Active in the bombing campaign and leading the diplomatic quest
for peace, Germany is behaving, perhaps for the first time since
World War II, as if it need have no qualms about flexing its
political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer has said repeatedly that the country should take pride
in the fact that, in the Kosovo war, ``Germany is on the right side
for the first time this century.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gina Mertens, a doctor and Greens supporter, said she saw
these changes as perilous. ``For Germany to start believing you can
bomb your way to peace is wrong,'' she said. ``I strongly believe
the Greens must be a force for pacifism.''
</P>
<P>
   She said many members of the Green Party would leave it for the
former East German Communists, now known as the Party of Democratic
Socialism, which has resolutely opposed to the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bauer said: ``The Green Party has no right to survive
because it is not the party of pacifism anymore. If we were in
opposition today, we would be strongly against the war, but
unfortunately we won the election.''
</P>
<P>
   But a small majority of Greens backs Fischer and believes that
two surprises _ first power, then war _ have made a new outlook
inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is bitter, the truth is sad,'' said Daniel
Cohn-Bendit, a 1968 student leader and a leading Green. ``But the
truth is we are right to choose force in the Balkans.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: YELTSIN HAS ESCAPED THE FRYING PAN, BUT NOT THE
FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-IMPEACH) 
(rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With impeachment now off the political agenda,
President Boris Yeltsin wins, and his Communist opposition loses.
An old balance of power rocks back into place, and Russia's latest
political crisis begins to recede.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   Even if as some predict the parliament goes on to approve
Yeltsin's latest nominee for prime minister, the struggle over
Russia's future was reopened with new vengeance this week with his
firing of the old prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. And it promises
to continue unchecked through the coming election year.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of this could be seen in the speeches on the floor of the
parliament Saturday morning, as leaders of Russia's major parties
ripped through the country's recent and distant past, throwing
around charges and countercharges of murder, treason, incompetence
and a criminal squandering of national resources.
</P>
<P>
   Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, called Yeltsin ``an
absolute evil.'' Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who
Saturday backed the president, reminded the Communists that it was
their party that had sacrificed tens of millions of lives during
more than seven decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   But the most eloquent comments came from liberals and moderates
who called on all sides in Russia's deadly political feuds _ above
all Yeltsin _ to accept blame and responsibility for the sorry
state of the country today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the fact that we are sure that impeachment is untenable
constitute a justification of Yeltsin and his rule?'' asked
Vladimir Ryzhkov, a leader of Our Home Is Russia, a party created
in 1995 to back the president and his administration. ``Legally
yes, but politically no, no. We have our own grievances to present
to Yeltsin, democratic grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ryzhkov also accepted responsibility on behalf of his own
party. ``Our Home Is Russia declares an indictment of all the
heroes of this era, including ourselves,'' he said. ``The names of
people on the right and on the left will forever be among the names
of the architects of the ruins to which Russia has been reduced.
Today, we still have a chance to admit our mistakes, to draw
genuine lessons from what happened to our country. If we don't do
it, the people will; if the people don't do it, history will, if
history doesn't do it, God will.''
</P>
<P>
   By putting Yeltsin in the dock, the parliament managed to reveal
the depth of the political animus against him in Russia today, not
only among die-hard Communists but at the heart of its moderate
political center.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the debate were the voices of Russia's economic
reformers _ said to have been behind the decision to fire Primakov
_ whose parties are too small to qualify them for a right to speak
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the eve of the vote, Vladimir Lysenko, a liberal
deputy from Moscow, described the president's political isolation
in graphic terms. ``He is in a complete vacuum, just as Tsar
Nicholas II was in 1917,'' said Lysenko. ``There is a dead zone
around him, like the one around Chernobyl,'' he said in an allusion
to the nuclear power station in Ukraine that exploded in 1986,
sending radiation around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his weakness, Yeltsin was able to pull off a
tactical victory Saturday, another testament to his skill at
reading his opponents' weaknesses. Their failure Saturday came in
part because they forgot to anticipate one of the oldest tricks in
the Russian political game book _ ducking difficult decisions
either by developing a sudden sickness, or just slipping off to the
dacha, as the country cottages where Russians often spend weekends
are called.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 90 deputies Saturday simply failed to cast
ballots. Some may have stayed away because they wanted to avoid
further provoking an irascible and unpredictable president. Others,
if rumors are to be believed, may have simply been bought off with
promises of jobs, favors for their districts or even outright cash.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment drive was also flawed by poor organization.
Instead of presenting promised ``experts'' laying out the five
cases against Yeltsin, his opposition was only able to muster a
predictable cast of anti-Yeltsin deputies, such as writer Vasily
Belov, whose ``evidence'' on the charge of genocide against the
Russian people consisted of simply claiming that genocide had taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it very well without any experts,'' Belov blandly
told the parliament on Friday. The genocide charge scored the
lowest vote Saturday, with 238 deputies voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment of a president is a purely legal procedure,
based on articles in the criminal codes,'' said Aleksandr Kotentov,
Yeltsin's parliamentary representative, commenting on the results.
``This was a political process _ the start of the Communists'
election campaign. But it was not successful, as we predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was an embarrassment for the Communist leaders who just
Friday were gloating about a predicted victory on at least one of
the five impeachment charges. After the vote, Communist leaders
tried to put the best face on the failure to top the 300 threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that most of the Duma is against Yeltsin,''
said Anatoly Lukyanov, a Communist who was involved in the 1991
coup. ``The main thing for us is that the charges are out in the
open. There are 21 volumes of charges against Yeltsin, and
manuscripts don't burn,'' he said, in reference to a widely
recognized quote from Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov.
</P>
<P>
   With a confrontation over impeachment now averted, the battle
now moves to the nomination as prime minister of Sergei Stepashin,
the Yeltsin loyalist who as Interior minister heads the national
police force. The first of maybe as many as three votes on his
nomination must be held this week.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wins parliamentary approval for Stepashin, this too
may prove to be just another tactical victory for Yeltsin. The
president said he had fired Primakov for failing to produce an
aggressive program of economic reforms. But in public statements
this week, Stepashin has assured members of parliament that he will
not stray far from the Primakov platform.

VIETNAM SEES WAR'S LEGACY IN ITS YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ In what amounted to a chance
second-generation reunion from the war years, five teen-age girls
laughed and chattered at a lunch table the other day, all of them
patients in a hospital for severely deformed or mentally retarded
children.
</P>
<P>
   Their fathers had been soldiers from different parts of North
Vietnam who fought in the same area of Tay Ninh province in the
south and dispersed to their homes when the war ended in 1975. Then
they had children. The area where they fought had been heavily
sprayed with the herbicide Agent Orange in a wide-ranging,
decade-long campaign by the United States to deprive its enemy of
forest cover and food crops.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here are convinced that the five teen-agers _ along
with tens of thousands of other deformed children of war veterans
and exposed civilians _ are the victims of the herbicide and its
poisonous residue, dioxin. Reunions like the one in the hospital
are not uncommon, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's scientific studies have been sketchy and its
evidence is often anecdotal. Until there is firm proof that
chemical herbicides are to blame, the United States says it cannot
take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has raised the issue only glancingly in talks with the
United States, said Ambassador Douglas Peterson. But it arises
repeatedly among people here who say it is one of the most painful
remnants of a war that ended 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where Americans are generally welcomed with
friendship, the absence of aid from the United States for deformed
children is one issue that still rankles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject that the government-controlled press keeps alive
with occasional reports and that is sometimes placed on the agendas
of foreign delegations, who are shown shelves full of glass bottles
with labels like ``Deformed baby with two heads, one body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk so much about human rights and humanity,'' said Dr.
Le Cao Dai, who runs the Agent Orange program of the Vietnamese Red
Cross. ``No human rights in China. No human rights in Vietnam. So
why, these children, are they not eligible for human rights?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and many independent researchers caution that
there is no certainty that Agent Orange is responsible for the
illnesses and birth defects, which can have other causes and can be
found in other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation
for 10 diseases, as well as for the birth defect spina bifida, that
have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the
spraying in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says more accurate tests are needed to confirm
the Vietnamese assertion that there are victims here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Agent Orange issue in this country is driven by
propaganda,'' said a diplomat. ``They would have you believe that
every deformed baby is a result of Agent Orange. And the same with
American GIs.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1971, the United States sprayed 12 million gallons
of defoliant over more than 10 percent of what was then South
Vietnam. Some 14 percent of the area's forests were destroyed,
according to U.S. figures, and broad stretches of the landscape are
still bare of trees.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence so far that some areas are still
contaminated was published last October by a Canadian environmental
research group, Hatfield Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-year study of the Aluoi Valley in central Quang Tri
province, the researchers found high levels of dioxin in the soil,
in fish and animal tissue, and in the blood of people born after
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such data were collected in most Western jurisdictions,
based on similar sampling levels, major environmental cleanup and
more extensive studies would be implemented,'' the report said.
``As Western-based scientists, we can hardly recommend less be done
in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was careful not to draw conclusions about the
contentious question of human victims of the chemical spraying. But
David Levy, vice president and senior scientist of Hatfield, said
in an interview that logic would suggest that there were victims.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, tests conducted by Vietnamese and foreign
researchers in certain localities here have documented high levels
of contamination of breast milk and blood. Though the methodology
may not be as rigorous as that in more-developed nations, the
findings are often striking.
</P>
<P>
   Dai said sharp contrasts are evident between the south, which
was sprayed, and the north, which was not, and between northern
residents who fought in the south and those who did not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Of course, to be very accurate, we need to have more medical
study to confirm the causes,'' said Dr. Nguyen Thi My Hien, the
director of the hospital here, the Thanh Xuan Peace Village, that
cares for deformed children. But she said she believed that about
80 of her 100 patients were victims of chemical spraying.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is Nguyen Cong Nang, 11, the severely retarded son
of a former soldier who is himself disabled, with metal shrapnel
lodged behind his right eye. Now the father, Nguyen Van Hien, 45,
spends his days at the hospital, feeding and bathing his son and
rocking him to sleep at nap times.
</P>
<P>
   He said that all three of his sons had birth defects and that
friends from the war also had children who were born deformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it was OK,'' he said of his fellow soldiers. ``We were
happy to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation. But these
children are innocent of the war. They are a generation of victims
who are the children of victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance reunion of the children of battlefield comrades
included Nguyen Thi Thoa, 15, whose body is covered with black
blotches and whose younger brother died of heart disease. Hien
described the blotches simply as a melanin disorder and said: ``It
is a very serious case. We are confused about how to treat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by her were two sisters, Nguyen Thi Thuong, 15, and
Nguyen Thi Khuyen, 13, both of whom have mild mental retardation
and whose growth has been severely stunted.
</P>
<P>
   Hien said the sisters' father had been unable to bear their
ailments and had fled their home. After their mother brought them
to live at the hospital, the doctor said, the parents reunited and
had another baby, who was also born deformed.
</P>
<P>
   That story is not unusual, said Dai of the Red Cross. Parents
often consider such births to be punishments for their sins and
keep trying for healthy children, only to produce more sick ones.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the parents are ostracized by fellow villagers
for these presumed sins and exiled to live at the edges of rice
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In a final humiliation for these unlucky veterans, he said,
``People sometimes say, `This is happening to you because you
killed too many people when you fought in the war.'''

CLINTON URGES FILM INDUSTRY TO LIMIT VIOLENCE ON SCREEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev.)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ President Clinton urged the entertainment
industry Saturday to voluntarily limit the glorification of guns in
movie advertisements and previews and to consider whether movies
rated PG-13 contain excessive and gratuitous violence.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Clinton was to appear at a Hollywood dinner
given by top movie executives that was expected to raise $1.7
million for Democratic candidates for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio broadcast, the president criticized the
Senate for passing a gun-control measure on Friday that he said was
``riddled with loopholes'' allowing unrestricted firearms purchases
at gun shows and pawnshops. But he also praised some gun
manufacturers for their support of administratio gun-control
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The president thus continued to weave a middle path between
condemnation of Hollywood and attacks on the gun lobby in his
effort to begin a national campaign to reduce violence by
teen-agers in the aftermath of the school shooting in Littleton,
Colo., in April.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened a White House meeting on youth and violence
last Monday that some in the entertainment business refused to
attend because they thought it was an effort to demonize Hollywood
for the prevalence of violence in American society. The president
emphasized then, and again Saturday, that he was not engaged in a
hunt for scapegoats but rather trying to spark some soul-searching
on the part of movie and television executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many creators and purveyors of violence say there is
nothing they can do about it,'' Clinton said in the radio address.
``But I believe they are wrong. Every one of us has a role to play
in giving our kids a safe future. And those with greater influence
have greater responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should see movies and music, TV programs, video games and
advertising for them made by people who made them as if their own
children were watching,'' he added. ``Members of the entertainment
community can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The president asked the industry to consider revising the rating
system to make movies rated PG-13 less violent. He suggested that
films now rated PG-13 as appropriate for teen-agers contain
material that is suitable only for older viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged owners of theaters and video stores to
enforce the current R rating, which means that children under 17
should not view the material unless accompanied by a parent or
adult guardian.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Gallup Poll cited by the White House, half of
American teen-agers say they have seen an R-rated movie in the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that the president's proposals on
movie advertisements and the rating system were not a threat but a
suggestion, not censorship but a plea for self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Several entertainment executives said this week that they were
willing to consider voluntary measures to limit access to violent
material. But most insisted that the easy availability of guns and
the turmoil of adolescence were the chief causes of violent
behavior by teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted studies that show that the average American child
will see 40,000 dramatized murders by the time he or she reaches
age 18. He also cited research indicating that celluloid mayhem
desensitizes children to violence and may lead to aggressive
behavior by troubled and alienated youths.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Democratic donors near here on Friday night,
Clinton said that parents, teachers and religious leaders, along
with Hollywood executives, had a responsibility to provide
alternatives to children so that they did not ``drift off into the
darkness'' of violent fantasy, or worse, action.
</P>

   ``What I think is that we now understand _ I hope we do, as a
people _ that if we're going to make America a safer place for our
children, we have to stop pointing fingers at one another and start
assuming responsibility,'' Clinton told contributors at the home of
Walter Shorenstein, a San Francisco developer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to appear at a fund-raiser Saturday night
in Beverly Hills given by the founders of the Dreamworks studio,
David Geffen, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. The 100
guests will include many of the top names in Hollywood who have
been among the president's most loyal patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen said this week that he and most of his friends in
Hollywood continued to support the president despite Clinton's
recent criticism of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles, Clinton travels to San Diego and Las Vegas to
complete a four-day fund-raising trip that was expected to net the
Democratic Party more than $3 million. He returns to Washington on
Monday evening.

EMBASSY BLAST CHURNS CHINA'S POLITICAL TEA LEAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Why did Zhu Rongji, China's popular prime
minister, cry on TV?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a tumultuous week when student-led protests and
government-run media dovetailed in a remarkable show of nationalist
frenzy, one of the main questions haunting Politburo-watchers in
China is why Zhu shed tears when he and other leaders appeared at
memorial services for three journalists killed in NATO's accidental
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the first reason, that even a politician as hard-boiled
as Zhu was genuinely overcome by emotion for the tragic deaths of
three fellow citizens, Chinese analysts and journalists say that
politics also helped darken Zhu's demeanor. The political stakes in
China's current outburst of nationalism are high, and the
overriding question of the day is: Has Zhu been hurt?
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, seen by many ordinary Chinese as the best hope for
combating corruption and transforming the moribund state sector of
the economy, is suddenly vulnerable to accusations by rivals that
he is too soft on the United States, the country Chinese seem both
to love and to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his trip to Washington in April, when he made broad
concessions on trade issues but failed to win entry to the World
Trade Organization, Zhu is being accused of humiliating his country
by selling out its interests and getting nothing in return,
particularly by officials threatened by Zhu's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now that China's extensive political machinery is issuing
spirited nationalist edicts and speeches to be studied and recited
by local officials in every province of China, Zhu's reform program
appears certain to be slowed. Even if Zhu's political standing is
not seriously diminished by attacks from opponents, he will
doubtless have to delay or soften his more aggressive reforms.
</P>
<P>
   For political scorekeepers who scour the media for clues to the
power struggle that inevitably intensifies during a crisis, even
though it remains hidden, the main event last week was television's
news broadcast Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   It showed little besides a formal mourning routine by six of
China's top leaders at ceremonies for the three journalists,
recorded in minute detail. Yet in China, even a simple event may
offer hints whose political implications are debated by viewers for
days afterward.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday's broadcast, starting with President Jiang Zemin,
each leader performed the same solemn triple bow before photographs
of the dead, and then moved slowly down a receiving line of
relatives, shaking hands and giving condolences.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast was clearly intended to convey the leadership's
sympathy for the victims of the bombing, since leaders are
sensitive to accusations, from students and military officers and
conservative politicians, that the official response to the bombing
has been too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, whose nickname among Chinese journalists is the Actor
because of his attempts to stage his appearance at news events,
looked saddened and solemn as he shook hands with the grieving
families.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line was Li Peng, chairman of China's legislature, who
is deeply unpopular for presiding over the crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989. Li appeared to avoid looking
at the people with whom he shook hands, achieving less than the
desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Zhu. He looked each relative in the eye, in silence.
His distressed expression said it all: This is unspeakably sad, and
I feel your pain. By the time he reached the end of the line, Zhu
was crying and looked genuinely moved. It was a virtuoso
performance, several Chinese journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhu is already the most popular leader among common people,''
said a magazine editor in Beijing. ``In a crisis, everyone looks to
see how the leadership acts. Zhu did best, in that one moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zhu's tears also meant something more, the editor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His expression said, `This is a terrible thing for China,' ''
the editor explained. ``Not just the families, not just China's
image, but also the whole economic reform process, which could be
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Other close observers of the week's events debated whether Zhu's
tears were a warning to sophisticated viewers, or an appeal for
support from fellow Communist Party members, or something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were seriously under attack, he would not appear on
television at all,'' said an official at a state-run company. ``I
think he was trying to look humble.''
</P>
<P>
   The official pointed to another clue, which came on the
following day's television broadcast, where China's leaders were
shown going to the hospital to visit several Chinese diplomats who
were wounded in the bombing of the embassy in Belgrade, and have
returned to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than show each of the top leaders comforting separate
wounded people, as such broadcasts often do, Jiang, Li, Zhu and
three other top leaders trooped into each hospital room together.
It involved awkward camera work to get them all on screen at the
same time, but the effort was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one reason to show them all together, rather than
separately,'' the official said. ``The message is that they are
united. Whether or not it is true, that is the message.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Almost exactly 10 years ago, China's leading political reformer
and Communist Party chief at the time, Zhao Ziyang, made a tearful
appearance on television as he visited hunger-striking student
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square just two weeks before the violent
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time Zhao was seen in public. He has been under
house arrest ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu does not seem to be in any imminent danger of dismissal.
China's media, by the end of the week, were reporting the
activities of Jiang, Li and Zhu in that order, in keeping with
their ranking in the Communist Party hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese journalist pointed out that many people took
note when Zhu said just before going to the United States in April
that he actually did not want to go, but that Jiang had insisted
that he do so.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders take few important decisions unilaterally, the
journalist said, so Zhu's statement, though it sounded simple,
indicated that it was a collective decision of the leadership that
he should go ahead with his trip, implying that a collective
responsibility must be borne if things did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 months since he was named prime minister, Zhu has won
loyal admirers and enemies by taking bold steps to kill off
unproductive sectors of China's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions he offered in Washington in April were aimed at
winning entry to the World Trade Organization, but more generally
aimed at forcing open change-resistant parts of China's
telecommunications, banking and financial services industries.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu is also said to be resented by some of his top colleagues,
with less talent for public speaking, because he is so appealing,
direct and humorous in public.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of Zhu's weaknesses, Chinese analysts say, is that he is
so popular among Western businessmen and officials, who appreciate
his direct manner. At a time of strong anti-American sentiment,
that vulnerability can only become more pronounced.

AMID HIGH-TECH WEALTH, A UNITED WAY IS DEPLETED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In what may be a leading indicator of how traditional social
welfare agencies are struggling even as technology yields new
riches, the United Way of Santa Clara County, in Silicon Valley,
collapsed this month as donations slipped, a reserve fund once
brimming with $11 million went dry, and on May 1 the agency ran out
of money.
</P>
<P>
   Donations to the Santa Clara United Way, the 30th largest in the
nation, are expected to total $20 million in the current campaign,
down 40 percent from the $32.6 million, adjusted for inflation,
that the organization raised nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The social services agencies have faced even bigger cuts in the
1990s than these figures suggest, however, because the proportion
of United Way money that donors designate to organizations other
than social services agencies has been rising rapidly and now
approaches half the total raised, said Michael E. Fox Sr., a San
Jose beer distributor who is the United Way chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet millionaires in Silicon Valley have drawn
attention for multimillion-dollar gifts to higher education and
major arts organizations, social services charities there say they
struggle with flat or shrinking support and are often spurned by
high-tech companies who see no link between their business
interests and social services.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has slashed financing for social services charities by
25 percent since 1996, according to a study sponsored by the Nathan
Cummings Foundation in New York. Donations to social services
charities have slipped about 6 percent since 1990, two other
studies show.
</P>
<P>
   To help the 100 agencies in Santa Clara County whose financing
was abruptly cut by the United Way collapse, Community Foundation
Silicon Valley created a fund.
</P>
<P>
   The first contributor, Steve Kirsch, the founder of Infoseek,
put up $1 million on Wednesday and announced that he had asked a
Who's Who of Silicon Valley billionaires and wealthy executives to
match his gift. As of Saturday, only Ebay, the Internet auction
company, had announced that it would match Kirsch's gift.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Jacobs, the president of the United Way until she was
fired on May 6, said that in her four years in San Jose, she
approached many high-tech companies only to be told that the social
services needs of the county were not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silicon Valley way of life is one of the best in the
country,'' Mrs. Jacobs said, ``but I don't know that there is a
grasp on the part of residents that there are people who need basic
social services _ shelters for battered wives, mental health
services. I dealt with a number of companies whose officials said,
`Our employees make this much money and they do not need these
services, so why are you here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jacobs said she also tried to meet with 12 wealthy Silicon
Valley residents about supporting United Way, but eight of them
would not even give her an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Tait, executive director of Friends Outside, which
depended on United Way for 20 percent of the money it spends on
counseling, job referrals and other help to families who have
relatives in jail, said she had encountered similar responses. But
Mrs. Tait said the fault may lie with the charities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in this valley,'' Mrs. Tait said, ``we have done a
poor job of educating the public'' about how social ills spread
when there are no services available.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of America officials sought to portray Silicon Valley
as an anomaly. Giving to United Way in other high-tech centers is
rising. The officials cited the Research Triangle area of North
Carolina, with the biggest growth, up threefold since 1984. King
County, Wash., and the high-tech community around Seattle _ which
has about the same population as Santa Clara County _ raised $68.5
million in the current campaign, more than three times the amount
raised in Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   The level of giving in King County ``disproves the claim that
young people in high-tech industries will not give for social
services,'' said Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation
Silicon Valley, which has a $240 million endowment, most of it
raised in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   King County relies heavily for support on workers at Boeing and
Costco and on support drummed up by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates,
whose parents were long active in United Way.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Beene, president of United Way of America, which
represents 1,300 local United Ways, said the collapse in San Jose
``is about a director with a good heart who made overly optimistic
projections about pledges and who was trying to deal with a very
high level of designations,'' in which donors directed which
charities received their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Jacobs was hired in 1995, she expanded the Santa
Clara United Way staff to 77 from 52 even though donations were
flat. Last fall, the board approved her request for a $1 million
line of credit without inquiring about the state of the
organization's finances, said Fox, who holds the volunteer position
of Santa Clara United Way board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mrs. Jacobs laid off 32 staff members, but the
board was not aware that she had paid each dismissed employee a
month's pay for each year on the payroll, at a total cost of $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who is also on 34 other charity and civic boards, said he
learned last week that $3 million of pledges from businesses were
made orally and are now worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jacobs said written letters were never sent to confirm
``verbal pledges'' and that no event was held to introduce these
businesses to United Way. She said that when the flow of donations
fell, she did not call in the member agencies to tell them they
would have to take less ``because I did not want to anger them and
upset them. I guess, with what happened, it would have been better
if I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Margie Diaz Kintz, an Intel Foundation director, and Joseph
Valentine, former president of the San Francisco United Way, will
temporarily run the Santa Clara County United Way and try to keep
it out of bankruptcy proceedings, United Way officials said.

GOATS ON TRIAL AS URBAN WEED KILLERS  
(DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Wyo., Calif.)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A sign in a city park here says it all: ``Goats at
Work.'' A herd of about 100 Cashmere goats that has been munching
at the park and other weed-choked areas around the city since April
is working for the city of Denver as part of a program to fight
invasive weeds that have taken over native plants and wildlife
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual to have goats graze within the city limits, right
along a managed city park,'' said Judy Montero, a spokeswoman for
the Denver Parks and Recreation Department. ``We hope the goats
will reduce our use of herbicides and pesticides in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city will spend $50,000 in grant money on this
experimental weed control program. The goats will be used to help
restore 25 to 35 acres within the city limits, including sites
along the Platte River and around Cherry Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest weed-control technique known to mankind,''
said Lani Lamming, an owner of Land Whisperer, the Alpine, Wyo.,
company that is leasing the goats to the city. ``It's so logical
and simple. In my opinion, we're using life to nurture other forms
of life. No natural resources are being wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lamming, who owns the company with her husband, Fred, said
goats preferred the broadleaf weeds to grass, unlike cows and
horses, which graze grass first. The herds are managed alternately
by the Lammings, their three teen-age sons and professional
herders.
</P>
<P>
   The goats, which work in two four-hour shifts daily in a
temporarily fenced-in area, can mow down about one acre per day.
They can reach areas that machines cannot, and they serve other
purposes as they graze: tilling the soil, re-seeding and
fertilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan for the park is to re-establish native grasses.
As the goats are nibbling on the broadleaf weed varieties, a park
official said, their hoofs are trampling in seeds of desirable
native species distributed by city employees.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a job varies depending on conditions, but Land
Whisperer estimates the average cost is $100 per acre, using 50 to
100 goats.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the city has relied on mechanical mowing, spraying
herbicides and pesticides and pulling weeds by hand. But those
methods have hazards: air pollution from mowing and contamination
of groundwater from chemical sprays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goats alone can't get rid of the weeds,'' said Gayle
Weinstein, a naturalist for the parks department. She said the
goats could work the same site only about three times during a
growing season and still get enough to eat. After that, most of the
seed heads should be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll come in and spray when the plants are weakened, ''
she said. ``Maybe with this combination we could get rid of the
weeds in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Denver, like cities and counties in many other Western
states, laws require any landowner, whether a private party or the
government, to control noxious weeds on the property or risk being
fined or even criminally prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   If noxious weeds are left uncontrolled, they create a chain
reaction of ecological and economical disasters. The weeds
eliminate native plants and possibly lower the water supply,
harming the wildlife that feeds on those plants. The land can then
lose its value for future development, for farming and ranching,
and for recreational uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lose it all if we allow weeds to take over,'' said John
M. Randall, an invasive-weed specialist with the Nature Conservancy
in Davis, Calif. ``It's not a stretch to say invasive species _ and
that includes insects and wildlife as well as plants _ are the
biggest threat to natural habitats next to development, the
subdividing land for housing and shopping malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Randall is in favor of using the goats, he and other
experts say the use of goats and other livestock should be in
addition to an arsenal of tools to fight noxious weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique is not going to be the silver bullet, and no one
should rely on one method,'' said Eric Lane, weed coordinator for
the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The state has an annual fund of $225,000 to promote weed control
projects on all lands, from federal to private, Lane said, and
$15,000 was given to the city this year to help pay for the goats.
The cost of fighting invasive weeds is even higher in other Western
states. In Montana this year, the Legislature passed a bill to put
$1.1 million into the state's noxious-weed management trust over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weed management is extraordinarily expensive, and it requires
persistent action,'' Lane said. ``The advantages to using the goats
are that this technique is uncontroversial, and because the goats
are attractive, it gets the public interested too.''

CORPORATE PARK'S BUCOLIC APPEAL IS LOST IN TRAFFIC

<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ Years ago, the office talk at
Glaxo Wellcome's U.S. headquarters here was primarily the weather
or the ease with which Duke's basketball team had just clobbered an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to the office now and complain about the
traffic,'' said Bill Shore, the director of community affairs at
Glaxo Wellcome. ``It's frustrating. I don't care if you're in Los
Angeles or Raleigh, if you're in a dead stop in traffic, you're in
a dead stop.''
</P>
<P>
   When Research Triangle Park was founded in 1959 by business
leaders in an area between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, it was
designed to be a 10-square-mile preserve where corporations could
grow without the urban ills of crime and pollution. Strict rules
maintained the sense of tranquillity. Even today, companies that
move to certain parts of the park's forests can build on only 15
percent of their land, with the rest remaining largely woods.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the concept has become too successful. About
50,000 people now go out to the country each day to work inside
Research Triangle Park at such corporate giants as International
Business Machines, Cisco Systems and Novartis Biotechnology, and
nearly all of them get there by car.
</P>
<P>
   The result is rush-hour jams along the roads that serve the park
_ notably Davis and Alexander Drives _ that can take an hour to
clear. Rain or a traffic accident along the primary highway serving
the complex, Interstate 40, can stretch the normal 15-minute drive
to Chapel Hill into a 90-minute ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The congestion is so worrisome that top executives of Glaxo
Wellcome and Cisco Systems recently told Gov. Jim Hunt that their
companies could not continue to expand here if the problem was not
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic problems plaguing Research Triangle Park are common
to many metropolitan areas, but to civic and business leaders in
the Research Triangle, that is precisely the problem. What makes
North Carolina gridlock different, they say, is the easygoing
culture of the state, which has drawn so many people and jobs here.
Even city dwellers in North Carolina expect their lives to be
hassle free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being stuck in traffic for an hour and a half is not the way
communities should live,'' said Smedes York, a former mayor of
Raleigh who is co-chairman of the Regional Transportation Alliance,
formed earlier this year by business and civic leaders to organize
efforts to relieve congestion around the park. But many of the
alliance's ideas face a dim future in the North Carolina
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Research Triangle Park may be home to some of the state's
largest employers, but some members of the Legislature appear
determined not to give the area special consideration.
Representatives from rural areas have succeeded in having much of
the money allocated for new roads divided equally across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the traffic horror is the design of the park itself.
Even though the campus is two miles wide, it has no residential
space, which makes all workers commuters. The only mass transit is
a limited bus service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working from a model that was popular in the 1950s and
1960s,'' York said. ``Nobody wanted to live downtown. That's why
the park was built that way. You just couldn't live close to where
you worked, heaven forbid.''
</P>
<P>
   When the park opened 40 years ago, the area's small towns
welcomed the new commuters. The reputation of Research Triangle
Park as a high-tech promised land soon spread nationwide, drawing
an influx of companies and well-educated, well-paid employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight years, the population of the six counties
surrounding the park increased 23.7 percent, to one million. The
average salary of those working in the complex last year was about
$56,000, compared with $23,800 for the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the surrounding communities soon began to struggle from the
boom. Nine years ago, Cary, near Raleigh, the state capital, had
only 44,397 residents. Today, Cary has around 85,000 and must buy
water from Raleigh and Durham.
</P>
<P>
   One problem that has vexed Cary and other towns near the park is
the lack of industry within their own city limits. Without an
inflow of corporate income taxes, Cary has had to use bond
referendums to finance many of its road and water programs.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the area's traffic woes, the Regional Transportation
Alliance has come up with proposals that include a 5-cent-a-gallon
gasoline tax in the six counties around the park and building toll
roads within the counties.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline tax, toll fees and other initiatives would raise $2
billion over the next 10 years for new roads that would connect the
park to surrounding cities, as well as for road expansions. While
the plan appears feasible, some members of the Legislature want to
make the gasoline tax statewide so that their areas would share in
the proceeds. But a statewide tax would require approval of the
full Legislature, where it would face a battle. Jim Black, the
speaker of the house, has said there would be no tax increases for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Some help is on the way, however. The state Department of
Transportation is planning to add a fourth lane to Interstate 40.
The Triangle Transit Authority, created by the Legislature and the
several municipalities to develop a long-term plan for
transportation for the area, is expected to build a $250 million
rail system to connect the park with several communities. But
neither of the projects is expected to be completed before 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders believe this will not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of one way being correct and one not,'' York
said. ``We just need to respond to the area's growth. But we also
need to remember that North Carolina has a history of solving its
problems.''

   DENVER _ A sign in a city park here says it all: ``Goats at
Work.'' A herd of about 100 Cashmere goats that has been munching
at the park and other weed-choked areas around the city since April
is working for the city of Denver as part of a program to fight
invasive weeds that have taken over native plants and wildlife
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual to have goats graze within the city limits, right
along a managed city park,'' said Judy Montero, a spokeswoman for
the Denver Parks and Recreation Department. ``We hope the goats
will reduce our use of herbicides and pesticides in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the city will spend $50,000 in grant money on this
experimental weed control program. The goats will be used to help
restore 25 to 35 acres within the city limits, including sites
along the Platte River and around Cherry Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the oldest weed-control technique known to mankind,''
said Lani Lamming, an owner of Land Whisperer, the Alpine, Wyo.,
company that is leasing the goats to the city. ``It's so logical
and simple. In my opinion, we're using life to nurture other forms
of life. No natural resources are being wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lamming, who owns the company with her husband, Fred, said
goats preferred the broadleaf weeds to grass, unlike cows and
horses, which graze grass first. The herds are managed alternately
by the Lammings, their three teen-age sons and professional
herders.
</P>
<P>
   The goats, which work in two four-hour shifts daily in a
temporarily fenced-in area, can mow down about one acre per day.
They can reach areas that machines cannot, and they serve other
purposes as they graze: tilling the soil, re-seeding and
fertilizing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan for the park is to re-establish native grasses.
As the goats are nibbling on the broadleaf weed varieties, a park
official said, their hoofs are trampling in seeds of desirable
native species distributed by city employees.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a job varies depending on conditions, but Land
Whisperer estimates the average cost is $100 per acre, using 50 to
100 goats.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the city has relied on mechanical mowing, spraying
herbicides and pesticides and pulling weeds by hand. But those
methods have hazards: air pollution from mowing and contamination
of groundwater from chemical sprays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goats alone can't get rid of the weeds,'' said Gayle
Weinstein, a naturalist for the parks department. She said the
goats could work the same site only about three times during a
growing season and still get enough to eat. After that, most of the
seed heads should be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll come in and spray when the plants are weakened, ''
she said. ``Maybe with this combination we could get rid of the
weeds in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Denver, like cities and counties in many other Western
states, laws require any landowner, whether a private party or the
government, to control noxious weeds on the property or risk being
fined or even criminally prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   If noxious weeds are left uncontrolled, they create a chain
reaction of ecological and economical disasters. The weeds
eliminate native plants and possibly lower the water supply,
harming the wildlife that feeds on those plants. The land can then
lose its value for future development, for farming and ranching,
and for recreational uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lose it all if we allow weeds to take over,'' said John
M. Randall, an invasive-weed specialist with the Nature Conservancy
in Davis, Calif. ``It's not a stretch to say invasive species _ and
that includes insects and wildlife as well as plants _ are the
biggest threat to natural habitats next to development, the
subdividing land for housing and shopping malls.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Randall is in favor of using the goats, he and other
experts say the use of goats and other livestock should be in
addition to an arsenal of tools to fight noxious weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique is not going to be the silver bullet, and no one
should rely on one method,'' said Eric Lane, weed coordinator for
the Colorado Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The state has an annual fund of $225,000 to promote weed control
projects on all lands, from federal to private, Lane said, and
$15,000 was given to the city this year to help pay for the goats.
The cost of fighting invasive weeds is even higher in other Western
states. In Montana this year, the Legislature passed a bill to put
$1.1 million into the state's noxious-weed management trust over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weed management is extraordinarily expensive, and it requires
persistent action,'' Lane said. ``The advantages to using the goats
are that this technique is uncontroversial, and because the goats
are attractive, it gets the public interested too.''

GAME 5 SETUPS: JAZZ AND HEAT IN SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ It was a hard lesson in playoff survival
learned by the upstart Sacramento Kings against the two-time
Western Conference champion Utah Jazz in Game 4 of their
first-round series here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seven seconds was all that separated Utah from a shockingly
early exit and the Kings from their first post-season
series-clinching victory since the franchise moved to Sacramento in
1985. The sellout crowd of 17,317 that packed Arco Arena was
sensing the kill, and Utah knew it had absolutely no margin for
error.
</P>
<P>
   No one understood this better than Utah point guard John
Stockton. He calmly took the inbound pass, ran the pick-and-roll at
the top of the key with forward Karl Malone _ as he has so many
times in his career _ freed himself on the right side and drained a
22-foot jump shot with seven-tenths of a second remaining.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of Sacramento preparing to play the Portland Trail
Blazers in the second round, the 90-89 Utah victory has forced a
decisive Game 5 in Salt Lake City on Sunday afternoon. For
Stockton, who also made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer in Game 6 of the
1997 Western Conference finals to propel the Jazz to its first NBA
finals appearance, clutch jumpers are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's right up there,'' Stockton said when asked
where he would rank Friday's last-second basket. ``We were going
home for the summer. But that's just one shot. The plays leading up
to it won't get the credit they deserve. Shandon was incredible on
both ends of the floor,'' he said of forward Shandon Anderson, who
scored 8 of Utah's last 12 points. ``We're not even in the position
to make a last-second shot if he didn't do what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's 8 points came in a one-minute stretch to turn an
81-78 deficit into an 86-84 lead with 31 seconds remaining.
Anderson scored 10 of his 16 points in the final period,
essentially carrying the scoring load down the stretch. Although
Malone scored 23 points to go with his game-high 16 rebounds, he
struggled through a 9-for-21 shooting night and was in constant
foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Utah also showed an uncharacteristic lapse in poise, getting
assessed with three technical fouls in a four-minute stretch
halfway through the third quarter that put the Jazz in a 9-point
hole. A more experienced team might have put them away, although
the Kings came very close.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be ready to go on Sunday,'' Stockton said.
``They played well and with confidence, and we're going to have to
play a better game than we played tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Jazz pulled out Game 4, it realized that fate
can only be tempted so many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that we're not out of the woods yet,'' Malone said.
``We're going back home, but we're playing a young team who have
everything to gain and nothing to lose.'' &QL;

TURNSTILE JUMPER KILLED BY SUBWAY TRAIN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fare dodger was crushed to death by a subway train
in Brooklyn early Saturday after he leaped onto the tracks trying
to escape two transit officers, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The turnstile jumper, Ronnie Perkins, 18, of Brooklyn, was
declared dead at the scene, police said. He was caught between the
platform and a southbound J train as it arrived in the Chauncey
Street subway station about 2:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they arrested one of two young men who jumped the
turnstile with Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   The arrested man, Remi Perry, 18, also of Brooklyn, was charged
with theft of services for not paying the $1.50 fare, police said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police account, the plainclothes transit
officers were standing on the platform when they spotted three
young men jumping over a turnstile without paying.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers moved toward them, the suspects split up,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   One ran back out of the station, while the other two jumped onto
the tracks below just as a J train was arriving on the southbound
side.
</P>
<P>
   Perry ran to the northbound tracks, but Perkins froze in the
headlight of the approaching train, then dashed back to the
platform, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the activity ahead, the train's conductor slammed on his
brakes but could not stop in time. The train caught Perkins as he
gripped the side of the platform trying to pull himself to safety,
police said.

Kennedy International Airport Saturday from camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second group of refugees _ the first arrived May 8 _

   The United States has agreed to help resettle 20,000 of the
hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have been forcibly
expelled from their villages and towns.

EWING ERA REACHES A DRAMATIC CROSSROADS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Latrell Sprewell walked into the New York Knicks'
locker room Friday night, a thick cluster of reporters migrated in
his direction. Suddenly there was a clear view of a solitary
Patrick Ewing sitting in his royal blue bathrobe, staring down the
fibers in the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   His chin was cupped in his hand, and he was perfectly still, as
if modeling while Rodin chiseled ``The Thinker.'' Any number of
issues could have been circling Ewing's mind, like the pain in his
left Achilles' tendon that was plunged into two feet of ice, the
devastation of losing Game 4 to the Miami Heat after the Knicks had
foolishly danced on their rivals' grave with an 11-point lead, and
the weight of what is before him.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a series-deciding Game 5 that will play out
here on Sunday. If the Knicks are eliminated by coach Pat Riley's
Heat, the outcome could also send into motion the firing of coach
Jeff Van Gundy and cloud the future of the Ewing era in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't playing for Phil Jackson,'' Ewing said after the
Knicks lost, 87-72, and allowed the Heat to tie the series, 2-2, at
Madison Square Garden. ``If they bring Phil Jackson in here, they
can trade me.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be management's plan if the Knicks falter in the first
round. One Eastern Conference official, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, said the Knicks will explore trade possibilities
involving Ewing if they begin a hot pursuit of Jackson, the Bulls'
former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would put things in place for Phil,'' the official said,
referring to the type of players Jackson would want for his
triangle offense. ``The Knicks wouldn't be so old, and they'd be
more versatile. Phil has never needed a pure center. In the
triangle, you need interchangeable parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap logistics would make a trade difficult, though.
At age 36, Ewing has two years and $30 million left on a $68
million contract. Also, Dave Checketts, the president of Madison
Square Garden, said Friday that he hopes Ewing retires as a Knick.
However, he added that no Knick is untouchable if the right trade
scenario developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pay attention to the things players say; I won't pretend I
don't,'' said Checketts, who is aware of Ewing's position on
Jackson and loyalty to Van Gundy. ``But they don't make key
decisions. But I will certainly listen to what Patrick has to say
in the off season.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever unfolds will hinge greatly on what happens Sunday
afternoon in Miami Arena. In a cruel symmetry, Riley has a hand in
deciding Van Gundy's fate. Here is the former Knick coach who was a
mentor to Van Gundy, gave him the Cliff Notes to develop his own
style, and prepared him to take over the team when the opportunity
came. Yet, a Heat victory could leave Van Gundy's job security in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Always loyal to Riley despite two volatile playoff series in the
last two years, always respectful of him even though their
relationship has been wounded by two playoff-deciding fights, Van
Gundy might be at the mercy of the Heat and at the whim of his own
moody players.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Knicks flash unlimited potential, just as they did
by crushing the Heat in Games 1 and 3. Other times, they seem as if
they have lost the character that defined the old Knick teams,
which may not have always won with grace, but gritted out tough
fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a leftover core to those Knick teams: Ewing, Larry
Johnson, Allan Houston and Charlie Ward. These players have
supported Van Gundy and would be shattered if he departs. There is
also a new niche in the locker room, led by Marcus Camby and
Sprewell, both of whom have less allegiance to a coach who has been
slow to trust them, and has placed them in roles less glamorous
than what they are accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy needs them all to beat Miami and advance to the second
round, becoming only the second No. 8-seeded team to topple a No.
1. Houston, in particular, is pivotal to the outcome. Over three
years, Houston's ability to find his range has often determined how
the Knicks have finished against the Heat in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Knicks lost Game 7 in Miami after Houston
began the day 1 for 9. Last year, Houston led an undermanned Knick
team with a 30-point outburst to take Game 5 and end the series in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to be myself,'' Houston said. ``I'm not going
to put any extra pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Sprewell have a chance to come together, once again.
Their ability to blend as one during this series has meant
victories. When they have been a part of an offense that does not
move the ball and leans on taking their man one-on-one, they have
failed, as they did in Games 2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can play together,'' Houston said. ``We know that
when we do play together, we can be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   How effective can Ewing be, though? He has so much to play for,
and yet the franchise center has started off well only to fade as
the game progresses.
</P>
<P>
   During the fourth quarter in this series, Ewing is only 1 for 2.
The blowout nature of the games _ which has limited Ewing's late
minutes _ has something to do with that. Still, Ewing's offensive
impact and defensive mobility have dropped off as the games have
gone on. In the first quarters of the series, Ewing is 8 for 15. It
is hard to know what Ewing will have left should one of his
career's most important games come down to a
survival-of-the-fittest fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to be ready to play,'' Ewing said, answering a
question about the state of his health. ``That's all. Both teams
are competitive, and you know they're not going to go down without
a fight. That's the way I look at it.''  &QL;

 76ers ROUT MAGIC AND WIN SERIES BY 3-2  
(mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For one brief but monumental moment, the youngest
player on the court made the nine great athletes around him look
like old men glued to the hardwood. Larry Hughes, Philadelphia's
20-year-old rookie, leaped from outside of the painted area, timed
the carom of his teammate Eric Snow's missed shot perfectly, caught
it with two hands and slammed it through the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the air on his dynamic finish, Hughes finished off the
Orlando Magic with the play as the Philadelphia 76ers went on to
win, 101-91, before a boisterous capacity crowd Saturday at the
First Union Center. The tip-slam gave Philadelphia a 93-86 lead,
completed a 9-0 run and shut the door on a furious rally that saw
the third-seeded Magic come back from an 18-point third-quarter
deficit to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway, who finished with 17 points but missed 14 of 17
shots, followed Hughes' moment with a 3-pointer, but Allen
Iverson's running jumper seconds later insured the victory and gave
the underdog 76ers the series, 3 games to 1. It was the Sixers'
first playoff series victory since sweeping Milwaukee in the first
round in 1991. They will meet the Indiana Pacers, a team they
defeated two of three times in the regular season, in the Eastern
Conference semifinals, beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who had every defense in the book thrown at him by the
Orlando coach, Chuck Daly, led everyone with another monstrous
performance, scoring 37 points and handing out nine assists. Eric
Snow followed with 20 points, and Hughes added 14. Nick Anderson
led Orlando with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia outscored Orlando, 13-6, over the last six minutes
of the second quarter for a 47-36 lead at halftime and looked
poised for a blowout early in the third. Continuing his assault
which began shortly after tip-off, Iverson scored 13 points in the
first seven minutes to reach 30 points with nearly a quarter and a
half left to play.
</P>
<P>
   When Iverson nailed his fourth 3-pointer of the game at 7:33 of
the third quarter, the Sixers went ahead by 62-44, seemingly
shredding the Magic. But out of nowhere, Orlando mustered up a 20-6
run that put them back in the game. Nick Anderson was the catalyst,
scoring 15 of the Magic's 35 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a resolve that seemed to have been swiped from them, the
Magic muscled their way to the foul line and hit 17 of 21 free
throws in the quarter. Philadelphia held onto the lead through the
third and took a 77-71 advantage into the fourth, but the Magic
closed the gap in less than four minutes when Darrell Armstrong's
3-pointer tied the score at 79-79 with more than eight minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Besides finding its offense and courage, the Magic made its run
with strong defense on Iverson. After reaching 30 points at 4:59 of
the third, the league's most explosive player was held scoreless
until 4:55 remained in the game. The short jumper gave Philadelphia
an 88-86 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who seems to have become public enemy No. 1 in
Philadelphia, started with intentions of avenging himself. Booed
severely in Game 3 on Wednesday, mocked with chants of ``Penny's
soft,'' he vowed to score points in Iverson-like fashion.
</P>
<P>
   After attempting just two shots in Wednesday's pivotal first
half, Hardaway was quoted in The Philadelphia Daily News as saying,
``I'm coming out firing, no matter what. I don't care if I miss 20
or 30 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia altered Hardaway's plans immediately. With Eric
Snow, the Sixers' burly point guard, muscling him, Hardaway was not
able to do what he envisioned. He attempted five shots in the first
quarter and missed them all. If it were not for three free throws,
the Magic's leading scorer would have been scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that his careless comment about missing ``20 or 30
shots'' had a chance of coming true, Hardaway took just two shots
in the second quarter. But the results were unchanged and he took a
0-for-7 line into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   With their main man caged, the Magic lacked the firepower to
keep up with the energetic Sixers. Anderson did his best, scoring
14 points, but the mission was nearly hopeless. While they were not
as reckless as they were Wednesday, when they committed 20 of their
27 turnovers in the first half, the Magic were clearly frazzled by
the Sixers' quickness.
</P>
<P>
   With Snow bumping, Iverson swarming and Larry Hughes swatting
down at the ball, Philadelphia rushed Orlando's perimeter players
to the point where avoiding turnovers became the chief objective.
Running the offense became a secondary concern.
</P>
<P>
   This happened early when, after falling behind by 7-2, the
Sixers turned up their defensive intensity, and fear began setting
in on the Magic. Back to back steals by Iverson and Tyrone Hill led
to baskets and gave Philadelphia its first lead at 13-12.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK'S BAFFLING ZONING CODE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 16:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's antiquated zoning code runs about 900 pages and
rivals the Internal Revenue Code in complexity. Unless you are a
member of the coterie of zoning lawyers, the odds of accurately
interpreting one section of the code in relation to another are
slim to none. City Planning Commission Chairman Joseph Rose now
plans to rewrite parts of the code so that rules for building
height and other crucial standards are not only clear, but sturdy
enough to withstand attempts to twist them into pretzels.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of this undertaking is visible on both sides of the
East River. Developers and neighborhood groups have already squared
off over the skyscraper Donald Trump wants to build near the United
Nations and David Walentas' plans for a retail and entertainment
complex on land near the East River waterfront in Brooklyn. Both
disputes reflect the muddled state of city land-use policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under Rose's plan, parts of the 1961 zoning code, which he calls
a ``hodgepodge of conflicting visions and objectives,'' would be
reformulated to encourage innovative design while respecting
neighborhood character. Among other things, he would set height
limits for buildings outside Manhattan's Central Business District,
create a process for granting occasional waivers for buildings of
exceptional design, reopen some manufacturing zones to community
uses and rethink commercial-use rules for doctors' offices and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is his plan to abolish plaza bonuses for
residential buildings. Time and again, this tradeoff _ more square
footage for a developer in exchange for a plaza _ has saddled the
city with unattractive and inaccessible public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   As useful as it is, Rose's reform agenda ought to be treated as
an invitation to think more broadly about zoning issues and
land-use opportunities. When he unveiled his ideas in a recent
speech, he expressed a preference for pursuing a short list of
reforms. A full-scale review of the code, he fears, would be
paralyzing. But rethinking land use does not have to result in
civic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   A number of American cities, including Pittsburgh and
Minneapolis, have developed fresh land-use principles, written a
new code and survived  &QC; the process. New York's 50-odd community
boards, various civic groups, architects and builders should be
invited to compile their own lists of the most vexing zoning
problems. A comparison of all these lists should make it possible
to choose between full-scale review of the entire code and taking a
triage approach by focusing on the top 10 to 20 issues.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue Rose has opened should logically lead everyone to
grapple with two other areas _ redeveloping the city's vast but
often dilapidated waterfront and identifying the environmental
values that should be loaded into the building, zoning and tax
codes. The dog days of summer that New Yorkers dread will be
testimony to the wisdom of examining environmental issues. During
extremely hot weather, New York creates heat islands.
</P>
<P>
   Dark road pavement, buildings with dark roofs and other
impervious surfaces boost already uncomfortable temperatures and
help produce ground-level ozone. Planting trees, a zoning code
issue, and requiring the use of reflective materials on roofs and
streets can lower temperatures. As New York reinvents itself, it
should not be hamstrung by a Sputnik-era rule book.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ``to do'' lists the Stulbergs drew up for their
youngest son's bar mitzvah included a mixture of items, from
standard and stressful to extraordinary and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside ``caterer'' and ``pick up dry cleaning'' were such
details as ``follow up computer file loading'' and ``insert tropes
_ need download.''
</P>
<P>
   When their son Joey finally took his place before 156 guests at
the Kane Street Synagogue in Brooklyn on Saturday, his parents
eased into the intricate day of services and celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Joey, 13, a quadriplegic with severe cerebral palsy who can
barely move and cannot speak, was having his special day, thanks to
a convergence of advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, planning for Joey Stulberg's bar mitzvah began in
November 1985, three months after he was born with an inability to
control motor movement, a severe form of cerebral palsy called
athetosis. At that time, a newspaper article described how a boy in
Pittsburgh with the same disease took part in his bar mitzvah,
using a special computer that gave him a voice.
</P>
<P>
   Joey's father, Robert Stulberg, recalled that his own father
sent him the article with a note attached: ``You may want to save
this for Joey's bar mitzvah. It's never too early to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Stulberg, a labor lawyer, filed away the clipping, only to dig
it out last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the computer's designer, John Eulenberg,
director of the Artificial Language Laboratory at Michigan State
University, the Stulbergs embarked on a journey that tested the
limits of technology, the family's perseverance and the
malleability of an ancient ritual. Yet Stulberg says, ``What's
unusual about this is that it's so usual. He's doing what boys and
girls have done for thousands of years, and has learned enough to
participate in his tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   For Joey, who communicates by tapping a talking portable
computer with a pointer attached to his baseball cap, synagogue is
``GOOD,'' but he looked forward to the ``FREEDOM'' of completing
his Bar Mitzvah studies so he can return to writing plays and
watching sports.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Stulberg's apartment, next to Brooklyn's
Prospect Park, was the site of deliveries, last-minute plans _ and
a small technological miracle, as words, movement and melody came
together.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, using a Hebrew software program, Joey
laboriously tapped out six different passages of Scripture and
commentary _ hundreds of characters each. He then e-mailed the
files to Eulenberg, who converted the text into audio signals and
gave Joey's words a voice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Eulenberg arrived from Michigan and transferred the
files into Joey's portable computer, which until that moment spoke
only English. As the Stulbergs _ including Joey's brother, Jacob,
15, his sister, Sally, 10, and their mother, Mickey Green _
clustered in the living room, Joey tapped his screen to bring up a
menu of Hebrew passages. From that, he tapped again, and out poured
the chanting of his Haftarah, the ultimate synthesis of his
word-processed texts.
</P>
<P>
   Joey is, at once, severely impaired and highly gifted. He weighs
50 pounds and must use a wheelchair. Yet he can study, paint and
write at the Henry Viscardi School for the disabled that he attends
in Albertson. Ask him about Wayne Gretzky's retirement and a look
of anguish crosses his face.
</P>
<P>
   He is likely to have a normal life span, said his doctor,
Stephen Ajl, associate professor of pediatrics at Downstate Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   But planning a special event is difficult. Joey's bar mitzvah
was originally planned for last October. But it was postponed so
that he could undergo four operations to reshape his hip bones so
they would not slide out of their sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the slow recovery, he continued to study Hebrew,
meeting with a tutor. There were other mishaps. Stulberg recalled
with a smile that Joey first painstakingly tapped in the wrong
Haftarah passage, or biblical teaching. Joey roared in laughter at
the memory of the frustrated effort. The right Haftarah passage
turned out to be the longest one there is.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, a group assembled at the synagogue, where a
long black ramp to accommodate Joey's wheelchair dominated the
aisle. As a congregant wired the sound system to project Joey's
synthesized voice, Rabbi Sam Weintraub _ in Talmudic fashion _
pondered the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ordinary, in that there is a young boy who has an
attachment to the synagogue, who is very nervous, and who is going
to lead the congregation in study,'' he said. But as Eulenberg
attached Joey's computer to stereo speakers and chanted Hebrew
resonated, Weintraub said, ``That is not ordinary.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GRUNFELD STILL ROOTS FOR HOMETOWN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is one longtime fan who thinks the New York
Knicks ``have a good chance'' to win the deciding game in Miami on
Sunday afternoon. He is Ernie Grunfeld, who, until April 21, was
the president and general manager of this erratic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a big Knicks fan,'' Grunfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not always. Maybe not in Romania, where he was born, but
certainly in Forest Hills, Queens, where you could press your ear
to the subway grating and imagine you heard the crowd roar in
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Grunfeld came to run his hometown team, the one with the
massive mood swings, between the energy and purpose of the first
and third playoff games against Miami and the anarchy of the second
and fourth games.
</P>
<P>
   If it all goes down Sunday, the current ownership of the Garden
must look at everybody, everybody, in the basketball chain of
command and ask, What did they know and when did they know it? As
the coaches say, it's a team game, but only Grunfeld was sent to
the showers before the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I had a plan,'' Grunfeld said. ``We were going with
more athletic, younger players to take the pressure off Patrick. We
wanted more diversity, more options. It's finally coming
together.'' He said that before Friday night's 87-72 loss, in which
the Knicks once again reverted to looking like strangers, clanging
impromptu shots off the rim after they had taken an 11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' said Grunfeld, who watched with friends
in New Jersey. ``This was a winnable game. They were leading in the
fourth quarter and couldn't hold it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld sounded as mystified as the coaches about the
scattershot basketball of this ad hoc season. He has worked with _
a nice neutral phrase _ both coaches. How alike they are, after
all. Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy both seem morbidly shocked by
letdowns in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our poise,'' Van Gundy murmured after Friday's loss.
``We didn't get the job done.'' And then Van Gundy added, ``In this
day and age, when the offense goes, the defense goes with it,'' not
exactly a hearty endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Riley's assessment of his team: ``We were
humiliated twice. Sometimes it does wonders for you. But we gain
nothing _ other than a trip home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like nobody can win. Both teams have problems that seem
beyond home-court advantage or coaching strategy or one crucial
injury or one hot hand. Nobody can get his act together this year.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld has stayed away from the Garden. He still has tickets,
but has no idea when he will feel like using them, or what the
future holds.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way since that epic evening a month ago when
Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, took him
out to dinner and said, in effect, ``Ernie, could you pass the
rolls? Oh, and by the way, I'll be taking over your duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld has not made any public complaints, and is laying low,
courting college players for the Knicks, and rooting. The inner
Knicks fan allowed him to exult over Wednesday night's victory,
when Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby energized the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a three-time all-star, a first-team all-pro the year
Michael Jordan was away playing baseball,'' Grunfeld said of
Sprewell, for whom he traded John Starks. ``He's great in the open
court, great in transition, and now he's more comfortable in the
half court.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Knicks suffered when Sprewell suffered a stress
fracture to his heel on Feb. 7. Grunfeld said, ``He needs time to
get in shape all over again, and it's halfway through the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby came over from Toronto in a trade for the durable and
popular Charles Oakley. On Friday, Grunfeld said, ``Obviously, in
the off-season I had to make tough decisions. They were not popular
decisions but they were in the best interests of the organization.
I felt he was athletic, younger, a shot-blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby had not looked disciplined in two years at Toronto, but
Grunfeld said, ``I felt he was in a situation where we could
surround him with players with a better work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were struggling with a 21-21 record when Grunfeld was
replaced and then they won six of eight and slipped into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hurt,'' Grunfeld said about his dismissal.
``I was surprised, shocked. I did my job for nine years and had the
fourth-best record during that time. I'm proud of what I
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not deny that it has been hard for his wife, Nancy, and
their children, Rebecca, 17, and Danny, 14, to not be part of the
Garden life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been harder on my family than on me,'' Grunfeld said.
``I've had more time to be with my family. We're still a basketball
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The basketball family will sit in front of the television
Sunday. Does he have any advice for his old team? ``They know what
to do at game time,'' he said. ``It's always tough to win a final
game on the road, but they can do it.'' Grunfeld is rooting for the
team of his childhood, but it is human nature that he is also
rooting for his own judgment, his own reputation, toward the end of
this strange, truncated season.

   Charles K. McWhorter, an aide to Vice President Richard M. Nixon
and later a lawyer for AT&AMP;T, died May 11 at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston after being injured May 1 in a car accident on
Cape Cod. He was 77 and lived in Manhattan and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter was a legislative assistant to Vice President Nixon
from 1957 to 1961 and joined AT&AMP;T as an executive assistant and
attorney shortly afterward. He retired in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after Nixon had been elected president, McWhorter
turned down an offer to work in the White House, saying he
preferred to remain in New York. He accepted an appointment to the
National Council on the Arts instead.
</P>
<P>
   McWhorter was born on Feb. 22, 1922, in Lewisburg, W.Va. He
graduated from West Virginia University and in 1949 received a law
degree from Harvard University. He also served in the Army during
World War II and the Korean War. A onetime president of the Young
Republican National Federation, he was active in Republican
politics throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Susanna Reckerd of Claremont, Calif.

DRIVE TO IMPEACH RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DIES IN PARLIAMENT

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a flood of venomous oratory, the Communist-led
drive to impeach President Boris Yeltsin failed in Russia's
parliament Saturday as nearly 100 members of the legislature
unexpectedly stayed away from the session, and some ballots were
thrown out because they carried no names or were defaced.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's opponents in the lower house of parliament, the Duma,
needed 300 votes out of the 442 active members to win impeachment
on any of the five charges against him. The count deemed most
likely to succeed was the charge that Yeltsin waged an illegal war
against the rebellious Russian republic of Chechnya in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But late Saturday afternoon parliament officials reported that
only 283 valid votes were cast in support of the Chechnya charge,
17 short of what was needed. Forty-three legislators voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other charges approached that total. Besides the
accusation involving the war in Chechnya, Yeltsin had been charged
with illegally dissolving the Soviet Union in 1991, staging a
violent 1993 coup against rebellious Communists in parliament,
destroying the Russian military and committing genocide by allowing
the nation's living standards to plummet, leading millions of
Russians to an early death.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide charge gathered 238 votes in support and 88
against. The charge of destroying the army collected 240 votes in
support and 77 against; the charge of dismantling the Soviet Union,
239 votes in support and 78 against, and the charge of staging a
coup against Parliament, 263 votes for and 60 against.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the votes as a
betrayal of Russia and pledged that legislators who opposed
impeachment ``will pay with their political careers'' at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conscience is clear,'' he told the news radio station Echo
Moskvy. Yeltsin's nominee as prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, said
the Duma had averted ``an extremely serious political crisis'' by
rejecting impeachment, and given Yeltsin time to address the
nation's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders forecast Friday that the Duma would approve at
least the Chechnya charge, and possibly others. But their cause was
set back seriously when only 348 ballots were accepted at
Saturday's climactic vote, 94 short of the number of active
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14 ballots were thrown out on some votes, either
because they were unsigned or were defaced with a large X.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a boycott of Saturday's balloting, the Communists sought
unsuccessfully on Friday to hold the impeachment votes then, rather
than wait until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant quoted officials Saturday as saying
that an ``epidemic'' had struck parliament members and that many
had checked into Moscow's prestigious Central Clinical Hospital for
treatment. The hospital was unable to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators have been under intense pressure to vote for
impeachment because of Yeltsin's unpopularity among voters. But
many also feared retaliation from the Kremlin should they support a
failed impeachment attempt, and it was widely believed that others
were offered jobs or other inducements to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Volkov, a spokesman for one of the leading Communists,
the chairman of the Duma's security committee, Viktor Ilyukhin,
seemed resigned to defeat after the vote, saying that it was the
symbolism of the impeachment effort that mattered, not the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether impeachment happens or not, we have to look at things
realistically,'' the spokesman, Volkov, said. ``This is a big
political action, important for the entire country. The vote itself
doesn't show what it actually means, because there is a big
political game'' affecting the balloting. Volkov said that ``all
the numbers don't show reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With any result,'' he said ``this is a big achievement of the
parliament _ that it can speak out against the government and its
actions. It shows to those who come next that the people are not
without a voice. It shows to the next Duma that they have a right
to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The firebrand nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky told Interfax
news agency that the Communist loss was a signal for Yeltsin to
``crush the leftists.'' Zhirinovsky, the head of the Liberal
National Democratic Party and an opponent of impeachment, predicted
that Yeltsin would now move to ban the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before the votes, Zyuganov said the impeachment process ``has
already had a refreshing effect in this hall and on the general
situation in the country'' by underscoring that even the highest
officials are accountable for their deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything was underscored by the three days of debate this
week, it was that the division between the Yeltsin government and
the Communists who control the parliament has evolved from fierce
political rivalry to blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov branded Yeltsin ``absolute evil'' in his closing
speech, a savaging of the president and a mournful eulogy for an
empire lost, ``a thousand-year-old power; the power that Hitler
failed to conquer but which, through the efforts of Yeltsin and his
team, was torn to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country took almost five centuries to gain access to the
seas, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea,'' he said, ``and today we
have been thrown back from these seas and we have sustained
colossal economic and moral losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all humiliated because the old people and the children,
the women and workers have been robbed. The reserves of the
strategic resources of this country amounted to more than $200
billion. Everything has been wasted _ sold and drunk away. We have
lost almost all property which was accumulated not during the 70
years of Soviet power, but during all the history of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Yeltsin's most powerful bloc of supporters in the
party, Our Russian Home, Vladimir Ryzhkov, retorted that the
charges against Yeltsin ``rest on sand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obvious to any law student in his second year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he defended Yeltsin against the impeachment
accusations _ noting, for example, that the Duma had voted to
support the same Chechen war that was the basis of a charge against
Yeltsin _ he conceded that the president has failed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, when he had the support of 97 percent of the
population, he did not use the historic opportunity to create a
truly democratic and stable state with a genuinely responsible
parliament,'' Ryzhkov said. ``In December 1993, when he had a clean
sheet of paper in front of him on which he could write any
constitution he wanted, he wrote the ugliest constitution in the
world which gave rise to a politically irresponsible parliament, a
politically helpless government and a president who was a colossus
on feet of clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, ``he brought us, after 10 years of
privation and setbacks, to a state where we have to begin
everything from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zhirinovsky condemned all sides, saying that Yeltsin was
being upbraided for a dissolution that has been under way for
hundreds of years, at the direction of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be said that the country was ruined in 1991. That
decision was made in 1717 in Paris; 280 years ago the West made a
decision to destroy the Russian empire,'' he said. ``Do you think
Napoleon invaded Russia just for kicks? That Hitler attacked Russia
just like that? That Yugoslavia is being bombed just like that? The
target is one _ the Russian empire, the Soviet Union; never mind
that we are now a democratic country. They are moving closer and
closer to the Russian borders.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Duma building in downtown Moscow, a vast crowd of
demonstrated cheered, waving Communist flags and signs reading
``Yeltsin resign!'' and ``We defeated Hitler, we will defeat
Yeltsin.'' One notable placard read, ``Yeltsin-out of the Kremlin!
Guilty!,'' twisting Yeltsin's name to give it a Jewish ending. As a
practical matter, Saturday's votes were mostly symbolic. Few
expected that a decision to impeach Yeltsin would actually result
in his removal, because the charges would have to survive review by
Yeltsin's appointees to constitutional and supreme courts, and then
pass the upper house of parliament, which has often backed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment had a gravity beyond mere condemnation of the
president. Many experts believe _ and some Kremlin aides have
hinted _ that Yeltsin would strike back at the Communists should
impeachment have passed, perhaps by finding a legal excuse to
dissolve the Duma and force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Constitution prohibits dissolving the Duma while an
impeachment is in progress. An attempt by Yeltsin to sidestep that
requirement would have provoked a showdown that could well have
endangered the nation's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Communists now must decide whether they wish to rebuff Yeltsin
by rejecting his choice of Stepashin, the interior minister, to
succeed Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is required to dissolve the Duma if it refuses three
times to ratify the nomination of a new prime minister. Although
the Duma seemed certain to reject Stepashin earlier last week,
Communist advisers said on Friday and Saturday that they hoped the
Duma would approve the nomination, if only to provide some
continuity in the government.

SPITZER THREATENS SUBPOENA ON FRISK DATA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer on Saturday
threatened to subpoena thousands of documents in his inquiry into
whether the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk
procedures systematically violated the civil rights of minority
residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Saturday afternoon,
Spitzer said that the city had suddenly refused Friday to
voluntarily hand over the records, after having agreed to do so for
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely essential for restoring confidence in law
enforcement that the concerns raised about potential abuses of stop
and frisk be addressed quickly,'' he said in an interview shortly
after sending the letter, ``and we will use all legal remedies,
subpoenas, litigation, to make this come about.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``For the mayor to have gone through eight weeks of
deceit like this is wrong and begs the question of what the mayor
is trying to keep from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's corporation counsel, Michael Hess, responded in a
written statement, arguing that Spitzer's investigation was
redundant and that the attorney general had both ``overstated the
uniqueness of his investigation'' and ``stepped into this matter
belatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The escalation in words comes as the Giuliani administration
finds itself under increasing pressure from a variety of law
enforcement and government organizations intent on uncovering any
abuse of authority by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The stop and frisk procedure is intended to protect officers by
allowing them to pat down suspects for weapons before questioning
them on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have charged that it has become an excuse for
officers who are trying to make drug or weapon arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations by the state attorney general, federal
prosecutors and the City Council, as well as a class-action lawsuit
seeking to shut down the department's elite Street Crime Unit,
followed the shooting death of Amadou Diallo at the hands of four
street crime officers on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   That incident raised questions about the department's policy for
approaching and searching people on the street. According to the
1968 Supreme Court decision, Terry vs. Ohio, that gave way to the
procedure, the police can pat down a suspect for weapons when the
police ``reasonably'' believe that a suspect is armed and that
criminal activity is taking place. While allowing broad latitude
for such searches, the department's Patrol Guide instructs officers
to search for weapons only ``if you reasonably suspect you or
others are in danger of physical injury.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police officials, a preliminary analysis of reports
filed last year in more than 20 precincts where the Street Crime
Unit has been active shows that 63 percent of all people frisked
were black. The analysis also found that 71 percent of all crime
suspects were described by victims as black, and 68 percent of all
arrests in those precincts were of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit's 360 officers _ more than 80 percent of
whom are white _ searched 45,000 people in 1997 and 1998, and made
9,500 arrests, according to the Police Department. Spitzer is
seeking records for all such searches in the city during these
years.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that he also believed that many officers do not
always fill out a required form, called a UF250, and this has been
acknowledged privately by police officers and prosecutors. Spitzer
said that conversations with officers have led him to believe the
form is filled out in only one of every five stops.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of accusing the department of systematic abuse in
this area, the attorney general said Saturday that the city was
making any impartial investigation impossible by refusing to hand
over evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is demanding and has the right to know both the
policies and the realities of the NYPD's stop-and-frisk
practices,'' Spitzer said. ``The city's refusal to cooperate with
our investigation is an affront to every one of its residents.''

C. EARL LESLIE, 91, HAND-LETTERING ARTIST FOR PRESIDENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Colo., Fla., Va.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Earl Leslie, a retired White House artist whose decorative
lettering embellished thousands of government documents and
proclamations issued by Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and
Eisenhower, died May 6 at Washington House, a retirement home in
Alexandria, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who rose to the post of assistant chief of the White
House social office, was officially called an engrosser, a
practitioner of a formal type of calligraphy that mostly uses gold
leaf and watercolor.
</P>
<P>
   He preferred the title engrosser, and was rankled when someone
called him a calligrapher. ``His distaste for the term stems from
when it started to get popular, and anyone who could do some fancy
curlicues with their letters started calling themselves a
calligrapher,'' said his daughter, Carroll Leslie Bastian of Falls
Church, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Aug. 24, 1907, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the son of
a well-known engrosser and penmanship expert, Scott Earl Leslie.
The younger Leslie mastered the art early in life, first earning
money for his hand lettering when he was only 12. While he was a
teen-ager, he joined his father in his studio in Cleveland, where
the family had moved.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, Leslie was a science buff and, Ms. Bastian said,
at one point in the 1920s he held the world speed record for the
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to attend the Colorado School of Mines, in
Golden, Colo., to study chemistry, but his father was injured in a
train crash, and he stayed home to keep the family business
running.
</P>
<P>
   After Leslie won a national hand-lettering contest, however, he
moved to Washington in 1932, taking a job at the Interior
Department. He moved to the White House in 1935 and except for
military service in Army Intelligence in World War II, he stayed
there until 1960, when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   In his time at the White House, he had engrossing projects
ranging from creating the proclamation of Germany's surrender in
World War II to drafting place-seating cards for state dinners. His
duties also included making protocol arrangements for social
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he used his precision talents in less tedious
assignments. The Secret Service, Ms. Bastian said, sometimes used
him as a handwriting expert, and Roosevelt once asked him for a
code with which to communicate with British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the White House, Leslie worked independently
for two decades, crafting a variety of documents for schools,
churches and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He wife, Ann Carroll, died in 1984. Besides his daughter, he is
survived by a brother, Elwin Leslie of Ouray, Colo.; a sister, Vera
McDonald, of Miami, and a granddaughter.

pitch batting practice much anymore and his team barely has a
winning record. But this has been a special season for Luis Tiant,
the former Boston Red Sox pitching hero from Cuba who won 229
major-league games. The second-year baseball coach at Savannah
College of Art and Design has been reunited with his son, who quit
his job in Miami to work as his father's assistant. ``Family is
everything,'' the elder Tiant said. ``It is even more important
than baseball.'' (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

DR. IAN FRASER, 98, WARTIME PIONEER OF PENICILLIN USE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Ian Fraser, a British surgeon whose medical team took
penicillin to the wounded on the battlefields of World War II and
established that it effectively checked their blood infections,
died May 11. He was 98 and lived in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser was a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps in West
Africa in 1941 when it sent him to Algiers to direct tests of what
was then a new and largely untested drug, penicillin. Early results
were disappointing. But working in a large hospital with patients
suffering from septicemia, he became convinced that it could be
effective if administered early _ before the disorder advanced and
became a killer.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted on a chance to test the new drug on the front lines,
to be applied directly as casualties came in. With special
dispensation from the War Office in London he received advance
notice of military operations so he could be there to treat the
wounded on the spot. Thus, he played a role in the early successes,
which eventually saved untold lives.
</P>
<P>
   A colonel, and eventually brigadier, Fraser left North Africa
aboard a hospital ship to care for the wounded from the beaches of
Sicily. Operating surrounded by bombardments and heavy shelling, he
earned a Distinguished Service Order and went on with the troops to
the beachhead at Salerno, the invasion of France and the Indian
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a general practitioner, he was born in Belfast and
was educated there at the Royal Academical Institution and Queen's
University, graduating in medicine and surgery. He trained under
doctors who knew the horrors of the trenches and battlefields of
France, and much later he described their make-do techniques in his
autobiography, ``Blood, Sweat and Cheers'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   He received a surgical appointment at Belfast Hospital for Sick
Children, but he volunteered for service as soon as war broke out
in Europe once again in 1939. In 1946 he resumed his career as a
surgeon and teacher in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1966 as the senior surgeon at Royal Victoria
Hospital in Belfast and Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children.
In the 1970s he served as founding chairman of the Police Authority
in Northern Ireland and, from then until 1992, he remained a
founding member of the Ulster Defense Regiment Advisory Council _
positions that made him a potential target of terrorism in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army bombed a house close to his in March
1976, and the assumption was at the time that he was the real
target because of his association with the Ulster forces. Army
demolition experts defused another large bomb near his home toward
the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   He lectured throughout Britain and in the United States. Among
his many awards were the French Legion of Honor and decorations
from Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's wife, Eleanor Mitchell Fraser, died in 1992. His
survivors include a son and a daughter.

ABORTION REFERRAL GROUP SUES OVER REJECTED ADS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Wash., Washington, D.C., Calif. Ohio, Ill. and Ga.)   By TOM LASSITER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's mass transit system, which accepts
advertising from a local church-financed agency that promotes
adoptions over abortions, has refused advertisements by a national
organization that refers clients to abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion rights group, the National Abortion Federation, has
sued in response, contending that the decision, by the Metropolitan
Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, violates the federation's First
Amendment right to free speech and 14th Amendment right to due
process.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA has regulations that forbid advertising it deems
controversial. In a letter explaining its decision, its advertising
representative, Transportation Displays Inc., suggested that a
message supporting abortion rights fit that category and would
offend some Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, as we are in the `Bible Belt,' MARTA cannot
accept advertising on subjects of controversy,'' Lisa Michaelson, a
Transportation Displays vice president, wrote in the letter to the
abortion federation.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA has until 5 p.m. Monday to file a response to the
federation's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements at issue, which would have been displayed
inside Atlanta buses, sprang from a new campaign by the National
Abortion Federation, based in Washington. They were aimed in part
at discouraging harassment of abortion patients and violence
against abortion providers, and they have been accepted by transit
systems in seven cities: Miami, Washington, Seattle, San Francisco,
Cleveland, Chicago and New York. Only in Atlanta have they been
turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The federation's lawsuit, filed April 27 in the U.S. District
Court in Atlanta, turns centrally on its assertion that MARTA, a
government agency, has created a constitutionally protected public
forum in its advertising practices, accepting advertisements
dealing with a variety of public issues like the dangers of HIV and
of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The suit cites a total of five decisions by four federal appeals
courts to the effect that in a designated public forum, the state
may not exclude speech that it considers controversial,
particularly if it has a history of permitting other speech that
could be deemed controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have defined the contours of a public forum, and we
think this case fits in them,'' said Lynn Bregman of the Washington
law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, who is serving as counsel
for the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Coenen, a professor specializing in constitutional law at
the University of Georgia, agreed that the question of
discrimination against a certain viewpoint was crucial to such a
case. Coenen cited a 1974 Supreme Court decision, Lehman vs. Shaker
Heights, in which the Justices ruled, 5-4, that a municipal bus
system could decline to run political advertisements only if it
prohibited all such advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of precedent is a contentious one.
</P>
<P>
   MARTA's chief counsel, Mike Sloan, said the suit's arguments
could be countered by a 1998 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. In that case, Children of the Rosary vs.
City of Phoenix, retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White,
sitting by special designation and writing for the appeals court,
said that the city's bus advertising panels were not necessarily a
public forum and that the city had an interest in maintaining
neutrality on contentious political and religious issues and in
preserving an environment attractive to commercial advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to carrying warnings on the dangers of HIV and
gambling, MARTA runs advertisements for the Atlanta Care Center, an
agency listed in the phone book under ``Abortion Alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnant? Worried? We Care,'' these advertisements say, and
offer a phone number for those interested in pregnancy testing or
counseling. The center, which promotes adoptions as an alternative
to abortion, is financed mainly by an interdenominational coalition
of churches.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan acknowledges that the center is anti-abortion but says
that its advertising campaign offers a service _ counseling _ and
that the National Abortion Federation's advertisements are of a
more political nature.

   CHINO HILLS, Calif. _ The home-buying experience of Kevin and
Danniele Flora in this community 35 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles may be a bellwether of current trends in home building,
especially in the first-time home-buyer market.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Flora, 30, is an account executive for a computer company,
and his wife, 28, is an account executive for a clothing
manufacturer. In August 1998 they committed to buying a house,
their first, in Ridgeview, a subdivision of more-or-less
conventional single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   What was unconventional was the degree of control that the young
home buyers exercised over the design of the house and such things
as types of floors and fixtures, which in new construction is
usually given only to buyers of more-expensive move-up housing. The
Floras paid about $230,990 for a house with 2,141 square feet of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Before the house was built, the couple selected one of about a
dozen floor plans, with an extra-large kitchen and master bedroom,
all included in the basic package priced at $220,990. But because
the Floras opted for such things as a brick-and-vinyl facade and
special bathroom fixtures not included in the options, they had to
pay an extra $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Floras were even encouraged to visit the home under
construction, and were given a camera to document its progress by
the home builder, Kaufman &AMP; Broad Greater Los Angeles Division, a
unit of Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp., both based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We added our own touches,'' said Kevin Flora. ``It felt almost
like a total custom home.'' The couple moved into the house last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The Floras' experience in buying a home in the Ridgeview
development exemplifies the strategy Kaufman &AMP; Broad has been
pursuing in the last four years to maintain a hold on the
first-time-buyer market.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy is driven, in large part, by consumer-preference
surveys, conducted among buyers of both new and used homes in each
of the company's 16 market areas. Such surveys are common in many
industries, but not in home building, according to Bruce Karatz,
the company's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While the company builds homes in several price ranges, Kaufman
&AMP; Broad is particularly interested in following the tastes of the
youngest segment of buyers aged 24 to 34, which it calls ``baby
zoomers.'' The name hints at the professional ambition,
fast-growing income and high material expectations of many people
in that age group.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys found a desire for greater choice among first-time
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   With the current strong economy and low unemployment ``people
don't feel boxed in, they have lots of choices,'' Karatz explained.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers ``want it their way,'' added Jeffrey Charney, the
company's senior vice president of marketing. ``They don't want a
cookie-cutter house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also showed that many buyers value practicality over
display, according to Glen Barnard, a senior vice president who is
regional general manager of the company's Denver office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation may be less interested in glitz and more
interested in functionality,'' he said. The current generation, he
added, are ``more utilitarian than other generations.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend corresponds to a ``back-to-the-basics'' theme in both
car design and volume-discount retailing, according to Barnard.
</P>
<P>
   One response to the desire for choice was to offer up to 12
floor plans, each of which allows further permutations. Previously,
Kaufman &AMP; Broad offered two or three floor plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers opt for nontraditional features not often found in
tract housing, such as media centers, sleeping lofts, Jacuzzi
bathtubs, or kitchen islands.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the surveys revealed that buyers in the 24-to-34 age
group were interested in buying enough space for growing families,
and something more luxurious than the traditional image of a
starter home.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after amenity, it turned out, was size,
according to Barnard. ``In every market that we have surveyed, the
single most important factor, beyond just being able to buy a
house, is getting the most square footage for the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That trend, he observed, is a ``reversal from the '80s, when
people wanted upscale amenities,'' such as cathedral ceilings, bay
windows, marble-floor entries, chandeliers and other symbols of
affluence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maximizing space was a deciding factor for Benjamin Jackson, 30,
an emergency-response social worker, and his 30-year-old wife,
Charlotte, a tax auditor for the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jacksons, who have two children, had originally
looked at existing houses near their place of work in neighboring
Orange County, ``I was looking for as much space as I could
possibly get for the money,'' said Jackson, who said he liked to
retreat to ``a little corner of the house'' after stressful days at
work. ``This space allows me to do that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The three most important places to add space in developments
like Ridgeview with larger than usual starter homes, according to
Barnard, are kitchens, master bedrooms and storage areas,
particularly closets.
</P>
<P>
   Often home buyers are willing to ``trade off'' or live without
other home features to maximize the size of those amenities,
Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, buyers are often willing to accept smaller garages
or fewer bathrooms. They will settle for smaller living rooms, or
for consolidating the dining room and living room into a single
``great room.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also have a choice of facades. ``If somebody is an
achiever and wants his or her house to make a statement, we've got
the elevation that allows them to do that,'' Barnard said. On the
other hand, he added, if people with ``inner-directed values and
lifestyle prefer that a house does not make a statement, we've got
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the surveys, Kaufman &AMP; Broad executives sensed that
current home buyers were often experienced consumers and wanted to
make home buying more of what Karatz calls ``a retail experience.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize that ``retail experience,'' Kaufman &AMP; Broad has
created large showrooms, sometimes as large as 20,000 square feet,
in most of its major markets, where prospective home buyers can
select fixtures, paint colors and such things as carpets, tile,
cabinet styles, bathtubs and fireplaces for their future houses.
</P>
<P>
   The showrooms are intended to make home buying into something
more like shopping, to make buyers feel more comfortable, more ``in
control'' during the often intimidating process of making a
six-figure purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take the mystery and anxiety out the home
purchase,'' Karatz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Floras, for example, opted for a carpet with extra padding
to extend the life of the carpet, as well as tile, ceiling fans,
his-and-her bathroom sinks and windows for the garage door.
</P>
<P>
   For Karatz, the good reception of Kaufman &AMP; Broad's recent
developments may augur some changes for the home-building industry
away from the cookie-cutter sameness that has typified American
home building since Levittown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the assembly line,'' he said. ``We are going to
build 22,000 homes this year, one at a time.''

   BUCHANAN, N.Y. _ All the fuel that the Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor has ever used since its first chain reaction 26 years ago
is here at the bottom of a 40-foot-deep pool about the size of a
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Plant engineers say the pool, its water made to appear a
Ty-D-Bol blue by the boron that smothers further nuclear reactions,
is very safe and very clean. But it is also nearly full. Within a
few years, the plant will run out of space to store the radioactive
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the spent fuel and the plant itself is very much
up in the air, caught in a tangle of questions about the economics
of nuclear power, the deregulation of the energy industry and the
environmental safety of nuclear waste disposal. And the uncertainty
has left some neighbors of the plant, 35 miles north of Manhattan,
deeply uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and others who have long opposed the plant
would like nothing more than to see it shut down forever. But under
one possible outcome, they could end up living next to both an
operating nuclear reactor and a nuclear waste storage site. (A
near-twin of the reactor, Indian Point 3, is operated by the New
York Power Authority. But it is younger and has a bigger pool for
spent fuel, so it faces no immediate crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   The plant's owner, Consolidated Edison, says it would like to
send the spent fuel more than 2,000 miles west to a proposed
storage site near Salt Lake City, but that plan has run into fierce
opposition in Utah. The alternative is to keep the spent fuel at
the plant here, encasing it in giant sealed containers made of
steel and concrete, a process known as dry-cask storage.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture is the possibility that Con Ed
may not be allowed to own Indian Point 2 much longer. Under state
energy deregulation rules, the utility has already sold most of its
non-nuclear generating plants, and it is awaiting a decision from
state regulators on whether it will have to sell the reactor here,
too.
</P>
<P>
   If Con Ed keeps Indian Point 2, it could apply for permission to
extend the plant's operating license and to build dry-storage casks
for its spent nuclear fuel. That would require public hearings and
approval from the state's Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   If a private company bought the plant, it would probably have
fewer hurdles to clear to keep the reactor going. And some of
Indian Point 2's neighbors, realizing that the plant could keep
running for decades with even more radioactive fuel kept at the
site, find this possibility extremely disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't think we should do on-site cask storage in
order to allow it to continue to operate,'' said Mark Jacobs,
director of the Westchester People's Action Coalition, a nonprofit
group that opposes Indian Point 2. ``It should be very clear if we
do not know what to do with the nuclear waste, we should stop
producing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the salad days of nuclear power, the 1960s, the federal
government had grand plans for the nation's spent nuclear fuel. A
commercial plant, the first of several planned, was built near
Buffalo to reprocess uranium and plutonium for reuse in reactors.
But virgin uranium turned out to be cheaper, and President Jimmy
Carter, concerned that the spent fuel could be turned into nuclear
weapons, banned the process.
</P>
<P>
   Then the government promised that by 1998, it would have a place
to bury the waste permanently. But now, the Energy Department is
saying that site will not be ready for at least 11 years. So scores
of nuclear plants around the country will soon find that they, too,
have run out of room to store spent fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Several plants have already put their fuel into dry-cask
storage. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission routinely approves such
a step, but state public utility commissions can veto cask
construction if they think the expenditure is unwise.
</P>
<P>
   And opponents of nuclear power have used political pressure to
prevent dry-storage casks from being built at some sites, hoping
that this pressure will force the plants to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But then deregulation came to the energy industry. New York and
about a dozen other states are encouraging private companies to
provide electricity, hoping that the competition will mean lower
prices for consumers. Those states are either forcing utilities to
sell their generating plants or are considering doing so. Nuclear
plants are not the easiest properties to sell. But while it costs
more to generate nuclear power than it does to generate electricity
from water, gas or coal, a private company that can buy a reactor
cheaply enough can still be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point 2 could flourish in a deregulated market, said Neil
Carns, senior vice president for nuclear operations at Con Ed. He
said he could foresee keeping the plant open 20 years beyond 2013,
when its current license expires.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep the plant running, Indian Point 2 needs more storage
space for spent fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a major point of vulnerability for Con Ed,''
said Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Energy Project at
Pace University Law School in White Plains, ``if they have no place
to take the fuel and they have significant local opposition to
siting a dry-storage facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts, including Smeloff, say dry storage can be safer
than storage in pools, because fuel can corrode in water and pools
can leak. Smeloff was the head of the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District in California when its reactor was shut down, and he
supervised the construction of such casks.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists favor storing spent nuclear fuel on
reactor sites because shipping the waste creates even more hazards,
they say. And many environmentalists are opposed to an agreement
Con Ed and other utilities signed with the Goshute Indians to rent
storage space on their reservation west of Salt Lake City, calling
it environmental racism. In any case, the Utah deal may never come
to pass because of opposition from officials there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Con Ed signed a contract with the Energy Department,
which promised to begin accepting fuel for burial by 1998 in
exchange for payment of a 1/10 of a cent per kilowatt-hour that
Indian Point generated over its lifetime. Con Ed has paid $117.5
million, but the Energy Department has not yet determined whether
the site, Yucca Mountain near Las Vegas, is suitable, and now says
that it will not be ready until 2010 at the earliest. Con Ed has
sued to be relieved of future payments, and a resolution is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fuel stays in this village of about 2,000 people
on the east bank of the Hudson River. The pool has 1,374 holes for
storing the spent nuclear assemblies vertically, and 917 are
filled, making the grid look like a giant game of tic-tack-toe that
is coming to an end. By 2005, Con Ed will have to move some of the
assemblies out or close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice but to bet on every horse in the race,''
said John Sanchez, the project manager for high-level waste at Con
Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes all the horses. ``We don't want these big
concrete things,'' said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for
Westchester County Executive Andrew Spano. ``We want it out of
there; that's the bottom line. We don't want the construction of
these things to hold this nuclear waste.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, though, what leverage the county has. Con Ed
would need a permit from the village of Buchanan to build
dry-storage casks, and the village has made it clear that its main
concern is to keep its jobs and its tax base steady.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County would like that, too, said Martin Rogowski,
chairman of the county's Public Utility Service Agency. But
Rogowski, who formerly worked at the Energy Department on nuclear
waste problems, expressed some uneasiness about the dry-storage
idea. ``You never know. How good are these casks?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rasmussen, Con Ed's assistant controller, said building
enough dry casks to make space in the pool for an additional
two-year fueling cycle would cost about $3 million, an increase of
about 2 percent in the plant's operating and capital expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the fuel sits in a room certified as safe from
earthquakes and hurricanes. The water is a steady 97 degrees,
warmed by the radioactive decay and cooled by a whining set of
pumps. A white bathtub ring has built up from the boron. Bubbles,
created for the most part by air pulled in by the cooling pumps,
wobble their way to the surface occasionally. The radiation levels
on the walkway surrounding the pool are minuscule, the utility
says.
</P>
<P>
   Four times a day, a technician checks the pool for changes, but
there are rarely any, said Denis Cornax, a watch engineer. Every
few days, a worker checks the water chemistry to insure that there
are no chlorides or other rust-inducing chemicals present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cleaner water than you have in your house,'' he said.

FIRST LADY'S PERKS MAY BE PITFALLS IN RACE FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Friday morning, an Air Force jet carrying Hillary
Rodham Clinton left Andrews Air Force Base for Buffalo, N.Y., where
a motorcade assembled by the Secret Service took her to a
fund-raiser for a Democratic congressman. From there, it was on to
an AFL-CIO forum jammed with cheering women, where Mrs. Clinton
spent an hour discussing the Democratic issues with which she has
identified herself in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone considering a run for senator from New York, a
category that includes Mrs. Clinton, it could not have been a
better day. The first lady lent her name to the state Democratic
Party and to a powerful labor union. In a room packed with
television cameras, she addressed an audience of potentially
crucial voters _ women _ about the very issues that she is likely
to embrace should she run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, it did not cost Mrs. Clinton a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trip was paid for by taxpayers because, Mrs.
Clinton's aides said, the AFL-CIO forum was an official first lady
event, no matter what political benefits it might have provided.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needed evidence of the advantages that will accrue to
Mrs. Clinton if she runs for Senate, there was no better place to
look than Buffalo during her recent visit, one of eight the first
lady has paid to New York this year. Her position as first lady is
one of many reasons Democrats are so enthused at the prospect of a
Clinton candidacy. They are increasingly convinced that she will
run, and expect her to signal her decision when she returns from a
family vacation in Florida in early June.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mrs. Clinton's advisers contemplate the unprecedented
event of a sitting first lady running for office, they are
beginning to realize that there are pitfalls as well as advantages
inherent in Mrs. Clinton's status.
</P>
<P>
   From the daily encumbrances of her security, to the conflicts
with her duties as first lady, to the vexing logistics of trying to
run for office 300 miles from the white house she calls home, Mrs.
Clinton's biggest electoral asset could very well throw more than a
few wrenches into any attempt at embarking on this new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that she is Hillary Clinton is her biggest
advantage,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant based in
New York. ``And the fact that she is Hillary Clinton is her biggest
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are certainly considerable, and not all of them are
immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Most obvious, the government will pay for a lot of her travel to
New York, and the bills are substantial. It costs $836 an hour to
operate one of the C-9s Mrs. Clinton tends to fly, in addition to
the costs of the motorcade and hotel rooms. Mrs. Clinton travels
with a trip director, an issues adviser, a White House photographer
and a press secretary, all of whom are on the White House payroll
and whose travel expenses are also covered.
</P>
<P>
   If she does makes any unambiguously political appearances, like
appearing at a congressional fund-raiser, then a percentage of the
travel costs, apart from security, are billed to the political
sponsor of the event. The rest, though, is paid by the White House,
at least until she declares her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton can also expect to benefit, in a less obvious way,
from the motorcades and Secret Service agents that shepherd her
around the state: The trappings of the White House provide an
immediate stature before she steps out of her car. And that Secret
Service, as Mrs. Clinton's husband well knows, can provide an
additional advantage _ a cordon that keeps a distance between her
and the reporters who may try to shout questions. Mrs. Clinton has
taken reporters' questions only once during her visits to New York.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there is arguably a downside to nearly every one
of these benefits. Already, aides to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the
Republican who is also thinking about running for the Senate, are
questioning why taxpayers should pay for her visits to New York.
Giuliani's aides said the mayor would make an issue of Mrs.
Clinton's reliance on federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign finance chairman, John Gross, strongly
suggested that the Giuliani campaign would push Mrs. Clinton to
reimburse the cost of her travel so far, should she enter the race.
``Given the fact that she's testing the waters, an argument could
be made that her trip to Buffalo, and for that matter all her trips
to New York, should eventually be charged to her campaign,'' Gross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her trips are beginning to draw criticism from nonpartisan
quarters as well. Charles Lewis, the executive director of the
Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group, said that if Mrs.
Clinton entered the race, her trips to date would clearly cross the
line between a first lady's duties and a candidate's campaigning,
and would raise questions about reimbursements. ``The issue is, how
much is it costing the taxpayer for this person to seek office?''
Lewis said. ``And should the taxpayer be paying for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers have responded to this criticism by
saying that she has not declared that she is running for office,
and thus does not have an exploratory committee in place that would
permit her to raise money to reimburse the government. (Under
federal policy, she would have to pay the government first-class
air fare for her seat on the C-9 to New York for trips that were
deemed political; her staff would be charged coach rates.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not a candidate,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's
spokeswoman. Referring to Mrs. Clinton's events in New York, Ms.
Berry said. ``If you look back at what she has done as first lady,
this is exactly what she does.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, a Harlem Democrat who is one of Mrs.
Clinton's biggest supporters, said the first lady was doing nothing
different from what incumbent politicians have done in running for
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long a member of Congress can go without
paying for trips,'' Rangel said. ``I don't know how long a mayor
can go without paying for trips. I don't know how long a vice
president can go without paying for trips.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said his upstate travel was paid for by his
political committees. And the fact that Mrs. Clinton has moved up
the date by which she intends to signal her intentions, from late
summer to June, suggests concern about such questions.
</P>
<P>
   The logistic difficulties of a campaign by someone of Mrs.
Clinton's stature were described by many New York Democrats as
daunting, though not insurmountable. In last year's New York race
for the Senate, for example, advisers to Charles Schumer, the
Democratic winner, typically did not decide how Schumer would spend
his next day _ from what he would say to where he would go _ until
the very last minute, to accommodate the changing demands of a
fast-moving campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a problem for Mrs. Clinton. Secret Service agents
arrive at least a day before the first lady to inspect places she
plans to visit, and they seal off the site before she arrives.
There is no such thing as hopping into a car or a plane for a quick
news conference on the issue of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big state, with a lot of territory to cover,''
Sheinkopf said. ``You can't get away without going to Utica. You
have got to go to Buffalo. Moving her around _ with all the
problems that a first lady has to worry about _can be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be an additional complication because one of the
things Mrs. Clinton needs to do in the months ahead, her advisers
say, is get a feel for both New York, where she has never lived,
and civilian life outside the White House. ``Has she ever been to a
movie in New York?'' one Democrat asked, outlining the kind of
real-life tutorial she should ideally undergo before meeting
voters. ``Has she ever bought a loaf of bread in New York? Has she
ever walked down a street? That's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The press office of the Secret Service did not return calls
seeking comment on a potential Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is likely to take an apartment in New York City to
establish a presence, not to mention a residence, her advisers
said. But she remains first lady through the end of 2000, and will
be under pressure to return to the White House to tend to duties
like state dinners. Mrs. Clinton's advisers are contemplating the
fact that she could come under attack in other parts of the country
if there is a perception that she is neglecting the White House for
her own political pursuits.

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEVER GENE SARAZEN'S CENTURY OF PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day Gene Sarazen died, Tiger Woods shot 61 in the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic. To anyone who remembered a conversation at
the 1996 Masters, it was as much a connection as a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Eldrick (Tiger) Woods was a two-time U.S. Amateur
champion, a 20-year-old golf phenom who would win another Amateur
title that summer and the Masters a year later. And after hitting a
ceremonial tee shot at that 1996 Masters, Sarazen, then 94 and
wearing his plus fours, was answering questions on the Augusta
National clubhouse porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering Tiger's age,'' somebody asked, ``how would you
rate him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Sarazen said, ``when I was 20, I won the U.S. Open and
the PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen wasn't bragging; he was just reminding his listeners
that golf has had other phenoms and he was one of them. It's called
perspective. And as someone who spanned the 20th century before
dying Thursday at 97 of complications of pneumonia, his perspective
on golf was unique.
</P>
<P>
   He will always be remembered for his double-eagle 2 with a
4-wood at the par-5 15th hole that put the Masters on the golf map
in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time in Hong Kong, someone introduced me as `Mr. Double
Eagle,''' he once said with a laugh. ``They must have thought I was
an Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   But the feisty little man born Eugenio Saraceni in Harrison,
N.Y., the son of an immigrant Italian carpenter, hit many other
important shots in winning seven major titles _ the 1922, 1923 and
1933 Professional Golfers' Association Championships, the 1922 and
1932 U.S. Opens, the 1932 British Open and that 1935 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first to win all four major titles; Ben Hogan, Jack
Nicklaus and Gary Player are the only others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best shot I ever hit,'' Sarazen once said, ``was in
the 1931 Ryder Cup at Scioto. On this short hole, I hooked my tee
shot over the green into a refreshment stand. I found my ball in
the middle of the stand in a crevice in the concrete. No free drops
back then, but a window toward the green was open. I played the
ball through the window and onto the green about eight feet from
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen made his putt for a par. When his opponent, Fred Robson,
three-putted, Sarazen won the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robson laughed and said, `That was a nice throw,''' Sarazen
recalled. ``I said: `That was no throw. I played the shot out of
there.' He lost the next five holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen said golf was more cutthroat back in the 190s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tell anyone anything,'' he recalled. ``If the green
was fast, we hoped they wouldn't find out until it had cost them
some strokes. And the only thing we hoped about the other fellow
was he'd break both legs. That sort of spirit made golf.''
</P>
<P>
   His ingenuity made the sand wedge, which made golf a little
easier for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up with Howard Hughes in his airplane and he told me,
`Gene, pull back on that stick,''' Sarazen once said. ``And it
flashed into my mind that some weight on the back of a niblick
could make a club and a ball bounce out of the sand the same way
that plane bounced into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else, Sarazen could assess the century's best
golfers because he saw and played with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even played with Harry Vardon,'' he once said, referring to
the six-time British Open winner of a century ago. ``It was at the
1923 North British at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. On the first
hole, a par 3, the wind was coming from the left. Vardon floated a
baffy in there about 10 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 1-iron, a low, boring ball that stayed left despite
the wind and wound up in a bunker. Walking off the tee I remember
saying, `I can't understand how the wind didn't take that ball,'
and I heard Vardon say, `The way you hit it, the wind had nothing
to do with it.' I took that as good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1982 article for Golf Digest magazine, Sarazen, then 80,
rated the century's top 10 golfers, men and women:
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus; 2. Bobby Jones; 3. Ben Hogan; 4. Walter Hagen;
5. Harry Vardon; 6. Gary Player; 7. Sam Snead; 8. Arnold Palmer; 9.
Lee Trevino; 10. (tie) Byron Nelson and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   1. Joyce Wethered; 2. Glenna Collett Vare; 3. Mickey Wright; 4.
Kathy Whitworth; 5. Betsy Rawls; 6. Louise Suggs; 7. Babe Didrikson
Zaharias; 8. JoAnne Carner; 9. Donna Caponi; 10. Patty Berg.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sarazen wasn't sure if Nancy Lopez's swing would
hold up, but if he had selected a women's top 10 in recent years,
she would probably have been in it. The men's top 10 would probably
be unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In judging golfers on longevity and the ability to win majors,
he called Nicklaus ``a far greater player'' than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever had Jack's power and his putting touch,'' Sarazen
said. ``And he's had to play in the major championships before the
TV cameras with the lead at stake. In the years long before
television, Jones usually teed off early and established a score
for everybody else to shoot at.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Gene Sarazen didn't rank himself, saying, ``My wife,
Mary, told me I can't.'' But privately, he confided, ``I'd be
somewhere around eighth, ninth or 10th.'' That's about the proper
perspective. After all, when he was 20, he won both the United
States Open and the PGA. &QL;

TONY TARASCO'S AGENDA: GANG LIFE TO YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ Tony Tarasco is speaking so quickly and
expressively about his love of baseball, the lure of gangs and the
legend of Jeffrey Maier that he gags on his own cigarette smoke
just to continue talking. This happens three different times as he
drags on one Marlboro, but it would be foolish to interrupt.
Tarasco has too much to say.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is pelting the seats at the rickety minor league ball park
here, but Tarasco, an outfielder for the Class AAA Columbus
Clippers, does not care. He is too engrossed in a conversation that
he turns into a dialogue. For Tarasco, there is always something
intriguing to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Like how he belonged to the Santa Monica Graveyard Crips gang
while growing up in California. How he has honored the memory of
his slain best friend and fellow gang member with two tattoos on
his thick body. How he now can laugh at questions regarding Maier
robbing a fly ball from him and helping the New York Yankees swipe
a post-season game from the Orioles three years ago. How he has
been the premier hitter for the Yankees' top minor league affiliate
and could return to Yankee Stadium in a much more enviable capacity
than as Maier's foil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing well and I know someone is watching; if George
Steinbrenner calls me,'' Tarasco said of the Yankee owner, ``I'll
get the job done. I'm not going to tell you it's a lifelong dream
to play for the Yankees. I want a ring, I want to make some cash
and I want to have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tarasco had uttered these words on March 26, when the Yankees
signed him as a minor league free agent, they would have sounded
ludicrous. At that time, the Yankees had Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee
and Shane Spencer sparring in left field and a rehabilitating
Darryl Strawberry lurking as a possibility, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry was arrested on charges of cocaine possession and
solicitation of a prostitute, Spencer was sent to Columbus, Ledee
and Curtis sputtered in their auditions and Spencer and Ledee have
now traded places.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco, the insurance policy, is hitting .364 with 7 home runs
and 25 runs batted in, and waiting patiently. Considering that he
almost retired two months ago, Tarasco's rapid ascension has
surprised even him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told God one night I was going to walk away if something
didn't happen,'' the 28-year-old Tarasco said. ``I said my prayers
and went to sleep. The next day my agent woke me and told me I had
a job with the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Tarasco is smiling, the wisp of black hair below his lower
lip getting wider. Tarasco, who was born in Manhattan and lived in
the Bronx until he was 7, said his father, Jack, was a vendor at
Yankee Stadium, so his new job was definitely a sign. ``I knew God
was telling me something by putting me with the Yankees,'' he said.
``He wasn't finished with me.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman said the Yankees ``jumped'' on
Tarasco, a .241 career hitter in the majors, after Kansas City
released him this spring. He can play three outfield positions, has
solid power, good speed, a decent arm and post-season experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much aware of him because of his performance and
the way that he's gone about his business,'' Cashman said. ``I'm
not saying he's moved ahead of anybody on the depth chart, but he's
on the depth chart now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco's demeanor is an unusual mixture of bravado and
politeness. He will tell a visitor a story about how he once missed
a drive-by shooting at a fast-food restaurant because he was in the
bathroom in the same casual tone that he uses to discuss the
intricacies of his sturdy left-handed swing. He will tell you how
his neighborhood was on the cusp of South Central Los Angeles and
that this made it inevitable for a 13-year-old to join a gang, and
then he will elaborate on his passion for writing.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Tarasco the baseball player has separated himself
from the gang scene in Santa Monica, where he said six of his
friends were killed, he conceded that home is still home. Tarasco
is nicknamed ``Baby Jacc'' after his father. Tarasco spells it with
a c instead of a k because he said ``hood language'' does not allow
the k to be used in certain words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a soldier in the gang,'' said Tarasco. ``Soldiers
do everything. I was into the hustle so I could make a few bucks
and dress nice for the girls. I was never into the raw dog, dirty
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One glance at Tarasco's left forearm is all that it takes to
begin to understand the world where he has lived. Tarasco has a
tattoo he designed of a blue cartoon figure with baggy blue jeans
swinging a bat and bashing a baseball that bears a screaming face..
Home plate has C.P. and R.I.P. etched on it, in memory of Chris
Pickett, Tarasco's friend for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco said Pickett was killed by a Los Angeles police officer
on March 23, 1992, when the officer thought that Pickett was a
robbery suspect. He died on the spot, one day after his 22d
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened around the time of the Rodney King trial,''
Tarasco said. ``It was an unlawful shooting. There were
investigations. I went home for the funeral, but I couldn't stay
when they delayed it for an autopsy. That dragged me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett was one of the gang members who watched Tarasco play at
Santa Monica High School and told him to devote himself to baseball
instead of the Crips. Tarasco, who said he never committed a crime,
explained that his friends realized his talent might be wasted.
Forget about wearing the blue and quit the Crips, they told the
16-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So Tarasco did. He was drafted out of high school by the Braves
in the 15th round in 1988 and made it to the majors with them in
1993. He was traded to Montreal in 1995 and hit .249 with 14
homers, 40 runs batted in and 24 steals, the last time he spent a
full season in the majors. Baltimore obtained Tarasco in 1996,
which was mostly an injury-scarred season for him until that
fateful Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   With the Orioles leading the Yankees, 4-3, in the eighth inning
of the first game of the American League Championship Series,
Tarasco replaced Bobby Bonilla in right field in what was his third
appearance in five months. When Derek Jeter clubbed a high shot to
right, the 6-foot-1-inch, 205-pound Tarasco was poised to catch it
until the 12-year-old Maier leaned over the fence and helped pull
the ball into the seats. Umpire Richie Garcia ruled it a home run
instead of interference and Maier was lionized by the news media
after the Yankees won, 5-4. Tarasco never had nightmares about the
overzealous Maier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find me in a mental home with posters of
Jeffery Maier on the wall,'' said Tarasco. ``When I signed with the
Yankees, someone asked me why I did and I told them so that if
anyone wants to lean over and take the ball from me again, then
they'll land in the Hudson River. Had it been the other way around
and O'Neill was in right, they would have hated that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarasco, who refused numerous invitations to appear with Maier
after the wacky play, called it ``destiny'' for the Yankees and
claimed that the notoriety has enabled him to secure tables in New
York restaurants without reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could have done differently,'' Tarasco
said. ``If I knew the kid was going to interfere, I would've
climbed the fence, grabbed him and then caught it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost time for the Class AAA game and Tarasco was
finishing up, actually saying that he is not obsessed with being
called up by the Yankees. He was briefly silenced when asked how he
would feel if he continues to produce snazzy statistics but remains
mired in the minors in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too far ahead,'' Tarasco finally said. ``You don't know
what might go bad for you and you don't know what might go good for
you. I just make myself ready and, when that door cracks open a
little, I jump through it. I'll be through and I'm not looking
back.'' &QL;

MAN BUILDS 24-SEAT THEATER IN HIS MANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Conn., N.J., N.Y., Ohio) (rk) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's too bad that Charles S. Cohen has to go to work. Or
anywhere, for that matter. Because underneath his 16-room mansion
in Greenwich, Conn., he has built a movie theater so evocative of
the past, with its plush red velvet seats and ornate moldings, that
emerging into the daylight, even on a spectacular spring day, is
annoying. Who wants to go out into the real world when the fantasy
has been so perfectly realized?
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters may not be popping up in every
multimillion-dollar house, but for people who have at least
$100,000 to spend on the technology, an approximation of quality
moviegoing can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen's movie theater was constructed several years ago
from a design by Theo Kalomirakis, he wants it to have the best
available video images, and so a few weeks ago he upgraded the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the videotape images in his theater are clearer, brighter
and more like film, which has a three-dimensional quality that
video doesn't quite match.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the match is close enough for an ordinary movie fan, and
the surroundings are familiar even if they were never experienced
in such a perfect, pristine form. The 24-seat theater was modeled
on the old Paramount in Times Square, and the brass handles on the
doors were taken from the original before its demolition. A
chandelier is from the old Centrum Theater in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a scene from ``A Bug's Life,'' it's easy to forget this
is a home. It feels like a glorious theater in a very rich city
where moments of rapture or pain or fun cannot be destroyed by
someone talking, chewing gum, cracking their knuckles, kicking the
back of the seat, answering a cell phone, or doing any of those
other annoying things that humans insist on doing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen is now president of his family's commercial real
estate business in Manhattan, Cohen Brothers Realty Corp., he
originally wanted to be a movie director, and as a student at Tufts
University he made a short film satirizing Bruce Lee that was shown
on a cable channel. But while his passion for movies is reflected
in the theater, it doesn't sound as if the life of a real estate
magnate leaves a lot of time for hanging out in the home theater.
</P>
<P>
   His subterranean palace is used most often when his two
children, who are 10 and 14, stay with him on the weekends when
they are not with their mother in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the lobby of the theater has bowls filled with candy
and a microwave for instant popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy of a ``real'' theater is sustained at every turn,
with icons meant to seduce.
</P>
<P>
   On descending the stairs into the space, built 30 feet
underground, the first sight is of a female ticket taker, a cloth
creation named Edna who sits in a glass booth. On the wall are some
of the theater posters that Cohen has collected, from movies like
``Vertigo'' and ``Sands of Iwo Jima.''
</P>
<P>
   Posters from more obscure films hang on the walls of his game
room and gymnasium, movies like ``Bad for Each Other,'' ``Never
Steal Anything Small,'' ``How to Be Very Very Popular'' and ``Babes
in Baghdad.'' The posters were less expensive than those for the
better known films.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all not-great movies,'' Cohen says, ``because
not-great movie posters are not in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The machines used to create the images on the 16-by-13-foot
screen are stacked in towers in a small room behind the theater.
Cohen's consultant, Eric Eidelman of Audio Video Interiors in
Hillsdale, N.J., recently installed new equipment to improve the
quality, including a Sony VPHG90 video projector that is compatible
with high definition television, and a Faroudja Labs VP400A line
quadrupler, which enhances the picture by getting rid of the scan
lines that indicate video rather than film is being shown.
</P>
<P>
   Eidelman, who develops home theaters all over the country, but
especially in places like Aspen, Colo., and Los Angeles, says that
some home theaters can be put together with $50,000 worth of
equipment but that getting the newest and best technology usually
leads to a bill two or three times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   People like Cohen, he says, are aware of changes that can
produce a better image, and so they usually need to upgrade every
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, in the mansion he built with his wife shortly before
they split up, Cohen has other temptations that compete with the
theater, like a tennis court and a swimming pool. It's the first
house he has built, but he designed it to be his dream house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have everything here,'' he says, ``that I could
want to do.''(BBOX) &QL;

RED WINGS ARE LOOKING TO THEIR STOPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Before Chris Osgood and the Red Wings flew to Denver
for Sunday's playoff game, the injured goalie practiced with his
troubled team, genuflecting repeatedly on his tender right knee
like a reverent man in church. Up and down went Osgood, bouncing
the padded knee off the ice, flexing it as he kicked at pucks.
</P>
<P>
   Directly behind his net, on the boards below the rink glass in
Joe Louis Arena, a blue and white advertisement for a health-care
company showed big crosses and shields. Should Osgood return to
uniform, Detroit feels it might again have net protection after
yielding 11 goals in its last two games. Without him, they are
merely the Wings and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood is recovering from a serious sprain that kept him out of
the first four games against the Colorado Avalanche in the Western
Conference semifinals of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Wings,
seeking their third consecutive cup, won the first two in Denver
behind backup Bill Ranford, who was described by coach Scotty
Bowman as an insurance policy. But Ranford faltered badly and had
to be pulled from the next two, both Colorado victories in Detroit
that tied the second round of the four-of-seven games series. The
third-stringer Norm Maracle replaced Ranford both times.
</P>
<P>
   If Osgood's knee feels strong enough Sunday, he will be back in
goal for Game 5. Should he be unable to play _ or fail to play well
after 19 days of idleness _ the Wing dynasty could end at two as
soon as Tuesday in Game 6 in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better now,'' Osgood said. ``I was down. I was frustrated.
I thought I was going to miss the entire series. Right now, I don't
know. I'm optimistic. I'm not sure. Every day I feel better. I
probably won't know until Sunday. It's an on and off thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole series has been that way. The official hype has this
as ``the best rivalry in sports'' in the 1990s, but this round has
not yet risen to the level of passion of 1996, when the Avalanche
eliminated the Wings en route to the cup, or of 1997, when Detroit
eliminated Colorado on its way to the title. True, there have been
some good individual performances by players such as Detroit center
Steve Yzerman and Colorado goalie Patrick Roy. And there have been
several bloody faces, including a 40-stitch cut to Detroit's
Brendan Shanahan when Peter Forsberg rammed him into the glass from
behind. That foul got Forsberg ejected from Game 1, a 3-2 Wings
victory in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But that game was ragged and the next three were one-sided, with
the losing team playing poorly. Hockey fans not aligned behind
either team are hoping both clubs will play well at the same time
to create the classic series they envisioned. As for the partisans,
the pessimism of Colorado fans and news media has been transformed
to a ``pinch-me'' sort of glee while the smugness of the Detroit
fans and journalists has been shaken by tremors of doubt. Some fans
booed the team and left Joe Louis early Thursday night. Even Osgood
found it hard to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't watch much after we were down 5-0,'' Osgood said of
Thursday's game, a 6-2 Avalanche victory. ``Pretty painful to sit
in the back and watch that. We were so hopeful when we came home
2-0. In a matter of four days, things turned around the exact
opposite. Things weren't working out. Frustrating things just
seemed to pile up, one thing after another.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that Osgood is being cast as the savior. Last
spring, he was less than Detroit's best player when he gave up
several goals on long shots. Some thought the Wings won despite
him. Now, they hope he will lift their spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you lose two games in the fashion we lost them, you
hope to be one of the guys who gives the team a boost and maybe
energizes them,'' Osgood said. ``But I don't really overestimate
the power of one or two players changing around a whole series. I
don't necessarily think I'll be the total difference. I know if I
do play, I'll be ready and give the team a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Detroit's ennui extends beyond the goal posts. Veterans
Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson and Wendel Clark, who arrived along
with Ranford at the trade deadline, have played ineffectively in
the last two games and may be weary. Obtained from Chicago, the
Rangers and Tampa Bay, they are not accustomed to playing this late
in recent springs.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, whose wife gave birth to a daughter Friday, played his
worst game of the tournament Thursday, losing a key face-off, then
throwing himself out of position before Colorado's first goal. He
finished with a minus-two in the plus/minus ratio and scored no
points.
</P>
<P>
   The trades at the deadline, which cost Detroit several future
draft choices, helped the Wings spurt to a strong finish. But now,
they again look like the lethargic bunch that settled for
inconsistency and mediocrity for most of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   No National Hockey League team has won three consecutive cups
since the New York Islanders won four from 1980 through 1983. The
six-month regular season, followed by a two-month tournament, makes
it difficult for a team to maintain the health and the intensity
necessary to prevail. Physically and psychologically, the Wings are
teetering, knees buckling. In Game 5, they could be as good as
Osgood. &QL;

 &HT;    Gen. Clark says KLA stronger
 &HT;    By Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TASK FORCE HAWK HEADQUARTERS, Albania _ Despite Yugoslav claims
to the contrary, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark said Saturday
that rebel forces in Kosovo are growing stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a functional organization,'' Clark said at a
news briefing here. ``It has a strengthened command and control. It
has increased manpower and it is very much still active throughout
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's assessment directly contradicts Yugoslavian claims
Monday that they had defeated the Kosovo Liberation Army and were
starting to withdraw an undetermined number of approximately 40,000
Serbian troops from the province.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week NATO said it had seen no evidence of a pullout
and branded the Yugoslav withdrawal a ``publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Yugoslav attacks had only served to strengthen the
rebels and that the Serbian army is coming under increasing
pressure from the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most remarkable thing about the situation on the
ground is that despite the statements of President Milosevic and
the boasts of his military leaders some two months ago, they did
not finish off the KLA in five to seven days,'' Clark said. ``They,
in fact, have made the KLA even stronger than it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   While praising the KLA ``comeback,'' Clark kept the rebel force
at arms length. He said the KLA is not allied with NATO forces and
he ruled out giving the rebels any material support.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, we are not arming (the KLA),'' Clark said.
``We don't have any business arming them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was in Albania to meet with the leaders of Task Force
Hawk, which includes Apache helicopters, an artillery unit and a
contingent of paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne division.
Although the highly publicized force was sent to Albania three
weeks ago to hunt down Serbian tanks and artillery, it has yet to
fire a shot in anger.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported today that Pentagon officials are
blocking Clark from using the Apache helicopters because of the
danger from Serb anti-aircraft defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clark would not say when the force might attack Serb positions
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawk is ready,'' Clark said. ``Hawk will employed at a time
and place of our own choosing.''

REAL ESTATE: OPTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE HOLDING TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a married couple buy a house or apartment, the
couple usually take title in the name of both spouses. And since
most houses and apartments are purchased with at least some
borrowed money, that means that in most cases, both spouses assume
equal responsibility for repaying the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But while shared ownership may contribute to matrimonial
harmony, lawyers say, it may not always be the smartest way to own
real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many times you'll see a husband and wife buy
a piece of property and sign both their names to a 30-year mortgage
without really thinking about what they're doing,'' said David
Clurman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ``And I don't think a lot
of lawyers give the subject a lot of thought either.''
</P>
<P>
   Clurman explained that as property values have increased over
the years _ particularly in the metropolitan area and even more
particularly in Manhattan _ it has become increasingly important
for those buying property to consider carefully the impact that
real estate can have on estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual these days for a couple who own a home or an
apartment to have a combined estate that exceeds $650,000 _ the
point at which an individual's estate becomes subject to federal
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, in our increasingly litigious society, it has
become more important than ever for people who may have exposure to
liability _ particularly professionals and those engaged in
unincorporated business enterprises _ to think long and hard about
the implications of having their name on a deed, mortgage or
promissory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common for people who are buying property to go to a
bank or a mortgage broker and sign loan applications before they've
even made an appointment with their lawyer,'' Clurman said. ``And
sometimes decisions that are made on the spur of the moment can
reverberate with great pain many years in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Kravet, president of Royal Abstract, a title insurance
agency in Manhattan, said that there are various ways in which
title to real estate can be held. A person can hold title
individually, for example, either in the person's own name or in
the name of a corporation or other legal entity owned by that
person.
</P>
<P>
   Title to property can also be held ``personally'' by more than
one individual, Kravet said. Two or more individuals, he said, can
take title as ``tenants in common,'' as ``joint tenants with rights
of survivorship,'' or as ``tenants by the entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   With a tenancy in common, he said, each owner's interest in the
property passes on death to that person's heirs or beneficiaries.
With a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, on the other
hand, each owner's interest passes automatically on death to the
surviving owner or owners.
</P>
<P>
   A tenancy by the entirety, Kravet said, is a form of joint
tenancy available only to married couples. However, he said, unlike
a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, which can be converted
to a tenancy in common by any owner selling his or her interest to
a third party, a tenancy by the entirety will remain so for as long
as the joint tenants remain married.
</P>
<P>
   Only divorce or the mutual agreement of the parties can convert
a tenancy by the entirety to a tenancy in common, Kravet said.
</P>
<P>
   And while most married couples take title to a home or apartment
as tenants by the entirety, there are often situations in which
that may not be the wisest thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We frequently recommend that professionals put property in the
name of a nonworking spouse or the spouse with the least exposure
to liability,'' said Martin L. Lepelstat, a real estate lawyer in
Woodbridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle encountered when trying to put property in the name
of a nonworking spouse is getting a lender to lend money to someone
with little or no ability to repay it. That can be accomplished by
persuading the lender to let the income-producing spouse guarantee
payment but not require that person to be included on the deed and
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be up front with the lender and you have to get to
someone who can make these kinds of decisions,'' Lepelstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason married couples might want to take title to real
estate in individual names or as tenants in common would be to
minimize, or even eliminate, federal estate taxes on their combined
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Joel E. Miller, a Queens tax lawyer, said that it is almost
always possible for married taxpayers to avoid paying such taxes on
the death of the first spouse. Real estate owned jointly by spouses
is not subject to estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Any other property owned by the first spouse to die can also be
shielded from taxes by making sure that it is all left to the
surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving everything to the surviving spouse, however, can
ultimately result in the payment of taxes unnecessarily because the
strategy frequently fails to take full advantage of both spouses'
unified credit.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Miller said, the unified credit exempts the first
$650,000 of an individual's estate from federal gift and estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the basic goals of estate planning is to avoid wasting
either spouse's unified credit,'' he said, explaining that is just
what happens when the first spouse to die leaves everything to the
surviving spouse.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Miller said, if a married couple own a $1 million
house as tenants by the entirety, and one spouse dies, the
surviving spouse automatically becomes the sole owner and no estate
tax is due. When the second spouse dies, however, and the house
then passes to the couple's children, only $650,000 is exempt from
taxes as a result of the unified credit; the remaining $350,000 is
subject to federal estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Miller said, if the same $1 million house
were owned by the couple as tenants in common, the first spouse to
die could bequeath his or her interest in the property to what is
known as a credit shelter trust. Such a trust can be designed to
allow the surviving spouse to remain in possession of the property
until death, at which time the property passes to beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the value of the property placed in trust _ $500,000, the
deceased partner's half share of the home's $1 million value _ is
less than the $650,000 unified credit, no tax is imposed on that
transfer. And since the surviving spouse is also entitled to a
$650,000 unified credit, that much of his or her estate will be
exempt from taxes as well.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Miller said, a couple who successfully combine both
unified credits can pass to beneficiaries up to $1.3 million in
assets without paying any federal estate taxes.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN WILL BRADLEY ENTER THE CHARISMA PHASE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was somewhere near the New Hampshire seacoast that Bill
Bradley declined to tell reporters what books he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go down the road of favorite novel,'' he said,
during a three-day campaign tour of youth centers, senior centers
and many variations on the theme of the presidential-candidate
forum. There was a credibility issue at stake here. What, he
demanded, would the press say if he picked one book now and then
changed his mind six months down the line? And what if he mentioned
something like ``Crime and Punishment''? The reporters might
theorize that he was identifying with the murderer-hero. No, we're
not going there.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, you see, is in the Vision Phase of his campaign, and,
as he firmly explained earlier in the New Hampshire tour, you do
not talk specifics when you are in Vision Mode. ``It's discipline
and sequencing,'' he said, in a tone that suggested the reporters
would really not respect him in the morning if he lathered them
with details of his health-care initiative that night. Sometime
this summer, he plans to kick into the Principles Phase, to be
followed in the fall by the Policy Phase, when he will be prepared
for ``taking the necessary hits you get when you are specific.''
After that comes the Action Phase, in which the candidate responds
to the hits and, presumably, comes back with a few good licks of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley staff swears he did not pay a consultant to think
this up.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an indication of the Bradley campaign's
self-confidence that it does not seem particularly desperate for
attention at this point in the game. Unlike most long-shot
candidates, Bradley does not accept invitations to appear on cable
television shows. He resists photographers' attempts to get him
near a basketball or a hoop. He is a serious candidate, and if you
do not believe it, just try listening to him tell a group of
Manchester citizens his opinion on the Uruguay round of the
international trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it all seems to be working pretty well. The voters at
the forums, coffees and house parties appear to like the Vision
Phase, particularly Bradley's rather fuzzy but seemingly heartfelt
concern about ``values.'' His fund-raising pales next to Vice
President Al Gore's mountain of cash, but money can't buy you love.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore candidacy is so wobbly that President Clinton recently
assumed the role of Spinner in Chief. He said Gore's leaden
speeches and inert staff add up to inevitable victory.
</P>
<P>
   Follow Bradley around during Phase One and you will learn that
what he is most concerned with is children, particularly poor
children who do not get enough parental supervision. He has a vague
but intense preoccupation with getting people to think of
themselves as part of a larger community, a greater cause. The
rhetoric of self-realization sometimes sloshes over into other
areas. ``Before somebody's going to join the international economy,
they have to be comfortable with their identity where they are,''
he said during a discussion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As a former basketball star, Bradley, unlike most politicians,
has never had to beg for attention. This seems to have given him a
quietness that allows him to draw people out by simply sitting
there _ head down, chin tucked in, peering up with a look of
slightly amused interest _ and waiting for them to volunteer some
information.
</P>
<P>
   It works particularly well with young people, whom he asks to
describe what they are ``most afraid of,'' with sometimes
remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of not making it,'' piped up 17-year-old Jose Rivas
in Nashua. ``What if I've come this far and it's as far as I can
go? It's not as far as I want to go, but what if it's as far as I'm
allowed to go?'' He told Bradley that he wanted to attend cooking
school but might not be able to raise the tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the same calm confidence that makes Bradley a
good listener makes him a dreary public speaker. Even his most
dramatic speech, a really admirable call to re-address the issue of
racial division, is devoid of applause lines. It would be a
profound problem in a different year. But no matter who wins the
presidential primary, boring is something the Democrats are just
going to have to learn to live with.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to comparing himself with the vice president,
Bradley says ``specific issue differences will be laid out in the
fall,'' when it is time for the harvest and Phase Three. If all
goes according to plan, sometime around August Bradley may also
volunteer that he likes historical fiction, and before Thanksgiving
the campaign may reveal that he has read ``Ragtime'' twice.

 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-six years after New York City tore down the
original Pennsylvania Station in an act so widely condemned that it
spawned a campaign for historic preservation, President Clinton in
a visit to Manhattan on Wednesday is to inaugurate the renovation
of the old station's surviving sister, the General Post Office on
Eighth Avenue, into a new railroad terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit promises to provide political momentum to a
project that has been planned and debated for six years and still
lacks the final commitment of government funds to cover its
expected budget of $484 million, say officials involved in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Although a White House spokeswoman, Julie Goldberg, said
Clinton's visit was intended simply to ``inaugurate the project,''
federal officials said it was envisioned as a way to draw public
attention to the architectural work that is now proposed, and to
encourage Congress to approve the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrific design and we thought it was time to show
the world what is being planned,'' said Tony Bullock, the chief of
staff to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has been the leading
proponent of the project in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Another federal official who has been at the center of planning
for the project, Robert Peck, the commissioner of the Public
Buildings Service, a branch of the General Services Administration,
said that discussions in recent weeks had ``put us in striking
distance'' of fully financing the project.
</P>
<P>
   The original Penn Station was widely regarded as one of the
city's best early 20th-century examples of neo-classical design
before it was demolished to make way for Madison Square Garden, but
the railroad station now being planned would be anchored by a
distinctly modern addition of glass and steel girders.
</P>
<P>
   Several involved in the project, including its principal
architect, David M. Childs of the firm Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill,
said the design might surprise those who envision something closer
to the ornate grandeur of the original Penn Station. But they said
the demands of modern technology and huge crowds dictated a
different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who likes true classicism and takes the attitude of
`don't touch anything' is likely to be on the other side of the
table from us,'' Childs said. But he added that his design would
``honor the relationship between the modern and the classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip K. Howard, the chairman of the Municipal Art Society, an
organization that has championed historic preservation in the three
decades that followed the demolition of Pennsylvania Station, said
he had reviewed the new design and fully supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal concern has been to make a train station at a
scale that would accommodate millions of visitors and tourists, and
you can do that with modern design as well as classical design,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Moynihan has led a campaign that focused largely on
reaching an agreement for shared use of the General Post Office,
formally known as the James A. Farley Building, by the Postal
Service and the proposed rail terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements mediated in recent months by Peck, the Postal
Service has agreed to vacate roughly a third of its space in the
vast structure of 1.4 million square feet by the time construction
begins. Peck said the Postal Service had also agreed to vacate the
entire structure at an unspecified point in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrangement of shared space resulted from years of
hard-fought negotiations in which some proponents of a new Penn
Station had maintained that the postal operations should simply be
moved out, and the Postal Service fought tenaciously to stay in
what is one of the nation's largest and historically distinguished
postal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Post Office deserves a lot of credit at this point,'' said
Charles A. Gargano, the senior economic adviser to Gov. George E.
Pataki and chairman of the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment
Corporation, an agency established in 1996 with commitments of $75
million from the state and $25 million from the city.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, the project has depended on far greater
commitments of Federal funds, particularly because its anticipated
costs have risen. The current estimate of $484 million, provided by
Gargano, is far higher than estimates a year ago that it would cost
less than $350 million, and officials say the construction taking
place elsewhere in New York City is likely to increase the cost
more by creating a shortage of workers and material.
</P>
<P>
   So far, commitments from Congress, the Department of
Transportation and other federal agencies have added $250 million
to the amount available, but such aid remains contingent on
congressional votes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   One fear, according to people involved in the project, is that
members of Congress will reverse themselves and divert money from
the project now that Alfonse D'Amato is no longer in the Senate
after many years as a powerful voice on the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no money is diverted, Gargano said, the project is still
$134 million short of the present cost estimate. In any case, he
said, the development agency he heads plans to adhere to a schedule
of breaking ground in 2000 and completing the project in 2003.

EDITORIAL: THE CHINA BLIND SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 16:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a more damaging U.S. security failure than
the serial hemorrhage of nuclear-weapons secrets and other military
information to China over the last two decades. Each new disclosure
adds to a picture of breathtaking incompetence by federal agencies
and lack of vigilance by Republican and Democratic administrations
alike. The United States might as well have dumped its most
sensitive defense secrets on Pennsylvania Avenue for Chinese spies
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Clinton administration's inert response to
possible Chinese campaign contributions in 1996, and the Justice
Department's lack of interest in tens of millions of dollars that
flowed from China into a small Los Angeles bank the same year.
Little wonder that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress want
to know whether the administration willfully ignored all these
Chinese provocations so it could improve relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Jeff Gerth and James Risen of The New York
Times have described three serious security breakdowns, two at
nuclear weapons laboratories and one involving work by a private
defense contractor. In all cases, there seems to have been a loss
of critically important information to China that could be used to
modernize Beijing's small arsenal of nuclear weapons or help it
develop other military technologies. In each instance, security
measures were lax and federal criminal investigations proved
ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   One case, at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California in the late 1970s or early 1980s, may have helped China
develop a small but especially deadly warhead. China is planning to
place the warhead on a new, truck-based mobile missile that may be
operational within three or four years and will be able to reach
Western regions of the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another episode, this one at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
in New Mexico, began in the mid-1980s with the possible theft of
another warhead design. Astonishingly, this espionage effort may
have extended until earlier this year and included the transfer of
U.S. nuclear computer codes that serve, in effect, as a physics
blueprint for warhead design work. The primary suspect, Wen Ho Lee,
an American scientist, was dismissed by the lab only this year and
his computer was not examined by investigators until March, nearly
three years after he first came under suspicion. In 1997, the
Justice Department inexplicably turned down a FBI request to put a
covert wiretap on Lee. He has not been charged and denies the
espionage allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In the third case, an American scientist working for TRW, the
defense contractor, appears to have given Chinese officials secret
information in 1997 about an advanced radar technology being
developed to track submarines. The company itself was not involved
in his activities with China. The scientist, Peter Lee, was not
prosecuted for espionage because the Navy refused to let
prosecutors disclose information about the technology in court,
despite procedures that safely permit the use of classified
information in federal criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
   This is no way to run a government. The nuclear labs were
negligent about security, and the Energy Department, which runs
them, failed to fix the problem until Bill Richardson took over as
secretary. The Justice Department was indifferent and the Navy was
obstructionist. The White House, which should have kicked these
agencies into action and insured that there was a coordinated
response, failed to react to initial alarms and only last year
ordered tightened security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, President Clinton's top national security
advisers received a secret government report warning that China
presented an ``acute intelligence threat'' to the nuclear labs. If
they had been paying attention, they might have reached the same
conclusion years earlier. &QL;

 A FRIEND OF McGWIRE HELPS GRIFFEY'S QUEST  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Griffey Jr. should somehow get out of his rut and hit
more than 56 home runs this season, say 71, just to pick a nice
round number, Tom Lampkin might have to go into the Hall of Fame as
the best good-luck charm in history.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin was a teammate of Mark McGwire's in St. Louis last
season, and now he plays in Seattle, where Griffey is the resident
threat to McGwire's still fresh record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens again, sure I would love to be on the club where
it happens,'' Lampkin said. ``That ride we were on last year was
just unbelievable and indescribable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, a journeyman backup catcher, actually had more than an
observer's role in McGwire's successful pursuit of Roger Maris'
record. They were close friends, and when McGwire took days off
from speaking with the news media, Lampkin served as a surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he could speak from vast experience on the subject of
home runs necessarily. In his six-team, seven-year (spread over 11
seasons) career, Lampkin has hit only 27 home runs (McGwire had
that many by the end of May), including two this season, both in
the last week.
</P>
<P>
   But he certainly has learned to know a home run when he sees it
because he saw McGwire hit plenty. Given his unique vantage point,
Lampkin was asked if it was far-fetched to think that he could
witness the record broken a second successive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' he said. ``I've thought about that.
I really don't see anybody breaking that record, at least not in my
lifetime. Not only do you have to have a bona fide home run hitter,
but that bona fide home run hitter has to stay healthy all year. He
has to play on basically a noncontending team and he has to
basically play noncontending clubs. Otherwise people are going to
try to get him out. He might end up taking more pitches to get his
walks, to get himself on base. There are just so many factors that
go into a guy hitting 70 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his doubts, much of what Lampkin said describes
Griffey's situation. With their pitching, the Mariners don't figure
to be much of a contender, and they will certainly play many
noncontenders because the league is full of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the same game that Lampkin hit his first home run, against
Orlando Hernandez at Yankee Stadium, Griffey hit his 11th. He
entered Saturday night's game with 12 in the Mariners' 34 games. In
35 games last season Griffey had 14 home runs; the year before he
had 15. McGwire hit 13 in the Cardinals' first 35 games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who has hit 56 in each of the last two seasons,
countenances no talk about home runs, let alone home run records.
He steadfastly maintains that he is not even a home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to hit the ball hard,'' he said. ``If it goes out, it
goes out. I try to hit the ball the other way. I get a bigger kick
out of hitting a ball to left field than I do hitting a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it was mentioned that none other than Hank Aaron has
anointed him the most likely to break his career home run record,
if any current player has a chance, Griffey said he does not and
will not try to hit home runs. But 361 career home runs and 161 the
past three seasons, which tie Babe Ruth for second-most hit in
three successive seasons, defines Junior as a home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's demonstrated year in and year out he's a bona fide home
run hitter,'' Lampkin said. ``When he gets a ball in the air, he
has such a nice swing and such good extension that the ball is
going to go out of the park. I'm nobody to tell him he is or he
isn't a home run hitter, but his approach is to hit the ball hard
somewhere and that's a great approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin, of course, feels privileged to have had the opportunity
to play with both McGwire and Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both have great work habits,'' he said. ``Both are very
intense when it comes to their business and their job. They both
take their work seriously and they're both great competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin noted one difference in their personalities. ``Junior's
maybe a little more jovial than Mark is during the course of the
game,'' he said. ``It seems like he takes it a little more easy and
relaxes. Mark is more consistently intense from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has hit a record 180 home runs the past three
seasons, is off to a slow start, with eight. Lampkin said McGwire
has told him in one of their many telephone conversations that he
hasn't been getting pitches to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched some of his games on TV and he's getting balls
four inches off the plate both inside and outside,'' Lampkin said.
``They're pitching him tough. Once he gets his patience back, like
he says he thinks he's starting to get around to, he'll start
taking those pitches and if it means walking, it's walking.''
</P>
<P>
   But could it be that McGwire suffers from Lampkin's absence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a question,'' the catcher said, laughing. ``I told him
I helped him hit a lot of those home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's helping Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   American League West Has Offense
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if a prerequisite for playing in the American League
West is an incendiary offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our division, if you don't have a good offensive lineup,
you don't have a chance,'' Art Howe, Oakland's manager, said. ``If
you go in with one hand tied behind your back, you might as well
have both hands tied behind your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the Athletics rank closer to the bottom than the
top of the league. But they have an explosive offense nonetheless,
scoring in double digits in six games and matching Cleveland for
the most such scores. As a division, the four-team West has scored
in double figures 20 times compared with 16 for the East and 15 for
the Central, both five-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics, playing better than Anaheim and Seattle, have
done it in spite of the noncontribution of Ben Grieve, the 1998 AL
rookie of the year, who was hitting .143 before Saturday's game.
Jason Giambi, who learned a few things about hitting when Mark
McGwire was a teammate, is the leading offensive force with a .300
batting average, eight home runs and 29 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   John Jaha, whom no one else wanted because he was coming back
from an off-season foot operation and who the year before had
undergone shoulder surgery for a torn labrum, has contributed seven
home runs and 23 RBI as well as a .345 average.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Collins, the Angels' manager, said the Athletics' best
move was signing 40-year-old Tony Phillips, who leads the team with
nine home runs. ``He brings energy and enthusiasm,'' Collins said.
``He knows how to win. He takes young players and brings them a
step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins himself continues to manipulate a lineup that is absent
three significant players _ outfielders Jim Edmonds (out at least
until September) and Tim Salmon (out for another month or more) and
shortstop Gary DiSarcina (out until mid-to-late June).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose a third of your lineup, I don't care who you
are,'' Collins said, discussing what their absence has meant. ``You
take Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill and Derek Jeter out of the
Yankees' lineup and they're not the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Earned Run Averages Soar
</P>
<P>
   When Jamey Wright's earned run average reached 7.58 in his
fourth start, the Colorado Rockies decided he needed a refresher
course in the minor leagues. What, then, should the Rockies do with
John Thomson, who in his fifth start gave up six runs to the Mets
in 2 2/3 innings and saw his ERA climb from 10.47 to 11.84? That's
the highest in the major leagues among pitchers who have made more
than two starts.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomson is not the only pitcher whose already inflated ERA
went up in his last start. Kent Mercker of St. Louis, on the
strength of six Philadelphia runs in 4 2/3 innings, had his ERA go
from 7.00 to 8.20.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair, in his last start for Detroit, gained his first
victory of the season in seven tries, but his ERA went from 7.76 to
8.21 because Baltimore scored six runs against him in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp of Boston managed to get his 7.97 ERA to 8.06 by giving
up two runs in two innings against Seattle. Mark Clark of Texas
went from 7.36 to 7.85 because Toronto scored five runs in 3 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher of Anaheim reversed this trend, though not by much.
Boston battered Belcher for six runs in 5 2/3 innings, but his ERA
was already so high that it slid from 9.96 to 9.89.
</P>
<P>
   But Latroy Hawkins of Minnesota executed the best arithmetical
performance. He went into a game against Kansas City with a 9.49
ERA, allowed seven runs in 6 2/3 innings and emerged with a 9.49
ERA

MISSOURI GENERAL ASSEMBLY CUTS TAXES BY $202 MILLION ON FINAL DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL and KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY _ Prodded by Gov. Mel Carnahan, Missouri
lawmakers cut taxes by $202 million and passed a revamped pension
increase for themselves before adjourning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut cleared the Senate 34-0 after less than half an hour
of discussion. The House had backed it 126-0 earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also set up a graduated driver's license system for
young motorists and passed an economic development bill that
sponsors said would benefit Centertainment and Trans World Airlines
in Kansas City and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the two biggest issues of the final, frenzied day were the
tax cut and legislative pension increase. Both topics had triggered
unusually angry comments by Carnahan earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the governor called lawmakers ``self-serving'' and
said he would veto a pension increase they had just passed because
it was extravagant. He also had threatened to call a special
session if lawmakers failed to give him a tax cut of around $200
million, as he had proposed in January. Carnahan had opposed some
lawmakers' calls to slash taxes even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Friday's adjournment, Carnahan said he was pleased
with the revised tax measure and gratified by the session's
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts are exceedingly difficult to pass, but this one is
good public policy,'' Carnahan told reporters. ``It's broad-based,
and we can afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who favors abortion rights, said the session's low
point was the lengthy debate over abortion that ``poisoned the
atmosphere over the last several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders cited the tax measure as a key
accomplishment in a 4 1/2-month session that veteran lawmakers
described as lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, said
lawmakers accomplished a lot even if much of it happened in the
final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you viewed this as a war, it was successful, and everyone
worked hard in the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP legislative leaders were less effusive.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leader Delbert Scott of Lowry City said GOP
pressure on the tax issue contributed to agreement on $202 million
package and other reductions. Scott and other Republican leaders
blamed the session's listless quality on Carnahan's early entry
into next year's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made him candidate Carnahan rather than Governor Carnahan
right from the start,'' Scott said. ``All his statements were
colored by that...and he was missing in action.''
</P>
<P>
   As the session ended Friday, all sides were congratulating
themselves on passing a tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has to return about $160 million to taxpayers to comply
with the state's revenue and spending lid, known as the Hancock
amendment. If lawmakers had failed to agree on a tax cut, the money
would have been returned through refunds.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut will:
</P>
<P>
   - Boost the personal exemption for single filers and married
couples filing separate state returns to $2,100 from $1,200. The
exemption for married couples filing a combined return will rise to
$4,200 from $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   - Increase the exemption for a head of household or a surviving
spouse to $3,500 from $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Allow a state deduction for the self-employed on their health
insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   - Trim the state's corporate franchise tax rate by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Liberalize the state deduction on pension income. Current law
allows single filers to deduct up to $6,000 if their incomes do not
exceed $25,000 and married couples to deduct up to $32,000. The new
law will gradually phase out that deduction for each dollar over
$25,000 or $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat, praised negotiators
who hammered out the plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough road,'' said Gaw, who made the issue one of
his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Gibbons, a St. Louis County Republican, said the
tax cut represented broad-based relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good settlement,'' Gibbons told the House. ``It's a
good way to reduce taxes in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons and other Republicans noted that total tax reductions
this year would be about $250 million, including tax credits in
other bills besides the $202 million cut. The governor said he
would have to review those other reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved a hotly debated state retirement plan
that will increase legislative pensions 35 percent, despite
objections from colleagues who said it would contribute to public
distrust of government.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan threatened to veto a nearly identical plan earlier in
the week. The only change from the earlier version is the
elimination of a 17 percent increase for longtime lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The new system would increase pensions for all but a dozen
lawmakers. But it would cap pensions at 100 percent of a sitting
lawmaker's salary. However, about a dozen veteran lawmakers could
receive more under the current system, including several who are
already eligible for more than their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   With the increase for those lawmakers left out, Carnahan said he
intended to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative pension increase was tied to a bill that would
give state workers, teachers, firefighters and other government
employees about a 6 increase in retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sarah Steelman, a Rolla Republican, tried to send the bill
back to a conference committee to strip lawmakers' pensions out of
the legislation. The motion was defeated 21-13.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan was adopted in the Senate 21-12. In the House,
where a vote usually takes a couple of minutes, nearly 15 minutes
passed as members delayed voting until it was apparent that the
measure would pass. The new plan was adopted 83-67, one more vote
than the minimum needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sponsor, Democrat John Scott of St. Louis, called it
a good bill that would boost retirement benefits for thousands of
workers across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Groves Bland, a Kansas City Democrat, said the public
was not upset by the legislature's pension increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think badly about the legislature, because the media
tell only bad things about us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Kenney, a Lee's Summit Republican, criticized Carnahan
for opposing a pension increase that affected only a dozen
lawmakers while accepting a huge increase for all the rest. He said
the veto threat was little more than a public relations stunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republican Rep. Matt Bartle of Lee's Summit
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are passing is no less excessive, unreasonable and
self-serving,'' Bartle said. ``What is the difference, Mr.
Governor? If you couldn't sign (the previous bill), you shouldn't
sign this one.''
</P>
<P>
   On another key issue, efforts to make it illegal for anyone to
drive with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or higher, instead
of the current 0.10 percent, died late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the reduction earlier this year. But the bill
that the lower limit was attached to died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House backers tried to add the reduction to another measure, but
it failed.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas Friday, lawmakers approved a new, graduated
driver's license system, which backers said would give young people
more time to improve their driving skills before they drive without
any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows people 16 and older to apply for unrestricted
driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January 2001, applicants age 16 to 18 can apply for
intermediate driver's licenses. They must have had temporary
permits for at least six months and proof from a parent or guardian
that they have had 20 hours of supervised driving.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers with an intermediate license would be banned from
driving alone between 1 and 5 a.m. unless traveling to and from
school or a job. Anyone with an intermediate license who gets six
or more points for driving violations in a 12-month period would
have to complete a driver improvement program. Those who meet the
conditions could apply for a full license at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The same bill provides for auto inspections and vehicle
registration renewal every other year instead of annually. It also
provides for driver's license renewals every six years instead of
every three.
</P>
<P>
   Other bills that won approval on the final day will:
</P>
<P>
   - Provide new tax credits to TWA and Centertainment, the
multimillion-dollar project that includes hotels, shops and
theaters in southern downtown Kansas City. The bill, by Rep. Henry
Rizzo of Kansas City, also expands the list of communities that can
qualify to be enterprise zones, which can be a key financial tool
in attracting industries.
</P>
<P>
   - Revamp a variety of criminal sentences, in part to trim the
state's prison population; create a new ``aggravated offender''
crime for people with more than three convictions for driving while
intoxicated within a certain timeframe; and ban the use of tobacco
products in state prisons starting July 1, 2000.

BROWNBACK A LEADER IN NATIONAL EFFORT TO DEFEAT CULTURE OF
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the very moment the press conference he had
called Monday to discuss youth violence was set to begin, Sen. Sam
Brownback, the senior Republican from Kansas, was in a taxicab
shuttling between the White House and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The room, meanwhile, was full. Sen. Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota
Democrat waiting to share the cameras with him, was in the hallway
cooling his heels.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback finally arrived about 15 minutes late. Just before
taking the microphone, he acknowledged a face in the front row, and
in an audible whisper said, ``Good morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 2:15 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Brownback if his sense of time is a little skewed these
days. His clock is dictated by the demands of the issue du jour _
culture and violence. As the nation probes its collective psyche
looking for explanations of the high school murders in Littleton,
Colo., last month, Brownback has emerged as one of the leading
Washington headshrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time frame where the country is willing to listen
and discuss culture,'' he said. ``I think it's been building for a
long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a moment of maximum political exposure, especially for
someone such as Brownback who has been pushing cultural renewal for
years.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the floor Wednesday, calling for a measure that would
allow entertainment companies to work together toward a voluntary
code of conduct about violence in programming.
</P>
<P>
   For all the polls that politicians use to divine public opinion,
and all the advice they get from experts, success often comes from
just being in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   A 42-year-old conservative Republican, Brownback has been riding
a fast train ever since he arrived in Washington less than five
years ago. After one high-profile term in the House as one of Newt
Gingrich's often-quoted revolutionaries, he ran for the Senate in
1996, for the seat Bob Dole held for 27 years. He won and
immediately made the cover of Time magazine in the company of the
Senate Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He is soft-spoken and disarming. But he is also somewhat of a
political swashbuckler, crossing swords with the entertainment
industry, or taking on issues like campaign finance reform that are
sure bets for attention. Yet he also is a lonely voice against
slavery in Africa, an issue that gets scant mention.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill aides call him prudent and careful, never one to do
anything purely by accident. It was in the Colorado massacre that
he saw the confluence of issues and concerns that have been part of
his recent focus _ and why viewers suddenly see him constantly
before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Long before high schoolers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
massacred 13 classmates and a teacher, Brownback had been outspoken
about the depiction of violence in music, movies and video games.
Picking up the baton from Tipper Gore, who championed the issue in
the 1980s, he held a well-publicized hearing two years ago on
violence in rock and rap music.
</P>
<P>
   When he said in 1997 that the lyrics were ``a long way from
Elvis shaking his hips on the Ed Sullivan Show,'' Brownback
symbolized the kind of amazement of an over-40 generation suddenly
surprised that its own children had gone far beyond anything it had
ever considered risque.
</P>
<P>
   The next year he held two forums on the subject of violence and
kids killing kids.
</P>
<P>
   His was also a very public _ and political _ lament that
something was wrong with the culture. But the nerve he had hit
didn't really buzz until after Littleton, when he led a Senate
hearing _ one that had been scheduled two months before the
shootings _ into how violence is marketed to children by the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his life has been a steady diet of press conferences
and television interviews. He was late for his Monday press
conference because of the White House summit on youth violence. But
he held another the next day with a second cultural renewal ally
from across the aisle, Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a frequent guest on the major news shows. He even
chartered a private plane to get him from Kansas early one Sunday
morning to Washington for his maiden appearance on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' and then whisk him back home to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out early on this thing makes him somebody in
demand,'' said Nancy Nathan, the show's executive producer. ``There
is sort of a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback acknowledges the risk in possibly being seen as
exploiting the Littleton tragedy for political purposes. But both
he and others say that the shootings exposed what they think
represents an open wound in American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To change the culture, you can use politics as the vehicle,
but culture is dominated by fields other than politics,'' Brownback
said. ``So you've got to go to the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his opponents in the current campaign to ``shame'' the
entertainment industry into cleaning up its act give him praise for
his style, if not his point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe people like Sen. Brownback are extremely sincere
and feel strongly about what they say,'' said Jack Valenti,
president and chief executive officer of the Motion Picture
Association of America, the film industry lobby in Washington. ``I
can't be getting upset toward someone who speaks his mind honestly,
with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said that as much as politicians like him want to do
something, the solutions would not come from legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that even his own home is not immune. He recently found
his 11-year-old son playing a video game that showed ``two guys
fighting and killing each other with axes.'' He removed it from the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you change your culture,'' Brownback said, ``by
millions of individual acts.''

CIPRIANI RESTAURANT EMPIRE UNDER FIRE, AND NOT JUST FROM UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inside the catering hall, among the soaring
Corinthian columns illuminated by rose-colored spotlights, waiters
milled about serving Bellinis _ cocktails of sparkling wine and
peach juice _ to a black-tie crowd of 500 publishing executives,
writers and editors.
</P>
<P>
   But the genteel murmurs within the basilica-like space belied
the racket outside on East 42nd Street, where union members
chanted, blew whistles and shouted catcalls at those who crossed
their picket line.
</P>
<P>
   The protest-marred gala for the writers' group PEN last
Wednesday at Cipriani 42nd Street, a converted bank building across
the street from Grand Central Terminal, was in many ways emblematic
of the tumultuous quest by the Cipriani family to become kings
among New York City's restaurant owners and caterers.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the Ciprianis _ led by Giuseppe Cipriani, whose
grandfather founded Harry's Bar in Venice _ have gone from relative
obscurity as the owners of two modest-size restaurants to a force
in the city's dining industry, with some of its largest, most
spectacular and expensive catering halls. The halls have become hot
spots for celebrities and the city's power elite _ TV news anchor
Peter Jennings, designer Giorgio Armani and financier Leon Black
are among those who have recently booked them.
</P>
<P>
   But in building their business, the Ciprianis have waged pitched
battles with union labor, specifically Local 6 of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees Union, while at times antagonizing clients,
investors, food critics and others in the restaurant industry.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the Ciprianis' initial successes, some
restaurant experts cite the family's union troubles and other
perceived missteps as evidence that its domination of the industry
is far from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the obstacles, Giuseppe Cipriani, who with his father,
Arrigo, runs Cipriani International, is thinking big. He said he
expected to have about $90 million in sales when his six
restaurants and catering halls in Manhattan are fully operating
next year, up from $7 million four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Harry Cipriani, the family's original New York
restaurant, Cipriani also runs Downtown, a hipper version of Harry
Cipriani in Soho, manages the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center,
and plans to open two restaurants in Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has restaurants in Italy and Argentina and a
line of packaged foods, and even plans to bottle its signature
Bellini cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   The Cipriani magic _ both friends and critics call it that _
includes a high level of service and the ability to get wealthy
customers to pay $30 for a bowl of pasta whose charms might
otherwise escape the attention of food critics. Frequent diners get
a warm hello from Giuseppe Cipriani and the waiters, who memorize
their customers' favorite drinks and deliver them before anyone is
seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely knows how to relate to a high-end clientele,''
said Mark Packer, a friend of Cipriani and the owner of the
Harley-Davidson Cafe and Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, a steakhouse in the
Flatiron district.
</P>
<P>
   But more than one hotelier and party planner said that the
Ciprianis' high-handed approach to the business has many people in
the industry rooting for the union. The first shot in the labor war
was fired in December, when Cipriani took over management of the
Rainbow Room and let go the 250 longtime union employees who helped
made the landmark restaurant high atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza one of
the most successful in the country. Many of those workers have been
picketing the Rainbow Room since then.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute has taken on broader social import because the
Cipriani family has also limited public access to the Rainow Room
and its revolving dance floor as they convert the complex to a
high-end catering hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a terrible thing for the city and for Rockefeller Center
to close off the public from the high-end tourist attraction in New
York where people imagined themselves to be Fred and Ginger,'' said
Tim Zagat, chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
``The way they handled the union was particularly stupid. And they
didn't just open one catering hall; they opened three mega-sites at
the same time. It seems to me this guy has made one significant
mistake after another.''
</P>
<P>
   significant mistake after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani's labor war came at a particularly bad time. Local 6
has amassed a $1 million organizing fund and can ill afford to lose
one of the most high-profile restaurants in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a picket line in front of the Rainbow Room for a
hundred years if that's what it takes,'' said Peter Ward, president
of the Hotel Trades Council and business manager of Local 6. ``All
we want is a contract that represents fairness and equity for the
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani, 34, said the union and his critics had it wrong. A
union contract, he said, hurt him financially and strangle his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose not to have a union, because having a union is very
expensive,'' Cipriani said. ``It's always bad to have a picket
line. I'll live with it. There've been places 10 years with a
picket line. I hope mine will last less.''
</P>
<P>
   But the labor conflict has only escalated. Only two days before
last Wednesday's dinner, Cipriani sued Local 6 for $5 million,
claiming that its criticism of him had prompted General Motors,
George magazine, Polytechnic University, HBO and others to cancel
lucrative events at the Rainbow Room and Cipriani 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a picket line in front of the Rainbow Room for a
hundred years if that's what it takes,'' said Peter Ward, president
of the Hotel Trades Council and business manager for Local 6. ``All
we want is a contract that represents fairness and equity for the
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani seems unlikely to budge. He is backing an effort to
toss the union out of Harry Cipriani, which, according to two
people who have seen the figures, generated a net income of about
$2.5 million on revenues of $8.5 million last year, a profit rate
more than double the industry average. ( Cipriani says the figures
are lower, although by his own numbers the union payroll consumes
only 16 percent of revenues.)
</P>
<P>
   At the catering halls, Cipriani has tried to avoid paying union
wages by hiring Michael Alexander to supply the waiters, who are
treated as independent contractors and paid $22 an hour. Other
caterers, such as Glorious Foods, treat the waiters as employees
and pay taxes accordingly. The union claims that Cipriani keeps the
22 percent service fee he charges, rather than turning it over to
the waiters as a gratuity. Cipriani contends that the fee is not a
gratuity, but is used to pay the waiters.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute prompted the Rainforest Foundation, which held its
annual fund-raising dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street in April, to
send Cipriani a critical letter and vow to pay the waiters the
difference between Cipriani's wages and union scale. (With a
gratuity, that scale is about $36 an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cipriani reign in New York has been marked by great success
and periodic blow-ups with food critics, investors and the union.
Arrigo Cipriani opened Harry Cipriani in 1985, at the urging of his
friend Lord Charles Forte, whose hotel company, Trusthouse Forte,
had the lease for the space at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth
Avenue. But when the Ciprianis opened a competing restaurant 20
months later called Bellini at what is now the Michelangelo Hotel
at Seventh Avenue and 50th Street, Trusthouse ejected the Ciprianis
from the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Ciprianis were invited back to the Sherry Netherland in
1991, after the Trusthouse lease expired. Three years later, the
Ciprianis abruptly closed Bellini, refusing to pay more than
$200,000 in wages and benefits to the union employees, and the
Michelangelo was forced to pay the bill. Cipriani said his family
closed Bellini to focus on Harry Cipriani, but a Michelangelo
executive said that the Ciprianis had fallen out with an investor.
In any event, Arrigo Cipriani was not keen on doing room service or
cooking hamburgers for the hotel's customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say, `Cipriani doesn't do hamburgers,''' said
Elisabetta Fabri, president of the Michelangelo. ``They have their
own style, and if you want to be partners with them it has to be
their way. The product is good but it's not out of this world.
Still, I was sad to see them go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ciprianis did not attempt to expand again until 1996, when
Giuseppe opened Downtown in Soho, with backing from another
longtime customer, Richard Rubin, the former chief executive of
Donnkenny Inc., who pleaded guilty in February to federal charges
of securities fraud. Rubin, Cipriani said, also helped him
financially at Cipriani 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurateur's friends say that Giuseppe has cast off his
playboy image and become something of a workaholic. A former race
car driver, he now travels in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes 500 and
has dropped out of the club-hopping circuit, settling into a
three-year-long relationship with a fashion model, Steevie
VanderVeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a misperception that he's growing too quickly,'' said
Jeffrey Goldberger, a real estate investor friendly with Cipriani.
``He's absorbed those acquisitions with great ease. He's really hit
the ground running, doing business from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Ciprianis' attempt to become a major restaurant and
catering company has raised hackles with more than just Local 6.
The same hubris that led the family into what could be a no-win
battle with the union, many people in the restaurant industry said,
has fueled its their decision to open what are essentially
competing catering halls.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which has very firm ideas about everything from the
size and shape of its tables _ small, round and short-legged _ to
its billing procedures, has alienated some of the party planners
and clients who have used Cipriani 42nd Street or 55 Wall Street,
which they all describe as breathtaking venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the more frustrating experiences I've had,''
said Fern Mallis, executive director of the Council of Fashion
Designers of America, which had booked its annual gala into 55 Wall
Street last year. ``There was a manner of doing business with us
that I found to be less than accommodating. The range of food
services are not quite as vast as the other top caterers'.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ciprianis have also had to retreat. Cipriani has scrapped
plans to revive the Fashion Cafe, a theme restaurant, at Grand
Central Terminal. And he is leaving the hotel and catering project
at 55 Wall Street, which was called Cipriani Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani had teamed up with Stanley Kimmel, the chairman of
Jones Apparel Group, who bought the landmark marble rotunda in
1997, to create a hotel and catering hall in the financial
district. Cipriani booked Jennings' wedding, Sean (Puffy) Combs'
birthday party and a Giorgio Armani fashion show. He also started a
concert series in which patrons paid $120,000 for a table to see
performers like Rod Stewart and Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, however, Kimmel and his partner, T. Richard
Butera, brought in Regent International Hotels to run the project.
Butera said that there had been construction delays and cost
overruns on the hotel, while Cipriani needed to concentrate on the
Rainbow Room and Cipriani 42nd Street. The concert series had lost
a small fortune, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too big a job,'' Butera said. ``Running a restaurant is
something the Ciprianis do out of their back pocket. But it's a
different thing to run a five-star hotel. There was a mutual
realization that we were heading for difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Butera said it was an amicable decision. Kimmel, who did not
return calls requesting comment, bought out Cipriani's management
contract at 55 Wall Street. And with Cipriani needing money for
renovations at the Rainbow Room and at Cipriani 42nd Street, Kimmel
doubled his stake in Cipriani International to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Butera said he continued to admire Cipriani's talent as a
restaurateur and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they could be the largest restaurateurs in New York,''
Butera said. ``I hope he gets through his problems with the union.
He has to somehow come to grips with them. Other than that, the kid
is unbelievable.''

BILL SEEKS TO CURB Y2K LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: A coalition of watchdog groups is asking consumers to
bombard Washington with protest letters, part of an effort aimed at
blocking legislation approved by the U.S. House this week that
would curb Y2K liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union, Public Citizen and the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group are leading the protest against the Year 2000
Readiness and Responsibility Act. A similar bill could be
considered by the Senate as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation, backed by the computer industry, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, passed the House on
Thursday by a vote of 236-190. The legislation would put caps on
punitive damage awards, make potential plaintiffs wait 90 days
before filing suits, encourage mediation and limit class-action
lawsuits relating to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was pulled from the Senate two weeks ago because
of protests from the White House and some Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill pits the interests of big businesses that do not
want to be held accountable for their defective products against
small businesses and individual consumers who will be the ones hurt
by Y2K,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one commentator has noted, this bill `looks like it was
written by Bill Gates on a napkin while having cocktails with
Donald Trump,''' Claybrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, founded by Ralph Nader, has set up a special
free fax service on the organization's Web site that allows
consumers to fax their senators from the Internet for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fax your senator to oppose Y2K immunity for big business,''
the Web site said. The fax site is at
www.citizen.org//faxserver//letter2//step1.htm. ---A couple is
hunkered down in their bomb shelter with a stock of pickled eggs,
kilos of toilet paper, potted meat, and breath spray.
</P>
<P>
   In another spot, hundreds of depositors are milling about a bank
waiting to withdraw their cash before a computer glitch leaves them
penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that ``Y2K'' actually means ``Yes to Kia,'' the Irving,
Calif.-based Kia Motors America advises consumers in a national ad
campaign now airing on cable not to worry about imminent disaster
as the century shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a broad and well-publicized global event and
turned it on its ear,'' said Fred Golldberg, CEO of the San
Francisco firm that created the ad. ``The Y2K issue is full of
intrigue, suspense and fear. The advertising makes it humorous and
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Bankers Association is not laughing. They insist
Kia should pull the parody ads because they give bankers a black
eye. In a letter to the bankers and federal regulators, the car
maker says the spot, expected to run until June 1, is not intended
to create panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ... a joke,'' Kia spokesman Monica Miller said. ``But you
know those bankers.'' ---
</P>
<P>
   Kansas National Guard officials learned two things during a
national Y2K communications drill earlier this month: Some
high-frequency radios don't work and those that do should be used
early in the morning or late at night when the signal strength is
best.
</P>
<P>
   As a regional control center, it was the job of Guard officials
in Topeka to send signal tests every hour for 24 hours to command
posts in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some radios flunked the test, said Guard spokesman Joy Moser,
while some radio signals were weak during the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials nationwide will run a similar test Sept. 1 to
see how prepared state armories are in the advent of a Y2K
communications blackout. Of Kansas' 56 armories, 21 still need
work, said Lt. Col. Mike Miller. The deadline for all work is Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to be prepared and not need (the radios), than to
need the capability and not be prepared,'' Miller said.

HOW STRONG IS THE INFLATION PRESSURE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Does a one-month inflationary blip on the Consumer
Price Index radar screen signal the end of U.S. price stability?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the financial market's initial reaction to Friday's
CPI report, it seems reasonable to think so. The revelation that
consumer prices took their biggest monthly jump in nearly nine
years put Wall Street in retreat, as stock prices tumbled and bond
rates surged.
</P>
<P>
   The overall CPI rose 0.7 percent last month, which wasn't much
higher than consensus expectations. What jarred the markets,
however, was a 0.4 percent gain for the so-called core rate, which
excludes the volatile food and energy components.
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters had expected only a 0.1 percent rise for the
core rate, based on assumptions that rising oil prices would fuel
most of the CPI's gain. As things turned out, the energy
component's increase was not only a record, but also was
accompanied by serious price pops over a broad range of items.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seldom does anything in moderation, and Friday was
no exception. A good rule of thumb, however, is that the greater
Wall Street's overreaction, the better the chance things aren't as
bad as they seem.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective, as always, is key. Friday's report, for instance,
made much of the fact that the core rate's surge was the sharpest
monthly jump since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Think back to what has been happening since. Looking
beyond the core rate, the overall CPI rose 2.5 percent in '95. The
following year brought a slight resurgence, as the CPI rose 3.3
percent in '96. A cooling period then followed, with the inflation
rate dipping to 1.7 percent 1997 and to 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of inflation, incidentally, was all the more
remarkable in the context of a strong economy and a tightening
labor market that pushed the jobless rate down to levels not seen
in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping things in perspective demands taking the long view of
economic developments. It also demands taking into account all of
inflation's contributing factors, of which the cost of labor is the
most critical. Despite the tight job market, subdued labor costs
are a primary reason for the recent absence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are signs that the U.S. economy is entering an
era of strong productivity gains fueled by computers, which will be
to the early 21st century what electricity was to the early 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In order for inflation to occur, there must be inflationary
dynamics in play. So far nothing happening in the U.S. economy
provides valid evidence of incipient hyperinflation except energy
prices. Energy price scares have been a cyclical thing for the past
20 years, though. Nevertheless, periods of energy price spikes have
been short-lived, while the periods of relatively low energy prices
have been long.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is monetary policy to consider for those who
believe inflation is strictly a monetary phenomenon. On this count,
there seems little to worry about as long as inflation hawk Alan
Greenspan remains Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, in other words, is a chimera. There's much out there
that might bring the good times to an end, but inflation isn't one
of them in the absence of inflationary dynamics.

   MISSIONARY-ABUSE _ From 1950 until 1971, children in the Mamou
Alliance Academy were routinely abused, physically, sexually and
psychologically. The African school served about 200 children of
missionaries from the U.S.-based Missionary Alliance (now the
Christian and Missionary Alliance) and other missionary
organizations until it was closed in 1971. When, decades later,
accusations of the long-grown children came to light, the Christian
and Missionary Alliance, which had run the boarding school, did not
take legal advice to deny and ignore the whole scandal, but ordered
a full-scale, independent investigation that confirmed many of the
allegations. Reports made public in late 1998 concluded that scores
of acts of repeated abuse occurred at the school _ from children
being forced to eat their own vomit, to bloody beatings with a
piece of rubber tire to repeated molestation by both male and
female staff members of both male and female students. Many of
those former children and some denominational officials are

   KIRK-FORDICE _ JACKSON, Miss. _ The last days of Kirk Fordice.
Mississippi's governor came out eight years ago and was the first
Republican since Reconstruction to win the job. But he has since
fallen from grace, to say the least. He is reviled by both
Democrats and Republicans, who say he is cruel, vicious, and
impossible to communicate with. He is the ultimate anti-politician
- whatever the legislature wants, no matter how hard it would be to
oppose, he opposes. He's practically the only politician who has
publicly come out in full support of the Council of Conservative
Citizens, the group that got Trent Lott in so much trouble. The
Legislature tried to pass a law banning dogs in the capitol because
Fordice kept walking his through. And what about that mysterious
wreck several years ago, after the three-hour lunch with a woman in
Memphis? We look into this veto record, and talk to legislators and
others around the state about what happened to this guy.

UPSTART TEAMS SHOWING NO RESPECT FOR THEIR ELDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Iverson scooted past Anfernee Hardaway in Orlando. Jason
Williams and Chris Webber didn't respect their Utah elders. And a
team that relies heavily on Isaiah Rider cruised into the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   All around the National Basketball Association last week, a
league few old-school curmudgeons wanted kept emerging. From
Sacramento to Philadelphia, the tried-and-true notion that stable,
veteran teams compete for titles _ and neophytes with tattoos don't
_ took a beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you even saw in the second game of the Minnesota-San
Antonio series,'' said Madison Square Garden president Dave
Checketts. ``The Minnesota kids _ and they're really all young kids
_ were playing very aggressively, playing with a lot of confidence,
hitting big shots at the end of a game. So there is a newer breed
of youth, energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that's even more the result of this whole thing
really being up for grabs. I don't think anyone is heavily favored
to win it all. It is wide open. A team that plays well and with
energy has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention in the NBA once said you needed a team to stay
together for a while to do well in the post-season, and that
entrusting your playoff hopes to 20-something players with limited
experience would only mean trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Before John Stockton hit a clutch jump shot Friday night with
less than a second remaining to force a Game 5 in Utah on Sunday,
Williams and Webber had helped put Sacramento on the brink of a
monumental upset. For most of the series, the Kings have played
with the exuberance of children at the park while the Jazz has
stodgily plodded upcourt, viewing each possession as a
life-altering moment.
</P>
<P>
   No one can keep up with Iverson, who staked the 76ers to a 2-1
in their first-round series against Orlando. Kevin Garnett was
giving the San Antonio Spurs of David Robinson all kinds of
problems in Game 2. And beyond all the problems Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant were creating for Houston's geriatric ward, the
once-combustible Portland Trail Blazers swept Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   None other than Pat Riley, his team facing long odds before it
evened the series with the Knicks on Friday, seemed to realize the
future was quickly becoming the present, that building a team of
aging warriors may not be the way to get the job done in the NBA
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different freshness; there's a new kid on the
block,'' Riley said last Thursday. ``And the new kid on the block
is hunger, excitement, enthusiasm and a chance to perform on a
platform they've never been on before.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I see that being the difference from some of the teams
that have been there before, that are sort of used to the routine
and getting into the playoffs and having good regular-season
records. Those teams are running into some ferocious energy on the
part of teams that may have been out of it, and all of a sudden the
hunger and enthusiasm is rising above the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   If this indeed is the advent of a new era, the counterculture
hero is making a big push for those marketing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be Iverson, Rider, Webber, Williams or, yes, Latrell
Sprewell, players with controversy and calamity in their past are
moving to the forefront in the playoffs. The NBA is not about
Michael Jordan peeking at Bugs Bunny through a Warner Brothers hole
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It is about Sprewell having cornrows sowed into his hair,
looking at the camera and intoning: ``Some people think I'm what's
wrong with sports. Some people say I'm America's nightmare.'' With
Jimi Hendrix's version of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' blaring in
the background, Sprewell ends his new And 1 commercial by adding,
chillingly, ``I say I'm the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento Is Sweet on Kings
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jazz before them, the Sacramento Kings appear to be
that rare small-market franchise enrapturing its homespun town
after years of futility. Everyone in California's capital, it
seems, is gaga over the league's most entertaining team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a national perception, but truthfully, it's not very
accurate,'' said Jerry Reynolds, the team's vice president of
player personnel, who has been with the organization since it moved
West from Kansas City in 1985. ``Our fans even have short memories
and have jumped on the bandwagon to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we've been bad before. But it hasn't exactly been
Clipper stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though they're making only their third playoff
appearance since the franchise moved, the Kings sold out Arco Arena
for 10 straight seasons at one juncture. Only three seasons ago,
the Kings had top-seeded Seattle on the ropes in the first round
before Gary Payton miraculously pulled out Game 3 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Having had a taste of the post-season, Kings fans finally became
fed up with their beleaguered team last season. With Mitch Richmond
asking for a trade and the franchise floundering, the atmosphere
became venomous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time they really turned on us, where it got
nasty,'' Reynolds said. ``I guess after all the loyalty they showed
early on, you couldn't blame `em.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing Vlade Divac, drafting Jason Williams and trading
Richmond for Chris Webber, general manager Geoff Petrie overhauled
the roster and assembled a free-wheeling bunch of passers and
scorers, the team that is going the distance against Utah on Sunday
at the Delta Center. Outside of professional wrestling and tractor
pulls, the Kings are again the hottest ticket in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a couple got together, got really mad at each other
and broke up for a while,'' Reynolds said. ``Then, they find out
they really like each other after all and get back together. But it
got ugly for a while, no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond making personnel decisions, Reynolds, 55, has scouted,
coached and performed every imaginable duty for the organization
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Before teams began bringing in five-person coaching staffs,
Reynolds was an assistant coach when teams had only two people on
the bench. Besides his current duties, he is also the general
manager of the Monarchs, Sacramento's Women's National Basketball
Association franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have three guys do what I did and pay them three
times what I made,'' he said laughing. ``Looking back, I guess I
feel cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the league's more colorful characters, he is the
second-most-popular person in his hometown of French Lick, Ind. As
he is fond of saying, ``People know Larry Bird just a tiny bit more
than they know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy Goes Unappreciated
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy may coach his last game with the Knicks on Sunday
in Miami. Amid the perception that he simply did not prepare his
talented team well enough over the last three years, he will most
likely be relieved of his duties if the Knicks lose in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   As with Patrick Ewing, when Van Gundy is gone, maybe then he
will be truly appreciated for not only his effort but also his
foresight and talent.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to motivate injury-prone players with major
chemistry and character problems will most likely shine through
once someone else is hired to coach this overhyped team.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, other people in the organization are taking credit for
the sudden development of Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   When his job was in jeopardy earlier this season, Van Gundy
stuck to his guns and made the timid Camby earn his playing time.
He was taken to task for not starting Sprewell, but that energy
infusion off the bench finally seems to be paying off after a long
adjustment period.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he could be petty and too often he treated basketball as
war, as did Riley before him. And maybe the politics of the Garden
finally got to him, and made him something more than a coach,
something that even he never wanted to be. But whatever happens, no
one could have taken this group of players farther.
</P>
<P>
   He is a very good coach in charge of some very flawed New York
teams. &QL;

WOMAN'S VIBRANT SPIRIT BLOOMED WHILE WORKING WITH WPA WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Betrenia Bowker is a petite and dignified
86-year-old woman who once ran with the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting recently in her pleasant Kansas City home, talking
quietly of old times, she dropped only the faintest hint that in
summer 1936 she fell in with the wildest bunch of writers,
painters, brawlers, poets and raw-jaw radicals who ever knocked
back a boilermaker in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that summer in St. Louis was hot,'' is what she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that can be taken two ways. Because it was hot that summer,
literally hot, 100 degrees for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to St. Louis, I actually saw the mercury
shoot right through the top of a thermometer on a building,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She saw other things: Depression homeless sleeping in doorways;
union picket lines and unemployment demonstrations; radical
speakers on almost every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the heat to which she alluded had more than one source.
Fresh-faced and fresh out of Drury College in Springfield,
Mo.,Bowker had unknowingly leaped into a political cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   She had been hired by the Works Progress Administration to help
put out the Missouri edition of the now-famed WPA state-guide
series. The guides were prepared by unemployed writers hired by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the guide was way behind schedule,'' she said, ``and the
people in Washington were getting impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowker saw the problem immediately. Missouri's project
administrators were at war with the guide's writing staff, a group
that included Missouri-born Jack Conroy, already noted for his
classic Depression novel ``The Disinherited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conroy and the other writers wanted to produce an honest,
literary portrait of Missouri,'' Bowker said. ``But the
administrators, real political hacks, wanted a sanitized,
chamber-of-commerce tourist guide.''
</P>
<P>
   When Conroy wrote a section on Missouri culture that highlighted
Ozark folk ballads and black music, he was ``reprimanded'' for not
hyping tonier subjects such as the symphony orchestras in St. Louis
and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle was on,'' Bowker said, ``and it was getting hotter
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Writers' Program was based on the ninth floor of
the Civil Courts Building in downtown St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   From there it was a short ramble to the old Mississippi
riverfront levee, where the writers gathered almost nightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go down to the river at about 10 p.m. and stay until 2 in
the morning, drinking and talking about writing and politics,''
Bowker said. ``And when all those fascinating, worldly people
discussed their views on social justice, well, they made sense to
me. I became a left-wing New Dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowker had grown up in southern Missouri, one of seven children
in a very proper, very conservative home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had twin sisters, two years older than I was,'' she said.
``And when they turned 16, they each asked for a raisin pie and
permission to say `Gosh.' That should give you an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, Bowker had read of Voltaire and the Age of
Enlightenment, and she dreamed of finding true companions to match
her secret rebel spirit.
</P>
<P>
   She found them on the St. Louis riverfront, eight or nine
kindred souls who made her feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fascinating part is that Betrenia was so plain-spoken and
intelligent that she more than held her own with those wild,
hard-living characters,'' said Douglas Wixson, a social historian
and Conroy biographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She proved tough and savvy, and they all fell in love with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy was the leader of that literary wild bunch. Raised in a
tough mining camp, barrel-chested, stentorian-voiced, he bellowed
even in private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have a beer with him and imagine he was addressing a
huge throng of coal miners,'' Bowker said.
</P>
<P>
   He was bellowing more than usual that summer. In a constant rage
about the state guide, he blew off steam in riverfront saloons.
</P>
<P>
   His regular drinking crew included poet William ``Wallie''
Wharton and other guide writers such as Edwa Moser, Jean Winkler,
Jack Balch and Milton Lomask. They adopted Bowker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd always wanted to see a barroom brawl, and they kept
trying to find me one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me places (strip joints and honky tonks) where women
did things I didn't know human beings could do. We went to bars
with sawdust on the floor and people singing and making speeches
and reciting poetry from on top of the tables.''
</P>
<P>
   She was enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first cigarette? they'd ask me. Is this your
first shot of whiskey? Of course, they never took me along to the
really rough places where they hung out in East St. Louis. They
were very protective of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing her barroom brawls, they wrote her about them
after she returned to Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fightin', fightin', all night,'' Winkler wrote in one letter
to Bowker. ``One man'd go down and the winner would take on
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And though they excluded her from the harder side of their boozy
nights, they did include her in their almost daily escapades, often
led by Wharton, a brilliant satirist and merry prankster.
</P>
<P>
   ``A men's clothing association was trying to popularize shorts
for men that summer,'' Bowker recalled. ``So they offered free
drinks to any man who walked into a bar wearing shorts. Wallie
walked in wearing his underpants. He got the free drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wharton also enjoyed playing a world-weary cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on to your pure and lovely innocence, Betrenia,'' he
would intone. ``Oh, if I could just recover mine once more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever recover it?'' she once asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, yes, many times, but I just keep losing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   After that summer, Bowker went back to Springfield to work as
the guide's regional editor there. She left the project entirely in
1937, as did most of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   The WPA Guide to Missouri remained mired in conflict. The book
was not published until 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The fears expressed by Conroy and the others proved
well-grounded. Most of their work was edited out and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we would have produced,'' said Bowker, who
taught school for a while, married, moved to Kansas City, raised a
family and became a successful free-lance magazine writer.
</P>
<P>
   In time she lost touch with most of the St. Louis bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' she said, ``1936 seemed long, long in the past.
But recently those memories have been coming back to me. And I've
been thinking more and more about that wonderful hot summer in St.
Louis.''

REAL ESTATE: THE MANY LIFESTYLES OF HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Maine, N.Y., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was of the essence to Michele Edwards and her three
siblings during the winter of 1998. Her mother, May, who was then
86 and who suffers from memory loss, had broken her hip and had
been moved out of her home in Greenwich, Conn., and into the
rehabilitation wing of a local nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   But the move soon proved to be a mistake. Despite a good
reputation, the nursing home had a rigid, unfeeling edge to it
that, Mrs. Edwards said, manifested itself among other things in a
strict bathroom policy: Assistance was allowed only at certain
scheduled times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the family began to scramble for alternative living
arrangements _ screening a dozen facilities for the elderly
nationwide _ they ran into a new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, they had to pin down exactly what their mother's needs
were. And then they had to learn the differences among a
bewildering array of terms, like special-care facilities, skilled
nursing and assisted living, with each term representing a class of
services that seemed to have almost as many variations as price
tags.
</P>
<P>
   Their quandary is hardly unique. In recent years the options for
people who are often making what may be their last move have
exploded both in terms of numbers and complexity of choices. For
many consumers, the options have fostered a sense of relief; no
longer do they, or their loved ones, have to stick to one of two
basic choices: minimal-care retirement homes or medically intensive
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are lots of variations in between. There are still
plenty of independence-oriented retirement centers where services
are usually limited to housing and meals. But many nursing homes
have broadened their service palette by adding facilities for both
independent living and what is called assisted living, designed for
residents who generally need help with just two or three daily
activities, such as bathing and dressing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Seniors Housing Association, a trade
group for developers, assisted-living facilities now account for
about three-quarters of the new senior housing being built.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the stand-alone assisted-living facilities that have
sprouted over the last decade are transforming themselves into
so-called continuing-care communities that often combine, on a
lush, campuslike setting, apartments for independent living, an
assisted-living facility, skilled-nursing beds and special-care
facilities for residents who have medical conditions like
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some continuing-care facilities bill themselves as ``life-care''
communities; in exchange for an often hefty entrance fee, as well
as monthly service charges, they provide unlimited medical care to
residents as they need it at no additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   Most such communities, however, charge residents for the care as
it is required. Some help in paying certain bills may come from
Medicare, which will pick up short-term medical costs, like
hospitalization. However, when it comes to the long-term care
provided by the senior living industry, consumers generally foot
the bill themselves, sometimes with the assistance of private
long-term care insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in what is called senior living credit a host of
factors for the diversity. First, the elderly population, many of
whom can be expected to need long-term care at some point, is
growing quickly. Meanwhile, both because of efforts to contain
costs and because of concerns in many states about quality of care,
the construction of new nursing homes ground to a virtual halt long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior-living industry is also reinventing itself to
meet what are, in many cases, increasingly sophisticated consumer
preferences, not just for larger living quarters, but also for
smaller, more homelike buildings in which to house them.
</P>
<P>
   One trend has been the effort to take advantage of new findings
in gerontology to make notable changes in the physical plans of
many facilities. One such change has been the incorporation of
circular building designs that let residents who have conditions
like Alzheimer's wander freely without leaving a facility's
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that badly stubbed its toes in the 1980s
when everyone rushed out and built one Taj Mahal after the next,
very little of which had any service or care component to it,''
said David Schless, executive director of the American Seniors
Housing Association, the developers' trade group. ``People were
building very upscale properties, but they discovered that very few
seniors were interested. So now they're building units that offer
more value and more service.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many consumers, the options have only intensified the
head-scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Take the range of financing options available. Assisted-living
facilities typically offer services for about half the price of
skilled-nursing care; in exchange, residents generally agree to
share responsibility for certain basic personal chores, as well as
to forfeit the continual clinical supervision of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, assisted-living facilities vary enormously in their
monthly fees, depending on where they're located, as well as the
type of accommodation or degree of medical services that a resident
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly fees can be less than $1,000, or more than $4,000. But
as an assisted-living resident becomes less independent and
requires more help with tasks like bathing and using the toilet,
costs can climb quickly, cautions Gregory Seal, a certified
financial planner in Denver, whose firm handles many long-term care
matters.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, he said, nursing homes may offer care that is not
only cheaper, but also more qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the marketing that an assisted-living facility may do
to indicate that you can stay there forever, as you become more
dependent you will require a type of care that perhaps the facility
isn't prepared to give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what kind of continuing-care or life-care community
makes sense is often no less complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance fees for life-care communities in the New York
metropolitan area, for example, can range from $170,000 to
$500,000, with monthly service fees that range from $1,900 to
$4,300.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly service fees at life-care centers usually stay the same,
their operators say as part of their sales pitch, even if a
resident requires more complex care later on. And in the long run,
a life-care community might cost a consumer less than a standard
continuing-care facility.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that life-care communities usually offer refunds
of at least 90 percent of residents' entrance fee when they leave
the community. In case of death, the resident's estate gets the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Most continuing-care facilities initially charge monthly service
fees only. In exchange, some provide an average of 120 days of
medical care a year (consumers pay for extra care), while others
require only that consumers pay daily rates for any long-term
nursing care that they may need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-size-fits-all industry,'' said Michael
Ruffer, executive vice president and chief operating officer at
Marriott Senior Living Services, a division of Marriott
International. ``And because there are so many different products
on the market, it really makes sense for the prospective resident
and their families to learn what their options are.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ruffer conceded that consumer confusion over terminology within
the senior-living industry has been ``huge,'' with consumers, among
other things, often confusing assisted living with home health
care, an entirely different industry.
</P>
<P>
   To clear up some of the confusion, some newly developing
continuing-care facilities, like the Andrus Retirement Community in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., refer to themselves as ``full-service
retirement communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Terminology within the assisted-living industry certainly hasn't
been helped by the way the industry is regulated.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robert Mollica, deputy director of the National
Academy for State Health Policy, a nonprofit organization in
Portland, Maine, every state currently has some type of
assisted-living regulations on its books, but often the states use
a basket of names to refer to assisted-living centers; some of the
more common ones are residential care, personal care, basic care,
domiciliary care, housing with services, and board and care.
</P>
<P>
   Mollica added that only 25 states now had regulations that
specifically use the ``assisted living'' term, while three states
have regulations pending, and an additional half-dozen are either
studying the industry or drafting regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But states also differ widely in their assisted-living
standards. Staff training requirements vary widely, for example, as
do standards for living arrangements, with some states requiring
apartment settings, while others allow shared bedrooms. To further
complicate matters, a few states require that medical services be
provided by a licensed home health agency, while others allow
assisted-living facilities to either hire private nurses or use
their own personnel.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mollica, New Jersey requires assisted-living
industry staffers to have training in areas such as basic nursing,
hygiene, infection prevention, and working with the needs of the
elderly. New York does not have the same requirements, while
Connecticut simply requires that staffers be trained to meet the
needs of the residents they serve.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even those states that appear to regulate and license
assisted-living facilities may not regulate all of them, said
Cynthia Rudder, director of the Nursing Home Community Coalition of
New York State, a New York City group that says it represents 30
consumer, professional and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, unlike most other states, regulations and
licensing for assisted living applies only to those programs that
receive public money, and which admit people who would otherwise go
to a nursing home,'' said Ms. Rudder. ``That means there is a whole
host of new, privately sponsored assisted-living residences that
are being built and that, with the exception of a some housing
regulations that apply to things like fire codes, are effectively
not regulated. We think consumers need to ask really good questions
when they visit these facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Ms. Rudder urges consumers to ask about
admission and discharge criteria, staff training credentials, and
financial issues, such as what might happen to the resident if he
or she were to run out of money to pay for their care.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to bring a common language of standards,
as well as quality, to the assisted-living industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, a coalition of six organizations, including the
Alzheimer's Association and the American Association for Retired
Persons, announced a national quality initiative to help states set
minimum assisted-living standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``States argue that assisted-living residents can vote with
their pockets, but the reality is that once someone moves in it
often takes a lot for them to leave _ and often the move is
traumatic,'' said Rhonda Buckner, director of the Consumer
Consortium on Assisted Living in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite growing competition within the senior-living
industry, it's not clear whether many consumers really can vote
with their pockets, because of the rapidly ballooning elderly
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The costs of these facilities are not going down _ they're
going up,'' said William Steinberg, a long-term care benefits
consultant with Hirschfeld, Stern, Moyer &AMP; Ross, a New York-based
firm that specializes in employee benefit programs. ``In the Sun
Belt states, they can't build them fast enough. The industry isn't
oversubscribed, and it won't be for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Seniors Housing Association,
assisted-living facilities now account for about three-quarters of
the housing being built for the elderly, with development activity
currently strongest in Florida, Texas, California and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the situation just a few years ago, most
assisted-living facilities are now being built as part of larger
senior-housing communities, to allow residents to ``age in place,''
an idea that has taken hold of the entire senior-living industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, the idea of aging in place was seen as a
problem because many facilities couldn't offer a lot of services,''
said Deborah Cloud, director of communications for the American
Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which represents
the not-for-profit side of the senior-living industry. ``Now we
look at it not as a problem, but as a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Andrus Retirement Community, in Hastings-on-Hudson,
certainly sees it as a goal. Andrus opened its doors in 1953 and
now serves mostly women, who average 86 years in age, and who live
in a nine-story building with hotel-style rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But starting next summer, Andrus, a not-for-profit retirement
community, will be overhauled to cater to people who are roughly 10
years younger. As such, it will offer six new buildings, as well as
some 200 independent-living apartments, 24 assisted-living suites,
48 skilled-nursing beds, and facilities that will include a cafe, a
computer room, a wellness center, and a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrus was appropriate for retirement living in the 1950s, but
it's not right for what we need now,'' said Skip Kedney, a partner
at Retirement Living Services in Hartford, Conn., which is
co-developing the new community with Beth Abraham Health Services,
a New York City-based, nonprofit provider of both long-term care
and rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, consumers are cottoning to the growing service
orientation within the senior-living industry. Take Mrs. Edwards,
who last winter picked an assisted-living facility that now houses
both her mother and her father, who suffers from less serious
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, in Stamford, Conn., is run by Marriott Senior
Living Services, under the Brighton Gardens banner. According to
Mrs. Edwards, it won her family over with its flexibility, because
it was the only assisted-living center that was willing to
accommodate both her parents in a single room.
</P>
<P>
   Other facilities, she said, either wouldn't accept her mother,
because she requires more care then her father, or insisted that
the family hire a private nurse to offer additional care to her
mother, which would have roughly doubled the cost.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Edwards, her parents' assisted-living costs,
now roughly $5,500 a month including such extras as dry cleaning
and haircuts, add up to roughly half of what a skilled-nursing home
might cost for just one person.
</P>
<P>
   More senior-living facilities are trying to accommodate those
couples where one member may be healthy but the other is frail.
Meanwhile, others are trying to alter the image that the services
they offer are typically for the well-off. For some consumers, that
image has been cemented by developments that have marketed
amenities like bistros and grand staircases, often presented in the
form of well-appointed Victorian manors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a good deal of product out there that is
oriented toward the middle-income senior,'' with monthly fees of
$1,700 to $2,000 a month,'' said Schless at the American Seniors
Housing Association. Even in large metropolitan areas like New
York, he added, ``there's a broad range of product.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York state the life-care concept is still a relatively
new one, because the state didn't authorize such communities until
1989, and since then it has used strict criteria to oversee their
development. Part of New York's strict approach can be traced back
to the state's nursing-home scandals of some years ago.
</P>
<P>
   New life-care communities, however, are breaking ground.
Kedney's company, for example, is developing, in collaboration with
Hebrew Hospital Senior Housing Inc., a life-care community on 30
acres in the Westchester community of Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   Called Westchester Meadows, the facility is scheduled to open in
2001. It will offer facilities such as a convenience store in
addition to 20 assisted-living beds, 10 skilled-nursing beds, and
120 one- and two-bedroom independent-living apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Westchester Meadows won't be cheap. Entrance fees, depending on
the type of living arrangements, will range from $191,000 to
$427,000, 90 percent of which will be returned at the end of the
resident's stay, while monthly service fees will range from $1,950
to $3,600. Residents will also be expected to put down an
additional $18,000, to cover the costs of any future
skilled-nursing care.
</P>
<P>
   Kedney said that Westchester Meadows had already received
initial $1,000 deposits from some 140 individuals or couples.
Still, he conceded that selling consumers on the life-care concept,
especially within a consumer-savvy New York area market, has been
more of an educational process than his company had anticipated.
One problem, he said, is that developments such as his are
targeting healthy, independent seniors, while the ``life care''
term implies to some consumers that such seniors aren't well at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard response that we've heard is `Well, this sounds
wonderful, but I'm not ready for it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers, however, are embracing the idea eagerly. Take
Morton Bailey and his wife, Marian. In March 1997, the couple, who
are in their mid-70s and who live in Ridgefield, Conn., put 10
percent down toward a 1,380-square-foot two-bedroom condominium
(now worth $450,000) at Meadow Ridge, a life-care community that is
scheduled to open next year in neighboring Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a former magazine publisher, has a few physical
ailments, as does Mrs. Bailey, a former schoolteacher. ``We did it
just for common sense,'' said Bailey, adding that the couple's
decision was also prompted by having to pay the bill for his
mother, who spent the last five years of her life needing long-term
health care, but who had no insurance to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on the aging urge consumers to also look at the
long-term social benefits of such postretirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social isolation is devastating,'' said Dr. Melvyn Hecht, the
chief medical officer at Youville Lifecare, a newly expanded
community for the elderly in Cambridge, Mass. ``It often leads to
functional decline, depression and weight loss. When we see these
signs, that's when we start recommending assisted living.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht recommends that consumers begin to assess their possible
senior-living needs as early as possible, before a medical crisis
sets in. Too often, he said, that is when most people begin to
scramble for help.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edwards agrees. Her parents, she said, are now comfortable
at their new, one-room home in Stamford, where among, other things,
they have access to their own doctors, as well as to free
transportation for activities like going to church. Still, she
said, reflecting on the considerable work her family had to do to
find care that would be both high in quality and comfortable for
her parents, ``as a family, we had a lot of catching up to do.''

POWERBOATING: MANUFACTURERS COURT AMATEURS WITH NEW CLASS FOR
RACING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's usually the big, tricked-out Superboats with their
churning, 1,000-horsepower engines that draw crowds at offshore
powerboat races. Now, less-imposing production boats are beginning
to draw crowds of their own. Their footsteps lead directly to the
amateur boater's door.
</P>
<P>
   Jim York knows the path. Having recently bought a new 38-foot
Cigarette racer, York plans to compete May 16 in the U.S. Grand
Prix at Point Pleasant, N.J. His boat has two factory-sealed
engines, each 500-horsepower, which can produce speeds of 80 miles
an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   Having his own race boat is a new experience for York, the owner
of a construction firm from Richmond, Va.. His previous powerboat
was a recreational craft, albeit a high-performance Cigarette model
called Top Gun. But he raced it only occasionally, mostly in
amateur meets around home.
</P>
<P>
   With his new boat, which York has named Cigarette Havoline, he
is competing at the highest level of powerboat racing. That
includes the seven-event Super Boat International circuit and other
competitions, such as those sponsored by U.S. Offshore and the
American Power Boat Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are boats you can actually race, and still use with your
family on weekends,'' York said. ``Before these factory boats were
built, you had to race in 30-foot custom boats with engines that
had to be pulled after every race. That got expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   New rules set up about two years ago by race planners and
Mercury executives make for a more level playing field. By agreeing
to develop two classes of production race boats _ Factory I and II
_ the industry hopes to sell more boats.
</P>
<P>
   The new factory boats all have the same Mercury engines, which
cannot be modified regardless of who makes the boat. And the hulls
must be vee-shaped rather than designed with a two-hulled catamaran
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the idea seems to be working. ``The intent is to bring
the average guy into racing, and not have to spend a lot more money
once he's in it,'' Donny Wadeck, project manager for high
performance boats at Wellcraft, said recently. ``He can use the F-I
or F-II for a recreation if he doesn't want to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the boats' price requires a commitment. A new F-II
racer from Cigarette costs about $250,000; a comparable Top Gun
recreational powerboat costs about $280,000, said Tom Kosto, vice
president of sales at Cigarette. The racing version weighs about
800 pounds less than the 9,000-pound pleasure-boating model.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boats are giving people something to do other than being
by themselves out on the water,'' Kosto added.
</P>
<P>
   John Carbonell, president of Super Boat International, agreed
that the factory models seem to be catching on. Race organizers are
preparing themselves by making rules for boaters who may not have
adequate experience in racing such fast boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new racer has to stay at the back of the pack,'' Carbonell
said. ``The boat has to be 100 to 200 feet behind the other boats.
And the team has to have the same physicals and safety checks
before the start of a race as the bigger boats. They can still get
into trouble, but it's not the same as doing 120 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the purchase price, Cigarette includes race uniforms,
life jackets and helmets equipped with an onboard intercom system.
The company will also furnish a qualified racing partner if the new
owner requests it. Beyond that, Cigarette pays buyers $500 as a
starter bonus for racing, and $500 for winning.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette moved into the limelight early with its new race boats
by winning the Factory II world championship last autumn in Key
West, Fla. But other manufacturers, such as Wellcraft, Fountain,
Apache and Hustler, are also promoting factory boats. Factory I
boats are smaller than the F-II's and come with one engine instead
of two.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a decade since Cigarette, once a leader in
powerboat racing, has fielded a factory team. At Point Pleasant,
two of the company's employees, Jack Cabasso as driver, and Phil
Lipschutz at the throttle, will compete aboard Cigarette Sony Music
in the Factory II Class. As many as 75 offshore powerboats, from 24
to 50 feet, are expected at the event, which is scheduled to begin
at 11:30 a.m. off Point Pleasant Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The factory boats, which will begin about midday, will run 16
laps on a four-mile course; the largest craft, the 40-to-50-foot
Superboats, are expected to race 13 laps on a seven-mile course
beginning at 1:30 p.m. &QL;

OUTDOORS: FROM GAME FISH TO FISHING GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By KEN SCHULTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can't catch a real fish, you can always visit the
International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame and Fishing Museum
and line up at its virtual catch machines. In a state full of
tourist attractions, this multifaceted facility in Dania, Fla., is
unique.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, the most popular feature was the Catch
Gallery, where five people at a time were holding fishing rods
tethered to fish-fighting simulators. Marlin, bass, trout and other
species _ shown in action on video screens _ struck, pulled, ran
and leapt, to the joy and determination of the youths and adults
holding real fishing rods and struggling for control.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, displays in the Hall of Fame celebrated the
achievements of two dozen famous anglers, including Zane Grey and
Ernest Hemingway. The walls were lined with photos, literature and
memorabilia. Hanging from the high ceiling were hundreds of game
fish replicas representing real world records.
</P>
<P>
   The educational displays of the Tackle Gallery traced the
evolution of sportfishing equipment, complete with rods and reels
dating to the 19th century. And the Legacy Gallery, which tracked
the roots of fishing for sport, paid tribute to the art,
illustration, writing and visual communications that have depicted
and extolled sportfishing, as well as fisheries management and
conservation issues.
</P>
<P>
   This facility is an educational component of the International
Game Fish Association, which was founded June 7, 1939, largely by
Michael J. Lerner. A field associate of the Museum of Natural
History, Lerner and a group of big-game anglers from around the
world created an organization to record game fish catches and
establish ethical sportfishing standards. It originally had a small
office in New York City but moved to Miami and then Pompano Beach
before settling in Dania last December when construction on the $32
million World Fishing Hall of Fame and Museum was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent to Fort Lauderdale, the site is virtually a
long-distance cast from Interstate 95. It started with a land
donation by an association trustee who purchased a block of real
estate in Dania that was a reclaimed Superfund site, once heavily
polluted by a lumber yard.
</P>
<P>
   The land today is host not only to the association's building
but also to an artificial lake with a mini-marina that has berths
for half a dozen assorted fishing boats. There is also a
work-in-progress wetlands exhibit, complete with nature trail and
real fish, which is meant as an environmental education tool.
Thanks to a community school program, by the end of the year every
sixth-grade student in Broward County will have visited.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was so engrossing that four hours slipped by, and
that was without visiting the 14,000 fishing-volume library. Not
only are the abundant interpretive and interactive displays
absorbing, but the minutiae of many of the exhibits are as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Tackle Gallery displayed a fascinating belt reel, made by
Wordens earlier this century and featuring a reel that is fixed to
a waist belt. There was also a unique corrosion-free, all-nylon
reel made in the 1950s by DuPont, and an 1870s-era baitcasting rod
sporting bell trumpet line guides and a triggerless handle.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legacy Galley, George Washington's fishing kit, complete
with hooks and supplies, shared top billing with a self-portrait
lithograph of Frederic Remington and his wife that is entitled,
``Her First Muskellunge,'' as well as fishing scenes from Currier
and Ives, and Norman Rockwell, plus a famous Winslow Homer work,
``Ouananiche Fishing, Lake St. John, Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fish Gallery contained a simple but clever simulation _ a
large current-charged bowl of water _ of how fish ``hear.''
Obviously, fish don't have ears like other animals, but they detect
noise through vibrations, which are sensed by inner organs and by
an external lateral line. Most anglers underestimate the ability of
fish to hear noises made by prey, lures, boats, and noisy or clumsy
anglers. The visitor can place both palms on the bowl to feel the
vibrations that are detected by fish.
</P>
<P>
   Information about fishing records is found at one of the
computer kiosks in the Records Gallery. While reviewing a few
species of personal interest, I stumbled across a cero mackerel
record established by the golfer Greg Norman. I also found the name
of the retired Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf, who caught a line-class
record Dolly Varden in Alaska in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed me as much as the displays was the number of
families. There's a special discovery room for young people, and
youth-friendly hands-on exhibits are located throughout the museum.
Volunteers take individuals and parties on personalized tours, so
anyone of any age or level of interest is accommodated.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A woman who was elected to Parliament in
April month but was denied permission to take her oath of office
because she refused to remove her Muslim head scarf will be
stripped of Turkish citizenship, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit said that the woman, Merve Kavakci, accepted U.S.
citizenship earlier this year without informing the Turkish
authorities. Under a rarely enforced clause in the legal code, the
government is therefore entitled to take action against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dual citizenship is permissible under Turkish law, but Kavakci
should have obtained Turkish permission before acquiring a second
passport,'' Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
   He said President Suleyman Demirel had signed a decree stripping
Ms. Kavakci of her citizenship. Such decrees take effect upon
publication in the official gazette.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of Ms. Kavakci's U.S. citizenship last week,
Ecevit, who has led opposition to her efforts to join Parliament,
said she was in ``a totally illegal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit and many other Turkish politicians, strongly supported by
powerful generals, insist that they can accept no compromise on the
issue of secularism. They say that sinister forces are seeking to
introduce religion into politics here, hoping ultimately to
undermine the secular republic and turn Turkey into a religious
state. Many see Ms. Kavakci as an agent of those forces.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservative Turks view her as a symbol of piety and
have rallied to her side. They have been supported by some human
rights advocates who believe that Members of Parliament, who unlike
civil servants are not pledged to neutrality, should be able to
dress as they please.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials said they had learned from immigration
authorities in the United States that Ms. Kavakci accepted U.S.
citizenship March 5, after she became a Parliamentary candidate but
before her election.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci is a member of the religious-oriented Virtue Party,
which some military commanders and civilian politicians believe is
secretly opposed to Turkey's secular principles.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders say they seek only the freedom to express
themselves and have portrayed Ms. Kavakci's attempt to enter
Parliament with a head scarf as an exercise in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Virtue leaders supported Ms. Kavakci. Three of its
representatives in Parliament have quit the party to protest her
stand. The most recent, Evliya Parlak, said Friday that Ms. Kavakci
``cannot be an emblem of Turkish women.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about Ms. Kavakci's citizenship led to speculation
that she might not be the only Member of Parliament who holds a
foreign passport in addition to one from Turkey. The leader of the
Virtue Party, Recai Kutan, estimated that there were 20 such cases
and demanded to know why the others had not been investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci, 30, quit medical school in Turkey after she was
denied permission to take an examination while wearing her head
scarf. Later she joined her family in Texas, where her father
headed an Islamic association, and decided to stay there. In 1994
she earned a degree in computer science from the University of
Texas at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Ms. Kavakci's scarf has not been limited to
Turkey. Several hundred women took to the streets of Tehran to
rally on her behalf, provoking a protest from the Turkish
government to Iran. Other demonstrations were held in West Bank
towns controlled by the Palestinian Authority.

 &HT;    ISRAELI ELECTIONS BOILING DOWN TO PERSONALITIES AND ETHINICITY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ World leaders hope Monday's Israeli election will
bring a new era of cooperation in the Middle East. But for
Israelis, an increasingly important question in this campaign has
become how they will live with one another.
</P>
<P>
   They will be voting on whether Israel should be a Western-styled
democracy or a Jewish fundamentalist state. They will be expressing
their frustration over a recession that stretches the gap between
rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   And, while they revel in the politics of the region's only
democracy _ voter turnout is expected to be over 80 percent _ the
divisions between what many call Israel's ``tribes'' are in plain
view.
</P>
<P>
   On major intersections across the country, religious Israeli
youth _ boys in yamulkas and girls in long skirts _ carry signs for
the several right-wing and religious parties. Opposing them are
left-wing secular youth, in halter tops and jeans _ touting their
favorite pols.
</P>
<P>
   They will elect their parliament from among 32 parties and, on a
separate ballot, they will choose a prime minister. The clear
front-runners are incumbent right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin
``Bibi'' Netanyahu and former general, left-winger Ehud Barak.
Barak, already leading in opinion polls, got a small boost Saturday
when the country's first Arab candidate, Azmi Bishara, withdrew
from the field. His supporters pulled down about 2 percent in the
polls and are likely to vote for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Should former defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai bow to heavy
pressure and withdraw his candidacy, Barak could win a majority in
Monday's election. If not, he will face Netanyahu in a runoff June
1.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, and Netanyahu, 49, fought in the same elite commando
unit, but they battle each other now under the guidance of their
American political consultants. Netanyahu tells Israelis that even
the Arabs want Barak because he's weak. Barak, on the other hand,
seems to appeal on a wider range of issues. He tells Israelis that
Netanyahu has left the country ``stuck'' on all fronts, from
economic development to religious tolerance to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   While world leaders have blamed Netanyahu for raising Middle
East tensions, in Israel the election could hinge just as much on
his contentious personality, which seems to inflame the country's
internal divisions. His supporters are the ultra-religious and
ethnic groups that proudly call themselves ``the rabble.'' They
feel Netanyahu fights for them against Israel's elites just as he
does against the Arabs. Netanyahu's opponents are fed up with that
confrontational nature. They call him a liar who is exploiting
Israel's divisions and pushing it toward war its Arab neighbors.
Even many of Netanyahu's cabinet ministers have abandoned and
bad-mouthed him. The distrust seems to trickle down to his voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay loyal to who is with the right wing,'' says reluctant
Netanyahu supporter Eliyahu Mordechai, 33. ``But, as far as the
personal aspect goes, there have been changes. He's not so
popular.'' Mordechai sells nuts in Jerusalem's Mehaneh Yehudah
produce market, long a Netanyahu stronghold. The market is filled
with blue-collar Sephardic Jews, descended from other Middle
Eastern countries. They feel alienated by Israel's Jews of European
descent. Mordechai removed the prime minister's picture from his
stall after Netanyahu fired Yitzhak Mordechai, the popular
Sephardic defense minister. Striding out of his shop toward the
crowded market, Mordechai sums up the changing mood: ``Barak is
going to win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former Netanyahu supporters have been repelled by the
power he has granted to the ultra-religious parties in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union voted heavily for Netanyahu in 1996, tipping the election his
way.
</P>
<P>
   They were hawks on security and felt ignored by the Labor Party
elites. But they are largely secular, and Netanyahu's religious
allies have challenged their Judaism, making it difficult for them
to get married or bring other relatives to the country. Polls show
many Russians are looking toward Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week(CQ), as he plunged in public opinion polls, the brash
Netanyahu turned to contrition. Telegenic as always, the
American-educated politician called his Likud Party loyalists home,
trying to remind them of the issue that has usually mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching a moment of truth in these elections,''
Netanyahu stated. ``I never said I was free of errors, but there is
one thing I can say, with my hand on my heart: That I have lead the
state of Israeli on the only road that can bring security and
peace. . . I implore you to put aside all other concerns. I implore
you to come home to the Likud.'' But, security is a tougher sell
this year than in the past. Barak's stance toward the Arabs differs
little from Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sting of the campaign, the Arabs, has been neutralized,''
said pollster Hanoch Smith. ``It's very hard to differentiate among
any one of the candidates as to what they're saying about the main
issue.'' After all, Netanyahu may be tough, but Barak was
Netanyahu's former army commander. He is also Israel's most
decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, he would implement more of the peace process, which
Netanyahu has halted amid claims the Palestinians have not kept
their promises. But, Barak pledges to stay as firm as Netanyahu on
the major principles. He refuses to share Jerusalem with the
Palestinians, insists on keeping most of the West Bank settlements
in place and says he'll be stingy with West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   There's a major difference in attitude. While Netanyahu reminds
Israelis of their fear of Arabs, Barak tells them they have nothing
to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more powerful than any neighbor. We can afford to
pursue peace from a position of strength,'' says Barak, whose short
and stocky physique belies his commando past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to fight terrorism. I will not let anybody strain
our security,'' Barak says.
</P>
<P>
   The tough talk has helped Barak bring the Labor Party toward the
political center, just as U.S. President Bill Clinton and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair did when their parties were viewed as too
far left of the mainstream. As Barak has taken cues from the
outside world, world leaders seem to be pulling for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Clinton administration appeared to back Netanyahu's
losing opponent, Shimon Peres. Now, it has been careful to remain
neutral. But it's clear that Netanyahu has frequently upset Clinton
by stalling the peace process and encouraging settlements on
disputed West Bank land. Several Arab leaders, through appeals to
his opponents, indicate they also want Netanyahu out.
</P>
<P>
   That's a fact Netanyahu is quick to publicize. But, it doesn't
matter to people like Galit Natan, a 30-year-old architect who
brought her daughter to a ``Just not Netanyahu'' rally recently.
She said Barak and Netanyahu will make similar concessions in the
peace process but, ``the process to get there with Netanyahu will
be horrible. It's the person. We are voting for a person, not a
party.''

 &HT;    Jefferson descendants weigh claims of black `kin'
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ Lanita Boettcher hopes someday to
sprinkle the ashes of her deceased black grandmother on the shaded
hillside where Thomas Jefferson and his white descendents are
buried.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the 38-year-old from Marietta, Ga., must get beyond
the locked gate at the Monticello Graveyard, owned by Jefferson's
descendents, who hold the key to Boettcher's wish.
</P>
<P>
   In its 86th annual meeting today, the all-white Monticello
Association will consider recent DNA evidence and centuries-old
oral history in deciding whether to admit Boettcher and other
blacks who claim to have descended from Jefferson and his slave and
alleged mistress, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective black members have refrained from charging racism,
despite being snubbed for years. But Lucian Truscott IV, a white
association member, has accused the group of discrimination,
heightening tension and publicity for today's family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Taboo still casts shadow
</P>
<P>
   ``It is racism; they do not want black people buried in that
graveyard,'' said Truscott, 52, a Los Angeles screenwriter and
novelist. ``Either you believe what Mr. Jefferson wrote, or you
don't, that all men are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's debate seems as complex as Jefferson's own hypocrisy
about owning slaves despite penning the famous words in the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this great interest in the evidence of a mixed
family,'' said Annette Gordon-Reed, author of the 1997 book
``Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings _ An American Controversy.''
``This topic has not been talked about much in America. It has been
taboo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's wife, Martha, died in 1782 from childbirth
complications. Her husband lived another 44 years, and history
records Hemings as Jefferson's fair-skinned companion at
Monticello, his plantation outside Charlottesville, until his death
in 1826.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time at this weekend's reunion, the association
has invited three dozen black people who trace their lineage to the
American statesman.
</P>
<P>
   The private gathering in a downtown Charlottesville hotel is the
first since DNA test results last fall found that Jefferson may
have fathered one of Hemings' sons, Eston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a love story there,'' said Boettcher, who
feels certain she is a great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter
of America's third president, whose square-jawed profile is
engraved on the nickel.
</P>
<P>
   `Accuracy,' not racism
</P>
<P>
   She is so proud of her family's history that she and her
husband, Rusty, named their 3-month-old son, Samuel Madison, after
another of Hemings' sons, Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Boettcher learned her family's history from her grandmother,
Ellen Lucille Roberts, who gathered it from descendents of Madison
Hemings, freed in Jefferson's will.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts died at 83 last August, just weeks before the DNA test
results were released. Her granddaughter thinks she would have been
heartened by the findings, which bolstered her belief she was
entitled to burial in the same graveyard as Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to rest my grandmother there, part of her
ashes,'' Boettcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Before that could happen, the association first must accept
black members. That's unlikely, at least this weekend, said the
association's outgoing President Robert Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it is racist,'' the 53-year-old Richmond lawyer
said. ``If you take a careful look at it, we are not concerned
about race. We are concerned about accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's 700 members, linked by genealogical records to
Jefferson's family, have the right to be buried in the fenced
graveyard behind Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 150 association members attending today's meeting
are expected to hear from retired Virginia pathologist Eugene
Foster, who conducted the DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said his study did not ``conclusively say anything,''
creating uncertainty that Gillespie said needed to be resolved by
genealogical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, for instance, that one of Jefferson's male
relatives _ such as a brother or cousins _ fathered Eston. The
testing found no DNA match in the male line of another of Hemings'
sons, James Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Madison Hemings, no DNA test was possible because
Foster could not locate a male descendant to give blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever time it takes, we want to be accurate,'' said
Gillespie, who today turns over the presidency to James Truscott.
``I basically see it as a family matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks who claim kinship to Jefferson said they hope the
dispute at Monticello can be resolved amicably, as an example of
racial harmony drawn from better understanding of America's complex
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this coming out, it should open a lot of people's eyes to
what was happening at that time,'' said Marietta businessman Lantz
Balthazar, whose daughter, Lanita Boettcher, is attending today's
meeting in his place. ``Maybe by talking about it, the races can
come together; at least, that is my hope.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a flood of venomous oratory, the Communist-led
drive to impeach President Boris Yeltsin failed in Russia's
parliament Saturday as nearly 100 members of the legislature
unexpectedly stayed away from the session, and some ballots were
thrown out because they carried no names or were defaced.
</P>
<P>
   The result left Communist leaders who had confidently predicted
victory arguing that the nation had been betrayed, and their
opponents claiming vindication against an impeachment they always
said was more a lynching than a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone had any kind words for Mr. Yeltsin, who emerged
from the proceedings an isolated figure, under attack from friends
and enemies alike.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's opponents in the lower house of parliament, the Duma,
which is dominated by Communists, ineeded 300 votes out of the 442
active members to win impeachment on any of the five charges
against him. The count deemed most likely to succeed was the charge
that Yeltsin waged an illegal war against the rebellious Russian
republic of Chechnya in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But late Saturday afternoon parliament officials reported that
only 283 valid votes were cast in support of the Chechnya charge,
17 short of what was needed. Forty-three legislators voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other charges approached that total. Besides the
accusation involving the war in Chechnya, Yeltsin had been charged
with illegally dissolving the Soviet Union in 1991, staging a
violent 1993 coup against rebellious Communists in parliament,
destroying the Russian military and committing genocide by allowing
the nation's living standards to plummet, leading millions of
Russians to an early death.
</P>
<P>
   The genocide charge gathered 238 votes in support and 88
against. The charge of destroying the army collected 240 votes in
support and 77 against; the charge of dismantling the Soviet Union,
239 votes in support and 78 against, and the charge of staging a
coup against Parliament, 263 votes for and 60 against.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the votes as a
betrayal of Russia and pledged that legislators who opposed
impeachment ``will pay with their political careers'' at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conscience is clear,'' he told the news radio station Echo
Moskvy. Yeltsin's nominee as prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, said
the Duma had averted ``an extremely serious political crisis'' by
rejecting impeachment, and given Yeltsin time to address the
nation's problems. Some predict that Stepashin, nominated by
Yeltsin after he fired Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister
Wednesday, will now be approved by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders forecast Friday that the Duma would approve at
least the Chechnya charge, and possibly others. But their cause was
set back seriously when only 348 ballots were accepted at
Saturday's climactic vote, 94 short of the number of active
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 14 ballots were thrown out on some votes, either
because they were unsigned or were defaced with a large X.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a boycott of Saturday's balloting, the Communists sought
unsuccessfully Friday to hold the impeachment votes then, rather
than wait until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant quoted officials Saturday as saying
that an ``epidemic'' had struck parliament members and that many
had checked into Moscow's prestigious Central Clinical Hospital for
treatment. The hospital was unable to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Most legislators have been under intense pressure to vote for
impeachment because of Yeltsin's unpopularity among voters. But
many also feared retaliation from the Kremlin should they support a
failed impeachment attempt, and it was widely believed that others
were offered jobs or other inducements to support the president.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Volkov, a spokesman for one of the leading Communists,
the chairman of the Duma's security committee, Viktor Ilyukhin,
seemed resigned to defeat after the vote, saying that it was the
symbolism of the impeachment effort that mattered, not the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether impeachment happens or not, we have to look at things
realistically,'' the spokesman, Volkov, said. ``This is a big
political action, important for the entire country. The vote itself
doesn't show what it actually means, because there is a big
political game'' affecting the balloting. Volkov said that ``all
the numbers don't show reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With any result,'' he said ``this is a big achievement of the
parliament _ that it can speak out against the government and its
actions. It shows to those who come next that the people are not
without a voice. It shows to the next Duma that they have a right
to speak out.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The firebrand nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky told Interfax
news agency that the Communist loss was a signal for Yeltsin to
``crush the leftists.'' Zhirinovsky, the head of the Liberal
National Democratic Party and an opponent of impeachment, predicted
that Yeltsin would now move to ban the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before the votes, Zyuganov said the impeachment process ``has
already had a refreshing effect in this hall and on the general
situation in the country'' by underscoring that even the highest
officials are accountable for their deeds.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything was underscored by the three days of debate this
week, it was that the division between the Yeltsin government and
the Communists who control the parliament has evolved from fierce
political rivalry to blood feud.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov branded Yeltsin ``absolute evil'' in his closing
speech, a savaging of the president and a mournful eulogy for an
empire lost, ``a thousand-year-old power; the power that Hitler
failed to conquer but which, through the efforts of Yeltsin and his
team, was torn to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country took almost five centuries to gain access to the
seas, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea,'' he said, ``and today we
have been thrown back from these seas and we have sustained
colossal economic and moral losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all humiliated because the old people and the children,
the women and workers have been robbed. The reserves of the
strategic resources of this country amounted to more than $200
billion. Everything has been wasted _ sold and drunk away. We have
lost almost all property which was accumulated not during the 70
years of Soviet power, but during all the history of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Yeltsin's most powerful bloc of supporters in the
party, Our Russian Home, Vladimir Ryzhkov, retorted that the
charges against Yeltsin ``rest on sand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obvious to any law student in his second year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he defended Yeltsin against the impeachment
accusations _ noting, for example, that the Duma had voted to
support the same Chechen war that was the basis of a charge against
Yeltsin _ he conceded that the president has failed the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, when he had the support of 97 percent of the
population, he did not use the historic opportunity to create a
truly democratic and stable state with a genuinely responsible
parliament,'' Ryzhkov said. ``In December 1993, when he had a clean
sheet of paper in front of him on which he could write any
constitution he wanted, he wrote the ugliest constitution in the
world which gave rise to a politically irresponsible parliament, a
politically helpless government and a president who was a colossus
on feet of clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he said, ``he brought us, after 10 years of
privation and setbacks, to a state where we have to begin
everything from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   And Zhirinovsky condemned all sides, saying that Yeltsin was
being upbraided for a dissolution that has been under way for
hundreds of years, at the direction of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be said that the country was ruined in 1991. That
decision was made in 1717 in Paris; 280 years ago the West made a
decision to destroy the Russian empire,'' he said. ``Do you think
Napoleon invaded Russia just for kicks? That Hitler attacked Russia
just like that? That Yugoslavia is being bombed just like that? The
target is one _ the Russian empire, the Soviet Union; never mind
that we are now a democratic country. They are moving closer and
closer to the Russian borders.''

</P>
<P>
   Outside the Duma building in downtown Moscow, a vast crowd of
demonstrated cheered, waving Communist flags and signs reading
``Yeltsin resign!'' and ``We defeated Hitler, we will defeat
Yeltsin.'' One notable placard read, ``Yeltsin-out of the Kremlin!
Guilty!,'' twisting Yeltsin's name to give it a Jewish ending. As a
practical matter, Saturday's votes were mostly symbolic. Few
expected that a decision to impeach Yeltsin would actually result
in his removal, because the charges would have to survive review by
Yeltsin's appointees to constitutional and supreme courts, and then
pass the upper house of parliament, which has often backed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment had a gravity beyond mere condemnation of the
president. Many experts believe _ and some Kremlin aides have
hinted _ that Yeltsin would strike back at the Communists should
impeachment have passed, perhaps by finding a legal excuse to
dissolve the Duma and force new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Constitution prohibits dissolving the Duma while an
impeachment is in progress. An attempt by Yeltsin to sidestep that
requirement would have provoked a showdown that could well have
endangered the nation's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Communists now must decide whether they wish to rebuff Yeltsin
by rejecting his choice of Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is required to dissolve the Duma if it refuses three
times to ratify the nomination of a new prime minister. Although
the Duma seemed certain to reject Stepashin earlier last week,
Communist advisers said on Friday and Saturday that they hoped the
Duma would approve the nomination, if only to provide some
continuity in the government.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ During a bitter, protracted election campaign,
Israelis have grown weary of the way the candidates advocate unity,
yet underscore the many divisions in this small, complex society.
</P>
<P>
   This race, like many Israeli elections, has brought out the
blood passions in a country that sometimes operates like a large
extended family, complicated by intense sibling rivalries,
intermarriage and generational disputes.
</P>
<P>
   There were routine cries of ``traitor'' as political mates
jumped ship, and nasty name-calling battles between Jewish
immigrants of different national origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a time of healing, that's for sure,'' said
Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist and fellow at the Israel
Democracy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Israelis finally vote on Monday, choosing between Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his key rival, Ehud Barak, many
will do so with the expectation that a coalition government will
eventually be forged _ perhaps even one that joins the major
parties these two men represent.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a race is one thing, after all, and governing Israel is
another.
</P>
<P>
   For the new government will face not only a stagnant economy and
roiling social tensions, especially between secular and religious
Jews, but also difficult, potentially destabilizing, diplomatic
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israelis cast two ballots. One is for prime minister,
the other for parliament, in which 33 parties are competing for 120
seats. The leading candidate for prime minister must win more than
50 percent of the votes to avoid a runoff election on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Barak, the Labor Party leader, was ahead in the polls
by a substantial margin over Netanyahu, the Likud Party leader, in
what has been a five-way race. Barak, a highly decorated former
general who is running at the head of the One Israel coalition, has
been gaining ground so steadily that it seems probable he will
capture more votes than Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the elections, then, the key question is not whether
Barak will lead on Monday, but whether he will win outright,
eliminating the need for an unprecedented, costly second round.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of such a victory increased Saturday night, when Azmi
Bishara, an Israeli-Arab candidate, withdrew from the race for
prime minister. Cleverly monopolizing the Israeli television news
some 36 hours before the polls opened, Bishara said effectively he
was pulling out so as not to stand in Barak's way. Yet he declined
to endorse him, or any of the three other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli electorate is unpredictable, which is why many
repeatedly cite a local political adage: Israelis tell the truth to
the pollsters but lie at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   To Netanyahu's disadvantage, furthermore, Israelis are also
impatient, traditionally unwilling to give their leaders a second
chance. Since Menachem Begin won re-election to a second term in
1981, no incumbent prime minister has ever won re-election
outright. There were some draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most countries, holding power confers a clear advantage,
worth some 5 to 10 percentage points, to whoever has it,'' said
Nachum Barnea, a leading political columnist. ``In Israel, holding
power is an electoral liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu's conservative coalition dissolved prematurely
in December, the country has been in a state of suspended
animation. The Israeli-Palestinian peace effort has been frozen,
and important social and economic decisions have been deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyhau has continued to lead the country while fighting an
uphill battle for his re-election. He has been running Israel at
the same time as his supposed flaws have been dissected daily on
the public stage.
</P>
<P>
   For many Israelis, it has been an uncomfortable, dispiriting
dynamic. The election race has turned into a referendum on the
polarizing personality of their prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running on the issues, but they are running against my
character,'' Netanyahu said in an April interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis say they do not see a big difference between the
two leading candidates _ both raised in elite Ashkenazi families,
both secular Jews, both educated in the United States, both
fighters in the same elite army unit at a critical time in Israeli
history, and both headstrong, ambitious men.
</P>
<P>
   And both men are leaning toward the political center that most
Israelis occupy. Barak, a former army chief of staff, does so from
a leftist party, and Netanyahu from a rightist one.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they support continuing the Israeli-Palestinian peace
effort from a point of pragmatism, as does Yitzhak Mordechai, the
former defense minister and Center Party leader, who is also
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm considering all three because I can't tell them apart,''
Yarden Ben Harush, 24, an education student in Beersheva, said .
``It's all a blur. The class I go to, we're 120 young people, and
we all feel that same way.''

</P>
<P>
   In 1996, stunning the country's political establishment,
Netanyahu won election by a mere 30,000 votes, or 1 percent, over
Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader. It was a tense time.
</P>
<P>
   The country had not yet begun to recover from the assassination
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Peres' predecessor as the Labor
Party leader, by an extremist religious Jew. Israel was enduring a
spate of Palestinian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was the first prime minister elected directly in a
separate ballot. Until 1996, Israelis cast only one vote, for their
party, and the party's leader ran the government.
</P>
<P>
   To stitch together a majority government, he built a coalition
of unlikely bedfellows: Sephardic Jews, Russian immigrants,
ultra-Orthodox Jews and Jewish settlers from the West Bank. He
linked them together by appealing to their shared feeling that they
were shut outside the gates of power by the Ashkenazi elite.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping them together was another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the direct election system, one political personality
needs to embody all the different parts of the Israeli political
soul,'' Ezrahi, the political scientist, said. ``In order to
function well, he has to be ambiguous, or he risks his own
downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   That is partly what happened to Netanyahu. He led his
conservative Likud Party to betray its founding principle when it
decided last fall to support territorial concessions to the
Palestinians. Approaching the American-brokered peace negotiations
slowly, cautiously and with a blustery and suspicious attitude
toward the Palestinians, he brought many Israelis into the peace
camp.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, he alienated his far-right supporters. And to
win them back, he distanced himself from his own accomplishment. He
declared the Palestinians to be violating their obligations, and,
in defiance of the American government, suspended Israeli
compliance with the most recent peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure, Netanyahu managed to antagonize
personally many of his followers and his political associates. And
by the end, although close associates believe him to be a highly
principled man, he had led many Israelis to believe the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, Netanyahu had received no endorsement from his
trade minister, Natan Sharansky, and did not expect one.
Sharansky's constituency, Russian immigrants, is considered the
only large bloc of swing votes. Barak has courted them furiously,
making steady inroads, and the latest polls showed the two
candidates splitting the Russian vote.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has run a professional campaign, with little opposition
from within his own coalition, making few mistakes. Netanyahu, on
the other hand, has feuded with his associates in Likud, and may
have miscalculated what would appeal to his voters, repeating the
themes of his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He entered this election race without two leading Sephardic
politicians by his side: David Levy, his former foreign minister,
who has joined forces with Barak, and Mordechai, his former defense
minister, who is running against him.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, whose persistence in the race represents the surest
obstacle to an outright victory by Barak, has played a pivotal
role. While his now doomed candidacy has been a somewhat quixotic
affair, Mordechai has served as a steppingstone.
</P>
<P>
   He has given die-hard Likudniks a way to walk away from the
party they were practically born into without betraying their
identities by going straight to the left. Now, however, many are
abandoning him for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in Netanyahu's party say that their goal is to
survive the first round, assuming that Netanyahu will fare better
in a one-on-one runoff. If a solid center-left majority wins
control of the parliament on Monday, it could galvanize swing
voters to return to Netanyahu. And the prime minister is presumed
to be the master of focused political combat.
</P>
<P>
   But many Israelis, even some who do not back Barak, are hoping
that the race ends Monday. They anticipate that whoever wins will
need to form some kind of coalition government, given that as many
as 20 parties could be elected to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And they want the country to start moving forward again.
</P>
<P>
   What is on the immediate horizon are critical negotiations with
the Palestinians and the Syrians that will help define Israel's
size, its place in the Mideast and its identity as a secure or
threatened state _ a country at war or at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in front of us one of the most critical years in Israeli
history,'' Barak said in an interview.

GORE BEATS BRADLEY IN PARTY'S FIRST STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ Nobody campaigned much. Really. And nobody
gives much weight to it. Honest. But just for the record,
Massachusetts Democrats, voting in the first party convention straw
poll of the 2000 presidential primary season, chose Vice President
Al Gore over former Sen. Bill Bradley by almost a 3-to-1 ratio
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Each camp, contending that it had exerted virtually no effort to
garner votes (unlike the other camp, which had obviously tried
harder), declared the vote a victory. That was true for the
basketball-tossing bunch wearing ``Another Celtic fan for Bradley''
pins and the contingent plastered with blue ``Gore 2000'' stickers
and passing out homemade chocolate chip cookies attached to
campaign leaflets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a ragtag, small group of people'' that has just begun
getting organized, said state Rep. Paul Caron, a Bradley backer and
the Democrat who had most pushed for the straw vote over some party
objections that it was premature. ``I think it was a very good
showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gore supporters, Michael Whouley, a senior national
campaign adviser and a local delegate to the convention, called the
result ``a resounding victory'' for the Vice President. The Bradley
supporters ``were hoping for a surprise and they didn't get it,''
Whouley said.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides agreed that the poll results amounted to a very
limited snapshot, taken well before either candidate had done much
to get the word out and of a highly unrepresentative group of
voters, the party stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant, said such party
stalwarts have significance of their own because Massachusetts
party die-hards ``are the people who will get on a bus to New
Hampshire'' and help campaign in its pivotal primary early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marsh said this straw poll may have turned out to be a
blessing for both camps, because it gave them incentive to begin
organizing in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she said, the vote outcome could prove a boon to
Gore. ``After a couple of months of bad polls and bad press,'' she
said, it could let him ``point to a win and start turning those
perceptions around.'' If the ratio had been more like 2-to-1, she
said, she would not have considered it a Gore victory. But this
way, she said, both sides could be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won 1,130 votes among Massachusetts delegates compared to
385 votes for Bradley. Among also-rans, the Rev. Jesse Jackson
received 20 votes and several personal picks received a sprinkling
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   For all its dubious validity as an indicator, the poll did allow
an unscientific peek into the minds of Massachusetts Democrats, and
they did look a bit troubled about Gore's candidacy, though
generally supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this sort of insurgency of about 25 or 30 percent of
the vote indicates there's probably some reservation'' about Gore,
said Thomas Finneran, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives. ``I don't want to say discontent, that's too
strong a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Some would use even stronger words. Several Bradley supporters
said they were tired of feeling embarrassed to be Democrats tarred
by White House scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Chisholm, a delegate from Everett, Mass., said: ``I got
into a little tussle with a lady who's pro-Gore. She said, `We're
going to lose the presidency if you guys keep backing Bradley,' and
I said, `You know what, I have to live with myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bradley supporters noted that they felt sure Bradley could
easily have received 50 percent of the vote if party members had
known more about him.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Gore supporters who dominated the Civic Center
hall in this central Massachusetts industrial city. Asked why they
supported him, they tended to cite his performance as vice
president, his experience and his better chances of winning the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those who chose to ignore the straw vote, some
because they were undecided but others because they objected to it
as a great distraction from the issues they wanted to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Felker, a delegate from Newton, Mass., and a member of a
small faction called the Democratic Majority Group, which seeks a
renewed focus on party nuts-and-bolts issues like housing, said
that with all due respect to the party, when the time came to vote,
``To tell you the truth, I was eating a sandwich.''

WHITE SOX BEAT YANKS, 12-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have apparently become so futile that
their fans grasp at any positive development to root for. They
found one in the seventh inning of a lopsided game Saturday when
Derek Jeter beat the ball into the ground along the third-base line
and raced to first base for a single.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 45,824 at Yankee Stadium, which had watched another
inept effort by the home team, cheered lustily. Jeter, who had made
outs his first three times at bat, was on base for the 35th
consecutive game, all of the games the Yankees have played this
season. No other major league player has reached base in every one
of his team's games.
</P>
<P>
   But neither sidelights nor consolation prizes win games, and the
Yankees tumbled to the Chicago White Sox, 12-4, for their fifth
consecutive loss. Jeter's 60-foot single actually ignited the most
promising inning the Yankees have had in the past four games, but
later in the inning Tino Martinez, who had just cracked a two-run
double, ended it prematurely by being thrown out at the plate on
Chili Davis' single to center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' four runs were double the number they had scored in
their previous three games combined, but they mattered little
because the White Sox battered Ramiro Mendoza for seven runs in the
first two innings, six of them in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a sinkerball pitcher and the ball wasn't sinking,''
said Don Zimmer, the beleaguered interim manager.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norton slugged a two-run home run and Magglio Ordonez
lashed a two-run triple in the six-run inning, which matched the
Yankees' worst of the perplexing season.
</P>
<P>
   The losing streak, the Yankees' longest since September 1997 and
their longest at Yankee Stadium since June 1994, can reflect a
series of possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   --The Yankees are only human after all and have found the forces
of nature and the American League working against them in their
effort to duplicate last season's incredible success.
</P>
<P>
   --Their hitters and pitchers have encountered an early-season
slump from which they will recover and proceed to play up to their
division-winning capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   --The players miss the guidance of Joe Torre, who is recovering
from surgery for prostate cancer, and have not responded to the
leadership of Zimmer, no matter how lovable they might find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to shrug it off,'' Zimmer said before the game,
discussing the team's recent problems. ``What am I going to do? Cut
my throat? Jump out of a building?''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, he said he still was not ready to do either.
There is no need yet for such severe reaction to the Yankees'
plight, unless George Steinbrenner erupts in one of his memorable
tirades that 114 regular-season victories kept contained last
season. But the Yankees are in danger of going to Boston on Tuesday
behind the surprising Red Sox, who pulled even with the Yankees
Saturday with a 6-5 victory over Toronto. Now that wouldn't sit
well with the owner.
</P>
<P>
   The latest loss was the worst of the losing streak because it
was a band of inexperienced youngsters who trampled all over the
Yankees. The nine White Sox players who were on the field for the
first six innings had a combined 11 years of major league service.
The pitcher was John Snyder, who gained his sixth successive
victory by limiting the Yankees to two runs in six innings, one of
them Davis' eighth home run. The other eight collected 15 of
Chicago's 17 hits.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the inning after Snyder departed that the Yankees
threatened to get back into the game. Down by 9-2, they scored two
runs on Martinez's double, and Davis followed with a single to
center. With two out, Willie Randolph, the third base-coach, waved
Martinez around third, but Chris Singleton nailed him with a
no-bounce throw to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking a question of the wrong man,'' Zimmer said when
asked about the play, betraying an underlying feeling between
coaches that exists quietly in the Yankees' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph said he went with his instincts and followed his
aggressive nature. ``It wasn't a line drive, one hop to the guy,''
he said of the hit. ``It was a ground-ball single. In the seventh
inning I'm not thinking of playing safe. In the ninth inning I
might hold him because that run doesn't mean anything. In that
situation, we had a little rhythm going, a little momentum going. I
wanted to keep that going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez was out, and the Yankees did not seriously threaten
again. The White Sox, on the other hand, scored three more runs
against Jay Tessmer in the ninth as Ray Durham doubled home two
after one had scored on a single by Singleton, who had hit a
two-run home run against Mendoza in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old story,'' Zimmer said. ``When the players
play good, the manager's good, and when the players play bad, the
manager don't know what he's doing. It's been that way as long as
I've been in the game. Ten days ago, 15 days ago, what a great job
Zimmer's doing. Well, I'm doing the same job now except the results
are different.''

IN A LAND OF WIMPS, PALMEIRO REIGNS SUPREME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ His face clouded into a large frown. And his
voice became a snarl. ``That's a bunch of \Rbaloney\S,'' growled
Rafael Palmeiro. ``Ballplayers aren't wimps.''
</P>
<P>
   First, let it be noted Mr. Palmeiro is highly qualified to
defend The Brotherhood against this nasty charge. But in a court of
public opinion, I don't think Rafael wins the case.
</P>
<P>
   Any jock-kingdom random survey of ``gamers'' who ``come to
play'' already has a well-established pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers aren't wimps? Compared to what?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not NHL players _ the manly of the manly. Nor, of
course, the NFL types, a distant second to hockey. Even the NBA
membership seems to rank ahead of ballplayers on a toughness scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare baseball to those other sports,'' barked
Palmeiro. ``We play every day. We play 162 games. More injuries are
going to happen. More players are going to have to be on the
disabled list, or be out of the lineup, because of the daily grind.
People have to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK ... maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Except it doesn't sound too good when stories are retold about
Greg Harris, the old Rangers pitcher. He once went on the DL after
injuring his elbow flipping sunflower seeds in the bullpen. Or
another former Ranger, catcher Ned Yost, who was DLed for
``excessive eyelid strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you combine the massive amount of guaranteed salaries with
the long-term contracts, and the incentive to be a ``gamer'' in
baseball is no longer available.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, it's Cal Ripken Jr., the iron man of all
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Or unless it's, yes, Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trivia question guaranteed to win a bar bet. What
baseball player has appeared in the most games in the '90s? And the
correct name can be seen in action today at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Hint _ Ripken has missed only 22 games in the decade, and those
came in the last month. He was back Thursday night from his
first-ever stay on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But that Ripken absence pushed him back to second on the
decade's iron-man list. Second to Palmeiro, who leads baseball with
1,403 games played in the '90s, to 1,400 for Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Let this one accomplishment, more than offensive numbers or Gold
Gloves at first base, define Palmeiro as a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of it,'' he said, ``but I didn't know it until the
other night. I've never dwelled on it because I don't think it
should be any big deal to try and be in the lineup every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 34, Palmeiro went far beyond ``trying'' for this season,
which was his return to Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Two knee surgeries in spring training left him medically
doubtful for Opening Day in April. But Palmeiro vowed he'd be in
the lineup. And he was. He has only missed one game thus far, when
a hamstring flared on the turf in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite just two games of facing major-league pitching in spring
training, Palmeiro had a better-than-average April for him, and, as
usual, his bat is booming in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state of mind _ my attitude is always to look for an
excuse to play, as opposed to not play,'' he said. ``All of us feel
tired at times, we've got nagging injuries at times, or we've got
the flu or something. But we're paid a lot of money to do this. I
feel an obligation to the people who pay me to be in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending the past five seasons with Ripken in Baltimore only
reinforced the already-established Palmeiro attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't help but rub off,'' he said. ``I don't know how
many times I figured there was no way Cal could play that night. I
knew how much his back was hurting. But he was in there, and he was
contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people criticized Cal for playing when they thought
he shouldn't have played. But I never saw him hurt the team because
he was limited by an injury. He always helped the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has been confined to DH duties this season, which is
not his preferred role. ``It's hard to adjust to not being at first
base, but it's also been a blessing for us. Lee \RStevens\S has
played so well. I'm about 80 percent with the knee, and I can take
my time with it. Because of Lee, there's no reason to rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of Florida, there were those of us who thought
Palmeiro was rushing an injury, based on his adamant stance of
playing the first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think management gets nervous at times,'' he said. ``They
have such a large investment in you, they don't want chances taken
with injuries. But it has to come down to the player knowing how he
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   By reputation, baseball players are going to take off if they
don't feel ``right.'' And their agents also stress a conservative
approach to playing.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are a few others _ the iron men. A Ripken. A
Palmeiro. They give ballplayers a strong defense against that wimp
label.

 &HT;    Maddux loses 3rd in a row
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Greg Maddux was not the one to stop the Braves road
hurtin'. He's the one who's been in the most agony recently, and he
was feeling it again Saturday in a 5-1 loss to the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wrigley Field, where he was 3-0 with a 1.14 ERA against his
former team, a struggling Maddux (4-3) looked even stranger. He
lost for the third consecutive time after allowing a career-high 14
hits and another five runs, and he didn't really understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown like this before and won a lot of games, a lot,''
said Maddux, whose ERA rose to 4.83. He has allowed 17 earned runs
in his past three starts and opponents are hitting .356 against him
this season. ``I was happy with my location, happy with my
movement, I got beat today. I know it looks bad and I know it may
sound stupid, but I like the way I threw the ball today.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox, catcher Eddie Perez and even Cubs
hitters agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched good today,'' Perez said. ``His changeup
was perfect. He made some great pitches. They threw the bat on the
ball. He's throwing the same way he's been throwing the past three
years. It's hard for him. I think he's frustrated. But I don't
think he has to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Henry Rodriguez agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's getting the same strike zone he had last
year,'' he said. ``But I see no difference in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had given up five runs in his 39 1/3 innings pitched in
his career against the Cubs in Wrigley. He gave up five runs in
only five innings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for most of this road trip, the first
inning was the killer as the Cubs took a 3-0 lead on back-to-back,
two-out pitches to Sammy Sosa (run-scoring double) and Rodriguez
(two-run homer).
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are 2-6 on this road trip and have lost a third
consecutive series. They are 21-14 and just ahead of the Mets in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have scored only two runs in their past three games
after Steve Trachsel pitched a complete game Saturday, allowing
only a bases-empty home run by Chipper Jones.

 &HT;    Glavine lacked his 'good stuff'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago _ The five runs Tom Glavine gave up Friday were more
annoying than worrisome, which makes them different from the five
runs he surrendered in each of his first two outings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's ERA climbed back up to 4.53 through eight starts and
his record dropped to 2-4. He had won two of three starts before
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was aggravating because I was starting to get on a roll,''
Glavine said. ``I can handle a game like that more than some of the
ones early in the year. You're going to have days where you don't
have good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said he hung all the sliders he threw. He wasn't putting
his changeup where he wanted to against right-handers, so he wasn't
throwing it in the spots he normally would.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run home run to Sammy Sosa came on a fastball where
Glavine might normally have stayed with his changeup. A two-run
single to Henry Rodriguez came on a hanging slider.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the season, the problems were more about not
getting his fastball where he wanted it, as Glavine said he
concentrated so hard on location and struggled to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early-on I wasn't comfortable, and I didn't have a clue where
the ball was going,'' Glavine said. ``(On Friday) I was
comfortable, felt good, I just didn't have the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliable Remlinger
</P>
<P>
   Among the most-reliable and most-used relievers in the bullpen
this year has been Mike Remlinger, who's job is everything from
retiring a left-hander or two or pitching two or three innings to
finish a game.
</P>
<P>
   With his 14th appearance on Saturday in which he pitched a
scoreless inning, he's 1-0 with a 1.84 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's a bonus for me is I can do a lot of things,''
Remlinger said. ``I just want to be able to pitch in as many games
as possible.'' Offensive questions
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have allowed runs in the first inning of each of the
last five games _ 17 of them _ and hitting coach Don Baylor said
it's had an effect on the Braves' offense, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are trying to get it all back at one time and it works
just the opposite,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are hitless in their past 24 at-bats with runners in
scoring position.

LEITER'S PLIGHT A MET MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One month into the season, New York Mets left-hander Al Leiter
is hardly living up to the role of staff ace. He's won only once
and has allowed 29 earned runs in 47 innings, a 5.55 ERA. After
giving up two home runs to the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday night,
Leiter has allowed six this year _ only two shy of his total for
the entire '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong? Leiter, who signed a four-year, $32 million
contract last winter, confesses he doesn't really know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm throwing the same,'' he said. ``If there's one
thing that I'm not doing consistently enough, it's throwing my
fastball away for strikes, maybe establishing a couple more strikes
away. But my curve's as good as it's ever been, my velocity's as
high as it's ever been and I'm breaking bats with my sliders. It's
just a real unlucky time.'' &QL; 
TOM HARDLY TERRIFIC
</P>
<P>
   Leiter can look to Atlanta's Tom Glavine as a fellow left-hander
who has struggled. In his first five starts, Glavine's trademark
sinker and changeup were noticeably absent, allowing 20 earned runs
in his first 272/3 innings (6.51 ERA). Glavine looked like he was
snapping out of it when he allowed only two earned runs in 201/3
innings, lowering his ERA to 4.13 entering Friday's start against
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   But against Chicago, Glavine allowed five earned runs in 52/3
innings, including Sammy Sosa's ninth home run. &QL; 
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Just because you can't crack the Braves starting rotation
doesn't mean you can't be successful. In his 15 starts since the
Phillies claimed him off waivers after he was released by the
Braves last August, right-hander Paul Byrd is 9-4 with a 2.89 ERA.
By beating St. Louis on Tuesday, Byrd improved to 4-2 and lowered
his ERA to 3.59 with the complete-game victory that included a pair
of strikeouts against Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves farmhand Chris Brock of the Giants beat Atlanta
5-1 on Wednesday, marking the first time San Francisco won a series
from the Braves since July 1996. Brock used the windy weather to
his advantage, allowing four hits and no runs in 51/3 innings. He
walked the first two batters he faced, then struck out Chipper
Jones, Brian Jordan and Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, now 4-2 with a 3.74 ERA, downplayed the significance of
facing his former team, which called him up briefly late in the '97
season after he spent almost six full seasons in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone made a big deal about it, but I'm excited about being
in the rotation and pitching every fifth day,'' Brock said. ``I'm
not worried about who I face. I don't have a problem with that
team. They just didn't have a spot for me.'' &QL; 
BELL TOLLS
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jay Bell homered in three straight games for the
second time this year, and Wednesday's home run off Montreal's
Ugueth Urbina was his fifth in seven games. Bell, who entered the
weekend tied with the Dodgers' Raul Mondesi for the league lead
with 13 homers, had homered in three straight games only once
before this year, Sept. 20-22, 1996. ``He's on poor man's
creatine,'' joked teammate Matt Williams, who hit his 12th
Wednesday night. ``Ranch dressing.''...
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati was viewed as a possible surprise team before the
season. Now, people are surprised how bad they are. Three starters
from the season opener are gone. Right-hander Brett Tomko was
optioned to Triple-A; right fielder Dmitri Young is hitting .203
and must share time with Jeffrey Hammonds; and third baseman Aaron
Boone was optioned to Triple-A on Wednesday after hitting .218....
</P>
<P>
   Some players do come back. Rockies second baseman Mike Lansing
was terrible last year after signing a four-year, $23.75 million
contract. He had no range, couldn't turn the double play and his
offensive numbers dropped off from 1997 despite the move from
Montreal's Olympic Stadium to Coors Field. Now, he's healthy and
hitting second in front of Larry Walker. Since the move, Lansing
has raised his average from .273 to .336....
</P>
<P>
   Florida right-hander Alex Fernandez, who went on the disabled
list May 2 with a pulled groin after a year-long recovery from
shoulder surgery, is eligible to come off the disabled list
Tuesday. When he originally pulled the groin, the Marlins said
Fernandez would miss at least three weeks. But now he only feels it
when he runs. &QL;

NOMAR SPEAKS WITH HIS BAT

 NOTES-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was beating up the
Angels last weekend, he had no idea it was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday night's 12-4 rout of Seattle, Garciaparra hit three
home runs, including two grand slams, and finished with 10 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Garciaparra said later. ``I've never in my
life hit three home runs, let alone two grand slams. It was
something else. I was crossing the plate (after the second grand
slam) and I was looking at the guys. I didn't know what to say. I
was speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had a 15-game hitting streak entering the weekend.
Last year, there were just two occasions where he went consecutive
games without a hit. He did not go three straight games without a
hit all season. &QL; 
STAYING HOME
</P>
<P>
   Despite a surprising start, the Chicago White Sox aren't drawing
at Comiskey Park. Through Wednesday, the Sox had drawn 186,729 in
15 home dates, an AL-low average of 12,448 that projects to 983,392
over 79 dates (two games have been lost to rainouts). With the
exception of the 1981 strike year, the Sox haven't failed to draw 1
million since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Reinsdorf says he believes his team would be doing
better had the Illinois legislature not required the new Comiskey
be built next door to the old one in the heart of Chicago's rough
South Side instead of the suburbs. &QL; 
REVOLVING CLOSERS
</P>
<P>
   Since the White Sox traded closer Roberto Hernandez to the
Giants on July 31, 1997, a tag team of Sox closers _ from Matt
Karchner to Bill Simas to Bob Howry _ has converted 57 of 63 save
opportunities, including 17 of 20 by Howry, who was among six
players acquired in the White Flag trade. Hernandez has gone 42 for
56. Howry is part of a bullpen in which the average pitcher earns
$367,500 _ less than 1/16th of Hernandez's $6 million salary with
Tampa Bay. &QL; 
OVERHEARD
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of a three-game series between the Indians and
Orioles on Monday, former teammates Robbie Alomar and Brady
Anderson talked. ``We were talking tennis,'' said Anderson. ``We
asked each other how come our girlfriends can't beat Venus
Williams.'' Anderson's girlfriend is Amanda Coetzer and Alomar is
engaged to Mary Pierce, both members of the women's tour. &QL; 
MILESTONES
</P>
<P>
   Long-time Twins prospect/disappointment Frankie Rodriguez
pitched a seven-inning no-hitter in the first game of a
doubleheader between Triple-A Salt Lake and the Cubs' minor-league
affiliate at Des Moines, Iowa. Rodriguez won 2-1, the only run
scoring after a first-inning throwing error by former El Camino
Real High infielder Dan Cey, son of Ron Cey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means something, but it's not the same,'' said Rodriguez,
who came in 2-3 with an 8.10 ERA. ``It's not the same as a
nine-inning no-hitter, and it's not the big leagues. But it's
definitely a step in the right direction.''...
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Alex Gonzalez and Carlos Delgado, who had their first
major-league hits four days apart in April 1994, nearly reached the
500 milestone in the same game Tuesday night. Gonzalez, who doubled
on April 8, 1994, to end an 0-for-10 start, got No. 500 with a
first-inning double. Two batters later, Delgado, who came in with
498, scored Gonzalez with a single but went hitless the rest of the
night. Delgado, who had one at-bat in '93, had a single and homer
on opening day in 1994. &QL; 
OVERLOOKED?
</P>
<P>
   Yankees coaches Willie Randolph and Chris Chambliss, both of
whom are black, were disappointed at being overlooked as the
Yankees' temporary replacement to Joe Torre. Both men have been
waiting patiently to manage in the big leagues, only to have
68-year-old Don Zimmer _ who was on the verge of retiring _ take
Torre's spot as a favor to George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be patient,'' Randolph said. ``If you keep asking,
`When am I going to get a shot?' you start to sound a little
bitter, like Davey Lopes. I love the game too much for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The real crossroads comes in two years, when Torre is expected
to retire. Chambliss and Randolph are both expecting to be
front-line candidates, although there are some in the organization
who believe former Met/Yankee Lee Mazzilli is moving up quickly
after winning seasons in two years at Single-A and Double-A. &QL;

past few years, no Reggie Jackson or Rollie Fingers, not a Bash
Brother in sight.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting image is one of those 12-inning Wednesday night
games on ESPN that drag into Thursday and threaten to preempt the
morning aerobic shows.
</P>
<P>
   Last place, small payrolls and tiny crowds were a losing
trifecta ticket in the Bay Area. At least the Giants are there at
the end every season. Could anyone even name an A's starter after
Kenny Rogers?
</P>
<P>
   Well, bless my Blue Moon Odom, something good is happening to
the A's. Today, they stand 20-17, winning 10 of their last 12 with
what is generally considered baseball's toughest early season
schedule. For the next two weeks, they don't play anyone close to a
.500 record.
</P>
<P>
   In the tight (read mediocre) American League West, that could
translate into a breakthrough season. Just percentage points out of
first, the A's won't win the division. But in a place where long
losing streaks leave teams just five games back, Oakland is
stepping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting over .500 is huge for us,'' right-hander Gil Heredia
said after he defeated the Tigers 2-1 on Wednesday in Detroit. ``I
feel fortunate to be on a team that is this fired up. It's fun. And
it's nice to know the young players we have can experience this
kind of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The record might not sound that great unless you consider the
A's haven't been above .500 this late in the season in almost three
years (Oakland was 55-54 on Aug. 1, 1996). The A's have a 4.35 ERA
that is third in the AL. Heredia is a big part of that, especially
on the road. In three starts there, he has an 0.89 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a stretch where we're scoring enough to win when the
pitchers do well, and when the pitchers are scuffling, we're
hitting,'' first baseman Jason Giambi said. ``It's good to be in
the zone we're in now.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's won Wednesday without any help from injured 3B Olmedo
Saenz and DH John Jaha and after learning that Rogers probably will
miss at least one start after leaving Tuesday's game with back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't taking these pants off,'' Rogers said. ``I can't tie
my shoes. It's almost impossible to sit in any position without it
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers hadn't completely lost his sense of humor, which is not
bad for a guy who barely has one. Talking about the long plane ride
home to Oakland, Rogers said he would be ``nice and quiet.'' The
last time the A's had an extended plane flight, May 4 from Oakland
to Toronto, Rogers and center fielder Jason McDonald got into a
fight over a card game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more well-known A's have struggled this year, most
notably Ben Grieve, last year's American League Rookie of the Year
who is hitting just .147. But others have been outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   A's pitchers have not walked more than three batters in any of
the last 10 games. Right-hander Brad Rigby entered the weekend with
101/3 innings of scoreless relief. Doug Jones is doing for Oakland
what he has done for Cleveland, Milwaukee, Houston and others in
the last dozen years. Jones has a win and two saves and two holds
in his last five appearances. &QL;

THE MANY MOODS OF JERRY WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a flourish of Jerry West mania last week in the media,
with everyone giving weighty analysis to the status of the
long-time executive of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   He's set to quit, one TV guy stated. He's had it up to here with
Jerry Buss, a reporter asserted. He still can't get Dennis Rodman
out of his system, declared another journalist. He is mad,
frustrated, upset, etc., and wants a one-year respite, still others
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   I heard and read the accounts, and smiled inwardly.
</P>
<P>
   To me, Jerry West never changes.
</P>
<P>
   I've known him closely since October of 1968, and he's still now
what he was then an enigma imprisoned inside a riddle.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Jerry West isn't what he seems to be, and what he seems
to be on the surface of public visibility is a calm, easy-going
gentleman with a coolly dispassionate personality that doubtless
was responsible for his once upon a time earning the sobriquet Mr.
Clutch for his facility at making final-second jump shots that won
games for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerry West I knew as a player was the most human of all
athletic superstars, a man constantly roiled up in pent-up
emotions, tormented terribly by failure, unmoved by success, lashed
by demons that conspired forever against his reaching a state of
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   He has been for the past two decades perhaps the top executive
in professional sports, and yet this season has been in such
private turmoil that he has missed attending most of the Laker home
games.
</P>
<P>
   He is given to dramatic mood shifts, and one day will insist
he's destined for retirement at the end of the season, the next day
will contradict his own words and insist he didn't quite mean what
he was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He has had so many changes of the heart over the years that
you've learned to accept his revelations with a knowing nod and
surreptitious wink.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there have been moments this season when West has
seriously considered giving up his position with the Lakers,
especially after Jerry Buss' acquisition of Dennis Rodman turned
out to be the disaster that West knew it would be.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time not so long ago that Buss allowed West to pull
all the levers with the Lakers, but that hasn't been the case in
recent times when Buss turned down West's request to acquire Mitch
Richmond and brought in Rodman over West's objections.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions by Buss have left West bitter and frustrated to
the point he'd like to leave the Laker organization, and even on
occasion in a fit of candor has said that's exactly what he planned
to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry West also has a keen understanding of economics.
</P>
<P>
   He might not sleep that well any longer and he doesn't and he
might not be happy with himself he isn't and he might want to get
away from the whirlwind that is his existence he does but he also
last summer signed a four-year contract extension worth
approximately $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   That calculates to $3{ million a year, and that's the kind of
income that will assure West and his family he lives with his wife
Karen and their two sons in Bel Air a lifetime of financial
security.
</P>
<P>
   Does he walk away from such dizzying stakes?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West is given to volcanic mood swings, but he's also an
exceptionally bright person who's a realist.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget the first year I worked with West I was the
Laker beat writer for the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner and he
confided to me off-the-record during an off-day after an agonizing
Laker loss that he would probably hang up his sneakers at the end
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   I would hear the same words at intermittent periods during the
next few years, but it wasn't until 1974 that West finally decided
to bid a farewell to a sport in which he had become a legendary
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling here is that Jerry West wouldn't mind fading into
the sunset for good, would like to get away from all those
irritating press interviews, from this weird meddling from Jerry
Buss, from the frustration he's been absorbing from this erratic
Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant team he has put together.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't.
</P>
<P>
   By the normal standards of society, Jerry West is a wealthy man.
</P>
<P>
   But by the standards at which he's accustomed to living
membership at the Bel Air Country Club, the big mansion in Bel Air
he still has a ways to go before he reaches the level that would
allow him to enjoy a retirement free of economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   And so, barring some unforeseen dark circumstance, Jerry West
figures to stay for the remainder of his Laker contract, unless he
receives an incredible offer from some team like the New York
Knicks that he couldn't resist.
</P>
<P>
   It's a certainty that rumors will periodically erupt to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But one always must be cautioned that what Jerry West said
yesterday won't necessarily jibe with what he says today, tomorrow,
or the following days.

 &HT;    One-on-one, charming leadership style Bush's strength
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He is an Ivy League good ol' boy, a Yale and
Harvard man whose leadership style belies the stuffy stereotype
conjured up by his patrician background.
</P>
<P>
   People like Gov. George W. Bush _ even those not politically
predisposed to being on his side. And Capitol players say that has
gone a long way in moving Bush to any success he has had in a job
that's not inherently blessed with power. What has made Bush a
successful hand-to-hand campaigner _ a social chameleon's ability
to talk to a variety of people about a variety of topics _ forms
the basis of his leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   American voters starting to take the measure of what kind of
president Bush might be will find a politician with a style that is
more personal than bully pulpit, according to lawmakers, lobbyists
and Bush watchers.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he knows how to lead and is not afraid to delegate
responsibility to staffers who earn his trust. He wades into
details only on issues that draw his intense interest, a technique
that can heighten the importance of the people who sign on to his
inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas government professor,
Bush brings back memories of another Ivy Leaguer with solid family
ties who set his eyes on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts me in mind of somebody like John Kennedy. He was
someone who did not press the legislature much and was not
particularly aggressive in his lobbying. But he was someone who was
personable, who got along well with individuals. Kennedy had the
ability to strike the spark of affection and respect in mass
audiences that Bush seems to have,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's leadership style has a ``passivity dimension to it,''
Buchanan said. ``He is not a very hands-on leader in terms of the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who jokes about how his life would be easier if Texas were
a dictatorship, has a shorthand explanation for his leadership
style in the legislative arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just what we call persuasion,'' he said. ``All types of
ways. I meet with people all the time. My staff members meet with
people all the time. ... People know exactly what my position is.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually. Anyone paying any attention knows Bush is for tax cuts,
teacher pay hikes and school vouchers, among other things. On those
topics, Bush leads.
</P>
<P>
   On others, he slaloms. The best recent case in point is the
effort to pass a revised anti-hate-crime law. Bush has declined to
say what he thinks of the proposal, which would enhance penalties
for crimes motivated by hatred for a person's sexual orientation,
gender, race or ethnicity. He has said he's uncomfortable creating
special protections for classes of victims, but he is not using the
bully pulpit to say he'll veto such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for his stand, Bush has said repeatedly, ``I will
look at the bill when and if it makes if off the floor of the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, that kind of stonewalling has been the exception. By
policy, he almost always declines to give a thumbs up or thumbs
down on specific bills in the legislative pipeline. But on major
issues, he is generally clear on what he wants. Overall, it's a
leadership style that has helped him win friends and influence
people. Legislative criticism of Bush's leadership has been rare.
But it flowed freely last week as crunch time set it on the
legislative session and Bush's attention was divided between making
law and getting ready to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd say he's been missing in action, but it's
been pretty close to that,'' Houston Rep. Kevin Bailey said at a
news conference called by Democratic lawmakers unhappy with
progress on tax cuts, teacher pay raises and other money matters.
``He's a lot less involved than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting styles
</P>
<P>
   By style, Bush differs markedly from other Texas leaders who
have trolled the Capitol halls in recent years. Democrat Ann
Richards, who served from 1991 to 1995, was about the best ever at
the public side of being governor. But she garnered a reputation as
a somewhat cloistered governor, a degree or two removed from the
lawmaking machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clements, Richards' Republican predecessor, suffered from
the run-government-like-a-business mentality, an approach that
ignores the fact that at times government is so upside-down that if
it were a business, you'd have a fire and collect the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who retired in January, built a
reputation as a leader with unmatchable knowledge, relentless drive
_ and an intimidating presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush style is more personal and subtle, an approach honed
during hours of schmoozing at baseball games, where he spent a lot
of time as managing partner of the Texas Rangers in the early
1990s. A top state senator who is almost always ideologically
aligned with Bush says the governor's style works better than
Bullock's.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who, like many lawmakers, would speak candidly
about Bush only if he remained anonymous, said Bush is a good judge
of audience and situation. The senator has seen Bush joke, cajole
or pound a fist on the desk when needed.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the lawmaker blames Bush for sticking too close to
``message'' _ sometimes to the point of counterproductive
inflexibility. This year's tax-cut proposal is an example. When
revenue projections showed Bush could not get the $2 billion he
wanted for tax cuts, Bush continued to insist on $2 billion, making
compromise more difficult to achieve, according to the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is disagreement on some core questions about the
Bush leadership style _ he is a detail guy, he's not a detail guy _
there is consensus that he is a successful delegator and a leader
who excels one on one.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush style has caused Sen. Rodney Ellis (D-Houston) to lose
sleep over liking a governor his political gut says he shouldn't
like.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush's first legislative session, he and Ellis
disagreed on welfare reform. Ellis, who had been tight with
Richards, expected an ugly battle. It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I talked several times. He was always approachable and
available, even though we didn't agree. And I remember he told me
at one meeting he would veto the bill if it contained certain
provisions,'' Ellis said. ``When it was over, I voted for some
things in the bill that kept me up at night, but I knew that was
the best thing to do, everything considered _ because he knew right
where I stood, and I knew right where he stood. That's the way he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a style of charming that can be disarming. Bush has worked
on it this year _ perhaps as part of an effort to make sure his
presidential campaign does not make him look out of touch at home _
by making unannounced visits in lawmakers' offices. Austin Reps.
Sherri Greenberg and Elliott Naishtat, both Democrats, say it
scores big points with lawmakers and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a one-on-one, or one-on-few, style in which Bush excels. He
used it to great advantage during his 1998 re-election campaign. If
his schedule had him in a hall for an hour, he'd speak for 15
minutes and mingle for 45, shaking hands and posing for photos.
</P>
<P>
   He is less comfortable when he has to stick to a text. His most
wooden performances have come in situations like his March 7
announcement that he was forming a presidential exploratory
committee. Bush usually does better when he can react to a crowd
rather than rely on a text. That talent is the basis for his
leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, says that in his 22 years in the
House, he's never seen a governor as involved with legislators as
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is liable to stop by your office, which is very unusual,''
Wilson said. ``But that's his own personal style, and it bodes well
for him as he makes the move to the national scene. He's not faking
this stuff; he's not play-acting. That's his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Democratic predecessor, Richards, herself long on
personality, never made the connection with lawmakers that Bush has
crafted, according to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when Ann was here, it was like she was talking
down to us _ like a 'big me, little you' kind of thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ellis and Wilson, Sen. John Whitmire is a Houston Democrat
short on good political reasons to get along with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when politics called for it, Whitmire was a leader
in the Democratic response to Bush's State of the State Address.
Whitmire ripped into Bush for talking a lot about tax relief and
not a word about improving transportation in Houston, one of the
few American cities with a need for 24-hour traffic reports.
</P>
<P>
   But while Whitmire does not shy from criticizing Bush's policy,
he has little criticism for Bush the man. Whitmire, a 26-year
lawmaker, tells the story of how Bush once helped him reclaim a
prized memento. When he graduated from high school, Whitmire got a
congratulatory letter from his congressman, George Herbert Walker
Bush. After Bush became president, Whitmire took the framed letter
to an aide for the president to autograph. He never got it back.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when the younger Bush became governor, Whitmire
mentioned the missing letter and asked for help getting it back.
Within hours, it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that goes to show you is George Bush is a people
person,'' Whitmire said. ``I've served under five governors and
he's probably the best people person in that respect of any. He
understands that governing is about people, that politics is about
relationships. And he pays a lot of attention to those
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential pull
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is clearly different this year, thanks to Bush's
upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators perceive that Bush has not given his aides
clear direction on some issues, and that, at times, aides disagree
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   They also say Bush seems somewhat in the dark on details of key
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist with a long-standing knowledge of how Bush operates
says the governor seems far less likely this year to put his neck
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on third base, but he's not taking a lead and trying to
steal home'' is how the lobbyist characterized Bush's
not-quite-committed posture this year. The lobbyist would not
comment on the record because his clients have bills en route to
Bush's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Several border-area leaders, who have been pushing for more
state spending on border highways and job training to compensate
for the effects of free trade with Mexico, say Bush's successful
courting of border voters last year hasn't translated into hands-on
support for their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eliot Shapleigh (D-El Paso) said that when he and Sen.
Eddie Lucio (D-Brownsville) met with Bush recently to ask the
governor to get involved in their uphill battle to get more highway
money for the border, they went away disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart has been there. His hands have not,'' Shapleigh
said. ``To say he's been a hands-on border governor this session
just isn't the case. His mind has been elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush and his staff are getting credit for staying
involved in every detail of welfare reform. Senate Human Services
Committee Chairwoman Judith Zaffirini (D-Laredo) said Bush has
invited her to his office to make suggestions about bills before
her committee and to pick her brain in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's staff, she said, has watched over certain bills at every
turn of the process, even offering their own amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're involved in everything,'' Zaffirini said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments about Bush's style _ ranging from fully involved to
barely participating _ confirm his overall image as a leader who
picks his fights, dives into them head first and delegates the rest
to staffers.
</P>
<P>
   CEO of Texas
</P>
<P>
   Bush is quick to note that his title is governor, not head
lawmaker. ``I'm not the leader of the Legislature. I'm in the
executive branch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him CEO for a multifaceted enterprise in which, at
any time, there is trouble in one or more of the agencies. How a
governor handles those messes can be a measure of how he or she
reacts to crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Bush's big corporate donors, funeral home giant
Service Corporation International of Houston, became entangled in a
regulatory tiff with the Texas Funeral Service Commission last
year, questions were raised about whether the company's $35,000 in
Bush campaign contributions bought intervention from the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office denies that anything improper occurred,
but the appearance of influence-buying helped fuel a growing
controversy about funeral home regulation in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has managed to stay out of the controversy. His top aides
have handled the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Dick McNeil, chairman of the nine-member funeral service
commission, said Bush has never tried to interfere in the agency's
investigation of SCI's embalming practices. McNeil, a Fort Worth
funeral home executive, said neither the governor nor his aides
ever asked him to back off the SCI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil said his only conversation about the controversy came at
a Bush campaign stop in Fort Worth last fall. McNeil said he shook
the governor's hand and said, ``I sure hope we haven't embarrassed
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush told him, ``I will be embarrassed if you have not
done your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush realizes that how he does his job could go a long way in
determining if he gets The Big Job. Though criticism has flowed
from some Democrats, it is nothing like what he will face on the
campaign trail _ both from his GOP primary foes and, if he gets the
nomination, from the Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the legislative session churns toward its May 31
conclusion, Bush insists he has demarcated a clear line between
making law and running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will worry about all the (presidential) exploratory
business and all that later on,'' he said. ``Right now, it's what's
best for Texas.''

AN EARLY LOTTERY PREVIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While savoring the ``incredibly Mike-like'' NBA playoffs, let's
pause to thank the little people who have made this post-season
unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   But leave Bob Costas out of it. The little rascals we're here to
toast are the down and out, those 13 teams that rolled over like
the family dog after he went frat boy on the living room carpet.
Teams whose final regular-season games had layoff implications.
</P>
<P>
   To help steer the same jokers away from doom next year, we have
decided to offer some helpful suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take it from the bottom:
</P>
<P>
   29. Vancouver Grizzlies. Motto: ``Please don't feed the Bryant
Reeves.'' Good news: The autograph Shareef Abdur-Rahim thought he
was signing for a three-year-old boy turned out to be a six-year
contract extension. Draft lottery Ping-Pong balls: 250 (out of
1,000). Needs: Forrest Gump and a sucker who will give them a
decent player for trading down to draft Duke power forward Elton
Brand.
</P>
<P>
   28. L.A. Clippers. Motto: ``Larry Brown slept here.'' Good news:
They know a great CBA player when they see one. Ping-Pong balls:
200. Needs: The green light to use what could be as much as $17
million in cap room.
</P>
<P>
   27. Chicago Bulls. Motto: ``Hang up after six rings.'' Good
news: Enough cap-room loot to hide GM Jerry Krause in the witless
protection program. Ping-Pong balls: 157. Needs: More American
players and another excuse to fire up a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   26. Denver Nuggets. Motto: ``Favored by 2 over the Clippers.''
Good news: Antonio McDyess still likes Nick Van Exel. Ping-Pong

   subu UF7 Weakly draft update
</P>
<P>
   By submitting his soul to the NBA Draft, UCLA point guard Baron
Davis has inspired local pundits to grant the Clippers a month of
vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   They figure the Clips are starving at point guard, so drafting
Baron will be automatic. No need for research or homework.
</P>
<P>
   Time out, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Clippers like Davis, but they have eyes for a few
other young turks available in the lottery pool. The waters remain
a bit brackish, because underclass hotshots like Rhode Island's
Lamar Odom, Duke's Corey Maggette and Jonathan Bender of Picayune
(Miss.) High have until today to declare their draft status. And
the Clips' draft position won't be determined until next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So while the same media prophets who didn't bother advising them
to draft Vince Carter last year are offering wisdom this year, the
Clippers will be busy studying the strengths and weaknesses of
several players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a test scheduled for Friday,'' Jeff Weltman, the
team's director of player personnel said, ``why would you take it
on Monday?''
</P>
<P>
   subu UF7 Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The league's all-defensive squad - as selected by its coaches -
seems invalidated by the omission of Portland's Greg Anthony and
Minnesota's Kevin Garnett. The 7-foot Garnett simply is the most
eager and versatile defender since Larry H. Parker. The on-the-ball
defense of Anthony, who spells Damon Stoudamire at the point, is
stickier than the fingers of a two-year-old. ... Dion Glover, the
Georgia Tech shooting guard who missed his sophomore season with a
bum knee and entered the draft this week, is listed as a top 20
selection by three NBA talent evaluators who begged to remain
anonymous. ... In his sneaker commercial, Latrell Sprewell refers
to himself as ``... the American Dream.'' Sleep tight.

CHARISMATIC WINS THE PREAKNESS AT 8-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Charismatic, the onetime claiming horse who stunned
the racing world two weeks ago when he won the Kentucky Derby at
odds of 31-1, pulled an even more unlikely trick Saturday when he
won the Preakness at 8-1 and advanced to the brink of the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   He was chased home again by Menifee, who lost the Derby by the
length of his neck and lost the Preakness by a length and a half.
And so, for the third straight year, a colt won both the Derby and
the Preakness and needed only to win the Belmont Stakes to achieve
a feat that only 11 horses have accomplished, none since Affirmed
21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go to the Belmont full of optimism,'' said D. Wayne
Lukas, who trains Charismatic for Bob and Beverly Lewis of Los
Angeles. ``I told Bob and Beverly before the Kentucky Derby: `I
don't know about the first two. But we'll look good in the
Belmont.' I just like his style.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood drama and soap-opera twists, few horses can
surpass Charismatic, a 3-year-old chestnut son of Summer Squall,
who twice was offered in claiming races for $62,500. But nobody
claimed him. Then, he went on a racing rampage, running in major
stakes every two weeks with these runaway results: fourth in the
Santa Anita Derby on April 3, first in the Lexington Stakes on
April 18, first in the Derby on May1 and first in the 124th
Preakness on this sunny and cool Saturday afternoon at Pimlico Race
Course.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the final mountain to climb: the Belmont Stakes in New York
on June 5, a mile and a half grind that proved the end of the
Triple Crown dream for Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998.
Both were trained by Bob Baffert, and both missed their shot at the
Triple Crown in the final strides. Silver Charm was nailed by Touch
Gold, and Real Quiet was caught by Victory Gallop. And fate once
more casts Elliott Walden in a supporting role: he was the trainer
of Victory Gallop, who ran second in the Derby and Preakness, and
his colt Menifee so far has followed in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic also carried an entire team with him, starting with
Lukas, who won six straight Triple Crown races until Baffert
overshadowed him two years ago. And add his jockey, Chris Antley,
who missed 16 months of work recently after entering in an alcohol
and drug rehabilitation clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes beyond my greatest expectations,'' Antley said in
some disbelief after the Preakness. ``This is special. The road
back for me was long and hard. Maybe that's what I needed in my
life _ to have something taken away. Now, I have the chance to win
the Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas and Antley worked their second dose of magic against nine
of the horses they outran in the Kentucky Derby, when Charismatic
won by rushing from seventh place to first in the homestretch, plus
three newcomers. People were flabbergasted that a colt with his
history could gain the splendor of winning the Kentucky Derby only
three months after running in a claiming race.
</P>
<P>
   They apparently were still flabbergasted Saturday: Charismatic
went to the post as the fifth betting choice and the highest-priced
Derby winner in the Preakness since Dark Star ran fifth in 1953 at
9-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the long shot raced one more time into sports history and
left some intriguing stars in his dust.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, who ran third in the Derby, faded to seventh this
time after 10 straight finishes in the money. Kimberlite Pipe,
winner of the Louisiana Derby and a favorite with the betting
public, ran eighth. Valhol, who after winning the Arkansas Derby
was involved in a dispute over whether his jockey had buzzed him
with an electrical device, ran ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, who ran despite words from his trainer, Carl Nafzger,
that he would scratch the horse rather than run him from the No. 13
post position, finished 10th. Worldly Manner, the mystery horse
from Dubai who ran a reasonable seventh in the Derby after not
racing for eight months, finished 12th. And the only filly in the
race, Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby, developed some
breathing problems during the race and was pulled up by her rider,
Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic lingered in 10th for half a mile while speedballs
like Vicar, Cat Thief and Kimberlite Pipe swapped the lead. It was
a fast pace: they went half a mile in 45 1/5 seconds,
three-quarters in 1:10 1/5. By then, Charismatic was making his
move from eighth place with Menifee on his heels. But Antley,
ignoring the common wisdom that the rail was the speed lane at
Pimlico this past week, took his colt to the outside and asked for
action.
</P>
<P>
   He got it. Charismatic shot past seven horses in the stretch and
withstood the furious close of Menifee. At the wire, he had a
length and a half on Menifee, who held second place by a head over
Badge, with Stephen Got Even fourth and Patience Game fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and three-sixteenths in 1:55 1/5, paid
$18.80 for a $2 bet to win and added $650,000 to a bankroll that
has leapt in two weeks to $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, jubilant as he neared the Triple Crown, said, ``I told
Chris this morning, you get him to the far turn in position, and
I'll get him home.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lukas, this was his fifth victory in the Preakness. He won
three Triple Crown races in 1995 with two different horses: Thunder
Gulch won the Kentucky Derby, Timber Country won the Preakness and
Thunder Gulch returned to win the Belmont. But Charismatic gave him
a shot at sweeping the Triple Crown with one superior animal, a
onetime claimer who finally convinced his doubters.

US DEFENDS AIRSTRIKE ON KOSOVO VILLAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States Saturday defended an attack that
killed scores of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo, strongly
suggesting the victims died as ``human shields'' when US bombs
obliterated a Serbian military camp and command post.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the site as ``a valid military target,'' US and NATO
officials said they had no prior knowledge that the ethnic
Albanians, who reportedly had been traveling through southern
Kosovo on tractors, were situated near the Serb outpost Thursday
night when US bombs and missiles ripped through the village of
Korisa.
</P>
<P>
   The raid apparently caused the most civilian deaths, as many as
87, of any attack in NATO's 54-day air campaign against Yugolsav
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing regret for the civilian casualties, Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon suggested the victims had been
positioned at the site by the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out of the hills and they happened to be put next to
a building that the Serbs had to know was a target because it's
exactly the type of building, the type of installation, we have
been hitting with regularity throughout Kosovo,'' Bacon said at a
Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, whose assertion was denied by Belgrade, cited numerous
reports by ethnic Albanian refugees that Serb forces have used
civilians as ``human shields'' at other military sites and
strategic locations, such as bridges. Bacon called the practice
part of Milosevic's effort to turn world opinion against the NATO
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think all of this is done to complicate the targeting and
to create exactly this type of public relations event that he
thinks he can use to his advantage,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the civilian deaths, NATO Saturday unleashed one of its
heaviest aerial assaults yet on Serbian targets in Kosovo. Serbian
media reported that NATO fired more than 90 missiles during the
daylight attacks, and attacks mounted after nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accident did not shake NATO's resolve in any way,'' Bacon
said. ``The air campaign will continue, with increasing force,
particularly against Serb ground forces and police units in Kosovo.
. . . In fact, the destruction will accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson stepped up his opposition to the US
policy in Kosovo, warning that ``the conduct of this war'' may soon
present a ``special moral challenge for this generation'' as
powerful as the challenge of the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement address at Mitchell College in New London,
Conn., Jackson renewed his call for NATO to suspend the bombing and
seek a negotiated peace. He also chastised allied leaders for not
seizing the apparent diplomatic opportunity that arose when
Milosevic, at Jackson's request, recently freed three American
soldiers. ``We must not succumb to the arrogance of power, the
idolatry of might,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO airstrikes are aimed at forcing Milosevic to accept a
peace settlement and permit the return to Kosovo of nearly 800,000
ethnic Albanians who have fled or have been forced from the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little action Saturday on the diplomatic front,
other than plans for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's meeting
Monday with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who is expected to
mediate with Milosevic in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari is scheduled to resume talks with US and Russian
officials on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, as Serbian officials accused NATO of
targeting ethnic Albanians to thwart Milosevic's alleged desire for
the refugees to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their efforts to prove that they alone can bring the
refugees back home and that only by force, the NATO fascists are
murdering all those who wish to return on their own or with the
Yugoslav government's help,'' Milosevic's government said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia claims that more than 1,200 civilians have been
killed and 5,000 injured since the NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The US and NATO officials, thrust again into the uncomfortable
position of explaining civilian casualties, said they had no doubt
the Korisa bombing target had been used since at least late April
by the Serbs as a military camp and command post. An armored
personnel carrier and at least 10 pieces of artillery were spotted
at the site, the allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past weeks, looking at that target, we had no evidence
that there were civilians present,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, German General Walter Jertz.
</P>
<P>
   Three US F-16s bombed the site after the pilots visually
identified it through aircraft systems as the target, officials
said. One of the pilots ``did see silhouettes of vehicles on the
ground,'' Jertz said.
</P>
<P>
   But allied officials said the pilot had no way of knowing the
vehicles might have been tractors or that civilians might have been
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are civilians in a target that has been clearly
identified as a military target, it certainly wasn't NATO that
brought them there,'' said Peter Daniel, a NATO spokesman. ``We
know who brought them there.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute roiled as NATO intensified an effort to destabilize
Milosevic's troops, dropping leaflets on Serb forces in Kosovo that
said, ``Leave your unit and your equipment and get out of Kosovo
now. If you choose to stay, NATO will relentlessly attack you from
every direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the strife, about 300 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo
crossed into Macedonia Saturday, the largest group to reach the
border in 10 days. Aid workers said the refugees reported that tens
of thousands of displaced Kosovars are surrounded by Serb forces
and unable to reach safety in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Montenegrin officials said that the Yugoslav army had
stopped Kosovars from fleeing to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers accompanied 616 additional refugees Saturday to
Fort Dix, N.J., where the refugees will be temporarily housed
before living with relatives or host families throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In Westfield, hundreds of soldiers gathered at Barnes Air
National Guard Base Saturday for a sendoff for three units of
Balkan-bound troops.
</P>
<P>
   The 104th Fighter Wing out of Westfield was joined by members of
the 110th Fighter Wing from Battle Creek, Mich., and 124th Wing
from Boise, Idaho. The combined units, with nearly 500 troops, will
form the 131st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron.

BLAIR SETS DEADLINE TO BREAK ULSTER DEADLOCK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair Saturday night set a deadline
of June 30 for the Northern Ireland parties to break the deadlock
blocking progress in the peace settlement and to establish the new
power-sharing government in Belfast called for in the accord.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from 10 Downing Street said Blair had told the party
leaders that the new final date was ``absolute.'' It argued that
proposals put on the table in extended discussions the past two
days offered a way forward that did not compromise the
``fundamental positions'' of the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle is the refusal of the Ulster Unionists, the
Protestant party that has the most elected representatives in the
new Northern Ireland Assembly, to permit the political arm of the
Irish Republican Army, Sinn Fein, from taking up its two positions
in the 10-member Assembly executive unless the IRA begins to turn
over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposals are understood to call for the immediate
appointment of the ministers and delineation of their
responsibilities. The final turnover of power would be dependent
upon a certification from John de Chastelain, the Canadian general
in charge of the disarmament commission, that the appointees can be
classified as nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's announcement amounted to the third time that a firm
deadline has been set in the intensified two-year negotiations
aimed at ending the sectarian bloodshed in the conflicted British
province.
</P>
<P>
   Blair identified an ambitious May 1998 goal in a speech to the
House of Commons in September 1997 in which he first laid out his
objective of obtaining a settlement to the conflict that has cost
more than 3,600 lives over the past 30 years. When the talks
appeared to be faltering, George Mitchell, a former U.S. Senate
majority leader chairing them, boldly moved the date forward to the
second week in April. The accord was signed on Good Friday, April
10.
</P>
<P>
   The June 30 deadline coincides with the July 1 date on which
governing powers will be transferred from London to the two new
legislatures in Scotland and Wales. Creating regional assemblies to
deal with local problems in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh, a
process called devolution, is a centerpiece of the Blair program of
reforming British politics.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Northern Ireland Assembly were elected last
June and have already held meetings in their ornate refurbished
chambers in the imposing Stormont government palace in Belfast. But
the creation of the cabinet to run the new government, the step
that will lead to the formal transfer of power from London, has
been held up by the impasse on when guerrilla arms must begin to be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Downing Street statement followed a series of telephone
contacts between Blair and the various party leaders Saturday and
10 hours of talks between those officials, the Irish prime
minister, Bertie Ahern, and Blair on Friday.

POLITICS OF FEAR BECOMES POLITICS OF INEVITABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 bc-ISRAEL-ELECTION-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Before Israel's last election, Bus No. 18 _ struck
twice within a week by militant Islamic suicide bombers _ became a
symbol of fear. Benjamin Netanyahu rode to victory in that vote
through nightly TV ads focusing on the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final days before Monday's vote, Israelis like Yoel
Markus clamber aboard Bus 18 without a second thought. Markus, who
voted for ``Bibi'' Netanyahu in 1996 because of security fears, is
switching sides this time, like many Israelis, to support
front-runner Ehud Barak, who polls say has a slight chance to avoid
a runoff with a big showing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is like this bus, it's going to go the same
way whether Bibi or Barak is driving,'' said Markus, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Markus and many Israelis seem to be turning their attention away
from securing Israel's borders to focus on problems within Israeli
society _ especially a deep religious-secular divide and a
faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters to me is Bibi's friends,'' said Markus. ``Over 2
1/2 years, we've watched Bibi get too close to the religious
parties. I don't have anything against the religious, but I don't
want to be controlled by them.''
</P>
<P>
   People who favor secular government _ some 75 percent of the
country's 6 million population _ fear that the ultra-Orthodox
religious parties have seized too much power in Netanyahu's
fractious coalition. Although many of these voters profess strong
links to Judaism and its traditions at home, they bristle at a
sense of religous intolerance and entitlement that they feel the
ultra-Orthodox have brought to government.
</P>
<P>
   So a growing number within the secular majority _ right and left
and especially the crucial Russian immigrant vote _ are galvanizing
forces against the religious parties that came to form the core of
Netanyahu's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In the election to choose a new prime minister and parliament, a
new secular party emerged solely devoted to fighting against the
religious parties. Its slogan is ``We have to stop them.'' Natan
Sharansky's Russian-immigrant bloc _ which has surged in population
from 700,000 to 800,000 since the 1996 election _ has an ad
campaign with the slogan ``No to Shas Control,'' referring to the
powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu keeps trying to make the issue security, even
resurrecting the 1996 bus bombing footage to make his point. But
Barak, a respected former general, has succeeded in blurring the
political lines by also stressing security in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll Friday had Netanyahu trailing Barak by as much as
13 percent. For the first time, pollsters were projecting on Friday
that Barak could take the majority of the vote in the five-way race
for prime minister Monday and avoid an anticipated runoff election
slated for June 1. The key to Netanyahu's precipitous drop in the
polls appears to be the Russian vote. In 1996, Netanyahu carried 65
percent of that vote. In this election, his support has fallen to
about 50 percent of the Russian voters.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sharansky, a Cabinet minister in Netanyahu's
government, said the religious parties' control of the influential
Interior Ministry has caused Russian immigrants to defect from
their traditional support for Netanyahu's conservative politics to
Barak's more secular line.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians seeking to emigrate to Israel have been challenged
on their status as Jews by the strict ultra-Orthodox who run the
ministry that oversees immigration and implements the Israeli Law
of Return. Thousands of Russians' conversions to Judaism are not
recognized by the ministry, nor are many marriages between Jews and
non-Jews. Dietary laws are being forced on Russian butchers who
sell pork sausage. And government investigators are cracking down
with fines on stores that open on the Jewish Sabbath. There is a
movement to change the laws that shut down public transportation on
the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Russian voters don't like the ultra-Orthodox
having so much influence over their lives. They want to play down
the role of religion in this country. They want to feel part of
Israeli society,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of religion in the race was clear aboard Bus 18
as it wound its way through the heart of Jerusalem last week. It
bumped past the neon-lit fast-food chains in the busy downtown,
through the largely secular and wealthy neighborhood of the German
Colony, and down into the modest housing blocks of Katamon, where
posters for the religious parties were plastered on nearly every
lamppost and bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Markus, a grocery store manager, said that after serving three
years in the military, he resents the Yeshiva students' exemption
from compulsory military service, as well as their tax-exempt
status. The resentment is compounded by a constricting economy and
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should have to do something for this country,'' he
said. ``No one gets a free ride.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's most dramatic policy statements early in the
campaign was a vow to enforce a recent Israeli High Court ruling
against a blanket exemption from military service for Yeshiva
students. Focusing his campaign on Israel's failing economy, Barak
has made the economic link between public spending and the rising
influence of the religious parties. He has criticized Netanyahu for
funding their new religious institutions and settlements in the
West Bank while cutting funding for Israel's new lifeblood, its
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Peleg Bahat, 26, heading home from a computer programming class,
said: ``To me the main issue is the religious problem. The feeling
between the religious and the secular is something on the verge of
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am like most Israelis. I am not really religious. I
define myself as human, Jewish, then Israeli. I want to have
tolerance in our society. And I want that anchored in law.
Netanyahu has allowed the religious to diminish that. Barak will
protect that tolerance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Efraim Yosef, 34, a father of five children and a Yeshiva
student, was holding a plastic bag filled with leather-bound
interpretations of the Torah as he waited for the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secular people are afraid. They see religion getting
stronger. They want to stop it, but they can't,'' he said, running
his fingers through his long black beard as he spoke. ``They will
never succeed. The signs that the Messiah is coming are everywhere,
and should not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barak is elected it is a big danger to the spiritual core
of Israel. Israel can only be a religious democracy. It can be
nothing else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments like this reflect the battle for the soul of Israel _
whether it will define itself as a religious state or a secular
democracy. It has been an undercurrent of debate in Israel since
well before it emerged as a nation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is as complex as it is polarized _ splintered among
ultra-Orthodox, modern Orthodox, religious nationalists,
conservative Jews, secular Zionists, and atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Yehoshua Porat, a history professor at Hebrew University, says
that what makes this election unique is that perhaps for the first
time a need to control the ultra-Orthodox and challenge their
attempts to fashion Israel as a religious state is being dragged
out into the open.
</P>
<P>
   Porat, a long-time activist in the Zionist-left Meretz Party,
surprised the country in 1996 when he openly supported Netanyahu
for his strong position on security. He believes Netanyahu has
succeeded in ensuring Israeli security within the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Now Porat insists that the power of the ``Haredim,'' or
``God-fearing,'' as the ultra-Orthodox are called, is the key issue
in the election, and justifies his switch to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haredim are becoming a parasitic sector. We should not
have to finance these parasites. We should have a better allocation
of our resources,'' he said. ``When Likud sees how much their
closeness to Shas undercuts their constituency, they will rethink
their attitude toward the Haredim. But for now, it is why Netanyahu
will lose.''

GORE WINS STRAW POLL HANDILY AT STATE ISSUES CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. _ As foot soldiers patrolled the floor and
campaign colonels eyed the fray from perches high in the Civic
Center, Vice President Al Gore easily defeated former senator Bill
Bradley Saturday in a straw poll held at the state Democratic
Party's issues convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore garnered 68.5 percent of the ballots cast by 1,649
delegates. Bradley claimed 23.5 percent, and 8 percent of the
delegates cast ballots with ``no preference.'' Still, both camps
declared themselves satisfied with the results of what state party
officials said was the nation's first presidential straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory was bolstered by Gore loyalists who
aggressively canvassed delegates from one end of the arena to the
other, working to maximize Gore's margin of victory to stave off
what could have been a political embarrassment for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Bradley presence appeared to be limited to one
sign in a far corner of the Civic Center and a few dozen plastic
basketballs distributed by Representative Paul E. Caron of
Springfield, a reference to Bradley's career as a professional
basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Caron, a state committee member who supports Bradley, engineered
the straw poll at the otherwise pro forma issues convention,
despite pressure from state and national party leaders to cancel
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gave delegates a chance to have their voices heard. I'm
very pleased with Bill Bradley's showing,'' said Caron.
</P>
<P>
   If Caron was satisfied with the vote, Gore's contingent was both
satisfied and relieved. Dennis Newman, who coordinated the New
Hampshire primary for President Clinton in 1996, relaxed his battle
demeanor with a small, tight smile when he pronounced himself
``very pleased'' with the poll's tally.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said the vice president would have made the same effort
in recruiting campaign workers at the convention regardless of
whether a straw poll had been held.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the state's top Democratic leaders _ including
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran, Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, and Secretary of State
William F. Galvin _ received telephone calls from Gore late last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore is scheduled to attend a fund-raiser Monday in
Boston, such personal attention from the vice president on the eve
of a straw poll seemed to be more than a social reminder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the national party's opposition to a straw poll,
political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said that the experience
``could be a blessing in disguise. It gets them off the ground and
organized. You might as well get ahead of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's nascent campaign has been dogged by a perception that the
candidate is too rigid, that he micromanages the operation, and
that Clinton's larger-than-life successes and shortcomings have
obscured both Gore's message and his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll mirrored levels of support for Gore in several
national polls matching him one-on-one against Bradley. But, as
Marsh said, it was a level of support Gore should have expected at
a Massachusetts convention dominated by party diehards.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign targeted the ``institutional support'' the
convention would attract and ``called in their chits,'' Marsh said.
She cited the presence of Michael Whouley, a key Democratic
campaign strategist, as evidence of how important the vice
president had considered the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joan M. Menard of Somerset, the state party
chairman, had opposed the straw poll but was noncommittal afterward
about whether she would oppose such votes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what's happening at the time,'' she said. ``Once
the state committee made its decision, it was over, and I think the
delegates were happy it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   As the straw poll was being conducted, the convention heard
rallying speeches from several Democratic leaders, including
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, former governor Michael S. Dukakis,
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, and former Democratic National
Committee chairman Steve Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,804 delegates in attendance were far short of the 3,400
eligible Democrats. While the straw vote captured most of the news
media attention, the convention's business also involved approving
an ``action agenda'' on education, economic equality, health care,
economic security, and social tolerance.

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SURVIVES ATTEMPT TO OUST HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin survived an attempt to
impeach him Saturday, as opposition legislators, crumbling under
intense Kremlin pressure, failed to amass the necessary number of
votes on five counts against the Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's political crisis showed no signs of easing. Yeltsin
faces a new showdown with parliament this week after outraging
lawmakers by dismissing the popular prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   And in a potential sign of new health woes for the aging
president, whose penchant for erratic public behavior has grown in
recent weeks, Yeltsin made a surprise hospital visit Saturday that
the Kremlin described as a ``routine planned checkup'' that just
happened to be scheduled for the day of the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote laid bare the deep divisions in Russian society.
Although Yeltsin is universally disliked _ the approval rating of
Russia's first popularly elected leader has diminished to 2 percent
_ some Russians believe the democratic and market transformation he
began are moves in the right direction, no matter how flawed the
results so far.
</P>
<P>
   But a much larger number, represented by the Communists and
their allies in the Duma, believe that Yeltsin's policies have been
a cynical and corrupt exercise aimed at destroying the country. As
life for most Russians gets worse, this split could widen and
drastically affect the results of planned December parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lies, hypocrisy, and cynicism have become the foundations of
Yeltsin's policy,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov told the
State Duma before the vote. ``Yeltsin is absolute evil for
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin Saturday was silent. A Kremlin spokesman said Yeltsin
had held meetings at one of his suburban residences. Yeltsin, who
has appeared unsteady and has had trouble speaking in recent weeks,
has a long history of serious illnesses played down by his
spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Yeltsin's health has become important again since
he fired Primakov and threatened to disband the Duma and set new
elections if the opposition-dominated lower house of parliament
voted for impeachment. The unpredictable Yeltsin, who thrives on
confrontation more than day-to-day governance, could still lash out
if the Duma refuses Wednesday to approve Sergei Stepashin, his
choice to replace Primakov as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Duma leaders said they would consider Stepashin's candidacy, but
most were noncommittal. Stepashin said: ``Thank God, disaster has
been averted.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the closest Yeltsin's opponents came to a ``yes'' vote
came on a motion accusing him of illegally waging war in the
separatist republic of Chechnya. The motion received 283 votes,
short of the 300 needed in the 450-seat legislature to begin
proceedings to remove Yeltsin from office, and far less than the
312 votes Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist, had
predicted a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The other counts all failed by larger margins. Those charges
accused Yeltsin of betraying the Soviet Union, destroying the
Russian military, illegally using deadly force by sending tanks to
end a 1993 standoff with parliament, and conducting economic
policies that brought about ``genocide'' of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   As angry Communist supporters in the Duma shouted ``Shame!
Shame!'' at legislators who opposed impeachment, their disconsolate
leaders sought to put a brave face on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a defeat because the majority of deputies
voted for impeachment,'' Zyuganov said. Before voting, Zyuganov had
accused Yeltsin of destroying thousands of years of Russian
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of a pro-democracy bloc that supported
impeachment only on the Chechnya accusation, said it was the
Communists who had destroyed Russia during their 70-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communists killed tens of millions of people in this country,
brought the country to collapse,'' Yavlinsky said, adding that the
Communist Party ``has no right to power in the country, and no
impeachment can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will share Yeltsin's responsibility,'' Zyuganov shot back.
The Communist leader later said he believed heavy lobbying by the
Kremlin had pressured some lawmakers to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   While other legislators charged that Yeltsin's administration
was offering money, perks, and plush government jobs in return for
``no'' votes, a more likely reason for the turnabout is that some
lawmakers did not want to risk losing the jobs and perks they
already have. Then there were those who could not be bothered, like
the lawmaker who sent in a telegram wishing the Duma well from his
vacation spot in the Canary Islands.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Mayor Yury Luzhkov, a likely contender in
next year's presidential elections whose new political party,
Otechestvo, is not eligible to take part in parliamentary elections
until December. Duma sources say Luzhkov ordered some 30-odd
supporters in the Russian Regions bloc, many of whom had supported
impeachment on the Chechnya motion, to vote against it.

IN GOLF, THE NUMBERS CAN LIE, EXCEPT FOR THE SCORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no secret who the longest hitters are on the PGA Tour.
Ask the most casual golf fan and they will likely tell you John
Daly and Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But who's the best iron player on the tour? How about the best
putter, the best bunker player or the most consistent player
driving the ball in the fairway? And, more important, does their
expertise translate into success _ in terms of tournaments and
money?
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're Woods, or David Duval _ the world's No. 1-ranked
player and top money-winner on the tour _ the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is proof that success in all areas means money in the
bank. He is ranked No. 1 on the tour in putting, No. 7 in driving
distance and No. 2 in greens in regulation, which has helped earn
him $2,728,750 this year alone. Like Duval, Woods also has used
statistical domination _ third in driving distance, fifth in greens
in regulation _ to vault his way to third on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   They are the exceptions, however.
</P>
<P>
   While statistics translate into winning in most sports, on the
PGA Tour it takes more than being the game's best putter, or sand
player, or iron player.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest money-winners are those who have all parts of their
game working well at the same time _ during the right week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, whoever is winning each week seems to be the guy
who is hitting it the best and rolling it the best,'' Phil
Mickelson said. ``Just about anyone out here has the capability to
hit it close from 150 yards. But week in and week out, the guy who
is hitting it the best that week _ and putting the best _ seems to
be the guy who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The names atop some of the tour's statistical categories are
probably unfamiliar to most. Fred Funk is No. 1 in driving
accuracy, hitting 80.5 percent of fairways, but he is 41st on the
money list. Chris Couch is second in driving distance behind Daly,
but ranks 131st on the money list. Rory Sabbatini is fifth in that
category and 102nd overall, and Robert Allenby leads the tour in
greens in regulation, but is 85th in money won.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate, by comparison, is eighth on the money list without
being ranked in the top 25 in driving distance, accuracy, sand
saves, greens in regulation or putting.
</P>
<P>
   Just more proof that in golf, statistics don't tell the whole
story.

GREG RAY HAS GONE FULL-CIRCLE AT INDY (FOR BULLDOG)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after panhandling his way into the front row of the
Indianapolis 500, Texan Greg Ray has returned to the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway riding in style.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, a resident of Plano and No. 1 driver for Team Menard, is
the chalk favorite to win the pole position Saturday for the
world's greatest auto race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on pole. I'll be very disappointed if we're not
on pole,'' said Ray, who wrote the feel-good story of the Speedway
last May when he qualified his underfunded and basic black
Dallara/Aurora in the middle of the three-car front row.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and powerhouse Team Menard made headlines during an IRL open
test at the 2.5-mile Speedway last month. Ray's lap at 227.072 mph
on April 12 was the fastest ever recorded by a ``new formula'' IRL
car. Ray also posted the fifth-fastest lap of the four-day session
at 223.753 mph, numbers that indicate Billy Boat's year-old
pole-winning average of 223.504 mph is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have way too much respect for all the other teams and
drivers to say we're the pole favorite,'' said Ray, anticipating
the scheduled opening of practice this weekend. ``But going off the
\Rtest\S speeds, I think they have to throw our name in the hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We qualified second last year and deep down in my heart _
without anybody taking it the wrong way _ I have worked so hard the
last three months. It's what I think about when I get up. It's what
I think about when I get on that treadmill, when I push those
weights, when I eat, when I go to sleep. I want to be on pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I do that? I don't know. But I know in my heart that
nobody is trying as hard to do all the right things on and off the
racetrack to prepare for qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and team manager Thomas Knapp shocked the IRL community last
year when they overcame the last-minute loss of a major sponsor to
earn a then-career best No. 2 starting spot _ smack dab between
well-funded A.J. Foyt Racing teammates Boat and Kenny Brack.
Running with the backing of a patchwork quilt of sponsors that
included Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Ray led 18 laps on
race day before retiring with a gearbox problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ray finished 18th in the 33-car field, but his determination on
the racetrack and his disarming demeanor off it marked him as a
marketable star.
</P>
<P>
   Team-owner John Menard took notes and hired Ray and Knapp at the
end of last season to replace NASCAR-bound star Tony Stewart and
veteran crew chief Larry Curry. Armed with Menard's considerable
financial and mechanical resources _ and their preferred
Dallara/Aurora/Firestone package _ Ray and Knapp immediately joined
the IRL's short list of elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Knapp's 1999 qualifying program earned the No. 1
starting spot at the one-mile Phoenix International Raceway in
March and for the tragedy-marred event at the 1.5-mile Lowe's Motor
Speedway in Concord, N.C., on May 1. Ray, who is winless in 16
career IRL starts, admitted that little of what was fast at those
tracks will transfer to the Speedway's long straightaways and flat
corners.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition has taken notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're somebody we're going to have to contend with for the
pole,'' Boat said of his Team Menard archrivals. ``They have an
in-house engine program, and they've shown they can be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray was in the lead of the VisionAire 500 at LMS when the race
was stopped and subsequently canceled after three spectators were
killed and eight injured by a wheel and flying debris caused by a
three-car wreck. No points were awarded, and there are no plans to
reschedule the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something tragic like what happened at
Charlotte, it's hard to even talk about the racing,'' Ray said
after an emotional sendoff luncheon/roast attended by 200 at The
Speedway Club at TMS on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That event featured a slide show and family stories about Greg
from his parents, Ginger and Benny; an IRL-commissioned feature
video on Ray's career; the proclaiming of ``Greg Ray Day'' by Plano
mayor John Longstreet and plenty of zings at Ray's lead-foot
driving style.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who finished a career-best second to Boat at TMS last June,
took everyone's best shots and fired a few back. But with his voice
cracking, Ray closed the program talking about being able to
realize his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to live your dream is very, very special,'' said Ray,
32. ``Being a race-car driver is seen to be childish by some. But
this is all I've ever wanted to do. I really feel like I'm closing
in on that dream. It's nice. I'll leave it at that.''

   But the opposition has taken notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're somebody we're going to have to contend with for the
pole,'' Boat said of his Team Menard archrivals. ``They have an
in-house engine program, and they've shown they can be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray was in the lead of the VisionAire 500 at LMS when the race
was stopped and subsequently canceled after three spectators were
killed and eight injured by a wheel and flying debris caused by a
three-car wreck. No points were awarded, and there are no plans to
reschedule the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something tragic like what happened at
Charlotte, it's hard to even talk about the racing,'' Ray said
after an emotional sendoff luncheon/roast attended by 200 at The
Speedway Club at TMS on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That event featured a slide show and family stories about Greg
from his parents, Ginger and Benny; an IRL-commissioned feature
video on Ray's career; the proclaiming of ``Greg Ray Day'' by Plano
mayor John Longstreet and plenty of zings at Ray's lead-foot
driving style.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who finished a career-best second to Boat at TMS last June,
took everyone's best shots and fired a few back. But with his voice
cracking, Ray closed the program talking about being able to
realize his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to live your dream is very, very special,'' said Ray,
32. ``Being a race-car driver is seen to be childish by some. But
this is all I've ever wanted to do. I really feel like I'm closing
in on that dream. It's nice. I'll leave it at that.''

GREG RAY HAS GONE FULL-CIRCLE AT INDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year after panhandling his way into the front row of the
Indianapolis 500, Texan Greg Ray has returned to the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway riding in style.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, a resident of Plano and No. 1 driver for Team Menard, is
the chalk favorite to win the pole position Saturday for the
world's greatest auto race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on pole. I'll be very disappointed if we're not
on pole,'' said Ray, who wrote the feel-good story of the Speedway
last May when he qualified his underfunded and basic black
Dallara/Aurora in the middle of the three-car front row.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and powerhouse Team Menard made headlines during an IRL open
test at the 2.5-mile Speedway last month. Ray's lap at 227.072 mph
on April 12 was the fastest ever recorded by a ``new formula'' IRL
car. Ray also posted the fifth-fastest lap of the four-day session
at 223.753 mph, numbers that indicate Billy Boat's year-old
pole-winning average of 223.504 mph is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have way too much respect for all the other teams and
drivers to say we're the pole favorite,'' said Ray, anticipating
the scheduled opening of practice this weekend. ``But going off the
\Rtest\S speeds, I think they have to throw our name in the hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We qualified second last year and deep down in my heart _
without anybody taking it the wrong way _ I have worked so hard the
last three months. It's what I think about when I get up. It's what
I think about when I get on that treadmill, when I push those
weights, when I eat, when I go to sleep. I want to be on pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I do that? I don't know. But I know in my heart that
nobody is trying as hard to do all the right things on and off the
racetrack to prepare for qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and team manager Thomas Knapp shocked the IRL community last
year when they overcame the last-minute loss of a major sponsor to
earn a then-career best No. 2 starting spot _ smack dab between
well-funded A.J. Foyt Racing teammates Boat and Kenny Brack.
Running with the backing of a patchwork quilt of sponsors that
included Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Ray led 18 laps on
race day before retiring with a gearbox problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ray finished 18th in the 33-car field, but his determination on
the racetrack and his disarming demeanor off it marked him as a
marketable star.
</P>
<P>
   Team-owner John Menard took notes and hired Ray and Knapp at the
end of last season to replace NASCAR-bound star Tony Stewart and
veteran crew chief Larry Curry. Armed with Menard's considerable
financial and mechanical resources _ and their preferred
Dallara/Aurora/Firestone package _ Ray and Knapp immediately joined
the IRL's short list of elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Knapp's 1999 qualifying program earned the No. 1
starting spot at the one-mile Phoenix International Raceway in
March and for the tragedy-marred event at the 1.5-mile Lowe's Motor
Speedway in Concord, N.C., on May 1. Ray, who is winless in 16
career IRL starts, admitted that little of what was fast at those
tracks will transfer to the Speedway's long straightaways and flat
corners.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposition has taken notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're somebody we're going to have to contend with for the
pole,'' Boat said of his Team Menard archrivals. ``They have an
in-house engine program, and they've shown they can be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray was in the lead of the VisionAire 500 at LMS when the race
was stopped and subsequently canceled after three spectators were
killed and eight injured by a wheel and flying debris caused by a
three-car wreck. No points were awarded, and there are no plans to
reschedule the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something tragic like what happened at
Charlotte, it's hard to even talk about the racing,'' Ray said
after an emotional sendoff luncheon/roast attended by 200 at The
Speedway Club at TMS on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That event featured a slide show and family stories about Greg
from his parents, Ginger and Benny; an IRL-commissioned feature
video on Ray's career; the proclaiming of ``Greg Ray Day'' by Plano
mayor John Longstreet and plenty of zings at Ray's lead-foot
driving style.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who finished a career-best second to Boat at TMS last June,
took everyone's best shots and fired a few back. But with his voice
cracking, Ray closed the program talking about being able to
realize his dream.

32. ``Being a race-car driver is seen to be childish by some. But

GIANTS LORD OVER DODGERS IN ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attitude is just one of the differences that give an epic
quality to the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, taking their cue from manager Dusty Baker, scratch
and claw for everything. They also refused to fold after losing
All-Star left fielder Barry Bonds for 10 weeks because of elbow
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were 13-11 without Bonds through Friday and still
hold a share of the lead in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have All-Stars at every position,'' pitcher Robb Nen
said. ``We just have a bunch of guys fighting for jobs who play
hard and do things right. We get runners home with less than two
outs, bunt runners over, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' early success wouldn't be surprising with Bonds in
the lineup. This is still pretty much the same team that won a
division title in 1997 and lost to the Chicago Cubs in a playoff
for the wild-card berth last year. Without Bonds, they should have
almost no chance. They just refuse to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blow, no doubt about it, but as a professional team you
have to deal with adversity,'' outfielder Ellis Burks said. ``You
have to find a way to win without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds is not the Giants' most indispensable employee. That honor
goes to Baker, a superb manager who commands unswerving respect and
loyalty from his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy to play for,'' Nen said. ``He's been through
it, anything you've done, he's done. Just look at him when the game
starts, he has a dip in, his wristbands on, he's ready to get out
there with you. He knows what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers haven't figured that out yet, but they certainly
have little trouble griping and complaining when things go bad.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gary Sheffield, who threatened to retire in spring
training because of the team's facial hair policy, blasted the
Dodgers for their blase attitude after a 6-4 loss to the lowly
Florida Marlins last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we are not intimidating anyone,'' Sheffield said. ``We
haven't shown anyone any reason to be afraid of us. We did the
first six games \R5-1 to open the season\S and nothing since then.
We're too lackadaisical, just thinking it's going to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big inning, then take five innings off. The next
thing we know, we're down by two and we're trying to play with a
sense of urgency. In Florida \Rin 1997\S, we had a saying, `One
heartbeat.' We've got be relentless. When you do that you're going
to win the majority of your games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' payroll is just under $80 million, and they have
nine players who have appeared in an All-Star Game. The Giants have
a $45 million payroll and just four with all-star recognition. One
of them, Bonds, is out until July.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could still be chasing them then.
Short hops
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, after Friday's win, have a five-game lead in the
National League Central. But manager Larry Dierker said, ``We got
it all in one week; another week it could be gone. I don't think
we'll stretch it out and run away with it, like we did last year.
To do it once like that is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers player Lee Mazzilli is now managing the New York
Yankees' Double-A team in Norwich (Conn.) and there are those who
believe he will eventually be the permanent successor to Joe Torre
as Yankees skipper. That wouldn't sit well with Yankees coaches
Willie Randolph and Chris Chambliss. Both were disappointed when
Don Zimmer was named interim manager during Torre's current
absence.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Hernandez is 42-for-56 in save opportunities since being
traded by the White Sox on July 31, 1997. The White Sox's tag team
of closers _ Matt Karchner, Bill Simas, Bob Howry _ are 57-for-63
since then, going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After the Arizona Diamondbacks swept the Montreal Expos with
three game-winning home runs in the ninth inning or later, pitcher
Todd Stottlemyre said, ``The last time I saw a team win games like
this in the last at-bat was '92-93 when I played on those \RToronto
Blue Jays\S world championship teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, when asked how Mr. Versatility,
Super Joe McEwing, spends his spare time, said, ``In between
at-bats, he goes into the phone booth, puts that cape on and
rescues somebody out of a burning building or out of the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians made a shrewd move picking up Mark
Langston as a left-handed reliever. Now they're considering him for
the rotation if Dwight Gooden or Charles Nagy continue to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies are interested in Twins reliever Rick
Aguilera. However, they refuse to give up pitcher Jamey Wright. The
Cubs and Braves continue to scout him as well.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jones, 42, had thrown 10 2/3 scoreless innings before
Friday, getting a victory, two saves and a hold in four
appearances. His resurgence is one of many factors that allowed the
surprising Athletics to sneak over the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Asked numerous serious questions about his left middle finger,
which developed a blister Tuesday and limited him to five innings,
Reds pitcher Steve Avery concluded the analysis by saying, ``I'm
just having a hard time picking my nose.''
SPOTLIGHT ON SCOTT ELARTON
</P>
<P>
   Elarton mightier in pen than as starter for Astros
</P>
<P>
   There are 29 teams that would kill to have Scott Elarton in
their rotation, including the Atlanta Braves. The Houston Astros
want him there, too, but right now he's too valuable as their
right-handed setup reliever. Elarton, whom the Astros refused to
include in a trade for Roger Clemens, entered the weekend with a
record of 2-0, a 1.37 earned-run average and 27 strikeouts in 19
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of this ballclub is offense,'' Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``We don't need the Atlanta Braves'
pitching staff. What we need is starting pitchers who can hold the
opposition to three or four runs on the average and a bullpen that
can hold a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put Elarton in the starting rotation, that leaves the
bullpen vulnerable and, because our starting pitching isn't the
Atlanta Braves, you're setting yourself up to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But to keep Elarton in the bullpen, the Astros need better from
Chris Holt, their fifth starter who is 0-5 with a 6.29 ERA. Almost
all of his troubles have come in the first inning, and the Astros,
taking advantage of some off-days, are skipping him in the rotation
right now until he can get straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't, the Astros will likely try to trade for a reliever
and move Elarton to the rotation. Either way, Hunsicker said this
will still be Elarton's last year as a reliever.

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEVER GENE SARAZEN'S CENTURY OF PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct time element in 13th graf)   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day Gene Sarazen died, Tiger Woods shot 61 in the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic. To anyone who remembered a conversation at
the 1996 Masters, it was as much a connection as a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Eldrick (Tiger) Woods was a two-time U.S. Amateur
champion, a 20-year-old golf phenom who would win another Amateur
title that summer and the Masters a year later. And after hitting a
ceremonial tee shot at that 1996 Masters, Sarazen, then 94 and
wearing his plus fours, was answering questions on the Augusta
National clubhouse porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering Tiger's age,'' somebody asked, ``how would you
rate him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Sarazen said, ``when I was 20, I won the U.S. Open and
the PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen wasn't bragging; he was just reminding his listeners
that golf has had other phenoms and he was one of them. It's called
perspective. And as someone who spanned the 20th century before
dying Thursday at 97 of complications of pneumonia, his perspective
on golf was unique.
</P>
<P>
   He will always be remembered for his double-eagle 2 with a
4-wood at the par-5 15th hole that put the Masters on the golf map
in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time in Hong Kong, someone introduced me as `Mr. Double
Eagle,''' he once said with a laugh. ``They must have thought I was
an Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   But the feisty little man born Eugenio Saraceni in Harrison,
N.Y., the son of an immigrant Italian carpenter, hit many other
important shots in winning seven major titles _ the 1922, 1923 and
1933 Professional Golfers' Association Championships, the 1922 and
1932 U.S. Opens, the 1932 British Open and that 1935 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first to win all four major titles; Ben Hogan, Jack
Nicklaus and Gary Player are the only others.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best shot I ever hit,'' Sarazen once said, ``was in
the 1931 Ryder Cup at Scioto. On this short hole, I hooked my tee
shot over the green into a refreshment stand. I found my ball in
the middle of the stand in a crevice in the concrete. No free drops
back then, but a window toward the green was open. I played the
ball through the window and onto the green about eight feet from
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen made his putt for a par. When his opponent, Fred Robson,
three-putted, Sarazen won the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robson laughed and said, `That was a nice throw,''' Sarazen
recalled. ``I said: `That was no throw. I played the shot out of
there.' He lost the next five holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen said golf was more cutthroat back in the 1920s and '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tell anyone anything,'' he recalled. ``If the green
was fast, we hoped they wouldn't find out until it had cost them
some strokes. And the only thing we hoped about the other fellow
was he'd break both legs. That sort of spirit made golf.''
</P>
<P>
   His ingenuity made the sand wedge, which made golf a little
easier for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up with Howard Hughes in his airplane and he told me,
`Gene, pull back on that stick,''' Sarazen once said. ``And it
flashed into my mind that some weight on the back of a niblick
could make a club and a ball bounce out of the sand the same way
that plane bounced into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else, Sarazen could assess the century's best
golfers because he saw and played with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even played with Harry Vardon,'' he once said, referring to
the six-time British Open winner of a century ago. ``It was at the
1923 North British at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. On the first
hole, a par 3, the wind was coming from the left. Vardon floated a
baffy in there about 10 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a 1-iron, a low, boring ball that stayed left despite
the wind and wound up in a bunker. Walking off the tee I remember
saying, `I can't understand how the wind didn't take that ball,'
and I heard Vardon say, `The way you hit it, the wind had nothing
to do with it.' I took that as good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1982 article for Golf Digest magazine, Sarazen, then 80,
rated the century's top 10 golfers, men and women:
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus; 2. Bobby Jones; 3. Ben Hogan; 4. Walter Hagen;
5. Harry Vardon; 6. Gary Player; 7. Sam Snead; 8. Arnold Palmer; 9.
Lee Trevino; 10. (tie) Byron Nelson and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   1. Joyce Wethered; 2. Glenna Collett Vare; 3. Mickey Wright; 4.
Kathy Whitworth; 5. Betsy Rawls; 6. Louise Suggs; 7. Babe Didrikson
Zaharias; 8. JoAnne Carner; 9. Donna Caponi; 10. Patty Berg.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sarazen wasn't sure if Nancy Lopez's swing would
hold up, but if he had selected a women's top 10 in recent years,
she would probably have been in it. The men's top 10 would probably
be unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In judging golfers on longevity and the ability to win majors,
he called Nicklaus ``a far greater player'' than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever had Jack's power and his putting touch,'' Sarazen
said. ``And he's had to play in the major championships before the
TV cameras with the lead at stake. In the years long before
television, Jones usually teed off early and established a score
for everybody else to shoot at.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Gene Sarazen didn't rank himself, saying, ``My wife,
Mary, told me I can't.'' But privately, he confided, ``I'd be
somewhere around eighth, ninth or 10th.'' That's about the proper
perspective. After all, when he was 20, he won both the United
States Open and the PGA. &QL;

CLIPPERS CAN LEARN FROM KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Stockton's last-second basket broke the
hearts of Sacramento fans Friday night, but it can't diminish the
remarkable transition the Kings have made from perennial league
also-ran to a potential team of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a year ago, the Kings were barely considered much
better than the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   So how is it that Sacramento is currently giving Utah a coronary
in the playoffs while the Clippers are once again winning the NBA's
Mr. Irrelevant Award?
</P>
<P>
   Just examine the amount of activity between the two clubs from
the conclusion of last season until the league ended the lockout in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made a major trade, acquiring forward Chris Webber
from Washington. The Clippers made no trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings filled their hole at center with a huge free-agent
addition, former Laker Vlade Divac. The Clippers filled their void
at point guard by belatedly signing an overweight Sherman Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings re-signed their key free agent, forward Corliss
Williamson. The Clippers had two key free agents, forward Loy
Vaught and center Ike Austin, and let both go without receiving any
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made a bold decision on draft day, taking point guard
Jason Williams despite his troubled past. The Clippers ignored
forward Vince Carter and went the safe route by selecting center
Michael Olowokandi, who could develop into a star, but probably for
another team.
</P>
<P>
   The teams did one thing similar. Both fired their coaches at the
end of last season, and both hired coaches viewed as retreads.
</P>
<P>
   With one major difference. The Kings didn't wait until just
before the lockout to hire Rick Adelman, like the Clippers did with
poor Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And Kings vice president Geoff Petrie gave Adelman a chance by
adding some talent to the roster. Ford never had a chance with the
crew he was given in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Kings are on national television today in Game 5
against the Jazz, maybe the Clippers will notice that a blueprint
does exist for turning around a troubled franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It can be done in one season.
</P>
<P>
   But for this to happen, there's one key thing the Kings didn't
have to worry about that the Clippers do: A cheap, meddling owner.
</P>
<P>
   No more massages: Orlando's Darrell Armstrong won the Sixth Man
Award this week, but it might be awhile before he goes back to the
massage table.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong played the last week of his season with a sore right
shoulder _ the same one where he had the rotator cuff surgery last
season. The soreness, though, is not related to surgery.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks it is related to a recent massage he had before the
Magic played at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``She rubbed a little too deep on the shoulder,'' he said. ``I
think she was trying to turn me into Stretch Armstrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only money: Miami guard Tim Hardaway's wallet is feeling a
little lighter. After falling short on an $854,000
assists-to-turnovers bonus during the regular season, Hardaway was
fined $5,000 by the NBA for failing to leave the court in a timely
fashion and verbally abusing the officials following his ejection
in Game 3 against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was asked if the fine was justified?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my money's worth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green to Miami? The Heat are interested in signing former Lakers
forward A.C. Green, who is unlikely to re-sign with Dallas. It's no
coincidence with former Lakers coaches Pat Riley and Randy Pfund
making decisions in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be a nice addition to a team,'' general manager Pfund
said. ``You'd certainly be right to assume, with some history
there.''
</P>
<P>
   No faith: Not that people in Minneapolis didn't think the
Timberwolves would make the playoffs, but the team had to share the
Target Center this week with the Shrine Circus.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs' locker room doubled as the clowns'
dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   By any name, he's a bust: It's a good thing Bison Dele, aka
Brian Williams, had 17 points in Detroit's victory in Game 4
against Atlanta. His teammates in Detroit _ including Grant Hill _
have given up hope of forcing him to play harder and feel like he
must be traded for the Pistons to have any chance of joining the
NBA's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Casey: Two of the Nets' most important players _
forward Keith Van Horn and guard Kendall Gill _ have asked the club
to re-hire interim coach Don Casey, but management has told players
to keep quiet about the coaching position. &QL;

SIX TEAMS FACING A ONE-GAME SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because they weren't May sweeps, it should be riveting
television when three NBA playoff series climax with a fifth game
today:
</P>
<P>
   Knicks at Heat: The stakes are incredibly high as these rivals
play a decisive playoff game for the third consecutive year, but
they're at full strength for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   New York will consider firing coach Jeff Van Gundy and making
personnel moves like trading Latrell Sprewell with a loss, while
Heat players fear a breakup of the team if they lose to the Knicks
for the second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is beyond everybody's control,'' said Heat coach
Pat Riley. ``This is preordained. This is something the gods
wanted. The consequence will be tremendous misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami wins with any kind of contribution from Jamal Mashburn,
shooting a wretched 31 percent in his brief playoff life. As it has
been all series, first one to 70 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Kings at Jazz: John Stockton ripped out the Kings' enlarged
hearts with his game-winning jumper in Friday's Game 4 thriller. As
most young teams do, Sacramento will wilt under Game 5 pressure and
the veteran execution of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have already shocked most experts, by not only pushing
Utah, but by coaxing the normally cool Jazz into uncharacteristic
emotional outbursts, such as Stockton exchanging slaps with Corliss
Williamson. ``We ran into a team that is hungry,'' said Jazz guard
Shandon Anderson. ``And we're feeling the effects of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pistons at Hawks: The first round's wackiest series has seen the
Hawks win twice by 20 and the Pistons by 16 and 21. The Pistons
have momentum and three key strategic advantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, they have learned to double-team Dikembe Mutombo, who is
much better at cleaning up messes than making moves or dishing out
assists. In the first two games he amassed 45 points, then got off
only four shots in the Game 4 blowout. Also, the Hawks are without
small forwards Alan Henderson (eye) or Chris Crawford (shoulder)
and the game, because of a scheduling conflict, will be played at
Georgia Tech instead of the Georgia Dome.
Rocket flameout
</P>
<P>
   Was that the Rockets' last red glare yesterday? Not long ago
they were back-to-back champs. However, Houston played like
anything but a veteran, savvy group in being eliminated by the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley showed glimpses of his younger self, but at 36
will he be willing to stick around as a free agent next season for
another last chance to win a title? And is there any doubt that
Hakeem Olajuwon is headed downhill? He was overpowered by Shaquille
O'Neal, outscored by an average of 29-12. And there was Scottie
Trippin' Pippen: a key turnover in Game 1 and 0 points in Game 2
before a 37-point outburst in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying this season as much as any since going to the
Finals \Rwith the Suns in '93\S,'' Barkley said a while ago. ``But
if we lose early, it'll be hard to get excited about next season.''
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining players from Houston's two titles in '94 and
'95 are Olajuwon and Matt Bullard.
Best and worst
</P>
<P>
   Best clutch performance: Stockton's pick-and-roll jumper to win
Game 4 at Sacramento looked eerily similar to his miss in Game 6 of
last year's Finals loss to the Bulls _ except this one rattled in.
Talk about pressure; he misses that shot and the Jazz is
eliminated, along possibly with his and Karl Malone's last chance
for a title.
</P>
<P>
   Worst clutch performance: Terrell Brandon was on fire and Kevin
Garnett earns $126 million. Timberwolves fans had to be cringing
when veteran Sam Mitchell missed three consecutive jumpers and
threw a bad pass in the final 2:00 of yesterday's elimination loss
to the Spurs. Numbers game 8: Combined baskets by the Suns' Luc
Longley and Rex Chapman in their three-game loss to the Blazers.
24 seconds
</P>
<P>
   Most underrated player in the league is Portland forward Brian
Grant, who hit 23 of 32 shots against Phoenix. ... Worst free-agent
bust could be Orlando's ``Stone Cold'' Ike Austin, who made $5.2
million and produced one double-figure rebounding game in 54
appearances. ... If stubborn Dean Smith is the only man who could
hold Michael Jordan to 15 points, then boneheaded George Shinn is
the only man who could turn him down as a business partner. ...
Shame on the media for not voting the versatile Garnett first-team
or second-team All-Defense. ``I would not trade Kevin, defensively,
for any of the guys in front of him,'' said Minnesota coach Flip
Saunders. ... Clip and save for L.A.-S.A. from Spurs leader Mario
Elie: ``People have been hyping the Lakers all year. The way Shaq
talks, it's like he's got 10 banners, and he don't even have one.''

TRIPLE CROWN RIVALRY, PART TWO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The budding rivalry between Charismatic and Menifee
is eerily reminiscent of the Real Quiet vs. Victory Gallop battles
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like Menifee, Victory Gallop finished second in the Derby and
was favored in the Preakness, but ran second again. Real Quiet won
both races. In the Belmont, however, Victory Gallop edged Real
Quiet to spoil his bid for the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee and Victory Gallop are trained by Elliott Walden. ``It
would look kind of funny if I didn't run \RMenifee\S in the
Belmont,'' Walden said.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Chris Antley, who has had a great view of the rivalry
aboard Charismatic, can't fathom the sudden change in his fortunes.
Before this year, Antley had missed 18 months fighting weight
problems, and feared his career was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few months ago, I was staying with my mom and dad \Rin
South Carolina\S driving a '67 Mustang, playing the stock market to
keep me busy, and thinking about my future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, in the next minute, you're back in the game and maybe
ready to do something that hasn't been done in a long time. I have
a chance to win a Triple Crown.''
Spectator runs on track
</P>
<P>
   Pimlico avoided a power failure this year, but its Preakness
undercard was marred by a bizarre episode in which a spectator ran
onto the track during a race.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who was not identified, jumped the inside rail about a
sixteenth of a mile from the finish pole as horses in the Maryland
Breeders' Cup Handicap _ three races before the Preakness _ were
turning into the stretch. He swung his fist at some horses and
riders as they swerved to dodge him.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, the horses missed him and no one was injured.
Heavily favored Artax came closest to him, with jockey Jorge Chavez
having to move sharply inside to avoid a collision and pulling up
his horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking right at my horse,'' Chavez said. ``I was
afraid to move to one side or the other, so I waited till the last
second. He tried to punch my horse, but he missed and punched me in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tense situation. I couldn't believe what was
happening. He could have killed my horse and maybe me, and himself.
Thank God everyone is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The man was wrestled to the ground and taken away by security
officials, who said he was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Pimlico officials refunded all money wagered on Artax, ruling as
if he had not run.
Vicar a surprise runner
</P>
<P>
   Vicar ran in the Preakness Stakes, although trainer Carl Nafzger
had repeatedly said he would be scratched because of his No. 13
post position.
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger changed his mind yesterday morning after Pimlico
officials convinced him that the post wasn't that bad. He probably
wishes he had stuck to his guns. Vicar finished 10th after running
18th in the Kentucky Derby.
Not excellent health
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, the only filly in the Preakness, did not
finish.
</P>
<P>
   She was pulled up nearing the stretch by jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarian Larry Bramlage said on ABC that she suffered
respiratory bleeding, although she raced on anti-bleeding
medication Lasix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll just have to regroup,'' trainer Bob Baffert said.
A sincere thank you
</P>
<P>
   Entering the second turn of the Preakness, Chris Antley said
Charismatic was trapped briefly behind Stephen Got Even, ridden by
Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see he didn't have much horse,'' Antley said of
Stevens, ``and he actually gave me a little shot to get out. He
said, `Go on, little buddy.' I want to thank him for that.''
Wider is better
</P>
<P>
   Before the Preakness, trainer D. Wayne Lukas and Chris Antley
discussed the rail-favoring condition of Pimlico's strip.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas told Antley to ignore the bias and keep Charismatic on the
outside, as he did in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we could switch up our style to take advantage
of a rail bias,'' Lukas said. ``It's like any athletic contest. If
you get to the NCAA final with a press, you'd better press. I
actually think he made a bigger move this time than he did in the
Derby.''
Lone Star connection
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Oop, fourth in the Texas Mile at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie, finished second yesterday in the William Donald Schaefer
Handicap at Pimlico, the race before the Preakness. He was beaten
by a half-length.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Oop is owned by James Jackson of Rockdale and trained by
Dallas Keen, the same connections of Valhol, who finished ninth in
the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air, winner of the Premiere Stakes at Lone Star, faded to
fifth in the same race.
Preakness attendance solid
</P>
<P>
   The electrical blackout at Preakness last year didn't discourage
the Baltimore faithful this year.
</P>
<P>
   On-track attendance was 100,311, slightly less than the 103,269
last year and the 102,118 that turned out in 1997.

TEXANS HAVE LINKS TO WOMAN WHO WILL BE AFRICAN QUEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DIANE SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people can boast that they have royalty in their family.
Edmond Sebugwawo of Keller, Texas, is one who can.
</P>
<P>
   His niece, Sylvia Nagginda Luswata, will become queen of the
African kingdom of Buganda this summer when she weds King Ronald
Muwenda Kimera Mutevi II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking to her as a Princess Diana,'' Sebugwawo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buganda, which has almost 7 million residents and 52 clans, is
in southeast Uganda. Decades of political strife caused many of its
people to scatter to places such as England, Sweden and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 friends and family members from Texas, California and
Oklahoma will say goodbye to the queen-to-be during a ceremony
Sunday at the Intercontinental Hotel in Dallas. Area Ugandans
estimate that 300 to 1,000 of their countrymen live in the Fort
Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to welcome her,'' said the Rev. Joseph Kamugisha,
president of the Uganda North American Association of Dallas and
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ugandans living in the United States are expected to travel
to Africa for the wedding. The ceremony is important to the Baganda
_ the collective term for the people of Buganda _ because Luswata
will be the first queen since royalty was banished in 1966 during
the rule of then-Prime Minister Milton Obote.
</P>
<P>
   Luswata, 35, was born in England and raised in Uganda. She
studied at New York University and often visited the Metroplex to
reunite with relatives during holidays. Luswata and the king became
engaged on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Luswata is expected to bring modern ways to the role of queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be the ladies who stayed in the palace. They
didn't do much, but things have changed. She's very independent,''
Sebugwawo said. ``We are very excited, because she has been one of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Edward Muteesa II, the father of Luswata's fiance, was the
last Buganda king before his son. King Mutevi, who was crowned in
1993, had lived in England for many years. He has been in Uganda
since his coronation.
</P>
<P>
   Mutevi ``was king, but he was a king without a kingdom,'' said
Francis Mayanja, a member of the Baganda who lives in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The re-emergence of royalty in Uganda is seen as a sign of
stability in a country torn by political strife, civil war and the
cruelty of former dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wedding of the century in Uganda,'' said
Sebastiane Lwanga, a North Texas resident who has known Luswata
about seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandans said the wedding allows the Baganda to reaffirm
traditions dating to 1200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this kingdom, we are not complete. We always had
somebody that we would look at to follow,'' Sebugwawo said.
</P>
<P>
   Buganda's hierarchy is similar to that of the British monarchy,
Mayanja said. A Muganda _ a singular member of the kingdom _ can
recite his or her family lineage back to the first Buganda king.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the queen comes, they will be introducing themselves by
saying which clan they came from and their lineage,'' Mayanja said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional dress will characterize the farewell ceremony Sunday
and the wedding, Mayanja said. Portions of the wedding will be
private, with rituals dating back hundreds of years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Buganda kingdom will flourish. Hopefully, they will have a
son and they will be able to carry on,'' Mayanja said.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN IS FIRST BLACK PhD FOR FORT WORTH SEMINARY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES and KAREN ROUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When some African-Americans in the ministry
learned of Cassandra Jones' plans to attend Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary, their words were harsh:
</P>
<P>
   ``One church leader told me, `Cassandra, if you go there, you
will be brainwashed and be no good to our community or to our
church,' '' said Jones, 41.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, she became the first African-American woman to receive
a doctorate from the Fort Worth seminary's school of educational
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not brainwashed,'' she said. ``The professors here have
been wonderful. I've learned a lot. They genuinely cared about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was one of 330 master's and doctoral graduates to receive
diplomas in a ceremony at Travis Avenue Baptist Church in Fort
Worth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who taught for 13 years in the Dallas public schools, was
a doctoral teaching fellow at the seminary. She said her seminary
years were good, but not hassle-free.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled comments made by two white students.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man told me he had never had a black teacher and he wasn't
going to start then. He withdrew from the class,'' she said. When
another student mentioned that he had never had a black teacher,
she asked him if her race was a problem. He said, `` `Not yet,' ''
she said. He remained in the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the positive and the negative side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who serves as national music director of the National
Baptist Convention U.S.A., the largest black Baptist denomination,
said it was difficult to hear opposition from black leaders she
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are from the South, and they experienced how
white churches ... practiced bigotry,'' she said. When they grew
up, many ``vowed not to have anything to do with those
seminaries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that black students get little or no financial
assistance from black denominations if they attend a white
seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our own,'' she said. ``All of my money, every dime,
came from Southern Baptist organizations and agencies _ all
white.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she is glad that, a year ago, Southwestern hired
Raymond Spencer, the school's first full-time African-American
faculty member. But she'd like to see the seminary become more
inclusive, using research produced by black scholars in every
discipline, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to teach at the college level.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Mayer felt the slim weight of an electronic book in
the palm of his hand, he suffered instant pangs of dread.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reassuring crackle of paper or the faint scent of
ink that had been a constant in his career in publishing, for two
decades as chief executive of Viking Penguin and now of his own
independent company, Overlook Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect it,'' Mayer said of the electronic book that could
change the dynamics of his business, ``but I have an emotional and
professional investment in what I know. And when I was young, I
knew that I could conquer any change, and now I don't know what's
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Such wariness is prompting Mayer, and some authors and agents,
to shy away from books made of bytes until a clear view develops of
the rapidly emerging market for electronic readers. The culture of
technology has collided with the slower-moving book industry, which
is engaged in a tense, early clash over how to divide up the spoils
of an infant business that is still difficult to picture in scope
and potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scramble over who controls what,'' said Laurence
Kirshbaum, chief executive of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time
Warner unit that includes Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co. He
noted that ``we're not being motivated by what's to come, but a
fear of being left out as the train is pulling away from the
station, with some exotic station in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, the New York-based Authors
Guild mailed out contract warnings last month to some 7,500
members. The letter criticized current e-book contracts as bad
deals. The guild said it considered distribution fees for
electronic book manufacturers a payment scheme that would deny
publishers and authors the rewards of the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent literary agencies are also advising authors to
refuse electronic book agreements unless the contracts promise to
revise the deals if electronic editions rapidly gain popularity.
But in turn, some publishers are refusing to make that concession,
which means that many popular books are staying firmly on the
bookshelves instead of a digital page.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, start-up technology companies have
pushed forward with plans to make electronic books as ubiquitous as
mass market paperbacks. This month, Nuvomedia will expand its sales
of $500 versions to stores, while Librius is preparing to begin
selling its slender 12-ounce pocketbook-sized model for $200 in
July. Softbook Press has been lining up deals with corporations and
school districts that are eager to eliminate lockers and reduce
backpack strain on students laden with textbooks. Softbook's
version, with note-taking and scribble functions, sells for $299.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-books became available late last fall.
Barnesandnoble.com, for example, has about 500 titles available for
sale and downloading and has sold about 15,000 copies in this
format. In general, the privately held manufacturers will not say
how many of the electronic readers have been sold, but a
Barnesandnoble.com spokesman, Ben Boyd, said the company had been
``pleasantly surprised with the pace that customers have purchased
these devices and titles.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may seem small now, says Chuck Verrill, a literary
agent with Darhansoff &AMP; Verrill, but ``the issues are profound in
their long-term impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to see the market grow, but we want to make sure
the terms are fair,'' he said. The agency's authors, including
Arthur Golden and E. Annie Proulx, are avoiding the electronic
format until they reach better deals with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The devices that are inspiring all this anxiety weigh from 12
ounces to more than two pounds and carry brand names like Rocket
eBook, Millennium E-Reader and the Softbook. They seem rather
expensive now for leisure reading, but eventually the manufacturers
expect the cost to fall below $100 or plunge to nothing as e-books
are given away like cellular phones to entice customers to buy and
download books, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   With almost missionary zeal, the entrepreneurs developing the
e-books from the West Coast and a culture of technology are
predicting changes in a publishing industry centered in New York
and steeped in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be everywhere,'' said Devin McKinney,
director of content services for Softbook Press. ``I think that 50
percent of the books are going to be published in electronic form
and not in paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers say they do not feel threatened by the development of
the electronic book because they do not think the form will replace
conventional books for adult readers who will always want to savor
the familiar touch of paper.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of young readers may have different notions
about what constitutes a good book. Some school districts are
already negotiating to buy the Softbook for students to essentially
create ``textbook-free'' schools where students can download books
and packets of course information over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Davis Joint Unified School District in Davis,
Calif., is expecting to learn this month whether it has received a
$6 million federal grant to subsidize the purchase of some 3,000
electronic books that will be shared among 7,700 students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if educators see immediate benefits, publishers are showing
more caution as the first deals are struck for electronic rights
that could set a pattern to last the life of a copyright. When
authors try to make the case that paperless books will result in
cost savings, Random House, the top-ranking publisher, expresses
private misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo, the company said that ``a generally held
misconception is that publishers will make greater profits on
e-books since the costs of paper, printing, warehousing and
delivery are saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ignores the different kinds of costs that are incurred in
handling e-books,'' the memo said. It then listed the added
expenses of formatting manuscripts for electronic books, protecting
digital material from piracy and granting higher discounts to
e-book distributors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Authors Guild does indeed expect savings from lowered
paper and printing costs and so, as the guild's director, Paul
Aiken, put it, ``the result seems clear: Authors should receive a
significantly higher royalty for e-books than they do for physical
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Authors Guild says that now, a writer might get a share as
great as 15 percent of the list price of a book as a royalty. The
structure for an electronic book is about the same, but can run as
low as 4 percent. In a conventional contract for a hard-cover book,
the publisher gets about 35 percent of the list price while the
distributor gets 15 percent and the bookseller keeps 35 percent.
With the new electronic rights agreements that e-book manufacturers
are getting from publishers, this structure shifts, with publishers
getting 25 to 40 percent, booksellers 35 to 40 percent and
distributors 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the guild has assailed the new cut for Nuvomedia,
which it describes as a combined ``whopping 60 percent distribution
fee'' to Nuvomedia and Barnesandnoble.com, which sells the
electronic titles.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such sentiments anger e-book manufacturers
like Martin Eberhard, the chief executive of Nuvomedia of Mountain
View, Calif., even though the parent company of Random House,
Bertelsmann AG, has invested in his company and in Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Book Expo America in Los Angeles, which draws
thousands of booksellers and publishers, Eberhard sat in his
exhibit booth, fuming about Random House's arguments and the
Authors Guild letter, which also contended that ``profit margins
for publishers and royalty rates for authors should soar with these
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the publishing industry doesn't let up on these squabbles,
it will hurt them,'' he said, adding that the combined 60 percent
share for the distributor and bookseller had since dropped to 55
percent of the list price of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard contends that the costs of publishing an electronic
version are lower than conventional formats and so authors can
improve their shares. But he complained that Random House was
taking credit for bearing the costs of encrypting digital material
``because they're trying to get the best royalty rate that they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Random House's general counsel, Harriette Dorsen, said:
``Publishers do the formatting and each device needs to be
individually done. Upgrades are required for new upgrades of the
devices.'' In addition, she said, the costs of encryption are
passed back to the publishers through higher discounts granted to
e-book manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some literary agents contend that Random House has taken tough
negotiating positions by refusing to allow contract revisions as
the market grows. But Ms. Dorsen said: ``This is emphatically not
correct that we have refused to revisit the issue of royalties. In
fact, we understand that in a changing environment, with a business
in its infancy, there will be changes in the way this business is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tension is such that Nuvomedia is prevented from
selling an electronic version of Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a
Geisha,'' one of the titles published by Random House's Knopf unit
that was used to test Rocket eBooks with customers. ``We had it all
ready to go, and it was pulled at the last minute because the
author wasn't happy with the deal,'' Eberhard said.
Barnesandnoble.com, which was offering it on its site, deleted it
when a dispute emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Golden's literary agent, Verrill, said that they chose not to
permit an electronic version more out of concern about the
uncertainties of the future. In general, he said, he thinks that
publishers should allow contracts to be revised after a limited
number of years to gauge the impact of electronic books on
publishing economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to commit a book that was likely to sell for
the next 20 years over terms that seemed so unthought-out,''
Verrill said..
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is aware of the impact if authors continue
to shy away from electronic versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it has an impact,'' Verrill said. ``It affects the
content that Nuvomedia can offer, and if they have nothing but
books nobody wants, then they're likely to fail.''

<P>
   DALLAS _ A day after the Senate rejected a hate crimes bill,
Gov. George W. Bush commended legislators for striving to reach a
compromise and said that Texas must rely on current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators of both parties tried hard,'' Bush said Saturday. ``I
put out a couple of suggestions. Good people just couldn't agree.
So now it's up to the prosecutors to use the current hate crimes
law. I hope citizens all across our state work diligently to treat
people with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who gave the commencement address Saturday at Southern
Methodist University and later held a brief news conference, has
been accused of opposing the bill because it included protections
for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The governor insisted that the issue did not rest on the sexual
orientation provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, my position was, first of all, this was a moral conscience
vote on the Senate,'' he said. ``I stood back and said I was going
to analyze the bill once it made it off the floor of the Senate. It
never did.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when Bush was asked during a news conference in Austin
on March 22 if he thought lawmakers should include protections for
homosexuals in hate crimes legislation, he responded: ``No, I do
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been criticized by Democrats and activist groups for
remaining on the sidelines during the weeklong debate of the hate
crimes bill. They blamed his silence on not wanting to take a
stance on a divisive issue so close to his expected campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not he intended it, the presidential campaign is
taking place on this floor today,'' said Sen. John Whitmire,
D-Houston, during an emotion-charged speech in the Senate chamber
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the way of a compromise, backers said, was the fact
that the bill would have punished crimes motivated by bias against
someone's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His unconscionable, immoral lack of leadership on this issue
is both tragic and exasperating,'' said Dianne Hardy-Garcia,
executive director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said his office tried to come up with a compromise and
was unsuccessful. The bill was inspired by the racially motivated
dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Texas, last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was pleased that a bill that would require the
parents of a minor to be notified at least two days before a girl
could have an abortion won approval Friday by a House committee.
The bill is headed for the full House.
</P>
<P>
   The governor planned to talk about the bill to Texas Right to
Life, an anti-abortion group that held a fund-raiser luncheon
Saturday with Bush as keynote speaker. The event was not public,
but Bush said he planned to tell the group that ``I hope to get a
bill out that will reduce the number of abortions in the state of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Right to Life spokeswoman Monica Hatcher said that Bush
was expected to speak about 10 minutes on his support for the
anti-abortion movement. The money generated by the $5,000-a-plate
event will be used for an anti-abortion ad campaign, she said.

ROBERTS PUTTS WAY INTO LEAD WITH 62 AS TIGER FOLDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ For a time yesterday, the GTE Byron Nelson
Classic looked to be a rerun of that popular, long-running series,
It's a Tiger's World, and You're All Just Guests in It.'
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through the third round, however, a strange thing
happened: Tiger Woods got the hook and a veteran character actor
named Loren Roberts took center stage. Now he'll play leading man
in the final round of the $3 million tournament this afternoon at
Four Seasons Resort and Club.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 43, is best-known for his nickname, ``Boss of the
Moss,'' a tribute to his exquisite putting touch. Yesterday, his
skill on the greens of the TPC propelled him to an 8-under-par 62,
the best round of the day, as he one-putted nine greens. That gave
him a tournament-record 54-hole total of 16-under 194 and a
two-shot lead over second-round co-leader Steve Pate, who battled
to a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the other co-leader starting the day, led or shared the
top spot with Pate throughout the front nine but collapsed on the
back. He made three bogeys from the 11th through the 15th holes,
then found water with an errant tee shot on the par-3 17th hole.
From there, he suffered a golfing meltdown, recording a quadruple
bogey that dropped him to 8 under for the tournament after a 74 and
all but killed his chance of repeating his 1996 victory.
</P>
<P>
   That left Roberts and Pate, a pair of native Californians, away
from the pack, with Roberts six shots ahead of their closest
competitors, two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen and teen
sensation Sergio Garcia, who are at 10-under 200. That gap, and the
likelihood of another day of howling wind, had Roberts confident:
The wind, he and Pate agreed, will make it difficult for any
challenger to shoot lights-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can shoot three or four under par \RSunday\S, they're
going to have to come catch me,'' Roberts said. ``It all depends on
what happens with the wind. Sunday's always a little bit tougher
unless you're coming from way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pate: ``It's possible to shoot low; it's not very likely.
It's more likely to shoot 75.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Pate took different routes to the top. Roberts got
rolling with a four-foot birdie putt on the first hole, then set
the tone for his day on the fifth hole when he made a 40-footer
over a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little bonus,'' he said. ``The floodgates opened up
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour fans have come to expect the run of 12- to 15-foot
birdie putts Roberts embarked on after that. But Roberts also drove
well, hitting every fairway and every green but the 18th. A short
driver, Roberts ranks fifth on the tour in driving accuracy and
kept the ball in the fairway yesterday in spite of the vexing
crosswinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the round of the year for me,'' said Roberts, who has
won five times on the PGA Tour, most recently in 1997 at the CVS
Charity Classic. He is 46th on the money list this year with
$364,869, largely on four top-10 finishes, including fifth at the
Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   While Roberts cruised to his 62, Pate struggled to a 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it nearly as well as I did the first two days,''
Pate said, noting that he spent much of his time off the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I was happy with my scoring. I made two bogeys.
I could've made a lot more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Roberts nor Pate was disappointed that most of the
attention went to Woods and Garcia yesterday, perhaps because that
allowed them to go about the business of climbing to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loren and I have been out here 15, 16 years,'' Pate said.
``There's no novelty in that.'' Referring to Woods and Garcia, he
added, ``They're the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were yesterday. Today, though, the story is Roberts
and Pate. \Ntagtop:David A. Markiewicz, (817) 390-7760

A YEAR LATER, WHO GOT BEST OF PIAZZA DEAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The modern traditionalist is advised to give
clocks for first anniversaries. So it says in our etiquette book.
Maybe it has something to do with time flying, we don't know.
</P>
<P>
   But what of contractual relationships that are severed, ripped
at the heart? It's one of the hitches in the human condition that
the anniversary of a union can pass like seconds on a clock,
without us hardly noticing, but the end date, should there be one,
will chime in our minds, pealing at the top of every year.
</P>
<P>
   The internal clock struck one Saturday for Mike Piazza and the
Dodgers. A match made in heaven (or at least Hollywood) ended badly
on May 15, 1998, when one of major-league baseball's most glamorous
teams sent its most charismatic player packing to Florida with Todd
Zeile for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, Jim
Eisenreich and Manuel Barrios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of a marriage,'' Piazza, the reputed godson of
Dodger don Tommy Lasorda said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, a stab at reconciliation would follow, with Lasorda
in his role as interim general manager trying to lure Piazza back
to L.A. before the July trading deadline. It didn't happen, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Money had torn the two sides apart and money remained the great
divide that ultimately kept Piazza and the Dodgers on separate
coasts. The catcher re-signed with the New York Mets, who had
picked him up from Florida a week after he was traded to the
Marlins, for seven years and $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   For one month Piazza had the title he so desperately desired.
Not The Artful Dodger, not Lord of Los Angeles, but Baseball's
Highest-Paid Player.
</P>
<P>
   He held that title for all of a month before the Angels wrenched
it from him to give to Mo Vaughn. The Dodgers then pretty much
rubbed it in Piazza's face by signing pitcher Kevin Brown to the
mother of all deals, $105 million spread out over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   On a bitter anniversary such as this, the inclination is to
revise history, each side massaging the truth so that its own pain
is kneaded away.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we hear Piazza saying ``I wound up where I should
be'' in a tone that suggests he absolutely means it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Dodgers say they are better off having Sheffield
and Brown around, as well as Mr. Consistent, Eric Karros, who would
have been another team's metronome if anybody had been able to
convince the prideful Piazza that it would be prudent for him to
save his knees and switch to first base.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Piazza and the Dodgers both changed during their
seven-year union in ways that made them ultimately incompatible. It
was best that they part, lest they stay together to keep up
appearances and end up destroying each other.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is the best-hitting catcher in baseball, but he never has
forgotten that he once was a 62nd-round draft pick of the Dodgers.
It says something about Piazza's fortitude that he got here from
there. Once slighted, twice intransigent and that was Piazza,
demanding that the respect that once eluded him be repaid (with
interest) in the form of cold currency and brooding when his salary
dollars and his playing numbers didn't, in his mind, add up.
</P>
<P>
   He seethed _ SEETHED _ when outfielder Raul Mondesi was signed
to a four-year, $60 million contract extension in January of 1998.
Why? Because at the same point in his Dodgers career, Piazza had to
scratch and claw for a two-year, $15 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a bachelor can live in L.A. like a modern-day
Gatsby on $7.5 million a year, Piazza couldn't appreciate his
wealth as long as there was somebody in the clubhouse making more.
And so we heard him say of an $80 million offer from the Dodgers
that he scornfully rejected, ``If I had taken their offer I would
have never been able to look myself in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on it, Piazza got caught in the same trap that snags
many people, dwelling so much on life's little injustices that he
couldn't fully enjoy his many great blessings.
</P>
<P>
   If Piazza had been able to not worry and be happy, who knows?
Perhaps his joie de vivre would have been contagious and all of the
Dodgers could have caught playoff fever. As it was, the chemistry
never was great in the Dodgers clubhouse that Piazza filled as
completely as he did his expensive tailored wool suits.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has the kind of presence, he walks into a room and all
the air molecules attach themselves to him, leaving little room for
anyone else to breathe. The Dodgers clubhouse without him is a
veritable oxygen bar. Maybe it's a coincidence, but hasn't Mondesi
looked reinvigorated since Piazza left?
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how much players can get accomplished when they're
not standing around waiting for their star to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza improved every year he was with the Dodgers, but did he
make his teammates better? A great player can win a game by
himself; a great leader knows it's infinitely better if he can get
all of his teammates into the act. God help the Mets' opponents if
Piazza ever makes the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Brown is so competitive he can be downright scary (that's
especially true if you're an inanimate object). But he already has
taught Chan Ho Park and Co. more than Piazza ever could about
getting batters out long after your best stuff is gone and grinding
out an extra inning or three on guts and guile.
</P>
<P>
   It worries us that Park's representative Steve Kim has been
pressuring the Dodgers to get Park re-signed, as if his contract
expired tomorrow and not at the season's end. That was the path
that Piazza's agent Dan Lozano traveled down on the way to
splitsville.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to think everyone involved in the Dodgers-Piazza
divorce came away from the experience a little smarter than that. &QL;

TIGER TUMBLES TO EARTH WITH 74
</HEADLINE>

By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ His facial expressions yesterday bore the
intense look of an angry drill sergeant and the disappointment of a
crushed child.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, perhaps more than any member of the PGA Tour, wears
his emotions like a Nike emblem. Under constant scrutiny, Woods'
game is held to standards others can't meet.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, Woods can get a little wound up.
</P>
<P>
   During the third round of the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, Woods
and his day both unraveled on the same 17th hole that saw Fred
Couples' meltdown in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Couples triple-bogeyed the par-3 No. 17 last year and finished
with a final-round 72 to tie for second.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' problems began long before, with bogeys at Nos. 11, 14
and 15. Including a quadruple-bogey 7 at 17, Woods fell _ for the
tournament _ from 14 under (tied for first) to 8 under (tied for
11th) in seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods granted no interviews after finishing a third-round 74
(4-over).
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, the 19-year-old Spaniard making his professional
debut on the PGA Tour, took two deep, stunned breaths when told of
Woods' 7 on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things happen,'' Garcia said. ``I was a little surprised.
When I saw the leader board on the 18th and saw him minus-8, I was
thinking `Is that wrong or what happened?' He hit a bad shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' attacking nature on the course had consequences
yesterday. In the end, the TPC Las Colinas course winds couldn't be
tamed with raw power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a needed rest,'' said Woods' playing partner, Steve
Pate, of waiting for Woods on No. 17. ``We've all been there, so it
doesn't tend to have any effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate said he thought Woods ``hit the wrong club'' off the No. 17
tee, a 6-iron. The drive landed in a greenside pond. Woods dropped
for a penalty on the pond's fairway side before hitting rocks on
the opposite end.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the fairway, Woods rolled a chip over the green and
needed three more strokes to find the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a fairly solid shot,'' Pate said. ``He just didn't
gauge the wind right. Where his drop ended up is no picnic. That's
a severe penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   WOODS MELT DOWN Tiger Woods led at 14 under after 10 holes of
yesterday's GTE Byron Nelson Classic third round. But three bogeys
and a quadruple-bogey on the back nine unraveled his day. A
breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   No. 11, Par 4: Woods' second shot lands in a greenside bunker.
Sand wedge and two-putt for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   No. 14, par 4: Woods' iron off the tee lands behind a tree to
the right. Pitch shot lands short of water separating fairway and
green. Third shot to green and two-putt for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15, Par 4: Woods drives right and overshoots the green on
his second shot. Chip on is short and he two-putts for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17, par 3: Woods' 6-iron tee shot hits the water to the
right front of the green. He takes a penalty stroke, dropping in
rough on the back side of the pond. His wedge shot bangs off rocks
lining the green and back onto the fairway. Woods rolls a chip into
the backside rough, then chips onto the green. He two-putts for a
quadruple-bogey 7.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Woods falls from 14-under to 8-under in seven holes.

TOYMAKERS CASH IN ON `STAR WARS' HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Forget a galaxy far, far away. The
center of The Force is on Variel Street, just off Oxnard Street in
this suburban Los Angeles community.
</P>
<P>
   It is from there, in a nondescript, warehouse-like headquarters,
that collectibles maker Applause Inc. created and is now overseeing
distribution of the legions of plastic action figures flooding toy
stores, fast food outlets and Internet auction sites to coincide
with the release of ``Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the company has created 79 separate replicas of Anakin
Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn and other George Lucas
characters for the film's first wave of merchandising. More will be
released in September and then periodically throughout 2000 on a
schedule dictated by Lucasfilm Ltd. designed to maximize profits.
</P>
<P>
   The giveaways are big business for Applause. The company expects
at least 15 percent of its roughly $200 million in 1999 revenues to
come from ``Phantom Menace'' merchandise, a figure that could rise
if the current hype surrounding the film continues through year's
end. Company executives are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars property has legs,'' said Chaz Fitzhugh, Applause's
senior director of brand management and the firm's point man on
Lucasfilm business.
</P>
<P>
   Applause's ``Phantom Menace'' products fall into two categories.
The company produces the low-cost action figures distributed en
masse with children's meals at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Plus,
it has exclusive rights to make highly detailed mega-figures, some
more than a foot tall, sold at places like FAO Schwartz for up to
$50 apiece. Both groups of products are cast and painted offshore,
usually by Chinese or Indonesian workers.
</P>
<P>
   What Applause doesn't make is the mid-range line of Star Wars
toys distributed at outlets like Toys `R' Us and Target. Those are
the business -- and boon -- of Hasbro, which expects to generate at
least $500 million in sales this year from ``Star Wars''
merchandise alone.
</P>
<P>
   Applause comes to the ``Phantom Menace'' task with an impressive
resume. Virtually every big media-collectible tie-in over the last
five years has included merchandise from the Woodland Hills firm,
and a walk through the company's display room reveals the
likenesses of the California Raisins, Capt. Kirk, Michael Jordan,
the Looney Tunes cast, Nickelodeon's ``Rugrats,'' the Taco Bell
Chihuahua and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're very happy with them,'' said Laurie Gannon, a
spokeswoman for Taco Bell, which previously contracted with
Applause to produce 23 million toy Chihuahuas for the restaurant
chain's ``Yo Quiero Taco Bell'' campaign. ``We do a lot of business
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To get on the ``Phantom Menace'' gravy train, potentially the
biggest contract in Applause history, the company sought out
Lucasfilm as early as 1995, offering to make collectibles based on
characters from the first ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, let's get in with classic `Star Wars' '' and then try
for the prequels, Fitzhugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some of the company's early efforts are getting a
second shot at life as retailers like the Lucky grocery chain pull
the inventory from storage in hopes of riding the latest wave of
``Star Wars'' consumer enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   With its foot in the door, Applause successfully negotiated with
Lucasfilm for the ``Phantom Menace'' rights. The company won't say
what sort of deal it struck with Lucasfilm, whose namesake has
gained a reputation for brilliant manipulation of business
partners. And there is an air of near fear among Applause officials
when pressed about any financial aspects to the Lucas contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've asked us not to discuss that,'' Applause spokesman
Mark McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is clearly thrilled with its role in the
``Phantom Menace'' juggernaut and is waiting now for the cash to
start rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' merchandise of all sorts -- from action figures to
spinning lollipops -- hit store shelves on May 3. And while the
first wave of buyers has been made up mostly of adult collectors,
retailers anticipate demand will really soar once the film hits
theaters Wednesday and children then want the characters they've
seen on the big screen.

HUNDREDS ATTEND NIGHTTIME VAN GOGH EXHIBIT IN L.A.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was more like a nightclub than a gallery
Friday as hundreds of people dressed in everything from avant-garde
gear to $2,000 suits braved the twilight to see Vincent Van Gogh's
paintings in a Los Angeles exhibit's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some sipped martinis on a rooftop terrace. Children fell into
slumber while their parents marveled at the artwork. Others said
they enjoyed the absence, for the most part, of the elite culture
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an eeriness about this,'' said 52-year-old Lee Gurst
of suburban Sherman Oaks. ``Van Gogh only sold one painting in his
lifetime; now we can walk through here and see paintings that sell
for $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like going through the Egyptian pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art became the first in the
country to show a major exhibition on a 63-hour marathon basis,
which started Friday -- marking the final weekend for ``Van Gogh's
Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 70 paintings will return home. But not before
thousands of people will have viewed the display between 9 a.m.
Friday and midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Another first for the museum was Club Van Gogh, an open-air
terrace featuring hors d'oeuvres, expensive drinks and music from a
jazz sextet. Booths sold replicas of the artist's famous ``The
Starry Night,'' alongside Van Gogh T-shirts and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole event proves there's been a resurgence in the Los
Angeles art culture,'' said LACMA spokesman Adam Coyne, noting the
1997 opening of the Getty Center museum in Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. has become a worldwide art destination -- an arts
leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since the exhibit opened Jan. 17, about 820,000 people have seen
the artwork -- the biggest LACMA hit since the ``Treasures of
Tutankhamen'' exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors in 1978, Coyne
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also came close to the nation's most well-attended art
exhibition, ``Treasure Houses of Britain,'' which attracted 990,474
visitors to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in
1985, Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurst said he hopes the late-night museum scene stays alive,
thrilled by the fact he didn't have to push through a crowd to see
the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should open up museums late at night all the time,''
Gurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Garner of suburban Woodland Hills, whose brother got him
the tickets, said he also liked the unique night atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better to see on the last night when you can go out
with a bang instead of hanging with a bunch of stuck-up people,''
said 17-year-old Garner.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ( Each has advantages and limitations. )
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to speed, nothing on the consumer market today can
beat a cable modem _ in theory.
</P>
<P>
   Under ideal conditions _ if you are the only one in the city
using the system _ cable modems offer lightning-fast download
speeds, up to 10 megabits per second, or 176 times faster than the
fastest dial-up modem, and more bandwidth than most customers could
conceivably put to use.
</P>
<P>
   The cable company, however, is not yet able to deliver that kind
of bandwidth to individual customers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, cable networks are shared systems. Like the water
pressure in an apartment building, the bandwidth is shared and
diminishes rapidly when everyone in the neighborhood goes online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the cable guys keep on adding subscribers until the
customer complaints get too loud, then they add capacity,'' Dunsby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Road Runner and its cable brethren have heard complaints in
other cities, where prime-time access often slows to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on this,'' said Dempsey Yearry, another
tester of Time Warner's service. ``I'm curious to see what happens
when everyone gets on the pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Goldberg, general manager of Road Runner in Kansas City,
says Time Warner has enough capacity in its upgraded network to
handle peak loads. And he says a slow cable modem will still beat
the top-speed service from the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company would argue that point.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell's answer to cable modems is called a Digital
Subscriber Line. Instead of requiring a new telephone line or an
ISDN connection, DSL can run on the same line as a voice call. The
phone company does it by extending the top frequency boundary on a
phone line and putting data on frequencies that aren't used by
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between cable modems and DSL is that DSL is a
dedicated service, meaning you don't share your bandwidth with your
neighbors. Consequently, the phone company can guarantee access
speeds, as Southwestern Bell plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell is touting the fact the DSL subscribers can
choose their own Internet service provider. And they point to their
stellar record of customer service, which happens to be the
Achilles heel of the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone company is not your friend, but customer service is
in their lexicon,'' said Rosenberg of Insight Research.
</P>
<P>
   DSL has its shortcomings, too. To get the service, the end user
must live within three miles of the phone company's central office.
And the farther away you live, the lower the connection speed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, DSL works only over standard copper phone wires that run
all the way back to the central office. Because newer subdivisions
_ including many in Johnson County and North Kansas City _ are
served by a shared fiberoptic cable, they can't get the service.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also will have trouble serving areas of Johnson
County until the end of the year, when it plans to complete the
upgrade of the cable networks formerly owned by TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell says it will be able to provide DSL service to
60 percent of the households in Kansas City when it rolls out the
product and invites customers to check availability in their area
on the company's Web site, {www.swbell.com}.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders feel those estimates are wildly optimistic.
Rosenberg's research puts the percentage of DSL-capable households
nationwide closer to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the difference between the two services may pale
beside the improvements that either provides over the current
generation of dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   Said Seley: ``Once you get used to this kind of surfing speed,
you can't go back.'' (END)

 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo _ Two weeks ago Shane Seley took a blind leap
into the uncharted future of cyberspace, a step that thousands of
Kansas Citians are eager to take.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a cable modem.
</P>
<P>
   Seley is one of 400 early-bird testers of Time Warner's Road
Runner, one of two services that will begin delivering high-speed
Internet access to Kansas City homes in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of cranking around the Internet at speeds up to
100 times faster than he could have achieved with his old dial-up
modem, Seley described the service with the enthusiasm of a true
believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just smokin' fast,'' he said. ``This thing actually works
like the Internet should.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no more busy signals. No more screeching modems.
No more waiting for browsers to launch or Web sites to load.
</P>
<P>
   No more World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever surfed the Internet from home can relate.
Instead of the easy access to text, audio and video that the
information highway was supposed to provide, most dial-up Internet
connections offer users a kind of perpetual electronic
rubbernecking: fast enough to grasp the potential, but too slow to
be truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   With high-speed access, Web pages _ even those with complex
graphics _ don't so much load onto your screen as pop up
instantaneously. Big graphics files _ such as the ``Star Wars''
trailer clogging corporate intranets across the country _ take
minutes, not hours, to download in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, high-speed connections are ``always on.'' If
the computer is on, it is on-line, transforming the Internet into a
constant and far more useful presence in the home _ an information
appliance to check the weather, look up recipes, scan movie
listings, or do any of the day-to-day tasks that are too much
hassle with a dial-up connection.
</P>
<P>
   The pent-up demand for such a service is huge. And for many, the
need for speed is not just a convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a necessity,'' said Jon Kesovich, a systems administrator
for a software developer in California who plans to move to Kansas
City this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kesovich will decide where to live based on the availability of
high-speed Internet service. ``I'm hoping to continue to work with
my office in Southern California....I can keep my job if I can get
high-speed access.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every neighborhood in Kansas City will have such access
immediately. And the two services coming to town initially are
being tight-lipped about their rollout plans.
</P>
<P>
   As in other parts of the country, cable will lead the charge.
Time Warner Cable says it already has 4,000 people on the waiting
list for its Road Runner service, which it will begin selling to
the general public at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   However, Southwestern Bell, in partnership with a variety of
local Internet service providers and Internet leviathan America
Online, is right on Road Runner's heels, promising to deliver a
similar service on standard phone lines by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, even Sprint plans to get in on the
action, introducing a bundled offering of phone service and
high-speed Internet access called ION.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finally freeing the genie,'' said Robert Rosenberg,
president of Insight Research Corp. ``The cork is coming off the
bandwidth bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Long time coming The deployment of so-called broadband services
has been hyped for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching this thing closely since 1984,'' Rosenberg
said. ``Every year it's been three years away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers have had a taste of things like Web browsing,
home shopping or stock trading over their dial-up connections. But
the staggering potential of the Internet remains largely untapped
because of inadequate connections to the home.
</P>
<P>
   The technology needed to fatten that pipe has existed for some
time. Most cable companies, however, weren't eager to spend
millions to upgrade their systems to carry two-way signals.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone companies also were reluctant to introduce a cheap
service that could undermine their lucrative business selling
high-speed ISDN and T1 connections to businesses for hundreds and
even thousands of dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of the Internet, however, cable and phone
companies see a huge growth opportunity, both in the ability to
sell high-speed access, and the prospect of delivering new services
over the lines.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest drivers for broadband deployment _ as was the
case with VCRs and dial-up modems _ is adult entertainment,
observers say. But the widespread availability of high-speed
connections also will create an explosion of e-commerce, from
banking to gambling, music to travel. Most applications haven't
even been dreamed up yet.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimates put the number of households using broadband
connections at close to 20 million _ nearly one in five nationwide
_ by 2002. And according to Forrester Research, online shopping by
consumers will spiral from more than $7.8 billion in 1998 to $108
billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever gets the first pipe into the house is going to be able
to sell all kinds of add-on services,'' said Martin Dunsby, a
senior manager at Deloitte &AMP; Touche Management Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Dunsby said, whoever gets that customer first is likely to
keep him for some time because of the high cost of equipment and
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Just as wireless phone companies have buried consumers in hype,
industry observers are predicting a new marketing arms race between
the cable and telephone broadband services, each claiming higher
speeds, richer content, and better customer service.
</P>
<P>
   So who's telling the truth?
</P>
<P>
   The cable and telephone companies are using very different
technologies. Each has advantages and limitations.

   you're putting around the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Frazier went out on Truman Lake on April 12, 1998, for
his first outing in his new 15-foot Streaker boat.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier and passenger David Braun anchored the boat from the
stern, something experts advise against.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of up to 25 mph created waves of at least 2 feet, filling
the boat with water. The men opened the back deck and saw water
about halfway up the gas tank. Their weight caused more water to
enter, swamping the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier and Braun started swimming to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Braun, a swimmer of moderate ability, did not make it.
Authorities say the shock of the 50-degree water and the weight of
his clothes prevented him from reaching the shore. Life jackets
were aboard but unused.
</P>
<P>
   The Water Patrol listed water conditions as the primary cause
but cited inexperience and inattention as contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult thing to deal with,'' said Frazier, of
Warrensburg.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say that boating is more dangerous than it appears
and that even experienced boaters can benefit from safety training.
</P>
<P>
   Many Missourians, however, choose not to take training classes.
The number of students in Water Patrol courses dropped 66 percent
from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More boaters nationwide are taking courses over the Internet _
one safety group reports 35,000 Internet students since 1997. Even
Internet instructors, however, concede that their courses are no
match for live training.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states _ but not Missouri or Kansas _ require mandatory
education.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marvin, a longtime boater from Overland Park, said he would
support mandatory training even if he had to sit through a
repetitive class. He said he had noticed a lot of newcomers making
the waters dangerous. Many pull their motorized skis or boats too
close to others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of them that need a little education,'' Marvin
said. ``They just get in the water and go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Water Patrol hopes to increase its enforcement ability. The
agency employs about 18 officers at Lake of the Ozarks, about 90
statewide. A federal grant, still under consideration, could add
officers next year.
</P>
<P>
   But enforcement isn't keeping up with the boats. And there is
always new traffic _ personal watercraft accidents have doubled
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Mosher said, boaters must watch out for their own
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have no respect for what boats can do,'' she said.
``They think the worst thing that can happen is they get wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think about running into the side of a boat on
their Jet Ski and getting their legs ripped off. A little common
sense is all you need. That would make things a lot safer.'' (END)

HUNDREDS ATTEND NIGHTTIME VAN GOGH EXHIBIT IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE AND TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It was more like a nightclub than a gallery
Friday as hundreds of people dressed in everything from avant-garde
gear to $2,000 suits braved the twilight to see Vincent Van Gogh's
paintings in a Los Angeles exhibit's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some sipped martinis on a rooftop terrace. Children fell into
slumber while their parents marveled at the artwork. Others said
they enjoyed the absence, for the most part, of the elite culture
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an eeriness about this,'' said 52-year-old Lee Gurst
of suburban Sherman Oaks. ``Van Gogh only sold one painting in his
lifetime; now we can walk through here and see paintings that sell
for $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like going through the Egyptian pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art became the first in the
country to show a major exhibition on a 63-hour marathon basis,
which started Friday -- marking the final weekend for ``Van Gogh's
Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 70 paintings will return home. But not before
thousands of people will have viewed the display between 9 a.m.
Friday and midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Another first for the museum was Club Van Gogh, an open-air
terrace featuring hors d'oeuvres, expensive drinks and music from a
jazz sextet. Booths sold replicas of the artist's famous ``The
Starry Night,'' alongside Van Gogh T-shirts and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole event proves there's been a resurgence in the Los
Angeles art culture,'' said LACMA spokesman Adam Coyne, noting the
1997 opening of the Getty Center museum in Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. has become a worldwide art destination -- an arts
leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show as much.
</P>
<P>
   Since the exhibit opened Jan. 17, about 820,000 people have seen
the artwork -- the biggest LACMA hit since the ``Treasures of
Tutankhamen'' exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors in 1978, Coyne
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also came close to the nation's most well-attended art
exhibition, ``Treasure Houses of Britain,'' which attracted 990,474
visitors to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in
1985, Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Gurst said he hopes the late-night museum scene stays alive,
thrilled by the fact he didn't have to push through a crowd to see
the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should open up museums late at night all the time,''
Gurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Garner of suburban Woodland Hills, whose brother got him
the tickets, said he also liked the unique night atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better to see on the last night when you can go out
with a bang instead of hanging with a bunch of stuck-up people,''
said 17-year-old Garner.

   Water Patrol reports.
</P>
<P>
   With their 16-foot Bass Cat anchored on Table Rock Lake, Steve
Thurston and David Richardson did not wait long to break out the
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   In the Water Patrol accident report, Richardson estimated that
they each drank about a pint of Canadian Mist.
</P>
<P>
   After several hours of fishing and drinking, Richardson said, he
was ``pretty drunk'' and fell asleep. Thurston began driving the
boat back to their hometown of Harrison, Ark., about midnight on
May 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another boater, Harry Southwood, said he noticed a flash 90 feet
away and saw Richardson's boat speeding toward his Sea Nymph about
55 mph, well above the nighttime speed limit of 30 mph. The boat
had no lights on.
</P>
<P>
   The boats collided. Richardson awoke to a deafening crash.
</P>
<P>
   Southwood was not hurt, but the Water Patrol found Thurston
dead, submerged in about 2 feet of water. He had deep cuts on his
face and neck, and the boat's propeller had nearly amputated his
left arm.
</P>
<P>
   The odor of liquor wafted from the rear of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson did not want to talk about the accident last week,
but a close friend said the crash had a lasting effect: Richardson
no longer drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad that it takes something like this,'' said Sonia
Marler, a friend who had picked Richardson up at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't hear the warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has more alcohol- and drug-related boating arrests than
any other state, according to Missouri Water Patrol figures. In
1998 the state made 535 arrests for boating under the influence and
1,322 for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 _ before the Water Patrol expanded checkpoints and
enforcement _ there were 331 BUI arrests and 1,008 drug arrests.
</P>
<P>
   New York, with almost 200,000 more registered boats than
Missouri, reported only about one-third as many arrests for
alcohol. Officials there say that only 10 percent of its accidents
involve alcohol, compared with 26 percent in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties for drunken boating in Missouri are much lighter
than for drunken driving. The first two violations are
misdemeanors. And violators don't have to worry about losing a
license _ boaters are not required to carry one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing as on the highways,'' said Connie Weyer, a
longtime boater from Sunrise Beach. ``You have 90 percent of the
people who are courteous and 10 percent who don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people who would have two or three drinks and not
drive a car will drink a six-pack or a 12-pack and drive a 4-ton
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though safety experts say life jackets could prevent 80
percent of fatalities, only a tiny fraction of boaters will wear
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who can't swim well often forgo them.
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, Michael Stobaugh of Matthews took his 10-year-old
son for a fishing trip on Clearwater Lake in southeast Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Stobaugh couldn't swim and wasn't wearing a life jacket.
Missouri law requires them only for riders of personal watercraft
and boaters under 7. His son could swim but wore a life jacket
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The water was calm, the temperature 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Then their boat hit something, and both were thrown into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Stobaugh's son took off his life jacket and tried to give it to
his father. The father refused. The boy screamed for help. As a
passer-by arrived, Stobaugh slipped underwater and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Stobaugh's wife, Marilyn, said she hoped such accidents would
spur people to wear life jackets, even if the water appeared safe.
Stobaugh said she would ``never, ever, ever'' ride a boat without a
life jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stress enough how important it is,'' she said. ``A
seemingly minor thing can change a person's whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three persons died in boating accidents last year, and 38
more drowned in Missouri waters. Most were not wearing life
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the evidence is there, trying to get adults to
wear life jackets is a real struggle,'' said Ruth Wood of the
BOAT//US Safety Foundation. ``Believe me, we've tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Indiana requires life jackets at all times. Hawaii, Idaho
and Wyoming have no requirements. Most states fall in the middle.
Kansas mandates life jackets for riders of personal watercraft and
boaters 12 and under.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hope to encourage the use of life jackets through
public-awareness campaigns. Experts say inflatable life jackets
that are lighter and less cumbersome could increase their use. Such
jackets are being developed but are not yet in general use.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, life jackets are perceived as inconvenient. And many
boaters don't want to follow rules that can cramp their leisure
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a boat, you want to be wearing nothing but
shorts,'' said Kenny Carroll, a Shawnee boater who never wears a
life jacket. ``You're kicking back and want to get a good tan. You
don't want to be wearing something that is going to annoy you as
you're putting around the lake.''

<P>
   LAKE OZARK, Mo. _ Officer Stacey Mosher hears her dispatch radio
crackle a report of an injury accident. She guns her Missouri Water
Patrol speedboat and heads for the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher discovers a woman who has slipped and hit her head; blood
streams from the cut. The injury appears minor.
</P>
<P>
   The real dangers, Mosher says, are still to come.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day the Lake of the Ozarks will be overrun by
boaters _ as many as 40,000. The summer boating season will bring
the threat of more serious injuries and even deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of the most dangerous states for boaters,
according to an analysis of U.S. Coast Guard data. The agency
tracks serious accidents, those involving injury or death, or
damage exceeding $500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Missouri ranked fourth, with 333 serious boating
accidents, and 11th in fatalities, with 25. According to an
analysis by state water officials, Missouri ranked first in arrests
related to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who come down here with more horsepower than
brains,'' Mosher said. ``That makes it dangerous for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The states with higher accident counts _ Florida, California and
Michigan _ have more miles of waterway and more registered boats.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, boaters were involved in 60 accidents and four
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities attribute Missouri's accident rates to too many
boats, too much alcohol and too few safeguards. In particular they
worry about the Lake of the Ozarks, where more than half the
state's accidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything goes at the lake,'' said Lou Mayer, a longtime
homeowner at the lake. ``It's like the Wild West all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri lacks the expansive waters of coastal states.
Competition for limited space makes it seem even tighter. Docks
extend from a growing number of residential projects. Boat
registrations are up 20 percent since 1990, and a new generation of
motorized-ski operators fights for a share of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Water Patrol officials say some boaters have surprisingly little
regard for the damage their vehicles can cause.
</P>
<P>
   As boats get bigger, many operators plow across the lake with
little fear, while others dart among the traffic on personal
watercraft, which now account for 30 percent of boating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Most safeguards are voluntary, not mandated by Missouri law.
</P>
<P>
   Adults can legally operate a boat during the day at any speed
with no life jacket, no training and an open bottle of booze at
their side. With no lanes or stop signs, boaters often make
split-second decisions as they navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for stricter boating laws have not been well-received
by those with financial interests in the lake, such as condo
builders and marina operators. Similarly, some vacationers grouse
at the prospect of more regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, laws setting nighttime speed limits and
establishing more drunken-boating checkpoints have been enacted,
but more- expansive proposals have failed in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Laws do make a difference. After Missouri enacted a law in 1997
that raised the minimum age for personal-watercraft operators from
12 to 14, accidents dropped 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Boating is increasing nationwide _ Missouri boat registration
tops 326,000 _ and some experts say lawmakers are taking action to
make waterways safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later you get to the point where the sheer numbers
create the conflicts,'' said Bill Engfer, president of the National
Association of State Boating Law Administrators. ``At this point
it's no longer a question of whether we should or shouldn't improve
boating laws. It's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Safe Boating Council says nearly all injuries and
fatalities could be prevented through three things: more
responsible use of alcohol; the use of life jackets; and education.
</P>
<P>
   And many of Missouri's 23 boating fatalities in 1998 listed one
of those factors as a primary or a contributing cause, according to
Water Patrol reports.

ITALIAN FESTIVAL RAISES SCHOLARSHIP MONEY FOR EVERY STUDENT IN
SMALL KANSAS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRONTENAC, Kan. _ Could teen-age cliques _ that high school
phenomena now so fearsome to parents across the nation _ be negated
with sumptuous helpings of risotto, chicken cacciatore, pasta
cordon, lasagna, crostini and ravoli?
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense to folks here.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10 residents of Frontenac, a southeast Kansas town,
turned out in droves for what's called Festa Italiana. They brought
home-cooked dishes like the above, had a wonderful time and raised
$35,500.
</P>
<P>
   That money _ and money realized from future festivals _ will
guarantee scholarships to graduates of Frontenac High who attend a
university, a junior college or a technical or trade school.
</P>
<P>
   That means everybody _ the jocks, the techies, the brains, the
nerds, the preppies, the weirdoes, the ins, the outs, the popular
and the not so popular, even the farm kid with cow manure on his
boots.
</P>
<P>
   This fall those here who choose to continue their education will
receive $100 a semester for four years.
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Cinotto, president-elect of the Frontenac Education
Foundation, which with the Pittsburg /{ Morning Sun/} sponsored the
festival, says people haven't seen anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may think $100 a semester isn't much,'' he said. ``But
it's just a start. We can increase it fairly rapidly. Look at the
response we got last month. This will grow. Four hundred dollars a
semester isn't out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Why scholarships from a town as a whole?
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to show every student is that if he or she has
the gumption to go on from high school, we're behind them,'' said
Linda Grilz, president of the foundation. ``No ifs, ands or buts.
We value them. And they must value themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after Festa Italiana came the tragedy at Columbine High
school in Littleton, Colo. Nobody here said, ``I told you so.''
Nobody got puffed up with self-congratulation, because people here
know that what happened in Littleton can happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Frontenac, Cinotto said, has its little cliques like any school,
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was just one step, in retrospect oddly
prescient. And, above all, unique.
</P>
<P>
   But then Frontenac and Unified School District 249 aren't
exactly a big-town suburban district. The school and the district
/{ are /} Frontenac, population roughly 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   District 249 is small _ 316 in high school, 361 in elementary.
Just about every student participates in something _ sports, band,
clubs, whatever. Kids ]Young people were all over the place at the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontenac is where if you mess up in school you'll not only
hear about it there but your parents' phone will be ringing long
before you get home,'' said Debbie Bridwell, a foundation board
member. ``This whole town raises these kids. That sounds
old-fashioned, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, started in 1993, two years ago raised $250,000
to provide computers, technical equipment and furnishings for
Layden Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   That done, somebody asked if hardware was enough? Kids, the
reasoning went, were Frontenac's lifeblood. What more concrete
things could be done to send a message to the children that they
were more than just young bodies moving in and out of tax-supported
schools?
</P>
<P>
   Festa Italiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have almost 30 scholarships here in town available to
students,'' Grilz said. ``People, over the years, have made
bequests for a kid to have some extra money at the school he
chooses. Or somebody's donated so a student going to a certain
school can get some help. But this, I've been told, is one of the
few places where the a whole town has put it on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Fogliasso, another board member, said Frontenac wasn't
going to wait around for a ``sugar daddy,'' one of those admirable
yet rare individuals who endear themselves to a community and get a
ton of publicity when they commit to sending every child to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Frontenac, a largely Italian-American, Catholic, working-class
community, knew there probably wouldn't be any such outside
windfall, Fogliasso said. So, he said, it was up to the town.
</P>
<P>
   The people had responded before. A couple of years ago a bond
issue was proposed to finance a new, $2.5 million high school.
</P>
<P>
   Some fretted. The old high school _ which would have to be torn
down to make way for the new one _ oozed sentimentality, its
history going back to the 1920s. Some feared poignant memories and
a backlash against modernity might sway some patrons, 38 percent of
whom are retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Seventy-five percent of the voters turned out; the
bonds passed 70-30, a figure most other school districts would kill
for.
</P>
<P>
   Still, raising money for scholarships isn't exactly the same as
brick and mortar. Didn't matter, Grilz said.
</P>
<P>
   What the foundation relied on, she said, was the
Italian-Americans' love of good food, maybe a glass of wine, a
long-overdue celebration of their heritage, and concern for the
future of their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at the nearby Frontenac Greyhound Racetrack
(formerly Camptown) featured a walk for cash, the Italian dishes,
wine tasting, 50 sponsors including Alitalia Airlines, an auction
and a raffle, and several hundred people visiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought maybe we'd raise $15,000, tops,'' Grilz said. ``We
ended up with more than double that. We were absolutely stunned.
There were hundreds and hundreds who took part in the walk. And
we've hardly touched the people who've moved away from here.''
</P>
<P>
   (Contributions to the foundation can be sent to 208 S. Cayuga,
Frontenac, KS 66763).
</P>
<P>
   What amazed the board was the enthusiasm of Frontenac's older
generation. It wasn't uncommon, said Pat Terlip, board treasurer,
that people in their 70s and 80s _ especially women _ stayed up
well past their normal bedtimes on April 9 putting the finishing
touches on some favorite Italian dish they took to the racetrack
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like this around here,'' Cinotto said.
``People will drive a long way for the food we have. So we're using
the big Italian-American get-together on the Hill over in St. Louis
as our model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, this could turn out to be really something.''

   FISHER-FESTIVAL (Frontenac, Kan. _) On April 10 residents of
Frontenac, a southeast Kansas town, turned out in droves for what's
called Festa Italiana. They brought home-cooked dishes and raised
$35,500. That money _ and money realized from future festivals _
will guarantee scholarships to graduates of Frontenac High.
</P>
<P>
   BOAT-SAFETY (Lake Ozark, Mo. _) On Memorial Day the Lake of the
Ozarks will be overrun by boaters _ as many as 40,000. The summer
boating season will bring the threat of more serious injuries and
even deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of the most dangerous states for boaters,

   LOS ANGELES: risks of arrest or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about the rush, nice cars and being the best,'' said
20-year-old Carlos Parker of Simi Valley who cruises to the races
in his modified Acura Integra.
</P>
<P>
   They spend thousands on their cars, outfitting them with bigger
engines, suspensions that improve traction and even nitrous oxide
injectors, which makes the fuel burn faster for extra speed,
Perazzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a modified exhaust and intake that gives me about 15
percent more horsepower,'' Parker said. ``I've got it up to about
130 mph on the freeway, at night of course.''
</P>
<P>
   With many modifications that aren't legal, customers have to
sign a waiver exempting the Sylmar performance shop of any
liability, Perazzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has the toughest restrictions in the country,''
Perazzo said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cars these days are moving faster, crowds have grown larger and
the death toll has risen, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a 20-year-old West Hills man died in March when
his car crashed in a street race at speeds up to 100 mph. Paul
Rolda lost control of his car and hit a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths aren't always from racing events.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena street racer Julio Mares, 19, died and his two
passengers were critically injured in November 1997 as they fled
from police who were breaking up a Sylmar street race.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a tree, too.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after his death, his mother, Maria Elena Mares, tried
to convince her son's friends to quit risking their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that they should stop the racing so that the same
thing wouldn't happen to another teen-ager,'' Mares said in
Spanish. ``I told them to try to move forward, to succeed in life.
I told them to see what had happened to our family and make sure it
didn't happen to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mares said her life hasn't been the same since the death
of her only son, who worked as a security guard. She has two
younger daughters, ages 15 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   As far as she knew, her son had never drag-raced nor shown any
indications that it was a hobby of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell me that he would hang out with his friends,''
said Mares. ``I don't think drag racing is good for youth. It's
very dangerous for them to be doing that in the city.''

DRAG RACING ELUDES THE LAW IN SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(With contributions from Daily News Staff Writer Yvette Cabrera) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The squad cars moved in, red lights and sirens
blaring Friday night at the intersection of Bledsoe Street and
Bradley Avenue, and dozens of youths bolted for their cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the hot spot in the city's suburban San Fernando Valley,
scores escaped in a trail of smoke and dust from a Los Angeles
police dragnet targeting illegal street races. But others weren't
so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dead,'' wailed a 17-year-old girl who was handcuffed and
put in a squad car for curfew violation with handfuls of other
teens. Officers would be calling their parents. ``I'm going to be
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   As she moved her cruiser into position, Foothill Division
Officer Michelle Rodriguez said this is where a raid on street
racers gets complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they run, things get dangerous,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared, about 75 cars and hundreds of youths
remained, waiting for hours as the Los Angeles Police Department
searched every car, screened every person and wrote tickets for
every vehicle code violation imaginable in this community about 24
miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't fair. We're out here having a good time instead of
drinking, partying and drugs,'' said 19-year-old Ree Rodriguez of
Downey. ``These raids get scary. People drive out of here like
crazy, and that's when people get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The raid didn't crush the spirits of 21-year-old Shawn Hendrix,
who travels to Los Angeles every summer from Oklahoma just for the
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to race on tracks. This is fun. It's better to
sneak around,'' Hendrix said. ``It's a huge thrill. Look how
exciting this is.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; With the approach of long, hot summer nights, young men are
beginning to meet secretly on empty streets to push their heavily
modified cars to triple-digit speeds. They're searching for the
next rush, for living-on-the-edge excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Friday night's action, longtime Valley street
racer Eddie Perazzo leaned over a counter at Hi Speed Motorworks in
Sylmar, explaining how racers come from San Diego and Las Vegas and
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other sport, but the adrenaline you get from it
is something I can't really explain,'' said Perazzo, 24, manager of
the performance shop.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 about a dozen people have perished in racing
incidents, including an 18-month-old girl who was a passenger in a
car that wasn't racing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the danger doesn't stop the hard core who come for the
thrill -- and profits of victory. The stakes are in the hundreds,
if not thousands of dollars to drivers with the top speed.
</P>
<P>
   Some even bet their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I've ever seen accidents is when someone is
showing off, or when the cops come and make everyone scatter,''
said Perazzo. ``Safety is a big issue and some people get nervous,
but I've never seen a watcher get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Police disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is these drivers are not skilled, and they
are racing at more than 100 mph while kids are standing in the
street,'' said LAPD Foothill Division Officer Ron Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The alcohol flows. Sometimes drugs. The clandestine events draw
larger crowds than normal during the summer when streets roar with
the sound of engines, bringing police task forces into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days you can get crowds of 400 kids out there, with
about 200 cars racing. It's just plain dangerous,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Street racer Ozzie Maya, 19, of Sylmar agreed the sport can be
dangerous, but said that racers and police should come to some kind
of arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they could watch and make sure nothing goes wrong,''
Maya said, sitting behind the wheel of a $25,000 Mitsubishi Mirage.
``I don't think anyone would have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Racers have also perfected their security to avoid detection,
Walker said. They often have lookouts who will monitor police
scanners and use cell phones to warn their friends, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it tough for police, who can't keep up with the
movement and get bogged down with logistics in setting up
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tough to put these things together. I've spent about
50 hours setting this one up,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Still they have good days.
</P>
<P>
   In October -- the most recent crackdown -- seven people were
arrested and nearly 150 others were cited when sheriff's deputies
broke up races in Lancaster in the northernmost portion of Los
Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   But with several hot spots throughout the Valley, it's easy to
keep the races alive. They're held in Pacoima, Reseda, Northridge,
Sylmar and Chatsworth. They travel into Lancaster near the area's
landfill, and to Quartz Hill in the remote Antelope Valley. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Street racing isn't new in the Valley. It began with hot
rodders in the 1960s when the muscle-car craze began to take root.
Its popularity hit the mainstream in 1973 when the film ``American
Graffiti'' romanticized street races in the summer of 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 30 years they've gone out for the thrill, to be the best,
and to win money,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   A film student at California State University, Northridge, who
chronicled street racing in a documentary said the action turned
out to be more dangerous than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is incredibly stupid,'' said Eric Zlotorynski,
who spent a semester in 1998 filming Los Angeles street racing
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me the most is that racers had a great lack of
care or safety for other motorists and the kids who were
watching,'' Zlotorynski said. ``I felt they were wasting -- and
risking -- what life they have.''
</P>
<P>
   But the showmanship and revelry are strong lures to young
people, despite risks of arrest or worse.

CONNECTICUT COLUMN: MUST HARTFORD KEEP GRASPING AT THE BIG TIME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Homer Simpson entered the ``How Low Will You
Go'' gross-out competition in last week's episode of ``The
Simpsons'' because the prize promised a trip to Hawaii. But it
turned out the ticket was really to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted The Hartford Courant to ask the cartoon show's
producers if Hartford had been insulted. No, said the producers. A
trip to upstate New York would be an insult, they said, but a
sucker prize to Hartford, that was a compliment. This seemed to
satisfy The Courant.  &UR; D'oh. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To hear them tell it, people in Hartford have been spending a
lot of time worrying about their city's reputation these days, now
that Hartford has been worked over by another big-time
entertainment outfit, this time the New England Patriots. The
football team promised to move to Hartford if the state would pay
for a new, $375 million stadium. Unlike the newspaper, legislators
did not stop to ask if they were being insulted before they voted
to spend the money. But the Pats then said no thanks when they got
an improved offer from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   So Hartford is deep into one of its periods of self-analysis, of
the sort it last went through two years ago when the state's only
major league team, the Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey
League, ran off to North Carolina. The dominant view is still that
Hartford must do what it takes to join the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the richest state in the union,'' said Francis
DelMastro, owner of the Civic Cafe, on Trumbull Street. ``We have
more money per capita than anywhere else, and we're still getting
dictated to by Boston and New York. And unless we keep making bold
moves, like we did for the Patriots, we're not going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Parker, the manager at Coach's Sports Bar, lamented his
city's small-town reputation. ``You look at Hartford, stuck here
between New York and Boston, and you've got to admit, it's been
always a bridesmaid, never a bride for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford metropolitan area, 37th in size nationally, has
lost population since 1990, while Boston (7th) and New York (1st)
have grown. The once dominant insurance industry is now largely run
by out-of-town conglomerates, and despite the wealth of its
suburbs, the city has large pockets of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But the downtown business district and the state Capitol area
have a Midwestern openness and greenness in springtime. They are
spotlessly clean and, on an early morning, offer visitors an easy
and relaxed atmosphere by big-city standards. It may or may not
mean anything that Hartford has two memorials to the inventor of
anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   And some people like it this way. For all the official
scrambling for the trappings of the big time, there are dissenting
voices that want Hartford to stop trying to keep up with the
neighbors and focus on what it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford has to get over this thing it has about New York and
Boston and be glad the way it is,'' said Patrick Brossard, who was
at the Civic Center last week to watch the minor-league Hartford
Wolfpack hockey team. ``I drove in from Windsor Locks, I parked
right here, and after the game I'm home in 20 minutes. Can you do
that in New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some boosters of downtown Hartford wish people would
think of something other than ease of access to the outbound
Interstate. Molly Browning is the public relations director of the
Greater Hartford Arts Council, and she has all the subtlety of her
native Texas when arguing that Hartford already has what it takes,
if only people would pay a little attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hartford had a thriving, nationally important arts community
long before anyone started talking about bringing the Patriots
here,'' she said, ``and what absolutely galls me is that nobody is
saying, `Hey, guys, we already have it all right here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Stage Company is a strong regional theater, Ms.
Browning pointed out. The Connecticut Opera has just brought in a
seasoned new music director, Willie A. Waters. At the Wadsworth
Atheneum, crowds lined up last week to see the new Georgia O'Keeffe
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is this city going to decide to go with what it's got,''
Ms. Browning went on, ``and stop waiting for someone to come in
from the outside?''

Charismatic quiets Derby critics 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
BALTIMORE _ This time, Charismatic left no doubt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considered by most a lucky winner of the Kentucky Derby two
weeks ago, the underrated colt blew away his opposition in
yesterday's Preakness Stakes to set the stage for another Triple
Crown chase.
</P>
<P>
   Four other horses had more money wagered on them than 8-to-1
Charismatic, but the former claiming horse carried jockey Chris
Antley to a 11/2-length victory over favored Menifee, whom he had
beaten by only a neck at the Derby. Badge ran third at 58-to-1
odds.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic now heads to the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes on
June 5 as the third consecutive Preakness winner to have a chance
at sweeping the Triple Crown. Silver Charm won the first two legs
in 1997, then lost the Belmont to Touch Gold. Real Quiet was upset
in last year's Belmont by Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second time in three years, beer distributor Bob
Lewis of Newport Beach, Calif., and his wife, Beverly, have a
chance at the Triple Crown, which has been accomplished only 11
times and not since 1978's Affirmed. The Lewises own Charismatic
and raced Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic could very well add his name to that list by winning
the Belmont, said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who won the Preakness for
the fifth time and continued his decade-long dominance of
3-year-old classic races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Derby,'' recalled Lukas, ``I told Bob and Beverly,
`I don't know about the first two, but I sure like him in the
Belmont.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic will earn his owners a $5 million bonus if he wins
the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's Kentucky Derby victory was diminished by troubles
that befell numerous other runners in the crowded 19-horse field.
But yesterday, before a crowd of 100,311, he had more adversity
than anyone and overcame it with a brilliant performance.
</P>
<P>
   Antley took him five-wide around the second turn of Pimlico Race
Course, even though the inside path next to the rail was much
faster than the rest of the track. No horse in two days had won at
Pimlico with a move that wide, but Charismatic swept past his
rivals with a bold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Although the outcome was similar, Pimlico's fast rail created a
vastly different pace scenario than the slow-paced Derby. In an
attempt to capitalize on the fast rail, Kimberlite Pipe, Cat Thief
and Vicar were all sent for the lead and dueled through fast
fractions of 45.27 seconds for a half-mile and 1:10.31 for six
furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for closers to prevail. Badge was far back in
the early running, too, as was fourth-place Stephen Got Even.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it again came down to Charismatic and Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic actually caught and passed Menifee, who was gaining
on him at the end of the Kentucky Derby. Menifee raced in eighth
place in the 13-horse field for the first half-mile, while
Charismatic was behind and outside him in 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's big move past Menifee propelled him to a
three-length advantage in midstretch.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Derby, said Pat Day, who rode Menifee, ``We
didn't close up any ground on the winner in the last sixteenth of a
mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, timed in 1:55 2-5 for the 13/16 miles, paid $18.60
to win. His 8-to-1 Preakness odds were the second highest for a
Derby winner, behind only Dark Star, who was 11-to-1 in the 1953
Preakness and ran sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky Derby, Charismatic paid $64.60.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is damn near better than the beer business,'' said Bob
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some loyal followers are getting their car payments done and
putting their kids through college if they stuck with this one,''
Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic is the 28th horse to win the first two legs of the
Triple Crown. Eleven had gone on to win the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic gave Lukas a record 12th victory in a Triple Crown
race, and his ninth in the 1990s. In one span during 1994-1996, he
won six consecutive. Although Lukas has never trained a horse that
swept the Triple Crown, he won all three races in 1995 with two
different horses, Thunder Gulch and Timber Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now maybe my turn has come up that we can do it with one
horse,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   After yesterday's clear-cut result, Charismatic will have far
fewer doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go home and read that the best horse won,'' Lukas
said.
</P>
<P>
   The best horse won.

RODRIGUEZ, HIRSCHBECK CLEAR AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Catcher Ivan Rodriguez made a special trip to
the umpire's dressing room after Friday's game to meet with umpire
John Hirschbeck and discuss their ninth-inning fracas. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Everything is cleared up,'' Rodriguez said. ``We both got a
little bit mad. It happens.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez thought Delino DeShields' ninth-inning dribbler was
foul when he picked it up. Hirschbeck ruled it was on the line and
called it fair. The two started screaming at each other while
manager Johnny Oates tried to separate them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were also words after the game, but Hirschbeck, who said
he appreciated the post-game gesture, said Rodriguez was not
ejected and there is no reason to file a report with the league. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good relationship with umpires,'' Rodriguez said. ``I
usually never get mad with umpires. But some times those things can
happen.'' &QL; 
Simms to resume rehab &QL; 
Reserve outfielder Mike Simms will resume his medical
rehabilitation assignment Wednesday barring any setbacks. With
Triple-A Oklahoma and Double-A Tulsa scheduled to play on the road,
The Rangers are undecided where Simms (torn tendon, left Achilles)
will be assigned, assistant general manager Dan O'Brien said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of looking forward to it because I'm finally
pain-free,'' Simms said. &QL; 
Clark takes BP &QL; 
Orioles first baseman Will Clark took batting practice on the field
yesterday for the first time since fracturing his left thumb April
18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clark could be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list before
the Rangers travel to Baltimore for a three-game series scheduled
to begin Friday. &QL; 
Athletics impress Oates &QL; 
The Oakland Athletics haven't had a winning season since 1992, but
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said he's not surprised they're three
games over .500 with their five-game winning streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good ballclub,'' Oates said. ``I've said that all
year. Putting Tony Phillips and Tim Raines in there with some good
young hitters was good, and they have some pretty good arms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is I don't think overall they have as much
depth as the other teams in the division. They can't afford to lose
too many guys. If they lose two or three guys like \RMatt\S Stairs
or \RMiguel\S Tejada, it probably makes it a little more of a
difference with them.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Rangers left-hander Eric Gunderson, who went on the 15-day disabled
list May 8 with tightness in his left shoulder, is scheduled to be
examined today by Dr. John Conway, the Rangers' orthopedic
consultant. Gunderson underwent a magnetic-resonance-imaging test
Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez received credit for a seventh-inning
stolen base Friday after a scoring change announced yesterday. That
gave Rodriguez a career-high 10 stolen bases and established a
season record for a Rangers catcher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle recalled right-hander Jordan Zimmerman from Double-A New
Haven of the Eastern League yesterday. Zimmerman is the younger
brother of Rangers right-hander Jeff Zimmerman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers promoted left-hander Robert Quarnstrom from Class-A
Charlotte to Double-A Tulsa. The Drillers needed a fresh reliever,
and Quarnstrom will return to Charlotte in the near future,
assistant general manager Dan O'Brien said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers purchased the contract of Ryan Karp from the
Atlantic League and assigned the left-hander to Tulsa. Karp, who
made 16 major-league appearances for the Philadelphia Phillies
during the 1995 and '97 seasons, will join the Drillers' bullpen. &QL;

RONALD REAGAN'S DAUGHTER SHARES HIS GIFT, GRIEF AT FORUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. -- When Patti Davis was a child, her father,
Ronald Reagan, once took her on a walk at their ranch after a brush
fire. He kneeled down to show her a green shoot that had burst
through the charred undergrowth.
</P>
<P>
   It was his way of showing her how the cycle of life and death
came full circle -- that even from the blackened ashes there was
new life coming, she said. It was this image of her father as a
``magical storyteller'' that came to Davis' mind when she learned
Reagan, the former president, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He painted beautiful pictures for me,'' Davis said. ``I didn't
always appreciate the things that he taught me, but I appreciate
them so much now.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I see how it has come full circle because now I have an
opportunity to bring him the same level of comfort that those
stories brought to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spoke to an audience of about 100 local residents and
caregivers who attended a women's health forum on the effects of
Alzheimer's disease, held Saturday at Verdugo Hills Hospital in
suburban Glendale, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``How unfair would it be for me to not utilize the things that
he has taught me at a time in his life when so much has fallen
away,'' said Davis, who has written about her experience with her
father's disease in national publications, including the most
recent issue of Ladies' Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Public Lives, Private Healing: One Family's Journey,''
Davis' presentation touched on issues such as healing and
reconciliation. Her talk was part of an educational series for
women started by the hospital last February.
</P>
<P>
   When her father's diagnosis was made, Davis said the issues she
faced were more than just physical death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of other kinds of death -- the death of
communication, the death of possibility, things that I had wanted
to share with my father to experience with him that I hadn't been
able to,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Davis said she decided to confront and discard
any resentment that she had felt toward her father for not being
emotionally available to her throughout her childhood, teen years
and adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to carry around the things that I hadn't gotten from
him would definitely impact this last stage of his life that we
would share together,'' Davis said. ``I thought the best thing that
I could do would be to clean up my own act, in terms of whatever
was left, whatever childhood wounds were left.''
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's is a progressively degenerative disease that
destroys the brain cells and causes memory loss, impaired judgment
and the loss of language abilities. It eventually results in the
complete loss of a person's ability to care for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Though her father is not able to communicate the way he once
did, Davis said they have found a level of communication that goes
beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that if I accept that this is the reality that has
happened to us -- this is my father's exit from this world -- that
I'm just content to be with him and sometimes in total silence
looking at a picture book or a book of photographs,'' said Davis,
noting that her father has a fondness for nature books.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation with Alzheimer's disease is to think that your
loved one can't communicate, doesn't have the cognitive skills and
therefore it doesn't matter what you bring into that room, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it matters more because what is still there is the
emotional reality, and that's even more raw because it doesn't have
that buffer of analytical thought,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with her father's condition, Davis said she has
learned what the essence of caregiving is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much about doing; it's about letting go of the
things that got in the way of you being fully present for that
person, fully present for that situation,'' said Davis, the author
of two national bestsellers in addition to her latest book,
``Angels Don't Die: My Father's Gift of Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was in his 80s when he disclosed to the nation in 1994
that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Davis said she
went through a grieving process over the period of a year and
learned not to fight it but instead grow from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an opportunity because of this disease . . . because
of the length of this illness, to have time with my father that
took us to another level that I wouldn't have gotten to if he, for
example, had been killed in 1981 when he was shot,'' said Davis,
referring to the assassination attempt against Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by an audience member if her father recognizes her,
Davis responded that her father is such a sweet man that she
believes that he acts like he recognizes people even when he
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I think underneath as long as my presence
there is a comforting one and not an intrusive one, that's OK,''
Davis said.

Abajo sets Lone Star track record 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mary Rampellini 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Jockey Donnie Meche capped an outstanding
afternoon yesterday at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie with his
victory aboard Abajo in the $100,000 Alysheba Breeders' Cup. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crowd of 11,739 spectators watched Meche win four races and
wagered $457,536 on the local simulcast of the Preakness Stakes
from Baltimore. From all sources, the track's handle had topped
$4.45 million by 8 p.m. yesterday, and was expected to be more than
the $4,446,191 wagered the day of the Preakness last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Alysheba Breeders' Cup, Abajo raced about a half-length
behind Fantastic Finish early in the seven-furlong sprint before
moving to a commanding lead entering the homestretch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to dart clear of fast-closing Lexington Park by a
length, and covered the distance in a track-record time of 1
minute, 21.58 seconds, lowering the 1:21.70 standard set by The
Last Spell in 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't feel like he's going that fast,'' Meche said. ``He
has a nice, long stride to him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abajo is trained by Steve Asmussen, who won three races
yesterday at Lone Star, and saddled Dreams Gallore to a
second-place finish Friday in the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes at
Pimlico Race Course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's for real,'' Asmussen said of Abajo. ``He's a fast-running
son of a gun. And he looked so good doing it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abajo has won three of seven starts for owner Bill Heiligbrodt
of Houston. He earned $30,000 for the victory, improving his career
earnings to $82,081. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lexington Park earned $20,000 for finishing second in the
Alysheba. Unlike the winner, Lexington Park is Breeders' Cup
nominated, making him eligible for additional purse funds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abajo returned $9 as second choice in wagering. Trickey Crew,
the favorite, finished fifth after racing wide entering the
stretch. &QL;

ERIC DAVIS HAS L.A. REGRETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It has been six years since Eric Davis played in Los
Angeles. To many, it might seem he never played there at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not after returning from colon cancer last year to bat .327 with
28 homers in Baltimore. Not with 300 home runs and 300 stolen bases
well within range for a career that was often cut short by
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But as Davis, now a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, remembers
his 1{ seasons with the Dodgers, he calls it one of the few regrets
in 14 major- league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He had grown up in South Central L.A. and had lived in Woodland
Hills since 1985. His childhood buddy Darryl Strawberry was part of
a Dodgers outfield that also included Brett Butler. It had the
potential to be the greatest in L.A. Dodgers history. But
Strawberry went down with a back injury in May 1992 and his career
never recovered. Davis had injuries to his neck, left shoulder and
left wrist that all later required surgery. The neck forced him to
retire after the 1994 season, but he came back after a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot in my life,'' Davis said before
Saturday's game with the Dodgers and Cardinals. ``But I've always
felt very badly that the fans in L.A. didn't get a chance to see me
really play. Everything was in place, coming home, everything. That
could have really been something.''
</P>
<P>
   What is really something is the way Davis has responded to every
adversity. Once considered surly and aloof, Davis is one of the
most popular players in the Cardinals clubhouse. Once reluctant to
accept the responsibility of team leadership, he now embraces a
more prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a special, special man,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson, who had Davis in Baltimore in 1997. ``That team had a lot
of big names, Cal (Ripken) and Brady (Anderson), but Eric was our
leader. Players responded to him and not just after the cancer. He
was very important to that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis acknowledges that the cancer surgery and subsequent
chemotherapy affected his perspective and resolve in a positive
way.
</P>
<P>
   He said leadership is a quality, ``set by example, not just
performance. It is the respect you get for standing up when times
are bad and accepting your part. It is easy for a guy to talk after
he's gotten a couple of hits. It's more important that he's there
when times are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not look back in anger at Cincinnati Reds owner Marge
Schott, his former boss. The two often battled, including after the
Reds won the 1990 World Series. Davis lacerated a kidney in the
Series and Schott billed him for the flight back to Cincinnati on a
separate medical charter.
</P>
<P>
   Schott has been under suspension from baseball for two years for
racially insensitive remarks and forced to sell her part of the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of her and I'm sad,'' he said. ``She is not a bad
person, she just made bad decisions. I think she often trusted in
people in Cincinnati that did not have her best interests at heart.
There are a lot of powerful people who think like that, but they
aren't allowed to do it in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also says poor decision making is at the root of the legal
problems facing Strawberry, who was arrested in April for
possession of cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. The two remain
close and Davis was Strawberry's chief confidante when the Yankees
outfielder underwent similar surgery for colon cancer last October.
But Davis said he isn't sure Strawberry will escape the demons that
have ruined his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Darryl ever find peace?'' he said. ``Not until he can
find some peace in his heart. He made some bad choices because he
has to realize that drugs are a disease that has to be addressed
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, now 37, said he expected to return to Baltimore after
last season, but the Cardinals offered a two-year, $8 million
contract. Although he has battled the flu the past week, Davis
started in right field Saturday night. He entered the game batting
.274 with three homers and 17 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his biggest individual goal is to reach 300 home
runs, which should occur next season. After that, he said he would
like to stay in baseball in a management capacity. Cincinnati
general manager Jim Bowden and Dodgers GM Kevin Malone have talked
to him about front-office possibilities down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see that someday,'' Davis said. ``I've learned
a lot over the years.''

BLESSING WHEELS FOR PERILOUS TRAVELS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the holy water, hurled by a white-robed church
elder, fell upon their heads and on the handlebars of their 1962
Schwinn Twin tandem Saturday, Harris Silver and his wife, Roz
Makarechi, exhaled and exchanged a relieved glance.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of a belief in God as much as the hope that the
sprinkle would prove an effective taxi repellant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel with 20,000 taxis in New York and a mayor gone after
us, we definitely need all the help we can get,'' Silver, 33, an
avid cyclist from Greenwich Village, said in a low voice
immediately afterward. ``Even as atheists.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the tone of the Blessing of the Bicycles inside the
Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, where more than 100 cyclists gathered with their bikes
to indemnify themselves from harm on New York's inhospitable
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute bike blessing was performed by the Very Rev. Harry
Pritchett, who read from the book of Ezekiel and from Psalms,
hurled holy water on cyclists _ of both the neon Lycra and
sweatpants-and-sneakers varieties _ and administered a moment of
silence to remember riders killed in accidents with motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them;
and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels
rose,'' intoned Pritchett, reading Ezekiel to the cyclists under
the cavernous church apse. ``Wherever the spirit would go, they
went and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the
living creatures was in the wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 cyclists are killed in New York City each year, said
Charles Komanoff of Right of Way, a bicycle group that produces
street memorials for fallen cyclists. During Saturday's moment of
silence, Komanoff read off names of some of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pritchett sprinkled holy water over the two rows of
cyclists as a small choir sang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that kosher hol water?'' asked one cyclist, Mike Kaback,
57, of Manhattan. ``It's Saturday, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   The bike blessing, said to be the first of its kind in New York,
was organized jointly by two rival bike clubs, the Five-Borough
Bike Club and the New York Cycle Club, as a kind of good will
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two clubs don't get along sometimes, so we thought this
would be a nice thing to do,'' Glen Goldstein, one of the
blessing's organizers, said before the service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cyclists planned to complete Sunday's Montauk
Century, a 100-mile haul from Penn Station to the tip of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the road rise to meet you, may the wind be ever at your
back,'' Pritchett said in a solemn closing benediction. ``And until
we meet again, may the Lord hold you and your bicycles in the palm
of His hand. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most cyclists, Pamela Blumenthal, a lawyer from Washington,
emerged from the blessing feeling refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a lovely service,'' said Ms. Blumenthal, 31.
``I don't think it was a joke at all.'' Asked if the bicycle
blessing made her feel safer on the road now, Ms. Blumenthal
squinted her eyes and paused. ``No. But I feel cared for.''

METS BEAT PHILLIES, 9-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The cat that scampered all the way from right
field into the Mets' dugout during the third inning Saturday night
wasn't black. But it might as well have been.
</P>
<P>
   An awfully ugly spell has befallen the Mets' ace, Al Leiter,
this season, and Saturday night the Mets needed a heroic comeback
against even shabbier pitching from the Phillies to win their third
game in a row, 9-6. With the victory, the Mets (21-15) are a
half-game better than the Yankees, and a half-game behind Atlanta
in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news only temporarily pushes to the background what
surely must be an emerging concern among the Mets. Leiter was 17-6
with a 2.47 earned run average last season, but he has been
strangely ineffective much of this season. Saturday night he gave
up seven hits and six runs in three innings, his shortest
appearance in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got Leiter off the hook because the Phillies left their
starter, Carlton Loewer, in the game even after it was obvious that
he was incapable of holding a 6-0 lead. The Mets got five runs back
in the fourth inning, while reliever Pat Mahomes, called up from
Class AAA Norfolk only Friday, held the Phillies scoreless for two
and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   They tied it in the fifth inning with a Brian McRae solo home
run. But the Mets could have taken the lead when Mahomes, in his
first major league at-bat, hit a double to right-center field. Rey
Ordonez, who had been on first base, ran hard all the way, but a
perfect relay from center fielder Doug Glanville to shortstop Alex
Arias to catcher Mike Lieberthal nailed him as he slid in
headfirst.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally took the lead in the sixth, when reliever Ken
Ryan made the mistake of walking Roger Cedeno, the Mets' leadoff
hitter and superb stealer. Cedeno took an enormous lead off first _
both feet were on the turf _ and stole second on a pitchout. With
an equally huge lead off second, he came around to score when
Edgardo Alfonzo hit a single over the mound and into center field.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud walked on four pitches, and the stage was set for
Mike Piazza to break out of a minifunk. When the count was full,
everyone in the stadium waited for an enormous blast. Instead, with
Alfonzo and Olerud running on the pitch, Piazza hit a liner to
Arias for one out. Arias tossed the ball to second baseman Kevin
Jordan, who stepped on second to get the force on Alfonzo and then
reached over to tag Olerud just two feet away for the simplest
triple play imaginable and the first against the Mets since May 11,
1993, against St. Louis. Piazza ripped off his batting helmet in
disgust and repeatedly slammed it against his thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter contains his angst better. Each time the Phillies hit him
hard, he would turn around on the mound, his face tightened in the
grimace of a man unfortunate enough to watch his own execution.
Leiter has struggled with his consistency all season. But after his
last start, when he gave up a career-high eight runs in seven
innings against Colorado, Manager Bobby Valentine and the pitching
coach Bob Apodaca insisted that Leiter is throwing even better than
he did last year, that he has not been hit hard and that he is
merely the victim of bad luck.

   When the time comes for her trial, the accused murderer Kelly
Blake won't be hauled into court in shackles. Authorities have
overwhelming evidence that Blake cruelly slaughtered two of her own
children and tried to kill a third, and for that, prosecutors would
love to lead her around in irons.
</P>
<P>
   But, they can't.
</P>
<P>
   The manacles would slip off the stumps.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Blake's hands are gone. As are her nose, her eyebrows, her
ears, her lips. Any chains attached to her ankles would have to be
wrapped around the braces she must wear in order to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's much of a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   Walking even a few steps requires assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't do anything on her own,'' says Blake's attorney,
Arthur Gorman. ``The fire destroyed her. She can't eat or dress or
go to the bathroom. Is that not punishment enough?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not for Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, who
recently charged Blake with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``She killed her two children. She attempted to kill her
third,'' Romley told a news conference. ``It is this office's
responsibility to say that children are important.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 20, 1998, Kelly Blake led her three children into a
shed attached to their home on Clarendon Avenue in Phoenix. She
told them it was a game. &QL; 
DESCRIBED AS `DANGER'
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that same month, Blake twice visited a county mental
health clinic, depressed. She was released with a prescription for
relaxants. One of the nurses who saw her wrote that Blake was ``a
danger to herself, children.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was.
</P>
<P>
   She blindfolded the kids, closed them inside the shed, doused it
with gasoline and lit it. Then she poured gas over herself and
stepped into the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Venessa Fausto and 12-year-old Ramon Fausto died.
Blake's 14-year-old son John Fausto escaped with minor injuries.
Kelly was taken to the hospital with third-degree burns over 85
percent of her body.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't die.
</P>
<P>
   The death sentence she'd imposed upon herself was commuted to
life without parole. Kelly Blake lives in solitary confinement,
locked securely within the charred prison cell of her body, from
which there's no escape.
</P>
<P>
   She's already burned herself at the stake. There's no need to
relight the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vindictive prosecution,'' Gorman said. ``They didn't
do anything until after I sued them.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gorman filed a lawsuit against the county and others
on behalf of Blake and her surviving son, claiming the county's
health care system failed them. &QL; 
SERVICES NOT PROVIDED
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't provide the services that would have prevented
this from happening, and now they're going to prosecute her,''
Gorman said. ``Prosecutors say they were waiting for Kelly to be
competent before they filed charges. Well, she had been competent
for months, and they didn't do anything until we sued them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is taking multiple medications. She's at risk for
infection. There may not be a facility in the state's prison system
that could adequately deal with someone in her condition. If
convicted, she could wind up in the same care facility where she
now lives.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, what's the rush?
</P>
<P>
   If, by some miracle, Blake improved and was able to lead a
``normal'' life, charges could be filed. There's no statute of
limitations on murder.
</P>
<P>
   Romley has said of Blake, ``As a parent, you have an obligation
to your children and you will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting this woman doesn't make her accountable, though.
</P>
<P>
   It only makes her a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   And wastes thousands of tax dollars that could be spent putting
other criminals behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about pity, or even mercy.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't about avoiding justice.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't about a killer going scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   Before anybody talks about Kelly Blake ``getting away with
murder,'' they should remember why it is the police can't take her
fingerprints. &QL;

JEFFERSON'S KIN NOT READY TO ACCEPT TIE TO SLAVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ For the first time in nearly 90 years,
descendants of Thomas Jefferson on Saturday welcomed to their
annual family reunion descendants of children who claimed to have
Jefferson as their father and Sally Hemings, one of his slaves, as
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   And for long, sunlit moments late Saturday afternoon, the two
groups lingered together here on the verdant lawns of Monticello,
the plantation home built by slaves where Jefferson, the nation's
third president and author of the Declaration of Independence,
lived for more than 50 years until his death in 1826.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes die hard among Jefferson descendants. For 200
years, oral histories of an illicit relationship have been passed
down by Hemings progeny, and recent genetic research suggests
Jefferson fathered at least one illegitimate child by her. But on
Saturday, the official organization of Jefferson's family said it
was not yet prepared to accept the Hemings line as Jefferson
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about accuracy,'' Robert Gillespie, a
Richmond lawyer who is president of the group, known as the
Monticello Association, told an audience that included Jefferson
and Hemings descendants, and many reporters. ``More evidence is
coming forward, and we invite it. But let's make sure we make the
correct decision, not a quick decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said the association's six-member executive committee
had met privately Saturday morning to discuss the possibility of
allowing Hemings' relatives to join the group, which has among its
privileges the right to be buried with Jefferson in the family
cemetery at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than respond to a groundswell of recent pressure and
publicity generated by Lucian K. Truscott IV, an author and direct
Jefferson descendant who has taken up the cause of the Hemingses,
Gillespie said the association would await further scientific
testing, more oral histories and whatever genealogical evidence
that Hemings' descendants could produce. He said a final decision
through a vote of the association's 700 members could take as long
as a year.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott, whose great grandmother, Mary Walker Randolph, was a
Jefferson granddaughter, called the delay racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this family, the word `genealogy' is a code word for
racism,'' Truscott said. `'But I'm going to make it much, much
harder for them to exclude the Hemings than to let them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie denied that racism had played a role in the executive
committee's decision. ``We have to live with this,' he said. ``Yes,
maybe some people will be disappointed. But many more will be
disappointed if we rush into it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jefferson descendants have been meeting here for the last
86 years, no previous reunion has matched this one for sheer drama.
In November, geneticists supported what Hemings descendants always
contended, that at least one of Hemings' sons, Eston, was probably
fathered by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to convince Truscott that Eston's line, as well
as those of Hemings' two other sons, Thomas C. Woodson and Madison
Hemings, deserved affirmation of their heritage as a true
reflection of Jefferson and his times _ and, perhaps, as a symbolic
step toward healing racial wounds that still exist.
</P>
<P>
   The study actually said that Thomas Woodson was probably not
Jefferson's son. But Truscott said that did not matter to him,
adding that all of the descendants of Sally Hemings deserved to be
accepted as members of the larger Jefferson family.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Truscott invited about 35 Hemings descendants to
the reunion, a weekend that included a reception at Monticello
Saturday evening and the association's annual meeting on Sunday.
Rather than risk any public reproach for appearing indifferent to
Truscott's overture, the association then issued its own invitation
to the Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was clear Saturday that many of the 200 Jefferson
descendants here were unwilling to open their arms _ not to mention
the family cemetery _ to descendants of Jefferson's slave.
</P>
<P>
   After Gillespie greeted all the guests from a podium on the
steps of the main house, Truscott followed with brief remarks in
which he told association members it was time for them `'to do the
right thing, to welcome these good people into our hearts and our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished to rousing cheers from Hemings' descendants but
tepid applause from association members. When a Hemings invited all
the guests to collect on the steps for a family picture, many
association members hung back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this needs to be studied, studied and studied, then it
will be resolved,'' said Frank Walker, an association member who
had declined to join the group at the steps.
</P>
<P>
   Many association members were skittish about discussing the
matter with reporters. Some simply walked away. Others, like
Walker, declined to say how they felt about the possibility they
might be related to descendants of a slave. ``Now is not the time
to be opinionated about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many of the Hemings family members expressed
unbridled joy _ a happiness to be invited, to meet family members
they never knew and to help cast light on an American icon who
owned as many as 80 slaves yet espoused the bedrock democratic
belief that all men are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Shay Banks-Young, 54, a domestic violence adviser from Columbus,
Ohio, who said her great-great-grandmother, Harriet Hemings, was a
daughter of Jefferson's and Hemings', contended that she did not
necessarily expect to be accepted into the Jefferson family this
weekend. Yet she looked upon the invitation as an important symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have experienced so many things based on the racial
attitudes of America all my life,'' she said. ``I sure didn't
expect this to be different. But I'm hopeful more might come of
this, and it will. A mile begins with a single step, and if this is
a part of a beginning, then that's good.''

NO RICE, NO PROBLEM FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Some symbolic gestures need no translation: Kobe
Bryant's dead-cold stare amid a deadly hot shooting streak. J.R.
Reid's crunching clothesline foul of an airborne Scottie Pippen.
The chest-to-ribs bump between Derek Harper and Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   These were the images of a team that let an opportunity slip
away _ that wouldn't let the same opportunity slide by twice.
Images of a team so steeped in confidence, even the loss of their
best shooter would not deter them.
</P>
<P>
   You could have watched the Lakers with the volume off Saturday
and known from the opening tipoff that they were set to eject the
Houston Rockets out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The job they failed to finish two days earlier was completed
without hesitation and no room for doubt, as the Lakers finished
off the Rockets with a 98-88 victory at Compaq Center, earning a
pass to San Antonio for the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finished off the Rockets in Game 4, a bit later than
they had hoped, but no less satisfying at the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to finish it off in Game 3 _ that would have shown a
lot more,'' said Bryant. ``But we did do a good job of coming in
here and putting them away.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it with everything they had and without one thing they
had relied on. Glen Rice was out with a sore right elbow, replaced
at the last minute by Rick Fox in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets never saw a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal brutalized Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Antoine
Carr for 37 points. Bryant scored 24, including a devastating run
of 15 straight from the first to second quarter, celebrating
silently with a few knowing looks to his sister Shaya at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   Reid banged relentlessly at Barkley, disrupting his rhythm just
enough to hold him to 20 points. Bryant, Fox and Robert Horry took
turns slowing up Pippen, and when that wasn't enough, Reid leveled
him with a third-quarter clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   Horry came through for 12 points off the bench, and Harper gave
13.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it looks like when the Lakers get on that ``same
page'' O'Neal is always mumbling about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, we just stressed to the team that in order
for us to be successful, we had to do it as a team, at both ends of
the court,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they had in a six-game winning streak that preceded a
letdown and a Rockets rout in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   They did it on a steady diet of Shaq and Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, frustrated the previous game, was put in motion more
often, preventing the Rockets from pushing him off the low block.
And Bryant simply got back to his aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Game 3, I didn't play well, and I never have two bad games
in a row, and 9 for 22 (shooting) is awful,'' O'Neal said. ``After
the game, Sarge (his father) called me up and let me have it. . . .
Kobe didn't play well in Game 3, and I didn't play well in Game 3,
and neither of us like to have two bad game in a row. So both of
us, we were coming out to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, facing elimination once again, matched the Lakers
blow for blow for most of the first quarter, but the firepower
Pippen and Barkley displayed in combining for 67 points in Game 3
never arrived this time.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bryant's 15-point run was over, the Lakers had a
four-point lead in the second quarter. Houston would never so much
as tie the game again.
</P>
<P>
   A brutally physical Lakers defense made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a closing game, and closing games are not handed to
you by anybody in this league,'' Fox said, ``so we knew we had to
come in and basically take it from them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in every Reid thump against Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at J.R.'s line, he didn't score, he got nine
rebounds. People will say, `My God, the guy stinks,' '' Rambis
said. ``But realistically, I thought he did a very good job doing
what we asked him to do against a future Hall of Fame, a great
basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets made their best charge in the third quarter, slicing
the lead to three points, but the Lakers had an answer for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Houston leaves the playoffs impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat by a better team; I really believe that,'' Barkley
said. ``The Lakers have a better team than we do. Shaq is the most
dominant player the last three or four years. . . . Kobe exploded
today. Scottie, Hakeem and I would have to reach into the past to
match what we had to go against.''
