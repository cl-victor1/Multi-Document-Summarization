<HEADLINE> Central Asia Urged to Improve Children's Living Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Governments of five Central
Asian countries were today urged to take emergency measures
to improve the worsening living conditions of 22 million
children in the region.
</P>
<P>
The call was made to the governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan by experts from those
countries and the United Nations at a conference on implementing
the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which was passed by the United Nations in 1989,
has been signed by about 170 countries.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), in Tajikistan, a country of 5.8 million people, infant
mortality is now at 60 per 1,000 and that at least 2.8 million
children suffer from respiratory and childhood diseases. The
country is now dependent on food aid because its economy has been
devastated by 1992-1993 bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF official at the conference in charge of central,
eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, said
living conditions and children's development is a major issue in
the region, particularly in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the five republics of the former Soviet Union have
faced severe economic problems in the sweeping social changes
since the collapse of the bloc in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The official promised that UNICEF will work closely with
governments in the region to solve the problems facing children.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has set up its first orphan village with the
financial support or donations from the government and
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discuss the health situation of women and
children and children's education in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
In March, the U.N. body appealed to the international community
for 5.6 million U.S. dollars for nutrition, education and clean
water programs for women and children in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The social safety net in the republic collapsed along with the
Soviet Union and the subsequent bloody civil war in 1992-1993
devastated its already stumbling economy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Theorists Urged To Get In Touch With Real Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 1 (Xinhua) -- China's theorist workers have
been urged to plunge into the reality of life and go among the
masses of people to help find scientific answers to people's real
questions.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and President of Party School of the CPC
Central Committee, who told a group at a national party school
conference on scientific research on Thursday that theoreticians
should make a systematic and comprehensive study of the changing
political, economic, cultural, and social situation.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to focus research work on both theoretical and
pragmatic issues deriving from China's reforms and opening to the
outside world, and the modernization drive, and to take a look at
the country's pattern of economic, political, and cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Hu emphasized that socialist ethical and cultural progress must
adhere to Maxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong thought, and to Deng
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics for guidance, and that Deng's theory must be
studied more and be put to use.
</P>
<P>
He said that study, research, and publicity of party and
leaders' theories are three important component parts of the
party's theoretical work and that improving theoretical researches
is the basis of improved study and wider application of theories.
</P>
<P>
The conference's purpose was the study and implementation of
documents adopted at the Six Plenum of the 14th CPC Central
Committee, reviewing of the work over the past few years and
mapping out of the party schools' scientific research agenda for
the next several years.

<HEADLINE> African Force Proposal Needs Study: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries want
more time to consult and discusss an American proposal to create
a pan-African force to react to conflicts on the continent,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwe National News Agency reports today, he
told Zimbabwean journalists in Ouagadougou yesterday that most
countries supported the proposal in principle provided the army
units would not be independent of existing defence forces.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who met George Moose, United States Assistant
Secretary of State for African Affairs, in Ouagadougou, said he
hoped the idea would be discussed further within the context of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on
politics, defence and security, which he chaired.
</P>
<P>
SADC Chairman and South African President Nelson Mandela
agreed that ''what was required was to find time to discuss it in
our forum of (the SADC) organ on politics, defence and
security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the proposed force should be part of the existing
armies and did not operate as an independent unit, as this would
create operational problems.
</P>
<P>
''The majority of the countries have accepted the idea in
principle, but the modalities need to be worked out. We are all
agreed that as long as the units are part of our armies, there is
nothing to worry. If they are going to be independent... then we
are going to have problems,'' mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
There were also different opinions on how such a force would
be deployed.
</P>
<P>
The American proposal called for the creation of a 10,000
strong inter-African force to intervene in any conflict on the
continent, with finance from developed nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Organisation of African Unity and some african
leaders have reacted cautiously to the idea, insisting that the
proposals should come from Africans themselves rather than from
outside the continent. enditem

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Remains 5.2 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
U.S. held unchanged at 5.2 percent in October as businesses
resumed adding workers to their payrolls, U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was very close to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent reached in
August. The rate in September inched up to 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said that payroll jobs climbed a strong 210,000
last month, led by the biggest increase in service sector jobs in
five months. In September, payroll jobs had actually declined by
35,000.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 119,000 jobs were created in service
industries led by an increase of 62,000 jobs at retail stores.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment was up only by 6,000 in October
following a big decline of 59,000 jobs in September. Job losses
continued in motor vehicles and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Employment in construction increased by 10,000 in October,
representing a slowdown from the first half of the year when
monthly gains averaged 29,000.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1994, the jobless rate in the U.S. has been below 6
percent, a period of time not seen since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department also reported that American workers'
average hourly earnings, which are closely watched for any signs
of wage pressures, showed no change at all in October.
</P>
<P>
Today's unemployment report was the last major economic
indicator to be released before the U.S. presidential election on
November 5.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole on Wednesday had
seized on a sharp slowdown in overall economic growth in the
July-September quarter to warn that the U.S. economy is not
performing as well as President Clinton claims and contend that a
recession could well be looming.
</P>
<P>
But the combination of the unemployment rate and inflation is
at its lowest level in 27 years, a fact President Clinton often
boosts as his achievements in the past four years and cites as the
centerpiece of his re-election effort.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition Wins Moral High Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) - Britain's Opposition has taken a
clear lead over the Conservatives in the new battle for the moral
high ground in politics sparked by Frances Lawrence, wife of the
murdered London headmaster, according to a Mori poll for The
Times.
</P>
<P>
By a margin of more than 2 to 1, voters chose Labor over the
Conservatives as the party most likely to tackle violence and
promote good citizenship as proposed by Mrs Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
The Mori survey had listed Mrs Lawrence's ideas for a ban on
the sale of combat knives, lessons in school on good citizenship
and raising the public standing of teachers and the police.
</P>
<P>
Last week Prime Minister John Major warned the Labor leader
against "cloaking himself in righteousness", but the Mori poll
published today finds that Labor is preferred to the Tories by 45
to 20 percent, with 8 percent naming the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
The findings came after Michael Howard, the Home Secretary,
yesterday agreed to meet opposition parties for talks on how to
ban combat knives.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister told the Commons that following the Labor
and Liberal Democrat spokesmen's joint letter to the Home
Secretary earlier this week, there would be a meeting in the
"near future" between Michael Howard, Jack Straw and Alex Carlile.
</P>
<P>
But Major also emphasised his view that Straw had accepted it
was not an easy matter to come up with a workable definition of a
combat knife.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Straw and Carlile, the Home Secretary said the
approach taken by them had "important deficiencies". But he added:
"I am certainly prepared to discuss this approach with you.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers and ruling party officials said that the
survey's findings had borne out their fears. One official said:
"We cannot beat Blair on morality. From now on it will be the
economy, the economy and the economy."

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Escapes Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 1 (Xinhua) - Liberia's chief warlord Charles
Taylor survived an assassination attempt on Thursday when gunmen
ambushed him inside the presidential palace, said a report
reaching here from Monrovia today.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's senior aide was killed in the attack by gunmen who
forced their way into the presidential palace in jeeps, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Panic gripped the capital Monrovia which is still recovering
from devastating ethnic warfare in April and May.
</P>
<P>
West African peacekeepers attempting to end nearly seven years
of civil war in Liberia quickly moved in with tanks and deployed
across the city's commercial district after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 10 people died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who started Liberia's civil war in 1989, but is now a
member of the interim ruling council, said in a broadcast on his
radio: ``As i entered the sixth floor of the executive mansion i
came under a hail of fire in which my senior aide-de-camp Jackson
Manley and my ECOMOG aide-de-camp and several of my senior staff
were wounded.''
</P>
<P>
But he did not say who could have carried out the attack.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Taylor's forces led the attempts to arrest ethnic
Krahn warlord Roosevelt Johnson, his rival. The ensuing all-out
fighting devasted the capital and derailed a delicate regional
accord on ending the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a witness, who was near the executive
mansion, as saying that the unidentified attackers overran a
checkpoint at the entrance to the mansion, which is guarded by
troops of the Nigerian-led the West African Peacekeeping Force,
ECOMOG, stationed in Liberia, said the report quoting a witness
who was near the executive mansion.
</P>
<P>
" Shops, businesses, markets and schools closed hurriedly and
traffic came to a halt. People are running for shelter, some with
their belongings," witnessess said.
</P>
<P>
At least two wounded were taken to the nearby Barclay Training
Centre (BTC) army barracks. BTC was the bastion of ethnic Krahn
guerrillas at the heart of militia warfare occurred in the
capital six months ago.
</P>
<P>
The attack happened only three days after the ECOMOG began to
deploy across the country to start disarming guerrillas under a
new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The warfare in April and May blew off course a 1995 accord
which was believed to be the most promising, because all the main
faction leaders signed it and were given jobs. A dozen earlier
agreements failed to end fighting which has killed more than
150,000 people and devastated the economy and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who has declared to run for president next May, said
he did not expect the attack to affect the latest peace accord
signed last August setting a new disarmemnt timetable and
elections for next May.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Top Peace Negotiator Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's chief negotiator in
talks with the Palestinians on civilian affairs was removed today
for meeting secretely with opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The decision to remove Oren Shahor from his position pending
investigation was made by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai at today's weekly cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the cabinet session said Shahor, an
army major general, would remain on the post as coordinating
officer in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu refused to accept Shahor's explanations for his
secret meetings with former prime minister and opposition Labor
leader Shimon Peres and former cabinet minister Yossi Beilin. The
meetings were exposed by the local media a day ago.
</P>
<P>
Shahor was appointed to the negotiating team by the late
Labor premier Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
He described his meetings with Peres and Beilin as strictly
personal and private, and totally unrelated to the ongoing
negotiations held with the Palestinians on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Shahor also dismissed the idea that the
general was trying to hide these meetings from the current
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres strongly rejected the government's attacks on
Shahor as a "witch-hunt" campaign. He told Israel Radio that, if
any disciplinary action was taken against Shahor, it would be
"scandalous."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there used to be meetings between army
officers and the opposition figures during his government service
when Netanyahu's Likud Party was in the opposition. He added
that, if he really wanted to be briefed on the peace talks, he
would have called directly the prime minister or defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid strongly criticized the government's
move against Shahor, saying it was aimed at scaring the army
officers and other government officials for meeting with
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
Beilin also blast the Likud government for taking the action.
</P>
<P>
"I want to understand what is wrong with the meetings. ... We
simply talk with these people and will talk with them in the
future, unless a regime comes to power here which forbids such
talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Netanyahu government appears to
be sensitive to the active role being played by Peres, a chief
architect of the Israeli-Arab peace process now stalled by the
Likud's hardline policies, in the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Peres has repeatedly attacked the government for dragging on
</P>
<P>
the peace talks and creating crises threatening to derail the
whole process.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Weapons Ban Set to Go Into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A historic convention
banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of
chemical weapons will enter into force on April 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hungary ratified the convention on Thursday, and became the
65th country doing so. As required by the Chemical Weapons
Convention, 65 countries have to ratify it before it can go into
force. It enters into force 180 days after receipt by the United
Nations of the 65th ratification.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after receiving Hungary's ratification, U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: "The world has taken
a significant step toward the complete eradication of chemical
weapons. The United Nations welcomes the efforts of Member States
to outlaw the barbaric and indiscriminate horror of chemical
warfare."
</P>
<P>
The convention, which is of unlimited duration, has so far been
signed by 160 countries including all five permanent members of
the Security Council -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China
and France.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Boutros-Ghali urged all states that had not
yet ratified the accord, "and particularly those with
significant chemical weapons stockpiles, to join those that have
already done so, and to give all full meaning to this historic
agreement."

BELGRADE, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav customs officers
discovered 373 kilograms of heroin Friday in a truck with
Bulgarian license plate at the border crossing on the
Yugoslav-Bulgarian border.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was found early in the morning when the truck was
trying to pass the checkpoint into Yugoslavia. It could sell for
more than 30 million U.S. dollars on the black market, the
Yugoslav Customs Administration said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Customs Administration Director Mihalj Kertes told
reporters the drugs were hidden in a separate container concealed
in the truck. The vehicle was driven by a Bulgarian citizen,
</P>
<P>
Kertes said the customs officers at Gradina checkpoint had
again shown they were very successful in detecting smuggled
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Friday's successful action is unprecedented in the world as
such a large quantity of narcotics has never been found even by
countries which have much larger and technically better equipped

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 1 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
and the South African National Editors' Forum today agreed to
meet every three months to improve communication between the
government and the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting the Forum in Pretoria,
Mandela said: "There has been a legitimate complaint about the
absence of communication from the government to the mass media."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said during the meeting the Forum had raised concerns
about the application of the criminal procedures act section 205,
which allowed attorneys-general to subpoena journalists for
information.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had sympathy with the media's difficulties
with the law, and the matter should be further discussed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Forum Chairman Thami Mazwai said the regular
meetings with the president would concern issues bedevilling
relations between the media and the government.
</P>
<P>
Mazwai said: "We are not going to abdicate our responsibility
to our readers to tell them what the government is doing in an
objective manner as possible."
</P>
<P>
He also said the forum had received assurances from the
president that the government had no intention of interfering
with the independence of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 21st anniversary celebrations of the Cape Town
Press Club on October 31, Mandela spoke highly of the
contributions by the mass media, saying it was not merely a
watchdog, but an active participant in building South Africa's
young democracy. enditem

MAPUTO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A feasibility study was

of gas pipelines and the building of an ironworks in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the joint study was signed this afternoon by

After the signing ceremony, Minister of Minerals and Energy of
Mozambique John Kachamila said that it will be clear in six or
eight months whether the production scheme can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, Temane Gasfield would be able to produce 100
million cubic feet of gas, which in turn would be transmitted
through 450 kilometers of pipelines to the planned ironworks in
Manica Province.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the ironworks would be built near
the Mozambican-Zimbabwean border because Zimbabwe, which is rich

<HEADLINE> China Sees Better Atmosphere at WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
on Friday spoke of a better atmosphere at the negotiations on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) resumed here
this week.
</P>
<P>
"I've got the impression that our negotiating partners are
becoming more realist and pragmatic at the talks. They are more
interested in trying to find a solution instead of making more
difficulties," Chinese assistant trade minister Long Yongtu told
Xinhua after a formal meeting of the WTO Working Party on China on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trade analysts here said that the "climate change" is mainly
due to a change of attitude on the part of Washington which
indicated recently that it is willing to speed up China's
accession process.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, China has conducted bilateral talks with
the United States and Canada on market access and the draft
accession protocol.
</P>
<P>
At the Working Party's informal meetings on Wednesday and
Thursday as well as the formal session on Friday, about 20 WTO
members discussed the six annexes to the draft protocol submitted
by China which present detailed descriptions of China's foreign
trade regime and contain some new offers of China.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions, though still different from time to time, but
the tone, the approach and the atmosphere have been changed," Long
said in a statement to the Friday meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Chinese government had made the decision
to undertake the principle of standstill, which means that China
will not promulgate new laws and policies inconsistent with the
WTO rules during the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Next week will see a series of bilateral talks between China
and about 10 WTO members, including the European Union, Australia
and Brazil. The next round of talks are expected to be held in
late February.

LUSAKA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Six leaders of the Zambian
biggest opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) were
acquitted here today by Lusaka High Court.
</P>

Judge Peter Chitengi said the prosecution has failed to
convince the court that there is reason to try these people.
Chitengi therefore dismissed the charges against them.

A total of eight UNIP leaders including its deputy chief
Inyambo Yeta were arrested last June after several bomb blasts
rocked the country. They were charged with involvement in the
blasts and being behind a secret group called "Black Mamba",
which was inciting violence against the new constitution.

The bombings took place at the time when President Frederick

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Arrests Many Following Attack on Taylor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force operating in Liberia known as ECOMOG has arrested a number
of persons, including militiamen, in connection with Thursday's
attack on the country's factional leader Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander, Nigeria's Major General Victor Malu, said
today that those arrested are mainly figures of factions under
the warlords of George Boley and Roosevolt Johnson, who were
accused by Taylor of being the mastermind behind the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
But both Boley and Johnson have denied responsibility for the
attack, which claimed the lives of Taylor's aid-de-camp and three
bodyguards and wounded several others on the sixth floor of the
eight-storey executive mansion housing Liberia's six-member
Ruling Council of State.
</P>
<P>
"An attack on any member of the council of state is an attack
on the entire council. I know nothing about it... We are not a
party to it," said Boley in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, quoted
by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Boley, the attack on Taylor is "not related" to
the factional clashes between his Liberia Peace Council (LPC) and
Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in the
southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the report quoted Malu as saying that he was "pointing the
finger at the LPC in the sense that only Taylor and Boley have
offices on the sixth floor of the executive mansion."
</P>
<P>
When the firing subsided and ecomog soldiers gained access to
the floor, "we found quite a number of weapons and ammunition in
Boley's office," Malu said, adding that some fighters from
Taylor's NPFL are also being investigated.
</P>
<P>
However, Malu said he does not believe that NPFL is involved,
"otherwise Taylor would have been a dead man by now" without the
protection the NPFL militia provided him.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast following the shooting Thursday morning,
Taylor, who escaped "unharmed", described the attack as "a
blatant act of murder" but called on his fighters "to remain
calm, disengaged and demobilized".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commercial activities in Monrovia, which stopped
after the firing, returned to normal today, with government
offices, schools, banks, supermarkets, shops and marketplaces
resuming operations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the shooting Thursday, Malu increased the night
time curfew in Monrovia by three hours, from 7:00 in the evening
to 6:00 in the morning (19:00 to 06:00 GMT) "until further
notice".  enditem

from the Palestinian self-rule areas on an official visit to

</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters upon his arrival at the Amman

account of Jordan's key role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said he would discuss with Jordanian King Hussein, Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti and other senior officials on the
regional situation as well as the Jordan-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
Among the expected topics in his discussions with Jordanian
leaders is Russia's role in the stalled regional peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's regional tour, which has already taken him to
Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas, is aimed at reviving the role of Russia in the deadlocked
peace march.
</P>
<P>
Russia acted as a co-sponsor along with the United States of
the Middle East peace process launched at the Madrid conference
in 1991.
</P>

Local officials said that Jordan welcomes Russia, largely
overshadowed by the United States since the collapse of the
former Soviet Union in 1991, to reassume its responsibilities as
co-sponsor.

</P>
<P>
The amendment to three articles of the constitution has
empowered the president to appoint the chairman of the Police and
Prison Services Council in consultation with the ruling Council
of State.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ghanaian capital Accra said today that the
amendment has also authorized the president to chair the Armed

The arguments culminated in a physical assault on the

<HEADLINE> Gabon Condemns Territorial Claim by Rwanda on Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Gabonese President Omar Bongo
said here today that the territorial claim by Rwanda on Zaire is
very dangerous and that it proves Rwanda's ambition to annex
Zairean territory.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that Rwanda has the inclination of annexation on
Zaire," said Bongo on Radio France Internationale, referring to
Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu's claim Thursday that the land
of Banyamulenges in eastern Zaire used to belong to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac today met with Bongo and
President Paul Biya of Cameroon, both of them on a private visit
here, to discuss the situation in Zaire and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Bongo said that Rwanda is trying to take advantage of the
absence of (Zairean) President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is now under
medical treatment in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"If President Mobutu was in Zaire, things would not be like
this today," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Gabonese president said that the principle of intangibility
of the frontiers of African states inherited from colonial times,
which is inscribed in the charter of the Organization of African
Unity, is "sacred."
</P>
<P>
With a map on the wall, the Rwandan president said Thursday at
a press conference in Kigali that the land of Banyamulenges in
eastern Zaire used to be Rwandan territory.
</P>
<P>
The Banyamulenges, an ethnic Tutsi people who are originally
from Rwanda but have long settled in Zaire, have been fighting
Zairean government troops in eastern Zaire for more than two
months.

<P>
LONDON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ireland, the current European
Union (EU) presidency state, announced in Dublin today that EU
ministers would meet in Brussels next Thursday to discuss
emergency humanitarian support for more than a million refugees
caught in the fight in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Joan Burton, a minister of the Irish Foreign Ministry, said in
a statement that the Irish government called the emergency meeting
at the request of the Belgian government, according to reports
from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"A coordinated and effective response by the union and its
member states is vital as several hundred thousand civilians are
in grave danger of death, injury, or illness from either violence
or lack of food and shelter," Burton said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister stressed that the meeting was an "essential
complement to the ongoing political efforts to bring about a
cease-fire and to establish stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
The EU member states have been asked to provide details of
actions to help alleviate the crisis and the EU Commission was to
report to the meeting on its assessment of the humanitarian
situation and its plans for a response.

<HEADLINE> Aid Workers Flee Zaire, Leaving Refugees Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 international relief
workers fled war-torn eastern Zaire for neighboring Rwanda today,
leaving about 1.1 million refugees to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
The pullout from the border city of Goma indicated the
effective collapse of international efforts to feed refugees who
had taken refuge in Zaire from ethnic conflicts in Rwanda and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Quintaglie, one of the evacuated aid workers from the
Rome-based World Food Program (WFP), was quoted by Reuters as
saying, "We have left behind us hundreds of thousands of
refugees. They have absolutely nobody to feed them."
</P>
<P>
The aid workers had been trapped in fighting between Zairean
government troops and ethnic Tutsi Banyamalenge rebels since
Tuesday. They managed to escape from Goma across the border to
the Rwandan town of Gisenyi during a lull in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Rowe, WFP spokesman in the organization's Rome
headquarters said they were very relieved that the aid workers had
managed to cross the border to safety.
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time, we are greatly saddened because we leave
behind a humanitarian crisis, with almost a million people in need
of help," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goma is the headquarters of the world's biggest relief
operation since 1994. The world's biggest refugee camp, Mugunga,
which lies west of Goma on the shores of Lake Kivu, was originally
built to hold 160,000, but is now crammed with half a million
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have come from other camps in the area which had
to be abandoned after battles between Zairean government forces
and the Banyamalenge rebels, backed by Rwanda's Tutsi army.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said that the organization's aid workers had managed to
leave behind some foodstocks so that many people had a week of
minimum food rations.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge for the international community now is how it
intends to feed those left behind," Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the agency is already drawing up contingency plans to
save the refugees despite the enormous transportation difficulties
created by the rough terrain and the peak of the rainy season.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A European Union Troika
delegation led by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton will soon
arrive in the Middle East in a bid to push forward the peace
process, according to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital
of Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the delegation falls in the framework of the
intensive diplomatic efforts the European Union (EU) is
conducting after the recent visit to the region by French
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The EU is seeking a greater and more effective role in the
peace process due to its strategic, security and economic
interests in the Middle East, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the European Union Troika delegation, which
consists of officials from Italy, Holland and Ireland, will be
warmly welcomed by the Arab states, which want a more active EU
role in the peace process to achieve balance against the
Israel-biased U.S. role, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab states welcomed the European Commission's (EC)
nomination of Spanish ambassador to Israel Michael Angel
Moratinus as a special envoy to the Middle East region at a time
when the peace process is facing a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The EC actively backs the peace process and has offered
aids and grants to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which is against any EU role in the peace process, is
expected to have strong reservations about the visit of the troika
delegation to the region, especially to the Orient House, the
semi-official PNA headquarters in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli sources hinted that in case the European
delegation insists on meeting Palestinian leaders in the Orient
House, Israel might refuse to receive the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to discuss with leaders of the
regional countries the Arab-Israeli peace process, especially the
Palestinian-Israeli track.

PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia beat
Petr Korda 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to enter the final of the Paris Open
tennis tournament here on Saturday.

<P>
Kafelnikov, the French Open champion, conceded the first set

Kafelnikov and Korda both played baseline tennis in the
semi-final match. But injuries have slowed Korda over the past

After the 4-4 draw, Kafelnikov took five straight games to take
second set at 6-4 and go up 3-0 in the third set.

At that time, Korda could no longer stop Kafelnikov from making

<HEADLINE> Tutsi Rebels Gain Upper Hand in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tutsi rebels are gaining the
upper hand in eastern Zaire, as the Zairean government on Friday
admitted the fall of the border town of Goma to the Rwandan-backed
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Goma was the Zairean army's main base in the east of
Zaire. Journalists and other sources say the towns of Bukavu and
Uvira, where the rebel offensive began two weeks ago, are also in
rebel hands, although the Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo
denied this.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels seemed to have pushed the majority of
Zairean soldiers out of Goma, but fierce street battles continued
in the city as some Zaireans were holed up in buildings fighting
rebels and troops from Tutsi-led neighbor Rwanda, reports said.
</P>
<P>
A photographer from Agence France Presse (AFP) said he saw two
civilians firing rockets with rocket launchers on their shoulders
toward the Rwandan border, which is 300 meters from central Goma.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the streets of Goma were completely deserted this
morning after 108 international humanitarian aid workers and some
foreign journalists fled under heavy bombardment to the
neighboring Rwandan city of Gisenyi, only three kilometers from
Goma.
</P>
<P>
An agency reporter saw an Italian humanitarian worker crying
after being evacuated to the Rwandan side of border. The aid
worker, a woman in her 20s who works for a non-governmental
humanitarian organization, said she could not bear to think that
one million refugees had been left behind.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that these Rwandan and Burundi refugees, mostly Hutus,
have been left to a "totally uncontrollable situation" after the
humanitarian groups left today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
World Food Program said today they could no longer contact the
refugee camps in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has warned that a humanitarian disaster worse than
the one in 1994 in Rwanda could break out soon. More than 50,000
Hutu refugees died of epidemic diseases in the summer of 1994
after fleeing Rwanda, in the wake of a genocide against the Tutsis
in which at least half a million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the health of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko,
who is having treatment for prostate cancer in Switzerland, is
reportedly deteriorating, leaving the political future of Zaire
under a cloud of uncertainty.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Aemerican Eddy Gragus, who
won the prologue stage on Friday, finished second in the
84-kilometer circuit-race first stage on Saturday. But that did
not stop him from maintaining the overall lead in the on-going
Kent Tour of China cycle race.
</P>
<P>
Gragus' fellow countryman John Peters won today's stage in one
hour 40 minutes and 31 seconds and another American Robbie Ventura
was third, all in an identical time.
</P>
<P>
The fourth and fifth finishers today were Nico Renders from
Belgium and Alessandro Calzolari from Russia.
</P>
<P>
But today witnessed the first major accident of the race, with
chain-action crashes in the 25th of the 28 laps set for the stage.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xuezhong of China's Kent team crashed onto a rider in
front of him, whose bike halted suddenly after the tyre broke.
Tang was also hit by a following bike and the rider on it.
</P>
<P>
Badly injured, Tang was rushed to a nearby hospital for
treatment. He remained in the hospital ward tonight.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, the only one who failed to finish the race today,
would most probably have to quit the race, according to the team
officials.
</P>
<P>
Tang, a climbing specialist, was the Chinese team's hope,
especially for the difficult 201-kilometer third stage from the
Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen suburbs to Baiyun Mountain
North of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The fastest Asian rider was Kazakhstan's Andrey Kivilev, who
finished sixth in the 28-lap stage.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Hung Chung Yam and Wong Kam Po were 27th and 66th
today. But Wong was 62nd on the overall rankings.
</P>
<P>
The race moves across the border on Sunday to Shenzhen for the
second stage, a 69-kilometer trip from the Mission Hills Golf Club
in the city suburb to the Guangming Farm.
</P>
<P>
The Tour of China has a prologue and seven stages, with a total
distance of 667.5 kilometers. The Tour ends on November 10 in the
seventh stage in a Shanghai suburb.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Rejects Japanese Demand Over Tokto Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has rejected the
recent Japanese call for a halt to the construction of a
wharf on Tokto Island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan).
</P>
<P>
"Tokto is an inherent territory of the Republic of Korea
either historically or under international law," a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said here last night.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the wharf on the islet is an act of
exercising South Korea's due sovereignty over its inherent
territory, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The South Korean government will continue to deal firmly with
any undue Japanese demand with regard to Tokto Island in the
future. We will naturally carry on the exercise of our sovereignty
over the islet," he added.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, the Japanese Foreign Ministry asked that South
Korea suspend the construction of the wharf on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Tokyo territory dispute erupted last February when
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that Tokto, called
Takeshima in Japanese, is part of Japanese territory, triggering
angry response from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement that it will
build a wharf on Tokto Island, an outcropping rock in the East
Sea about midway between South Korea and Japan. The rocky islet
has an area of 0.186 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Economy Deteriorating Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian economy
continues deteriorating due to the continued closure imposed by
Israel, according to a U.N. report today.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) in the Palestinian
territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip declined nearly 20
percent between 1992 and 1996, said the report issued by Terje
Larsen, the U.N. special coordinator in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average unemployment rose from under 10
percent to the current rate of 30 percent because a large number
of Palestinian workers were barred from entering Israel to seek
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The real wage of the Palestinians has fallen about 20 percent
since 1995. The consumption declined about 10 percent due to the
rising unemployment and lower wages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the closure imposed by Israel played a
large part in the deterioration of the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Under the excuse of security needs, Israel has imposed a
protracted military closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas,
allowing entry of only a limited number of workers.
</P>
<P>
From February this year when a wave of suicide bombing
attacks by Islamic extremists, Israel has tightened the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new Likud government, which took power in June,
began easing the closure by allowing in about 34,000 Palestinian
workers, but this was still fewer than the pre-closure number of
60,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the full closure was reimposed last month in a bid
to prevent infiltration of suicide bombers from the militant
Islamic group Jihad, which reportedly attempted to mark the
anniversary of the alleged murder of its leader Fathi Shkaki by
Israeli agents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The economic deterioration has fueled anger among the
Palestinians, who are already upset by Likud's hardline
policies, and is widely believed as one of the major reasons
leading to the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed late September that
killed over 70 people.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Hebron Deal to Be Signed in Cairo (by Wang Yukui (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel Radio reported today
that the unannounced target date and place for signing an
agreement on the Israeli army redeployment in Hebron are
respectively November 12 and Cairo, capital of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U.S. diplomatic sources as saying that the
signing of the agreement would take place in Cairo, when a
regional economic conference is underway.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will head the U.S. delegation to mark the signing
of the accord between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their hope that the accord would help
resume the expansion of economic ties between Arab countries
and Israel, which have been halted since the establishment of
the new Israeli government last July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross,
who returned to the states last Monday after spending four weeks
here in a direct involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, is likely to rejoin the talks next week.
</P>
<P>
After four weeks of continuous talks, Israel and the
Palestinians failed to reach an agreement on the Israeli
army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron,
particularly in terms of security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Friday that
Ross was in touch with both the Israelis and Palestinians,
and he plans to call Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk held an unscheduled meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu Friday after the cabinet's weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
No announcement was made after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, who also took part in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on Hebron, said earlier this week that he
expected an agreement to be reached soon after Arafat returns
from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Arafat returned to Gaza Friday after a four-day tour of
Europe, which took him to Norway, Ireland and Spain, in an
effort to seek supports from the European countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army was originally
supposed to have complete its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28 and pulled back from approximately 80 percent of the town.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
determined to complete the process of privatization of the
state-owned enterprises in the public interest, Finance Minister
S.A.M.S. Kibria stated here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day workshop on "reform in state-owned
enterprises and privatization", the minister said that the country
cannot continue to bear the burden of the state-owned enterprises
incurring a loss of 20 billion taka (about 465 million US dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his ministry was receiving requests for fund from
the revenue budget for the state-owned enterprises almost
everyday.
</P>
<P>
"If the fund is stopped, the state-owned enterprises would face
closure," he added, stressing the need for efficient management of
the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will follow a balanced and pragmatic policy in
privatization of the state-owned enterprises as it believes in
transparency and accountability, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel last February and March which left over 60 people
dead and more than 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the previous Israeli government announced that
the army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after
the May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterwards that he would leave the decision of
the redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 40 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike,
and tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram
al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 150,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu had said that he
would like Hebron to be part of the final status
arrangements with the Palestinians; but, at the same time, he
also said he would stand by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israel and the Palestinians started a
new round of continuous talks on the Israeli army's
redeployment in Hebron, which had already been delayed for
more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements agreed to under the Oslo accords, in light of
the violent confrontations between Israel and Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
During the September confrontations, triggered by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more
than 70 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
After the confrontations, which had included exchanges of
fires between Israeli troops and the Palestinian police,
U.S. President Bill Clinton called for an emergency summit in
Washington to resuscitate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock talks, in an attempt
to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of Ross and other US officials, Israel and the
Palestinians failed to complete a deal on the Hebron
redeployment.

<P>
JAKARTA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The current danger status of
Indonesia's most active volcano, Mountain Merapi in Java, will be
retained as the volcano is still spewing hot clouds and ashes in
the last two days, Antara news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Following the upgrading of the danger status of Mt. Merapi from
the "alert" to "preparedness" level on Thursday evening, the
spewing of hot clouds and ashes had dwindled in stages, Antara
quoted volcanology director Wimpy S. Tjetjep as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the danger status would be retained for the moment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On late Thursday, Volcanologists advised residents living
around Mt. Merapi to prepare for an explosion and leave their
homes immediately.
</P>
<P>
Tjetjep said some 500 residents in the designated danger zone
near the volcano had moved to shelter about three km away.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi's activity could develop with an eruption, though it
is still difficult to predict when such an explosion would occur,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi volcano last erupted on November 22, 1994, killing
at least 69 people, injuring more than 100 others and causing
widespread property damage.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has the highest density of volcanoes in the world.

<HEADLINE> New World of Pre-Marriage Property Agreements in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- With China's reforms and
opening to the outside world, the living standards of the citizens
of China's largest city is on the upsurge, but so is the divorce
rates, which has been increasing over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
An unusual parallel development, for those who have saved some
money and bought fixed assets, is the fact that pre-marriage
property agreements have also appeared in Shanghai, which is the
leading industrial and financial center.
</P>
<P>
The pre-marriage property agreement caters to the needs of the
more open-minded and pragmatic, who can reach an agreement or get
notarization before getting married in order to avoid possible
property losses in case they suffer the misfortune of divorce.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the Shanghai Notarization Administration show
that the number of instances of pre-marriage property notarization
in the first half of the year was doubled last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
An administration official says that the pre-marriage property
agreement, which is popular in the developed countries, began to
be accepted by the well-to-do residents in Shanghai a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Evidence indicates, he said, that the pre-marriage agreement
does not seem to interfere with the quality of a marriage and is
simply dealing with husband and wife relationships in a new
situation.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that marriage and household property laws that
existed did not completely meet various needs of Shanghai's
citizens, and that the notarization is a complementary form for
handling marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
The pre-marriage property notarization indicates the people's
growing awareness of the law and that it is conducive to
maintaining harmony between couples and social stability, and they
predict that the notarizations will become increasingly popular in
the city in coming years, according to these experts.

<HEADLINE> 141 Tanzania's Parastatals Privatised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 141
parastatal companies have so far been privatised in Tanzania
since the introduction of the privatisation program in the
country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters here yesterday, Vuyo Owagi, the Public
Relations Officer at the Parastatal Sector Reform Comission
(PSRC), said out of the 141 parastaals, 22 had been acquired by
indigenous investors while 25 became joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Despelling fears that the program has been hijacked by foreign
investors, Owagi said there is a remarkable growth of the
Tanzanian economy, following the introduction of the
privatisation program as compared to the previous centralized
economy.
</P>
<P>
She said that for instance, the Tanzania Cigarette Company at
the present is the largest single investment project since
independence with its new investment reaching 55 million
U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company and two others, namely the Tanzania Breweries
Ltd.(TBL), and Tanga Cement Company were so far the three leading
divestitures in the country, earning the Treasury a total of
91.03 million Tanzania Shilliongs (about 152,000 U.S.
Dollars),Owagi added.
</P>
<P>
With TBL alone, the PSRC has been able to pay to the Treasury
2 billion T.Shs. (about 3.3 million U.S. Dollars) in the form of
dividends in 1995, an amount which had never been realised for
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Owagi told that the PSRC does not have the retraining and
redeployment program for the retrenched workers, but it is paying
them the staturoy terminal benefits as required by the law.

<P>
-- British Telecom is in talks over MCI Communications
Corporation, the second largest long distance telephone company in

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Currency Liberalization Gains Momentum in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The decision taken by the
Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Wednesday to ease controls on
foreign currency deposits has won applause from local bankers
and gained momentum in Jordan's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The moves were aimed at slashing foreign currency deposits
from 35 percent to 14 percent, easing restrictions on investing
those deposits and removing limits on foreign currency deposits
held by Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Previously, 35 percent of the total 3.4 billion dollars of
the foreign currency deposits in Jordanian banks were used to
be a mandatory fund to bolster the kingdom's hard-currency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
They also gave banks greater control over their short term
cash flow by introducing a degree of flexibility in the
amounts they are required to place every day with the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank ruling allowed money in foreign currency
deposits to be invested in a wide range of financial
instruments, including margin trading and swaps, while banks were
only allowed to redeposit in dollar accounts in the past.
</P>
<P>
The currency liberalization measures, the first of its kind
since an economic crisis in 1988 when the kingdom imposed
restrictions on foreign currency dealings after finding itself
strained under 8.3 billion dollars in foreign debts accumulated
in the 1980s, has freed up to hundreds of millions of dollars
for investment.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the CBJ was quoted by today's English
daily Jordan Times as saying that the state treasury decided to
free up to 800 million dollars in its 21 commercial banks' funds,
deposited with the CBJ in the past eight years, for more
profitable investment.
</P>
<P>
Local bankers praised the CBJ decision as a major stride
towards financial deregulation, saying that the general lifting of
regulations could prepare Jordan for a more sophisticated money
market.
</P>
<P>
Although the moves are mainly targeted at improving the
climate for dollar investment, they could also boost confidence
in Jordan's dinar, bankers say.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the country's foreign currency
reserves now stand at 600 million dollars, and inflation was
brought down in eight years by 12 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also boasts an annual growth rate of 6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) since 1993, a reduced budget deficit of 4
percent of GDP compared with 19 percent in 1990 and an
unemployment rate of 15 percent of the work force, compared with
25 percent six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Fayez Abul Inein, the general manager of the Bank of Jordan,
described the new CBJ directives as a positive step in the drive
for financial and monetary liberalization and as a big leap to
confront the fear and rumors about the strength of the dinar,
according to Arabic dailies Al Ra'i and Al Dustour today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Amman Financial Market (AFM) showed upbeat this
week after the banking regulations were eased Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly report of the AFM said the turnover for the week
ending Thursday was three million dinars compared with the
previous week's 2.8 million dinars.
</P>
<P>
Traders in the market believed that the market is expected
to witness an upward climb this week.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Thwarts Israeli Scheme to Set up Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Police have thwarted an
Israeli scheme to set up an espionage and terrorist network in
Lebanon and detained an alleged head of the network, Beirut's
largest-circulated An-Nahar daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the police arrested an Armenian of Lebanese
nationality, who is in his 30s, in the Armenian neighborhood of
Burj Hammoud in East Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The police broke into the man's house and seized evidences on
his collaboration with the Israeli intelligence service of Mossad,
and his several meetings with Mossad's leaders in Israel and the
Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it did not specify when the operation was carried out.
</P>
<P>
It added that the evidences also show his cooperation with
Mossad in a bid to establish a large-scale network of agents in
Lebanon and send them to Israel's self-claimed "security zone" in
south Lebanon to meet Mossad's officers.
</P>
<P>
Those agents were instructed to execute assassinations and
detonation of car bombs targeting Islamic fundamentalist movements
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It has been found out that the detainee had accompanied four
men to the Israeli buffer zone for recruitment and training by
Mossad in the border strip, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The detainee was handed over to the Beirut military court
Friday and was charged with "collaboration with the Israeli enemy
aimed to engage in terrorist activities by carrying out
explosions, assassinations and leaking informations on the
anti-Israeli resistance movement."
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the police failed to
find the four men, and believed that they had escaped
to the border strip after their scheme was exposed.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli spy of Lebanese nationality was executed by a fire
squad in Beirut last month. The spy, Ahmed abdu Badia Halaq, was
accused of blasting Fuad Moghaniyeh, an officer of Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God, and two others in the
Lebanese capital on December 12, 1994.
</P>
<P>
This was the first Israeli spy executed in Lebanon since the
end of Lebanon's civil war in 1990.

</P>
<P>

wait until it declares its policies to Parliament, the final
process of forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
New MPs will begin reporting to the Parliament Secretariat on
November 18 and the process normally takes five to seven days.

Thailand by US President Bill Clinton.
</P>

accession to the throne and the king would be busy with many
functions.

<HEADLINE> DPRK condemns South Korea-U.S. Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Two leading newspapers in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) strongly condemned
the United States-South Korean military exercise, code-named "Foal
Eagle," today in their editorials.
</P>
<P>
The two-week long exercise began on Monday and involves about
34,000 U.S. military personnel, several hundreds of thousands of
South Korean military people and the U.S. aircraft carrier
"Independence".
</P>
<P>
The paper "Rodong Sinmun" pointed out that the exercise was a
well-planned provocation "aiming at threatening DPRK and leading
the Korean Peninsula into the edge of war."
</P>
<P>
In its commentary, "Rodong Sinmun" said that judging from the
targets, scale and content of the exercise, "Foal Eagle" was a
replica of the "Team Spirit" military exercise which had been an
annual one since the mid-70s by the U.S. and South Korea. The
"Foal Eagle" military exercise was to fill in a "vacancy" which
appeared after the temporary cessation of the "Team Spirit"
military exercise. Therefore, the "Foal Eagle" was more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that in the "Frame Agreement" on the
nuclear issue signed by DPRK and the U.S., Washington had made a
public promise to join hands with the DPRK to bring about a
nuclear-free zone, peace and security in the Korean Peninsula.
The "Foal Eagle" military exercise was not only against the spirit
of the "Frame Agreement", but also meant the U.S. betrayal of the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"Minju Choson" in its commentary condemned the military
exercise and demanded an immediate stop of the exercise.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Commodities Now Popular in Newly-Weds' Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- More newly-married couples in
Shanghai prefer domestically-made household electrical appliances
in their homes.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey, conducted by "Shanghai Youth News" among 50
newly-married couples, shows that 60 percent of them have chosen
domestically-made commodities for their new homes, much higher
than that in previous years.
</P>
<P>
When China first started to open to the outside world in 1978,
large numbers of foreign brand-name goods, dominated by modern
household electrical appliances, poured into Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
These well-packaged advanced foreign goods became trendy among
young people. Many newly-married couples also took pride in using
commodities of foreign brands to furnish their homes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also discloses that the concept of consumption and
"sense of fashion" of contemporary youth is undergoing changes, and
many young people have changed their psychology of pursuing only
commodities of foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
It reaches a conclusion that the changes demonstrate the young
people of present China are more mature toward consumption on one
hand. On the other hand, domestically-made commodities are now of
higher quality, and are capable of meeting demands of consumers
after technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the people surveyed said that as long as
commodities have good quality, it does not matter whether they are
imported or not, but prices and after-sales service are key
factors that matter.
</P>
<P>
According to another survey, conducted by Shanghai municipal
economic departments among major stores in the city, on the whole,
domestically-made commodities still hold a dominant penetration on
Shanghai market, while imported commodities only hold a small
share.
</P>
<P>
Sales of domestically-made washing machines account for 90
percent of the total sales of such commodities in the stores,
while sales of China-made refrigerators make up 95 percent of the
total, but foreign-made sound equipment and video-cassette
recorders still pose an edge over domestically-made models on the
market.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that young consumers, being in the forefront
of market consumption, and newly-weds as a representative
consumption group, will remain the focus in future market
competition.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Lowers Growth Rate to 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown of Thailand's
economy has led the central bank to again lower its forecast for
this year's economic growth rate to 7 percent, down from the
mid-year prediction of 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 7 percent expansion rate would be the slowest in a decade,
with last year's economy growing by 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic data released by the Bank of Thailand show
that exports in the first eight months of this year grew only 2.4
percent, suggesting that the 10.2 percent export growth target
will not be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai Marakanond, governor of the Bank of Thailand, Friday
described the economy as "fragile" and warned that it could no
longer be taken for granted by the politicians who lead the
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sharp economic slowdown and short-term weakness,
overall stability is maintainable, Rerngchai added.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation is now of less concern, having fallen since
September, while the current account deficit fell to 29.3 billion
baht (1.17 billion US dollars) in August compared with 49.6
billion baht (1.98 billion dollars) in April.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Legislature to Modify Foreign Investment Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's top legislature will
directly take charge of approving foreign-funded major
construction projects in the country, according to a report
published today.
</P>
<P>
Nong Duc Manh, Chairman of the National Assembly (NA), said the
legislature's involvement in construction approval will be the
largest proposed change to the country's foreign investment law.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by a "Vietnam News" report as saying that the NA
is holding discussions to seek more favorable conditions for
investors to work stably over long periods of time in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the assembly will also discuss ways for
more effective management and regulation of foreign investment, as
the current investment environment has left "many gaps."
</P>
<P>
These gaps, such as incomplete regulations on taxation, "have
been taken advantage of," said the top Vietnamese legislator.
</P>
<P>
The NA Chairman alleged that outdated and backward equipments
imported into Vietnam by joint-venture companies have left the
country a "garbage dump."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Vietnamese should learn and fully
understand the technology imported to the country in order to
successfully manage it later.
</P>
<P>
Manh revealed that the foreign investment law will be modified
in many areas, including provisions of land use, contract
management, taxes and state regulations.

<HEADLINE> Unexploded Depleted Uranium Shells Found in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 unexploded
depleted uranium shells, probably launched by the U.S.-led
coalition forces during the Gulf War in 1991, have been found last
week in the Kuwaiti desert bordering its northern neighbor Iraq, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Arab Times, citing well-informed sources, said Bangladeshi
mines-clearing units operating in the Kuwaiti desert last week
found the 10 unexploded depleted uranium shells in the desert
between Abdalli and Umm Qaser near the northern border with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said the shells were found outside the demilitarized
zone, and the unused shells are six inches (15 cm) long and one inch
(2.5 cm) in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted security officials, who asked not to be named,
as saying that the Kuwaiti army was informed of the finding and
appropriate action was taken accordingly.
</P>
<P>
But it did not give further details on where the shells have
been taken.
</P>
<P>
According to British Nuclear Power Agency, about 40 tons of
depleted uranium were used during the Operation Desert Storm in
1991.
</P>
<P>
In August 1993, a Kuwaiti specialized radiation protection
team which surveyed the Kuwaiti desert collected samples from
various places, which were hit with depleted uranium missiles or
shells.
</P>
<P>
Uranium experts say that although depleted uranium dose not
penetrate the skin, particles may be ingested through food or
inhaled while breathing. These in turn could cause problems in
the kidney or cause cells in the lungs to mutate and
become cancerous.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Breakfast Important to Chinese Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- He Yuna, an expert of the
Institution of Nutrition of the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine, recently called on Chinese students to attach more
importance to breakfast.
</P>
<P>
He said that students and their parents should improve their
knowledge of what constitutes a nutritious breakfast.
</P>
<P>
He said so because a recent survey, conducted by the
institution, reveals that 20 percent of all Chinese students,
particularly those from urban areas, do not eat enough for
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that those who do eat a morning meal
don't necessarily choose nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the breakfast menu of China's urban
students is quite different from that of rural students.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that rural students eat an adequate amount of
breakfast, mainly consisting of grains and vegetables, but they
don't get enough high-protein foods such as milk and eggs. On
average, a rural student only has two to three grams of egg per
day.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, urban students have more milk and eggs, but do not
eat enough food in the morning.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that rural students have more nutritious food,
while urban students should eat enough so that they can complete
their schoolwork energetically.

<HEADLINE> India's Export Growth Remains Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India's exports for the first
half of the current financial year indicates a sluggish trend with
a growth rate of only 9.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Except a few items such as coffee and electronics, most of the
key products in the export basket have registered low growth or
even negative growth, according to Commerce Ministry data
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The overall exports during April-September 1996 was 16.14
billion US dollars as against 14.68 billion during the
corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With the growth not touching even 10 percent during the first
half of the current fiscal year, chances of meeting the export
target of 38 billion dollars for 1996-97 (April-March) seem to be
remote now.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the current financial year, the Indian
Commerce Ministry was expecting an export growth of 20 percent for
1996-97 and is still hopeful of meeting the target.
</P>
<P>
India's export and industrial production growth has shown a
sustained slowdown over the past few months.

KAMPALA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Fuel prices went up again in
Uganda yesterday after major oil firms announced increases in
pump prices, reported the local daily ''New Vision " today.
</P>
<P>
With the fuel price hike coming to effect as of today,
the price for petrol per litre increased from 1,120 Ugandan
Shillings (one U.S.Dollar) to 1,150, while the price of
diesel rose from 970 Shillings to 990 and price of
kerosene went up to 850 Shillings from 820, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
This follows a rise in world oil prices and the exchange rate
of the U.S. Dollar against the shilling.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices are reported to have been rising steadily for
the past few months, which has forced local fuel to raise prices
three times this year. Fuel prices first rose in last August and
they climbed by one percent in October.

<HEADLINE> Man Speared by Steel Pole Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A man who was almost speared to
death by a steel pole on a construction site is making a good
recovery in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The steel pole fell from a 27-floor building and pierced the
construction worker's body. But after two weeks intensive care
treatment his life has been saved.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that 29 years old Wang Jianbin has now pulled
through the most potentially fatal postoperative symptom - blood
infection. He is now recovering from the surgery, according to
Gulou Hospital in Nanjing, east China.
</P>
<P>
Wang was hit by the three-meter-long steel pole at a
construction site in Nanjing on October 17. The pole entered from
the left side of his back and came out of his right knee.
</P>
<P>
Wang's colleagues had to cut parts of the pole from his body
before sending him to Gulou Hospital, where it was found that his
blood pressure had dropped to zero.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons found Wang's lung, pericardium, stomach, duodenum and
other organs were damaged, but by sheer luck his heart was unhurt.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week all higher.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals ended the week higher on active
short-covering activities sparked by the bullish palm oil export
data for October 1996.
</P>
<P>
November south closed the week 28 Ringgit (about 11.2 US
dollars) higher at 1,180 Ringgit (about 472 dollars) against 1,152
Ringgit (about 460.8 dollars) during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) ended the week
higher following the bullish performance of the London Metal
Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
The metal closed at 14.80 Ringgit (about 5.92 dollars) per kg,
five sen higher compared with 14.75 Ringgit (about 5.9 dollars)
per kg during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The week's turnover rose to 492 tons from 405 tons previously,
with European and local buyers dominating the bulk of
transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market also closed the week higher
following inquires from Britain, the Middle East and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Dec RSS One rose nine sen to close at 317.50 sen (about 127
cents) per kg from 308.50 sen (about 123.4 cents) per kg while SMR
20 surged two sen to 311.00 sen (about 124.4 cents) per kg from
309.00 sen (about 123.6 cents) during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The market has been in a downward trend over the last two
months with buyers staying away after active short-covering until
September, coupled with the long summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
The tight rubber supply following the return of the rainy
season which affected latex production also boosted prices.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Banking Sector Stable, Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's financial sector
has made a stable and healthy progress since the start of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The city has adhered to the government policy of keeping
reasonably-tight control on money supply.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of September, the
total savings had increased by 61.1 billion yuan, and outstanding
loans also rose by 30.4 billion yuan compared with the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The bank loans have mostly been invested in key projects and
well-performed state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, the proportion
of short-term loans is also going up.
</P>
<P>
Household savings also appeared to be increasing, and by the
end of September, savings by local people had reached 178.7
billion yuan, up 38.9 billion yuan over the end of last year, a 30
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Three major financial markets in Shanghai have been operating
well this year.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, the business volume on Shanghai
Stock Exchange hit 16,100 billion yuan, increasing by 3.1 times
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Since new issues and state bonds have been successfully
floated, the number of investors has been increasing. The number
of listed shares on the stock market reached 295, with a
total market value of over 490 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At the Foreign Exchange Trading Center, the trade volume added
up to 46.1 billion US dollars in the first nine months.
</P>
<P>
Since supply exceeds demand, on the foreign exchange market the
weighted average prices of US dollar against RMB has fallen a
little, with the Hong Kong dollar and Japanese yen also declining.
</P>
<P>
As capital-supply was relatively sufficient in the city, local
funds continued to flow out to other parts of the country, mainly
Guangdong and Hainan provinces. In the first nine months,
inter-bank loaning market in China totaled 394.3 billion yuan in
business volume.

<HEADLINE> NBA Starts 51st Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Basketball
Association (NBA) started its 51st season Friday night with 14
pairs of 29 teams played in different cities with commemorations
of the 50th anniversary of the Association.
</P>
<P>
The earlest game was between Chicago and Boston, beginning at
7:00 p.m. EDT (2400 GMT), and Portland at Vancouver starting at
10:30 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
The other games on Friday night were Cleveland at New Jersey,
Milwaukee at Philadelphia, Washington at Orlando, Atlanta at
Miami, Indiana at Detroit, New York at Toronto, San Antonio at
Minnesota, Sacramento at Houston, Dallas at Denver, Seattle at
Utah, Phoenix at L.A. Lakers, and L.A. Clippers at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
In commemorating the NBA's 50th anniversary, the New York
Knicks and Toronto Raptors played in the old-fashion uniforms and
it was the first of 22 games this season in which teams wear
replicas of uniforms from the league's past.
</P>
<P>
The Raptors, instead of wearing their usual red, white and
purple outfits, wear plain white jerseys with "Huskies" written
across the front in blue letters.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks take uniforms with light blue lettering outlined in
orange against a blue background.
</P>
<P>
The new season came with more movement of players than ever
before. Toss in a few trades and over 100 players changed
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'neal's free-agent move to the Lakers, who gave him
a 120 million dollar for seven years, was the biggest story in the
Summer filled with personnel changes around the league.
</P>
<P>
Barkley has moved over to the Houston Rockets, who have only
two players remaining from the team that won the first of its two
consecutive championships in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte Hornets traded Larry Johson to the New York
Knicks while the latter signed Allan Houston from the Detroit
Pistons, who acquired Stacey Augmon and Grant Long from the
Altanta Hauks.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Hawks signed Dikembe Mutombo from the Denver
Nuggets, who signed Ervin Johnson from the Seattle SuperSonics,
while the Seattle team signed Jim McIlvaine from the Washington
Bullets.
</P>
<P>
The Bullets also acquired Rod Strickland from the Portland
Trail Blazers, who in turn acquired Isaiah Rider from the
Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
"No longer are you going to see players sticking around with
one club for long periods of time," Orlando Magic coach Brian Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the defending NBA champion Chicago Bulls retained the
rights to superstars Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman and
re-signed Coach Phil Jackson to insure another run at a tittle.
</P>
<P>
A second straight NBA title would revive claims of the Bulls
being one of the greatest teams ever.
</P>
<P>
All-Star forward Scottie Pippen and Sixth Man Award winner Toni
Kukoc are in place and aged center Robert Parish joins a bench
replete with role players.
</P>
<P>
However the Bull's top guns are all over 30, leading one to
wonder if they will be able to match their magical season of a
year ago, sports analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Seattle won 64 games last season and reached the finals for the
first time in 17 years. Versatile Swingman Craig Ehlo joins a
squard that features Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton and
All-Star forward Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some maturity from Gary Parton from the Dream Team,"
Sonics Coach George Karl said. "it seams to have made him more of
a leader. The addition of Jim McIlvaine and Craig Ehlo are
positive. We think they are better players than the ones they
replaced."
</P>
<P>
Other teams also reorganized their players and five new coaches
were added in the season.

<HEADLINE> India to Support Ghali in Bid for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- India is going to support the
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his
re-election bid, The Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to highly-placed sources in the Ministry of External
Affairs, the decision to support Ghali is based on the convention
that all his predecessors held two successive terms.
</P>
<P>
Ghali completes his present term of five years on December 31
and his re-election is being strongly opposed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"Supporting Mr. Ghali, who has been one of Egypt's outstanding
diplomats, is in line with our traditional policy of expressing
solidarity with the African countries," one External Affairs
Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
"And in this context the fact that the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) has unanimously recommended Mr. Ghali's re-election
has made our choice easier," the source added.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Selective buying of blue
chips on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on the last two days of
trading during the week enabled the Composite Index to nearly wipe
out losses accumulated in the first three days.
</P>
<P>
The main board, especially blue chips, attracted little
interest from investors early in the week following disappointment
over the government's failure to cut the corporate tax rate widely
expected before the announcement of the 1997 National Budget on
October 25.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index closed 0.47 of a point lower at 1,172.48
compared with 1,172.95 at last week's close, the all main board
Emas Index shed 2.47 points to 336.31 from 338.78 the previous
week and the Industrial Index shed 8.49 points to 2,215.82.
</P>
<P>
Strong buying support early in the week saw the second board
closing 3.15 points higher at 634.51 compared with the previous
week's close at 631.36 despite profit taking from mid-week
onwards.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the week rose to 1.704 billion shares worth
13.527 billion ringgit (about 5.4108 billion U.S. dollars) from
1.583 billion shares valued at 12.843 billion ringgit (about
5.1372 billion U.S. dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Main board turnover fell to 576.220 billion shares worth 3.936
billion ringgit (about 1.5744 billion U.S. dollars ) from 741.420
million shares worth 5.195 billion ringgit (about 2.07 billion
U.S. dollars) and second board volume increased to 697.145 million
shares worth 7.457 billion ringgit (about 2.98 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with 587.186 million shares worth 6.417 billion
ringgit (about 2.56 billion U.S. dollars) the week before.
</P>
<P>
Off-market turnover increased to 245.178 million shares worth
1.249 billion ringgit (about 490 million U.S. dollars) from 82.988
million worth 605.597 million ringgit (about 242.23 million U.S.
dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Next week is expected to see more selective buying of blue
chips and this might see the Composite Index move towards the
1,180 level at least in the early part of the week, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentals are still strong and there is expectation that
by the end of the year the Index would touch the 1,200 level, the
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the absence of immediate fresh domestic leads, the
market might be influenced by the direction of the Dow Jones at
the close of the week, they added.

<HEADLINE> Flood-hit City Gets 320m Yuan From Insurance Firm </HEADLINE>

<P>
NANNING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 20,000 enterprises and
households in Liuzhou city, Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, have received a total of 320 million yuan in
compensation from the local branch of PICC Property.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that PICC Property, the largest of its
kind in China, has paid such a large indemnity to a city for
flood-related damage.
</P>
<P>
Liuzhou was attacked by disastrous floods this summer, the
heaviest-ever in the city's history, which caused heavy losses,
though local governments and the people had carried out intensive
rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Property city branch, sent over 100 million yuan to
local policy holders, in its first wave of compensation payments
in July. So far, 320 million yuan has been paid by the insurance
firm.
</P>
<P>
The prompt compensation payments have helped local firms and
individuals restore production and normal lives.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out Troop Increase in Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Perry said today that the United State will not increase its
forces in South Korea despite the tensions arising on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with South Korean Defense
Minister Kim Dong-Jin, Perry said there is was no "basis for
making an increase in U.S. forces" because the military threat
posed by North Korea had not increased.
</P>
<P>
The news conference came after the United States and South
Korea held the 28th security consultative meeting on Friday, in a
wake of a recent series of incidents in the region, including a
DPRK submarine stranded off the South Korean coast.
</P>
<P>
South Korea believed the submarine was on a spy mission, while
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintained it ran
aground by accident on a routine mission.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Defense Minister Kim Dong-Jin also ruled out the
possibility of increasing troops to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
separating the DPRK and South Korea, when asked about a CNN report
that his country had been ready to send troops into the zone in
the wake of the sub' incident.
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have no plans to send ... our troops into the
DMZ," he said.
</P>
<P>
But both Perry and Kim said that the two countries would
continue to maintain a high state of readiness with emphasis on
training and force modernization.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the net result of modernization was that "the forces
deployed in South Korea today are substantially more capable than
they were a year ago, and than they were two years ago."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the 1994 agreement to freeze the DPRK's nuclear
program and to provide it with a light-water reactor should go
forward given the tensions in the region, Perry said: "Both the
United States and South Korea have agreed to continue to pursue
implementation of the agreed framework."

<HEADLINE> Perry: No Conclusion on Bombing of U.S. Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary William Perry on Friday contradicted report about 40
detained Saudis allegedly involved in the June 25 bombing attack
on a U.S. military air base complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The report was published in Friday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Perry told a joint news conference, with visiting South Korean
Defense Minister Kim Dong-Jin, that Washington had "reached no
conclusions" as to who was responsible for the bombing, which
killed 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is still under way. We have reached no
conclusions about who was responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that Saudi Arabian security officials
were holding about 40 Saudi citizens who they had concluded were
involved in the truck bombing, and the man who allegedly drove the
explosive-laden truck into the complex was among them.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it had got the information from
"knowledgeable sources", and quoted U.S. officials as saying that
the Saudis had not fully briefed the United States on the latest
arrests and FBI agents in Saudi Arabia had not been allowed to
interview the alleged driver of the truck.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the degree of cooperation U.S. investigators were
receiving from the Saudis, Perry refused to provide any details or
comment, only saying he had "made very clear" to the Saudis "the
importance to our Defense Department of full cooperation in this
investigation."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post also quoted the knowledgeable sources as
saying the Saudis had obtained evidence that the 40 detainees were
all members of a group called "Saudi Hezbullah", believed to be
linked to the Iranian-backed Lebanese group of the same name.
</P>
<P>
Perry himself said in August after a trip to the Persian Gulf
region, including Saudi Arabia, that the bombing attack on the
U.S. military complex could have an international connection. If
so, he said, Iran would be the first to be suspected. But this
time he avoided to say about that.
</P>
<P>
The Dhahran truck bombing was the second attack against a U.S.
target in the kingdom in less than a year. In November 1995, a car
bomb detonated at a U.S. military training facility in Riyadh
leaving seven dead, five of them Americans.

<HEADLINE> Efforts To Help Homeless in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The German Red Cross has
launched a movement to help the homeless, estimated at one million
nationwide and 12,000-14,000 in Berlin alone, to cope with a
looming bitter winter.
</P>
<P>
The movement, dubbed "Fight the Winter by Joint Efforts", calls
on the community to donate for the homeless, among which 400,000
to 500,000 are children, mostly deserted by their parents.
</P>
<P>
Between 700,000 to 800,000 homeless are living in shelters
they've made with waste iron sheets and cardboard, because they
cannot afford to pay rents, which are quite expensive.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross has set up temporary collecting centers to
provide the wanderers, who usually spend the nights at railway
stations and under bridges and eaves, with a place to sleep from
6:30 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., and a warm meal.
</P>
<P>
It will take 250,000 marks (about 167,000 U.S. dollars) to keep
the eight collecting centers in Berlin open till next spring, but
only 175,000 marks (120,000 dollars) were obtained from community
donations in the past ten months.
</P>
<P>
Literary and art workers are also helping by putting on benefit
performances in 19 cities.

<HEADLINE> 121 Bangladeshis to Be Accused or Witnesses in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi police have prepared
a comprehensive list of 121 persons who will be either accused or
witnesses in the country's military coup of August 15, 1975 when
"the father of the nation" Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman was
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur, the first head of state after Bangladesh won
independence in 1971 and father of present Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, was killed during the military coup along with his wife
and their sons. Hasina and her sister escaped the tragedy because
they were abroad at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources today, of the 121 persons
including all the living ex-ministers of the 1975 cabinet, 27 have
already been earmarked as accused, 26 as witnesses and others are
treated as suspects including former chief of army staff Major
General K.M. Shafiullah who is now a member of parliament (MP) of
the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
The list has been placed before the Ministry of Home Affairs
and actions will follow on receipt of necessary approval from the
government, the sources disclosed, adding that necessary steps
would be taken against them during investigation.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that of the accused persons, 10 have been
arrested, interrogated and detained while others are on the wanted
list.
</P>
<P>
The 10 held are all retired army personnel except former state
minister for information Taheruddin Thakur.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Develop Skilled Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's skilled labor
development remains stalled because there are no transparent
supporting policies from the government, a Thammasat university
research paper says.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicts that industries will need as many as 5.7
million skilled workers over the next five years, and warns that
programs to develop those skills can not be delayed any longer.
</P>
<P>
The skilled labor shortage is due mainly to Thailand's attempt
to attain industrialized nation status in a hurry, with a flood of
high-tech and complex equipment entering the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The paper says skill development efforts should focus on the
following fields, in order: electrical and electronics industries,
communications, cold storage, steel, metallurgy, industrial
design, computers, architecture and industrial chemistry.
</P>
<P>
"But the government's program is still far from being a success
despite being closely supervised by the Skill Development
department," professor Sasapat Yodpet, one of the researchers,
was quoted by local daily the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is because of the private sector's uncertainty about how
far the program can meet their purposes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the government, through the Skill
Development Department, approach private companies and focus on
developing specific provincial areas and particular labor groups
in line with industrial sector needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Skill Development Department, Thailand's
unskilled laborers number more than 27 million people or nearly 80
percent of the adult workforce of 34 million.

SOFIA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian customs, in the
northern city of Ruse, today seized 14 kilograms of smuggled
heroin at a checkpoint on the Danube River.
</P>

The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that the drug was
smuggled in from Istanbul by two Turks. They passed through the
customs at the Turkey-Bulgaria border, but were apprehended at
Ruse when they tried to leave for Germany in car.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was the latest result of an intensified crack-down
on drug crimes by Bulgarian police.
</P>
<P>
In July, the customs at Ruse, about 250 kilometers from
Bulgaria's capital Sofia, seized 17 kilograms of heroin smuggled
by two Dutch people.

<HEADLINE> Synthetic Gemstones in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Synthetic material being passed
off as natural gemstones and charged unreasonable prices has
become a problem in the Thai market.
</P>
<P>
The market is flooded with simulated rubies, sapphires,
emeralds, amethysts and other synthetics.
</P>
<P>
It is not wrong to trade in synthetics as long as the traders
inform the buyers of the truth.
</P>
<P>
However, there are instances when even laboratories are unable
to determine with certainty whether a gemstone is natural or
synthetic.
</P>
<P>
What has become a major danger in the market is the increasing
incidence of misrepresentation, said Muriel Ho, vice president of
the Bangkok-based Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences.
</P>
<P>
While in some countries there is legal protection for the
consumers, punitive measures have yet to be formulated in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Even though the stones are sold by manufacturers as synthetic
ones, they lose distinction as they travel the distribution route,
said Ken Scarratt, an official with the institute.

MONTEVIDEO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Links between Uruguay and
China are growing ever stronger since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1988, says Uruguayan Foreign
Minister Alvaro Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos returned home today from his October 24-31 visit to
China. He said at the airport that the eight-day visit was a
success.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the relationship between Uruguay and China had

</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding not only between the authorities,
but also between the people of the two countries," Ramos added.

<HEADLINE> Mechanical Failure Might Be Cause of Brazil's Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 1 (Xinhua) -- A mechanical failure in
the right turbine has been suggested as the fault which caused a
Fokker-100 airliner to crash in a densely populated Sao Paulo
neighbourhood, killing 117 people.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted Antonio Bueno, an aircraft
mechanic at Cononhas airport, as saying that he saw the thrust
reverser on the Fokker's right turbine open and close several
times in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
The thrust reverser, used on landing to help bring a plane to a
stop, is designed to reverse the direction of the engine's
exhaust, creating aerodynamic resistance.
</P>
<P>
Bueno said he saw the right engine's thrust reverser open up
and it was not normal and created a very strange sound. "The next
time I looked, the plane took a dive and disappeared underneath a
mushroom-shaped cloud," he added.
</P>
<P>
But TAM airline President Rolim Adolfo Amaro Friday refused to
speculate on what caused the crash, saying all he knew at present
was that the plane lacked power.
</P>
<P>
A final official report on the accident would be published
within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
The Fokker-100 was acquired in 1993 and the captain had logged
6,000 hours in the air.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed on Thursday morning soon after its takeoff on
a domestic flight from Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
In addition to all the 89 passengers and six crew on board, at
least 20 people on the ground were killed.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened at a densely populated residential area
which was only two kilometers away from the airport runway.
</P>
<P>
An airport official said the plane took off from Sao Paulo's
Congonhas airport at 8:25 a.m. local time (19:25 GMT) Thursday,
and seconds later it crashed into an apartment building and burst
into flames.
</P>
<P>
The crash was the worst air accident in the country in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Businessman Detained in Smuggling Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Eduardo Zabalza, the
general manager of the customs agency, "Murchison SA", was detained
today charged with alleged links with the most notorious case of
smuggling in Argentina's history.
</P>
<P>
The National Customs Administration suspended the activities of
"Murchison SA" several days ago to facilitate the investigation of
the case, known as "the parallel customs" scandal. Eduardo Zabalza
was only one of the 30 persons involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in early October found a "customs" that operated
parallel to the state one and was involved in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that merchandise containers belonging to
several enterprises were declared "in transit" by the parallel
customs. Then the containers left the country after being emptied,
leaving the merchandise in the country.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities last month confiscated a large quantity of
such smuggled merchandise.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that merchandise worth more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars was smuggled in by the parallel customs in the last
five years, resulting in a loss of more than 3 billion dollars in
tax revenues to the country.
</P>
<P>
The investigations involve big importing companies, customs
agencies, and the National Customs Administration itself, judicial
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Menem announced on October 8 the intervention
of the National Customs Administration and its merging with the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Moves National Archives Records to New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
finished moving 2 billion pieces of historical documents, maps
and recordings from the National Archives building in downtown
Washington, D.C. to a new suburban home to keep them away from
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Starting on January 3, 1994, it took the Archives nearly three
years to move more than 1.2 million cubic feet of records to the
new home, "Archive II", in suburban College Park, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"Today marks the end of the largest move of records ever," said
John Carlin, archivist of the United States. He said the work was
done on time and without anything being lost or damaged.
</P>
<P>
The historical pieces included the most valuable photographs in
the National Archives collection, 8,000 Civil War plates by Mathew
Brady, more than 198 million pages of written records, 13 million
maps in more than 4,000 cases, 8 million photos, 112,274 reels of
motion pictures and 200,122 sound recordings.
</P>
<P>
Also among the pieces moved were 43,726 cubic feet of documents
the government seized after Richard Nixon resigned, the John
F. Kennedy assassination collection and captured German records
from World War II.
</P>
<P>
Susan Cooper, spokesman for the Archives, said it was the
largest archival move in history, bigger than that of the Public
Records of England and the National Archives of Canada.
</P>
<P>
But some of the documentation of American history, including
records of Revolutionary and Civil wars, the Navy, the Census, the
Congress and all the original Public laws, will remain in the old
Archive building which receives more than a million visitors each
year.
</P>
<P>
The new facility has 520 miles (830 kilometers) of shelves, and
environmental controls to preserve the records.

<P>
MANILA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has ordered Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers
to put an end to the rise in kidnapping cases in the south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Barbers has been instructed by the president to do his utmost
in controlling kidnappings in Mindanao, especially in Cotabato
province, Executive Secretary Ruben Torres was quoted today by
local press.
</P>
<P>
Torres said the order came after wide protest actions launched
in Cotabato by irate residents following the killing of a
businesswoman in a botched kidnapping attempt last week.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping situation in Cotabato has reached an alarming
level with residents and businessmen asking the government to
provide them helicopter surveillance to deter kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Torres said it is possible to create a special task force to
solve the kidnappings in Mindanao, adding that Barbers can also
strengthen his cooperation with Governor Nur Misuari of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in stopping the crime.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has reportedly recorded more than 108
kidnapping cases this year with 14 hostages having been killed and
at least 1.5 million U.S. dollars extorted as ransom.

SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city is planning domestic and overseas investment for building
dykes to reclaim 2,000 hectares of land by the end of the century,
according to Xu Qihua, director of the city's bureau of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to meet the need for land for future
development, he said, adding that a regulation will take effect
January 1 to give investors land-use rights to reclaimed land, and
to allow transfer and leases and the right to do business there.
</P>
<P>
The "Shanghai Regulation on Beach Administration" was adopted
Thursday by the Standing Committee of Shanghai Municipal People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Per capita land use in Shanghai, which has a population of 13
million, is only 26.5 square meters, much lower then the average
for other big cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the city has used 120,000 hectares of land for
construction projects and reclaimed 70,000 hectares of land from
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that rapid growth of the city's economy means it will
need another 3,300 hectares of land for construction projects
every year.

SHENYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- For 3,000 local Catholics in
Jinzhou City in Liaoning Province, Father Hu Baoping is the head
priest of the city's parish, while for poor believers, Hu is a
poverty-relief worker.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old priest has helped poor Catholics by teaching
skills about cropping and breeding over the past three years,
setting up a training center, the first of its kind in China, and
inviting experts from colleges to give lectures. About 400 people
have been trained there by now.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1994, Father Hu got 50,000 yuan in bank loans
and bought over goose eggs for the parish, but the project was a
complete failure because of the lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give up though and tried again, purchasing over
300 young geese and distributing them among followers free of
charge. This time, he succeeded, and nearly 40 rural households
have raised over 700 geese and over 2,000 ducks.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a new fortune by feeding geese and ducks," some
of these previously-poor farmers say, while Father Hu explains
that the Church can also make contributions for social and
economic development.

GENEVA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Burundi has been circled out by
the soccer's world governing body FIFA from the World Cup African
qualifying tournaments due to the ethnic conflicts in the Central
African country.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said in Zurich, Switzerland on
Friday that Burundi has been replaced by Sierra Leone in the
second round African qualifying tournament despite its 2-0 win on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Cooper explained that the decision was made after Burundi
soccer federation declined to ensure the security of all players
of matches played in its country.

<P>
Ethnic violence in Burundi between Hutus and Tutsis has
reportedly claimed some 150,000 people, mostly civilians since
1993.
</P>
<P>
Under FIFA's order, Sierra Leone will thus play Morocco on
November 10 in Rabat in Group 5 which also blankets Gabon and
Ghana.
</P>

Burundi only entered the African World Cup qualifiers for the

<P>
At present, about 1.57 million Beijing residents are above the

</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, an area with ten percent of

SHANGHAI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- In Shanghai, many youngsters in
one-child families, who became selfish "little emperors" spoiled
by their parents, are getting lessons in school about good
behavior and doing more to help out around the house.
</P>
<P>
This is one result of Shanghai's school programs to unspoil its

</P>
<P>
In many large Chinese cities, the majority of families have only

</P>
<P>
Many of the "only children" are pampered, and are said to be
self-willed, having little regard for the feelings of others.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai teachers are instructing their students to say
goodbye to their parents when they are going out, to make them
tea when they return home, and to use their pocket money to buy
gifts for their parents and others.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 90 percent of these students are active
in doing household chores or other tasks which show their

<P>
With the win of 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), Enqvist virtually strips Edberg
of the chance to win another major tennis title before his

However, organizers awarded Edberg a miniature trophy to salute

</P>
<P>
In the 10th game of the first set, Edberg netted his volley to
surrender his game, the only one broken by the 12th-seeded Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
Edberg kept his sixth game of the second set by surviving three
break points for a tiebreaker which he once led 5-2 but eventually
lost 8-6.
</P>
<P>
Other semifinal spots were snatched by Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
Magnus Gustafsson and Petr Korda.
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson defeated Marc Rosset 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 to claim the
first semifinal ticket while Korda edged Arnaud Boetsch 7-6 (7-2),
7-6 (8-6) by winning two tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, seeking his double victory here, defeated Paul

<P>
SHENYANG, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The 60 ha of potato in Jianping
County of northeast China's Liaoning Province has witnessed good
harvest, reaching a per ha yield of 31.5 tons, 40 percent higher
than average.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed the good harvest to the help of
foreign farming technicians introduced to the province.
</P>
<P>
And this is not the only contribution made by foreign farming
experts: in the past year, Liaoning invited more than 100
agricultural experts from ten countries and regions including Japan
and the US.
</P>
<P>
These experts, with their Chinese counterparts, fulfilled a total
of 104 cooperation projects, covering sectors such as planting and
animal breeding.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, famous as an old industry base, has also great
potential for agriculture development. The grain output in the
province is expected to reach 16 billion kilograms this year.
</P>
<P>
A vice-governor of the province has promised to work out a
series of policies to attract foreign agriculture experts to the
area.

<HEADLINE> Magical Water Medicine Plant Opens In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A new pharmaceutical factory
making traditional Tibetan medicines has gone into production in
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The factory is named after a "sacred spring" in Lhasa, and
uses the spring water, or "magical water", as local residents call
it, in its production.
</P>
<P>
Located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the Xungbalhaqu
Tibetan Medicine Factory has cost 4.2 million yuan (nearly 500,000
US dollars), and can produce more than 20 kinds of Tibetan
medicines.
</P>
<P>
It is being jointly run by the Aid Fund for Tibetan Development
and the Tibetan Medicine Hospital of the Nagqu Prefecture, which
has sent a dozen experts and technicians to work in the factory.
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the autonomous region's aid-poor programs,
with all its employees recruited from Doilungdeqen, a poor
suburban county of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Before the new factory was founded, the autonomous region had
three major Tibetan medicine factories, in Lhasa, the Qamdo
Prefecture, and the Nyalam County. There are also a number of
small factories run by various Tibetan Medicine Hospitals.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Common Efforts in Helping Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The international
community shares a common obligation for solving refugee problems
and further international cooperation is needed.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Wang Yuehua of the Chinese Delegation to the
United Nations at the U.N.'s Third Committee (Social) meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
The number of population of concern to the United Nations
Higher Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) worldwide has remained as
high as 26 million, Wang said, adding that the refugee exodus in
the Great Lakes region of Central Africa recently has drawn a
great deal of attention.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative reiterated China's stand that in
solving refugee issues, eliminating their root causes and
providing international protection and humanitarian assistance
should be carried out in tandem.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts, territorial disputes, ethnic and religious
conflicts within a country, drastic deterioration of the economic
situation as well as large-scale natural disasters are major
causes for the exodus of refugees. She also called attention to
the causes such as economic sanctions and blockade.
</P>
<P>
In order to eliminate these causes, she said China stands for
the establishment of a just and reasonable new international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary repatriation is the most ideal solution, she said.
Other means like local integration and resettlement should be used
in a flexible manner in light of the actual situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that at present, the majority of countries receiving
refugees and displaced persons are developing countries. They
can no longer bear the heavy burdens created thereafter, she
said. The international community is duty-bound to provide them
with more assistance.

<HEADLINE> UN Maintains Sanction Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council decided today to keep on its sanction against Iraq,
which bans the country to export its oil since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanction was imposed on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in
1990. The leading condition for lifting the sanction is that Iraq
has been verified as having eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction. The verification is carried out every 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. allowed Iraq in its April 1995 plan to sell oil in a
limited scale to purchase food and medicine, in response to
reports of malnutrition, collapsing medical services and other
humanitarian problems Iraqi civilians suffered because of the
sanction. But the U.N. resolution has been shelved.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese representative told Xinhua after the consultation
that the Chinese delegation urged Iraq to cooperate with the
United Nations to exercise an overall implementation of relevant
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Chinese hold the Security Council should
give an objective and impartial evaluation of the efforts made by
Iraq in this regard. "We have noticed Iraq has maintained its
cooperative relations with the U.N. Special Committee, which has
also made progress in its verification of Iraqi weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi representatives were not available immediately to comment
on the decision of the Security Council. Officials from Iraqi said
earlier that they had already reached the criteria of the U.N. and
the sanction should be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Zaire to Repatriate Rwandan Refugees with Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Zaire will repatriate more than 1
million Rwandan and Burundian refugees with force but in a gradual
way, the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a Zairean government
communique as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Zaire will carry out "forced and gradual repatriation of all
the Rwandan and Burundian refugees camped on its territory," said
the Zairean government following a cabinet meeting today in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Zaire refuses to "take part in any meeting
whatever its nature is on the events in the east of Zaire, as long
as the aggressor has not quit the Zairean soil."
</P>
<P>
The communique did not specify who the aggressor is, but it is
apparently referring to Rwanda, which has sent troops into Zairean
territory to back the Banyamulenges engaging Zairean troops.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government also denied reports that the city of
Bukavu has been completely controlled by the Banyamulenges, and
said that the city is under the control of the Zairean armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
An AFP photographer in Bukavu said today that the Banyamulenges
have been controlling the city since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zaire has closed its border in the North Kivu and South Kivu
provinces, and has banned air flights above the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
A French specialist in the African military said today that in
the on-going war between Zaire and Rwanda, Rwandan troops can
easily get the upper hand because they are better equipped, armed
and trained than Zairean troops.
</P>
<P>
Zaire, which is the largest central African state with a
territory of 2.245 million square kilometers and a population of
37 million, has an army of 50,000 men.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, which is 90 times smaller than Zaire and has a
population of some 7.1 million, also owns an army of 50,000 men.

and displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the governments of the region to pursue such
a dialogue without further delay in order to defuse the tension.
</P>
<P>
In this aspect, it expressed welcome to an initiative of the
secretary-general to dispatch to the Great Lakes region a special
envoy to consult with all concerned in order to establish the
facts relating to the present conflict and develop a plan to
defuse tension and establish a cease-fire.

Unity.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Threaten to Carry Out More Suicide Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK) today threatened to continue its suicide bomb
campaign if Turkey maintained its policy of dealing with the
Kurdish issue with force.
</P>
<P>
"If the Turks continue the policy of military solution of the
Kurdish issue, the next few days will show that each Kurd is a
bomb on the head of the Turkish state," a message from PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan read out at a press conference in Athens said.
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old woman PKK guerrilla, dressed to look pregnant,
blew up herself and four others in a suicide bomb attack on a
crack police force headquarters in the southern Turkish town of
Adana last week, the third such attack since July.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish National Liberation Front's Athens representative
Chevded Amed said that the latest three attacks, all by Kurdish
women, had taken the Kurdish resistance struggle into a new phase.
</P>
<P>
"At this new stage of our struggle, actions will intensify," he
added. "The message is that we can hit the Turks wherever we
want."
</P>
<P>
Amed said that the Kurds had shown their goodwill for a
political solution to the 12-year-old struggle by calling a
unilateral cease-fire but that Ankara "insists on its policy of
force."
</P>
<P>
Amed said the PKK supported the creation of a democratic
federation in southern Kurdistan in Iraq and rejected any attempt
to create a status quo without the participation of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
"We want to stress that the PKK is a considerable force in
southern Kurdistan and there are possibilities to create a
democratic alliance with the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union and the
Iranian Kurdish Democratic Party to fend off Turkish threats and
invasion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the U.S. initiative in northern Iraq would
fail if it did not take the PKK into consideration.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Kurdish Peace Deal Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Robert Pelletreau noted here today that the cease-fire
agreed between rival Iraqi Kurdish factions would establish the
ground for the implementation of oil-for-food agreement for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a brief meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller after a peace accord
was reached between Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed oil-for-food agreement between Iraq and the
United Nations permits Iraq to sell oil to buy food and
medicine. Iraq was put under international sanctions after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the Thursday deal, The KDP led by Massoud Barzani and
PUK headed by Jalal Talabani agreed to stop months of bloody
strife in their Western-protected enclave and move towards an
arrangement for sharing power and border revenues.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting Ciller also accepted the other
representatives at the peace talks from the KDP, the PUK,
Turkoman Front, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ciller hailed the agreement -- mediated by Turkey, the
U.S. and Britain -- as a "historic turnaround."
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau handed Ciller a letter from Secretary of State
Warren Christopher which reportedly expressed thanks for Turkey's
 constructive role in bringing about the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Pelletreau noted that details of implementing the peace accord
need further discussions.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting of the six parties has been scheduled in
Ankara on November 15 for more discussions on the deal.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Troops Reportedly Infiltrate Goma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan troops have infiltrated
the eastern Zairean city of Goma close to the Rwandan border, the
Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted international humanitarian
sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The head of a humanitarian group said that troops belonging to
the Rwandan Patriotic Army (APR) went past the front of the office
of his organization in the center of the city at 16:30 local time
(1430 GMT).
</P>
<P>
AFP also quoted a European resident in Goma as saying that he
sighted this afternoon Rwandan troops near a hotel beside Lake
Kivu, where many international organizations have their offices.
</P>
<P>
About 100 aid workers of humanitarian groups are now waiting
for evacuation from Goma.
</P>
<P>
The reports contradict with an earlier report by AFP that
Zairean troops were still controlling Goma by 17:00 local time
(1500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
One local resident told AFP that he met Zairean troops on the
Avenue of President Mobutu, which is the main street of the city.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan troops exchanged intensive artillery fires with Zairean
troops all day today along the border between the two countries,
and the Rwandan border city of Gisneyi was reportedly bombarded by
Zairean troops.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that many of the 100,000 inhabitants of Gisneyi tried
to flee the town, but were forced to stay at home by Rwandan
troops.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan troops sent reinforcements to Gisneyi from Kigali this
afternoon, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean city of Bukavu in South Kivu is now
completely controlled by the rebel Banyamulenges, who entered the
city triumphantly Wednesday after Zairean troops abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu
province, have fled to nearby hills, said AFP.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings enjoys more power following Thursday's amendment to the
west African nation's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to three articles of the constitution has
empowered the president to appoint the chairman of the Police and
Prison Services Council in consultation with the ruling Council
of State.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ghanaian capital Accra said today that the
amendment has also authorized the president to chair the Armed
Forces Council or appoint his nominee to chair it.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the vice-president was the chairman of the two
councils.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Ghanaian government drafted the
amendments following persistent disagreements between Rawlings
and his vice-president and political rival Kow Arkaah Arkaah.
</P>
<P>
The arguments culminated in a physical assault on the
vice-president by Rawlings in December at a cabinet meeting,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For elections scheduled for December 7 this year, the
opposition New Patriotic Party and People's Convention Party are
forming the great alliance led by John Kufuor, who chose Arkaah
as his running mate, the report said.
