<HEADLINE> Jordan, Kuwait to Resume Inter-capital Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Royal Jordanian (RJ) and Kuwaiti
Airlines (KA) agreed today to resume flights between the two
countries' capitals for the first time in six years, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
RJ agreed with a KA delegation, which arrived here this
morning, to equally share four flights every week between Amman
and Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti technical delegation will soon be here to finalize
related procedures before the flights are operational. The exact
date for the resumption of flights has not been declared.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, together with some other Arab nations, ostracized
Jordan for its perceived pro-Iraq tilt following the August 1990
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and canceled all the flights between
Jordan and Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Later when Jordan distanced itself from Iraq, the
Jordanian-Kuwaiti relations began to improve.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the trade volume between the two countries amounted
to some 28 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sports Carnival Marks HK's Handover to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Song and music broke the
quietness of the Hong Kong Stadium here Sunday when 5,000 people
assembled in a sports carnival to mark Hong Kong's reunification
with China in just eight days.
</P>
<P>
The star-studded "Sports and Games Carnival," jointly organized
by the Urban Council and the Regional Council to mark the
handover, featured a wide range of activities satisfying both
sports enthusiasts and those who looked for fun and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The participants, who are almost of all ages, from those just
months old to those in their 70s to 80s, were treated to sports
entertainment such as basketball, fencing, wind surfing and table
tennis.
</P>
<P>
Among those invited to the event were some of Hong Kong's top
athletes, active or retired, in such sports as table tennis,
swimming, bowling, rowing, fencing, athletics and soccer.
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights was a variety show which demonstrated the
vitality and talent of local sports stars, popular singers, TV
artists and veteran soccer players.
</P>
<P>
Chai Po Wa, a former member of the Chinese national table
tennis team and now Hong Kong's ace woman table tennis player,
said she felt the handover is great. "We are all Chinese, after
all," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said Hong Kong's table tennis benefited a lot from its
exchanges with China's inland, with its players visiting there
very often for pre-tournament training.
</P>
<P>
"The sport of table tennis here will surely get better and
better after the reunification," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wong Man Wai, a star football player during the 1960s and now a
soccer coach of the local sports club of South China, said he is
happy about the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has long been in close ties with China's inland in
the sport of football, he said, adding that more exchanges are
expected in the future.
</P>
<P>
Wong supports Hong Kong's participation in China's Eighth
National Games slated for the coming October in Shanghai. "By
participating in the games, Hong Kong players would come to know
how they are now lagging behind others and thus try to catch up,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the local game," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Reject IRA Disarmament in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin
McGuinness said today it would reject efforts to disarm its Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla backers until talks on a Northern
Ireland settlement made progress.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness said the surrender of guerrilla weapons was "the
biggest stumbling block to forward movement" in the Northern
Ireland peace process, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA, which has launched
a military campaign trying to end the British rule in the Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill
Clinton Saturday urged the IRA to give up violence so as to allow
Sinn Fein to join the multi-party peace talks under way in Belfast
for the past year.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was barred from the peace talks which were resumed on
June 3 after several-month adjournment because the IRA resisted a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In a speech commemorating Wolfe Tone, an 18th century Irish
nationalist, McGuinness asked for clarification from Britain and
Ireland on how the talks would tackle arms surrender.
</P>
<P>
"Decommissioning has not yet been removed as an obstacle to the
negotiations. What is the demand for decommissioning?" McGuinness
asked.
</P>
<P>
"It is the demand that the IRA surrender its weapons before
talks begin or before they can make progress. Those who make this
demand have no interest in making peace," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes UN Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait welcomed today the
U.N. Security Council resolution 1115, which urged Iraq to
implement all previous resolutions and condemned Iraqi attempts to
block U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
This came in a weekly cabinet meeting chaired by acting
Kuwaiti Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs
Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel said in a statement, which was
available here.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet expressed appreciation for the firm stand
of the Security Council member states concerning the sovereignty
of Kuwait, Al-Dekheel said, adding that Kuwait considered it a
clear message to urge Baghdad to respect the will of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved Saturday night
a resolution demanding the Iraqi government cooperate fully with
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that earlier this month Iraq barred the
U.N. inspectors from three sites suspected of containing weapons
banned under U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined that the fact that weapons of mass
destruction still remain in Iraq, as the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) insisted, has posed direct and indirect threats for the
comprehensive concept of the security of the region.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with the ambassadors of the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council Saturday, Kuwaiti Deputy Foreign
Minister Sulaiman Majed Al-Shaheen expressed such concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle today presided over the inauguration of his new party --
the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), calling on his party
members to be messengers of truth, justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands who attended the inaugural meeting of the
LCD in Maseru, Mokhehle, 78, asked them to intensify a campaign
of entrenching democracy at grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
He also urged his supporters to recruit members to ensure the
LCD won all the ballots in the January 1998 local government and
national elections.
</P>
<P>
The LCD's party flag with green, red and black color was
unveiled at the Sunday gathering.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle on June 7 resigned from the then ruling Basutoland
Congress Party (BCP), formed the LCD, and immediately transferred
governance to his new party, a move which plunged the country
into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opposiiton parties formed a coalition with Mokhehle's former
party in protest against what they said was an unusual move.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crime Blockade to Be Launched in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- South African anti-crime
activists said today they will launch a nation-wide blockade to
protest the spiralling rate of crime.
</P>
<P>
Journalists of the South African Guild of Motoring said in a
statement that the action is their brainchild to the government's
"lack of seriousness" in dealing with crime.
</P>
<P>
Large scale chaos is expected to grip the country Tuesday if
thousands of motorists respond to their call to blockade roads
and streets, they said.
</P>
<P>
The organisers claimed the action is expected to be the biggest
anti-crime demonstration ever held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's major roads, including the busy number one
national highway, will be blockad by motorists and truckers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a peaceful, non-confrontational people's protest,"
the organisers said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the blockade was "not intended to create
havoc" in the country but was merely meant to register a message
to the government to "act against criminals".
</P>
<P>
Dubbing their action as a "blockade against crime", the journalists
claimed that the government was "not serious about stopping crime" so
they had decided to take the law in their own hands.
</P>
<P>
The South African government said last month that it will
inflict heavier punishment on violent crimes.

Qatar and Bahrain.

They said that Fatchett would be using the trip, which will
also take him to the UAE and Kuwait, to familiarize himself with

<HEADLINE> World Power Leaders Plan to Complete Denver Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven
industrialized countries and Russia today are preparing to
conclude a three-day summit which focused on global political and
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.,
Russia, Germany and the European Union (EU) are meeting today for
the third and final day to complete a communique this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A draft of the communique, which may have minor changes,
covered global economic, social and political issues.
</P>
<P>
"The process of globalization, a major factor underlying the
growth for world prosperity in the last 50 years, is now advancing
rapidly and broadly," said the document.
</P>
<P>
"More openness and integration across the global economy create
opportunities fo increased prosperity," said the final communique.
"Our task, as we enter the 21st century, is to make the most of
these opportunities," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The communique cited the global challenges as aging population,
environment protection, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,
anti-personnel landmines, trans-national organized crimes,
counterterrorism and the United Nations reform.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also planned to express their determination to
revive the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process faces a crisis, and we are determined to
reinject momentum into it," the communique said. "Restoring the
sense of security and confidence among Israelis and Palestinians
is essential."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Saturday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the challenges need the efforts of
every country and no one nation can resolve the issues alone.
</P>
<P>
"We face new threats that respect no borders and that no one
state can defeat alone," she told reporters. "The eight are
meeting those threats together."
</P>
<P>
"Our joint message to terrorists is this: you have nowhere to
run and nowhere to hide," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of computer and telecommunications technology
has created new opportunities for criminals and new challenges for
law enforcement," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the eight countries will combine knowledge and
resources to enhance their ability to "locate, identify and
prosecute high-tech criminals."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also discussed the situation in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (Zaire), the Republic of Congo
(Brazzaville), Haiti and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"All Afghan parties and concerned countries should abide by the
provisions of recent resolutions on Afghanistan adopted by the U.N.
Security Council and General Assembly," the communique declared.
</P>
<P>
Albright said, "We called on all parties in Afghanistan to stop
the fighting and work toward forming a broad-based government that
will protect the rights of all Afghans."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Nigeria-China
Friendship Association, Chief V.N. Chibundu today hailed the
return of Hong Kong to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the former Nigerian ambassador to
China said the return of Hong Kong to its motherland is a good
example in resolving international disputes through peaceful
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Chief Chibundu said the approach of "one country, two systems"
advocated by Deng Xiaoping shows a great wisdom.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that with a high autonomy promised by
the approach, Hong Kong will be even more prosperous after its
return.
</P>
<P>
Chief Chibundu welcomed the agreement of the Chinese and
Portuguese governments on the return of Macao to China on
December 20, 1999, in the same spirit.
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to the resolution of the Taiwan
issue equally through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The chairman recalled the visit to Nigeria by Chinese Premier
Li Peng a month ago, saying that it is good to the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Chief Chibundu said his association has been working and will
continue to work for the establishment of more intimate
relationship between the governments and peoples of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The association, established in 1994 and already with over 300
members with a branch in Abia State in southeast Nigeria, will soon
launch another branch in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, the chairman
said.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Says French Army in "Full Decomposition" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- President of the extreme-right
National Front (FN) Jean-Marie Le Pen said today that the French
army is "in full decomposition."
</P>
<P>
In a speech to 3,000 people meeting for the "rustic festival"
organized by a veterans' group in Neuvy-sur-Barangeon, central
France, Le Pen said that one cannot run an army with "less than 5
percent of the gross national product."
</P>
<P>
On France's full return to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Le Pen said the plan was "ill-understood"
because "the reason to be of NATO, that is the Soviet military
threat, had for a long time disappeared."
</P>
<P>
"NATO has today become the military arm of the new world order
payable to the United States of America and it is the policy of
the United States of America, at the profit of America, that is
practised," he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored that the nuclear tests by France in the South
Pacific were stopped "before the objectives were attained" and
that France "renounced in fact a modern nuclear force, whose
modernization cannot be realized only with a series of
supplementary tests."
</P>
<P>
"By renouncing the modernization of all the arms capable of
intercepting the missiles which could target our country, we have
in fact submitted the keys of our independence and our security to
others than ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Declaring that France no longer has "the military means as a
great power," Le Pen said that the French army before the 1994
announcement of the law on military reform was "in a state of
indescribable disaster."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his support for the plan by President Jacques
Chirac to professionalize the army to build an army "with the
reserve capable of ensuring operational defense of the territory."
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the reduction of conscription, which resulted
from the army professionalization, during "a full crisis of
unemployment."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Parties to Talk with Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The alliance of opposition parties
in Zambia voiced its commitment here today to dialog with the
ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) to iron out
problems of good governance and the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Rodger Chongwe of the Liberal Progressive Front, who read a
joint statement by 12 opposition parties, said Zambia will not
achieve sustainable development in the absence of meaningful
dialog and consensus on the major issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the alliance demanded that the 1996 elections be
nullified because "they were fraudulently conducted" and an
interim government be put in place.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also demanded the repeal of the 1996
constitution amandment bill, which barred former President
Kenneth Kaunda from running for the presidency in the elections
held last November.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the press conference at which the opposition

<HEADLINE> W. African States United on Sierra Leonean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors to the United Nations
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have
decided to maintain a common front in dealing with the current
crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The official News Agency of Nigeria reported today that the
ambassadors of all the 16 ECOWAS member countries reached the
agreement in a meeting in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting presided over by Nigeria's permanent
representative to the United Nations, Ibrahim Gambari, endorsed
the current diplomatic efforts to end the crisis after the May 25
coup.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassadors also expressed strong support for the
decision by African leaders that all necessary means be used to
reverse the coup, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report remarked that the meeting is meant to be a counter
offensive to the diplomatic efforts of the coup authority to seek
support from the UN.
</P>
<P>
A Dr. John Karefa Smart has been sent to New York by the coup
leader Major Johnny Paul Koromah. He has failed to meet the UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan but did meet with officials of the
UN Department of Political Affairs.

<HEADLINE> PNA Condemns Israeli Decision to Confiscate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) today accused the Israeli authorities
concerned of trying to confiscate 20 VIP cards from senior
Palestinian officials under the pretext of inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in East Jerusalem, Hassan Asfour, Palestinian coordinator of
peace negotiations, said that it is not strange for Israel to
adopt any practice to show its hostility towards the
Palestinians. He warned that the move will ruin what he called
the spirit of peace.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Deputy Justice Minister Ibrahim Al-Doghmah noted
that it is a very dangerous decision that violates the
regulations of the signed agreements between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Doghmah stressed that according to the signed agreements
"Israel alone has no right at all to withdraw the card."
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report quoting security sources
as saying that the 20 senior Palestinian officials including PNA
Justice Minister Freih Abu Midein and some members of the
legislative Palestinian Council are on the Israeli blacklist.
</P>
<P>
The sources claimed that Israel holds them responsible for
what it called inciting recent unrest in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip as well as for attacks on Jewish settlers and
Palestinian land dealers selling Arab land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian stone-throwers
continued for its seventh day Saturday following the U.S. Congress
decision made on June 10 to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided
capital of Israel and allocate 100 million U.S. dollars to move
the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the controversial city.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Israel rescinded the VIP card of
Col. Tawfik Tirawi, head of the Palestinian General Security
Service in the West Bank, whom the Israelis held responsible for
the alleged murder of three Palestinian land dealers.
</P>
<P>
The VIP card enables the holder to enter Israel from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip freely and to cross into Jordan and back
with no restrictions.

<P>

multi-national troops of the African peace keeping force and the
Mutineering soldiers, sources monitored said here today.

<HEADLINE> Coupmaker Confident of Peaceful End to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra Leone
said today it is confident of reaching a peaceful solution to the
crisis in the country after talks with a high-level Ghanaian
delegation in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Armed Forces Revolution Council (AFRC), which
seized power in a coup on May 25, "is now firmly convinced that
the much talked about military intervention is unlikely," the
state radio said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day visit by the four-man Ghanaian delegation
"represented a significant step towards the opening of dialogue
on the Sierra Leone situation," AFRC Chairman Major Johnny Paul
Koroma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue has contributed towards narrowing the
communication gap between the (military) government and the
international community," said Koroma, who was sworn in as head
of State Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped 'the task which Ghana has undertaken will
finally lead to the restoration of peace, security and
constitutional order in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Koroma stressed his government will sustain the dialogue with
Ghana as well as other countries of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) "to find an urgent and acceptable
solution to the present impasse" in the country, which is a
member of ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian delegation, headed by Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Gbeho, was reported to leave for Accra, Ghana, this
afternoon with a personal message from Koroma to Ghanaian
President Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Gbeho said at the end of
the visit that Ghana wants to see a return of democracy in Sierra
Leone through negotiations rather than military force.
</P>
<P>
"Ghana still supports the Organization of African Unity
decision reached in Harare, Zimbabwe recently, calling on all
countries to do their utmost to restore the consitutional order
in Sierra Leone," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the best way to resolve the crisis is by
diplomatic means, to reach a negotiated settlement, rather than
by fighting," said Gbeho.
</P>
<P>
Both Gbeho and Koroma refused to disclose the substance of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the report quoted sources close to the talks as
saying that the coup leaders had discussed the idea of staying in
power for only seven or eight months, instead of two years they
have announced, if an international peacekeeping force, rather
than the ECOWAS peacekeeping force, was deployed in the tiny west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The military junta has promised to establish a broad-based
government made up of all parties concerned, including the former
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front, but is firmly opposed
to the return of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who is now
in neighboring Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Suspends in Bangui After Chadian Troops' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in the capital of the
Central African Republic, Bangui, suspended this evening after
what was described as "a muscular offensive" by Chadian soldiers
serving the African peacekeeping force MISAB upon former
mutineers.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted witnesses as saying that
"thick and intensive" shootings turned into "a real rainfall of
shellings" from the Chadian troops, who used 106 mm cannons and
heavy machineguns mounted on military vans.
</P>
<P>
The mutineers tried to shoot back with anti-tank rockets, but
without success, said the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
The latest account of casualties listed 23 dead and 70 wounded
since fighting broke out Friday between mutineers and the MISAB in
Bangui. The French embassy was hit by shellings from mutineers
which wounded seven Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
Heavy casualties were inflicted upon civilians in today's
fighting, in which only one French soldier and one Chadian soldier
were wounded while an unspecified number of mutineers were killed
or wounded, according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
Chadian soldiers pursued the mutineers and drove them out of
the positions they took earlier today on the outskirts of the
Brussels and Kouanga districts of Bangui, and many youths who
supported the mutiny fled town.
</P>
<P>
French military helicopters flew over the city to guarantee
security of "big axis" of roads in Bangui and French soldiers
blocked the mutineers staying in the Kassai barracks from breaking
out to join the fighting, reported AFP.
</P>
<P>
The mutineers said that they were "disappointed over and
awakened by the behavior" of French troops, who they said backed
the MISAB in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The president of the international mediation committee for the
Central African Republic, former Malian President Amadou Toumani
Toure, did not show up today in Bangui as he was expected to.
</P>
<P>
Gabonese President Omar Bango, who was described as "the dean
of African heads of state" for solving the Central Africa
conflict, today appealed to all involved to "let triumph" good
sense and respect the Bangui Accord signed in February to arrange
a political solution.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Troops Not to Be Deployed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has assured Liberians and the international
community that its troops currently operating in Liberia will not
be deployed for any mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG statement issued at the weekend in Monrovia, capital
of Liberia, said the assurance was given to allay fears that
ECOMOG troops might be deployed to Sierra Leone for another
mission, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some ECOMOG troops were sent to Sierra Leone shortly after the
May 25 coup that overthrew the elected civilian government led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
However, they were mostly soldiers from member countries of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
"We have not moved troops from Liberia," Malu asserted, saying
that the ECOMOG High Command was "very sensitive" about the
number of troops in Liberia and would not undertake any
reduction.
</P>
<P>
According to him, only a few technical officials have been
sent to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, to assist in the
establishment of an effective communication network for the
mission to restore Kabbah's government since the commencement of
the crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
Malu said ECOWAS would convene a meeting in Guinea to
fine-tune its plan to restore democracy in Sierra Leone, where
talks between a high-level Ghanaian delegation and the ruling
military government ended Saturday night was reported to bring
confidence to the junta of a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said that the four warships sent by Nigeria,
the main contributor of ECOMOG, to Freetown had withdrawn from
the territorial waters of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The retreat was made on Friday in order to give a conducive
atmosphere for the crisis to be resolved by negotiations, it
said.
</P>
<P>
On the on-going political process towards Liberia's scheduled
presidential and legitimate elections on July 19, Malu said
ECOMOG was monitoring the conduct of the political campaign and
would adjust its security arrangement as the situation demanded.
</P>
<P>
He also gave an assurance that the armed force of Liberia
would be restructured into a balanced and professional force that
would be of benefit to all Liberians.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Police Force today
showed to the media its new insignia and other special articles.
</P>
<P>
The insignia and more than ten police articles, including the
cap badge, buttons, and lapel and shoulder badges, will replace
those currently worn by the 27,000-strong Royal Hong Kong Police
Force at zero hour, July 1, when China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the new police insignia, the pattern of the bauhinia, a
flower representing Hong Kong, has replaced that of a crown, and
the words "Hong Kong Police," in both Chinese and English, have
taken the place of "Royal Hong Kong Police" found on the old
insignia.
</P>
<P>
At the top of the insignia is the bauhinia supported by two
garlands in the shape of a circle. Within the circle are five
skyscrapers representing Central, the business center of Hong
Kong, and sea waves. The streamer beneath the garlands bears the
words "Hong Kong Police" in Chinese and English.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Economy Linked with whole world: Banking Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Hong Kong is no
longer one of Hong Kong's six million residents, but one covering
all time zones, a senior American banking official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Its economy should serve as a market for 1.2 billion people in
the inland areas, and be based on global competition, said Antony
K Leung, managing director of the Chase Manhattan Bank in Hong
Kong, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy today takes Hong Kong as its center and is
closely linked with neighboring regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing industrial development as an example, Leung said, Hong
Kong devotes itself to sectors with a high added value, such as
market management, finance and design, while its production
process is completed in other areas in the same time zone.
</P>
<P>
To date, Hong Kong-funded plants have employed over five
million people in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will maintain its status as an international
financial center in the foreseeable future, said Leung, who has
been working with foreign-funded banks for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view hat foreign companies are confident that
the "one country, two systems" policy will be implemented to the
letter. They will continue to invest in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the best place where foreign investors can do
business with China, he said, adding that they can do business in
Hong Kong instead of traveling to all parts of China by
themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese-funded companies can find their business
partners in Hong Kong because so many transnational companies have
set up their regional headquarters in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investors have a good understanding of conditions in
China. Compared London, New York and Singapore, Hong Kong is the
best place for Chinese enterprises to raise overseas funds, Leung
said, predicting that major inland companies will be listed in
Hong Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
He is of the view education is crucial to enabling Hong Kong to
retain its favorable position in global competition.
</P>
<P>
From a long-term point of view, the quality of professionals is
essential to maintaining competitiveness of a region or a country,
said Leung, who will be a member of the Executive Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Hong Kong would become an attractive
place not only for professionals in Asia, but also for scientists
and experts of Chinese origin in North America and other parts of
the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think more professionals will create greater wealth, provide
more opportunities, and make Hong Kong more competitive," he said.

MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Defying a ban by the Supreme Court,
a non-governmental group today submitted to the Philippine
Commission on Election (Comelec) a petition backed by 5 million
people for constitutional change to let President Fidel Ramos run
for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Braving heavy rains, hundreds of members of the People's
Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA) marched to
the Comelec office this afternoon to present the 5 million
signatures.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, established by Ramos' supporters in late 1996, has
been seeking to change the 1987 constitution to lift the term
limits of all the elected government officials, including Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Comelec officials accepted the signatures which were
transported by several trucks. But they stressed that the poll
body can not act on the petition since it is permanently
restrained by the Supreme Court from entertaining any petition on
charter change.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the high tribunal upheld an earlier ruling that
there is currently no enabling law for constitutional change in
the country, actually killing the charter change drive.
</P>
<P>
In its decision given this March, the court ordered the PIRMA
to stop its drive to collect signatures needed for demanding a
plebiscite on charter change. It also ordered the Comelec not to
entertain any petition for change to the country's 1987
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the people could introduce amendments
to the charter through a people's initiative which could initially
be done by submitting a petition backed by at least 12 percent of
the country's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The signatures will still have to be verified by the Comelec
before it decides to schedule a constitutional plebiscite in 60 to
90 days upon determining the petition's sufficiency in form and
substance.
</P>
<P>
The constitution, which was promulgated in 1987 after the
ouster of former president Ferdinand Marcos to prevent
dictatorship, provides that the president can only serve one
six-year single term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, whose term of office will end in June 1998, has sent
conflicting messages about the charter change issue.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly stressed his determination to step down
when his term of office expires. But meanwhile, he said he
supports the people's right to change the charter and went further
recently by urging Congress to pass a law to enable the charter
change.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Speaker of the House of Representatives de Venecia
said house members of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party will be called
to a caucus before the next congressional session opens on July 28
to decide on any moves to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said any decision to push for convening Congress
into a constitutional assembly to amend the constitution must be
discussed among party members.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, a possible contender for presidency in 1998,
reiterated his stand that amending the charter at this time is not
proper and that he favors change in the constitution only after
1998.
</P>
<P>
"It will be self-serving if we amend the constitution now," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Opposes Burial of Lenin's Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, Russia's lower
house of parliament, today called on the Russian authorities and
citizens to oppose any attempt to remove the mummified body of
the Soviet Union's founder Vladimir Lenin from the mausoleum in
Moscow's Red Square.
</P>
<P>
The communist group in the State Duma put forward a draft
resolution calling plans to remove Lenin's body from its Red
Square mausoleum as a violation of international norms and the
Russian constitution.
</P>
<P>
Among the 240 deputies of the 450-member State Duma who voted,
232 backed the resolution and eight were against.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin last month proposed holding a
nationwide referendum on whether to remove Lenin's corpse and give
it a Christian burial, hoping the vote would put an end to the
long-standing dispute.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and the democrats say it is un-Christian to keep a dead
body on display and argue that Lenin had wanted to be buried.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian communists strongly oppose the idea,
saying that forces around the president wanted to "re-write
history". They also say that Lenin, who died in 1924, never
expressed any wish as to the fate of his body.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Buy More Canadian Bonds in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners resumed their investment
in Canadian portfolio securities in April with 3 billion U.S.
dollars in purchases, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The purchases were entirely directed to Canadian bonds as
foreigners sold money market paper and stocks, the federal agency
said.
</P>
<P>
After selling off 1.1 billion dollars of Canadian bonds in
March, foreign investors came back with purchases of 4.2 billion
dollars in April, their largest investment since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Corporations and federal enterprises accounted for almost all
the new issues sold abroad in April," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canadian investors purchased their smallest
amount of foreign securities in 10 months, adding a mere 0.2
billion dollars in April.
</P>
<P>
This was well below the monthly average of over 1.4 billion
dollars invested in foreign securities over the previous nine
months, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Securities Market to Continue to Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- After Hong Kong returns to China
on July 1, the local securities market will not only maintain key
elements which have made it successful in the past but also
benefit from new business opportunities opened by the historic
return.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Dr. Edgar Cheng, Chairman of the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd., at the Far Eastern Economic
Review Annual Conference "Countdown to 1997: Roadmap to Hong
Kong's Continued Prosperity," which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's return to China should have the effect of adding a
large new dimension to our market without taking away any of its
existing international and regional role," Cheng told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Describing the handover as an event that can only bring
positive effects, Cheng noted that, with the backing of the
economic hinterland of China, Hong Kong should be better
positioned than now to increase the breadth and sophistication of
its range of financial products and services, thus enhancing its
"critical mass" as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"If a stock market reflects the state of public confidence,
then Hong Kong is an extremely confident place," he said, adding
that the capitalization of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has grown
by 15 folds since its unification in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current bull market is being driven by a
number of economic factors, such as Hong Kong's strong economic
fundamentals which are now being more widely appreciated.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps most important, there is the removal of uncertainty --
as the shape of things to come becomes clearer and the transition
is seen to be going more smoothly than was widely predicted," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present business confidence in Hong Kong
remains high, and that local businesses have "clearly cast their
vote by staying and planning to expand."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the world's seventh largest,
with 610 listed companies having a total capitalization of 524
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the listed companies are based in Hong Kong, and there
are 30 inland-registered enterprises. Daily turnover at the
exchange averaged 1,421 million US dollars in the first five
months of this year, up from 727 million US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that Hong Kong is well placed in Asia for its
traditions of openness and international orientation and that the
Hong Kong stock market is the most accessible in Asia, with the
largest foreign membership east of London.
</P>
<P>
"Provided we can retain our cosmopolitan culture and free flow
of information, I believe the 'gravitational pull' of Hong Kong as
a financial center is likely to be increased by our return to
China," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Ex-President Ordered to Return Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo and ex-militarians found guilty for 1979's military coup
and the Kwangju incident have been ordered to return pensions they
received thus far after leaving public posts, a spokesman of the
Government Employee Pension Corporation (GEPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The GEPC handed out the order to former President Roh and seven
ex-military generals involved in the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
The step was taken on the basis of the Pension Law banning the
disbursement of pensions to those given prison terms or heavier
penalties for such crimes as treason, rebellion or acts
benefitting the enemy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that they have received 70 percent of
their last salary in retirement pensions each month so far, the
amounts they are supposed to return in lump sums will range from
112,360 U.S. dollars to 258,427 U.S. dollars in most cases.
</P>
<P>
Former President Roh is obliged to return 44,944 U.S. dollars
for the pension he received before he held the post as a cabinet
minister and then was elected to succeed President Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
Ex-president Chun, however, was excluded from the list because
he held an elective post as president right after he left active
military services.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April's final trials, former Presidents Chun and Roh
were ruled life imprisonment and 17-year term in prison
respectively for their leading roles in the 1979 military coup and
the 1980 suppression of civil uprising in Kwangju City. Other
co-defendants were sentenced prison terms of 3.5 to 8 years.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents were also fined hundreds of million
dollars for accepting bribes from business tycoons while in
office.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone companies Ericsson
and SmarTone decided to team up to provide specialized Global
System for Mobile (GSM) network operations support for Ericsson in
China.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson and SmarTone recently singed a consulting partnership
agreement on which the latter will provide support for Ericsson's
operation in China starting from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, SmarTone will provide selected constancy
network services, designed to complement Ericsson's existing
nationwide support structure. These services include network
optimization, tuning, operation and maintenance to ensure optimal
utilization from a capacity, quality and coverage point of view.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson, a leading supplier of GSM infrastructure equipment
and services to the China telecommunications market, chose to form
a partnership with SmarTone because of the latter's technical
excellence and considerable experience in GSM network.
</P>
<P>
SmarTone was the first company in the region to launch the now
highly popular and advanced GSM standard for digital mobile
services, and has one of the largest and finest engineering teams
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, SmarTone was the
first mobile communications company in Asia to introduce the
sophisticated GSM standard for digital mobile services.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Indices Rise Moderately in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Composite Consumer Price
Index (CPI)
in Hong Kong, based on the combined expenditure pattern of all
households, showed a increase rate of 5.8 percent in May, slightly
higher than that of 5.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The CPI (A) gained a year-one-year rate of increase of 5.8
percent in May, higher than that of 5.2 percent in the previous
month, figures released today by the Census and Statistics
Department show.
</P>
<P>
And the CPI (B) recorded a year-on-year rate of increase of 5.7
percent, also higher than that of 5.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The faster rises in the CPI (A) and CPI (B) were mainly
attributed to relatively high prices of some fresh food items,
according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding rate of increase in the Hang Seng CPI,
however, dropped to 6.0 percent in May from that of 6.4 percent in
April, due to slower increase in the prices of outer clothing.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April, the CPI (A) and CPI (B) rose 0.3 percent
and 0.4 percent respectively, and the corresponding rise for the
Hang Seng CPI and the Composite CPI were 0.5 percent and 0.4
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first five months together, the increase in the CPI
(A) and CPI (B) averaged at 6.0 percent and 5.9 percent
respectively over a year earlier, while corresponding increases
for the Hang Seng CPI and the Composite CPI were 6.2 percent and
5.9 percent respectively.

president of the technicians and mechanics' labor union said.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the company's flight schedule relied
entirely on overtime work, which often meant employees having to
work an additional six to ten hours after their regular eight-hour
shift.
</P>
<P>
"We are working our normal eight-hour shifts to press for the
hiring of seasonal staff who are necessary for maintaining the
normal flights schedule," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Aviation said today it would announce within the next
few hours a new flight schedule for the next fortnight, reducing
the number of flights to and from the Greek islands.

BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Wu Bangguo today told
a meeting on household electric appliances in Beijing that local
enterprises should work to make China one of the world's major

<HEADLINE> Chinese Dolphin Chosen as Mascot for Hong Kong Handover </HEADLINE>

Celebrations
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese dolphin, a precious
mammal under the class-one State protection, has been chosen as
the mascot for celebrations of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for choosing the precious species,
known for its mild temper and cleverness, as the mascot.
</P>
<P>
First, the dolphin, which is 2.2 to 2.5 meters long and weighs
over 230 kilograms, can only be found along the coast and bays in
south China, thus can well symbolize Hong Kong as an important
seaport city.
</P>
<P>
Second, the name of the Chinese dolphin, who swims back to the
Pearl River for reproduction each year, demonstrates that Hong
Kong is an inseparable part of China and ought to return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Third, in the habit of living in groups, the dolphin implies
the eagerness of the Hong Kong compatriots to return to the
embrace of their motherland.

<HEADLINE> Deputy Transport Secretary on HK Rail Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's rail network needs
not only continued development but also a long-term strategy in
response to changing needs of the community and the increasing
population.
</P>
<P>
This is a view expressed by Paul Leung, deputy secretary for
transport, at a news briefing held today at the HK Convention and
Exhibition Center and attended by 40 foreign and local reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Railways are vital to Hong Kong's transport network, and
essential to continued economic, social, land and housing
development," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Hong Kong has some 6.3 million people and the
population is expected to grow to 8.2 million in the year 2016,
adding great pressure to the mass transit system, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Railway Development Strategy" announced in
December 1994, Leung said, Hong Kong has been giving priority to
three projects: the Western Corridor Railway, the Mass Transit
Railway (MTR) Tseung Kwan O Extension, and the Ma On Shan-Tai Wai
rail link/Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR) extension.
</P>
<P>
These projects are scheduled for completion in the early years
of the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Leung said, there have been other long-term
proposals, including a rail link serving the future Southeast
Kowloon reclamation area, an east-west rail line serving the
future Central and Wanchai reclamation areas, and an MTR extension
from Sheung Wan to the future Green Island reclamation area.
</P>
<P>
On rail link between Hong Kong and inland areas, Leung said
there have been through trains running between Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Further steps will be taken to speed up
rail transport at the Lo Wu checkpoint linking Shenzhen and Hong
Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that, to relieve traffic pressure, a new
cross-harbor tunnel, the fourth in Hong Kong, is under serious
"consideration."
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that by 1998 Hong Kong will have a
140-kilometer-long rail network.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's rail network transports 32 percent of the total
passenger volume carried by its public transport system. It
carries 3.2 million passengers a day. The network also carries 90
percent of all passengers who travel between Hong Kong and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, an estimated 50 million people are expected to travel
between Hong Kong and the mainland via Lo Wu.

<HEADLINE> 65 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-five rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the military
operations staged by the Turkish security forces in southeastern
Turkey during the past two days.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the office of the Emergency
Regional Rule said that the Turkish government troops wiped out
33 PKK militants in Gariptepe region of Baskale town in Van
province bordering Iran, 26 at Kazan valley in Cukurca town of
Hakkari province linking northern Iraq and six in Genc town of
Bingol province.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the government troops had also
wounded 10 PKK members in Baskale town of Van province and
captured six others in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Two PKK guerrillas surrendered to the security forces in the
region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces have been carrying military
operations against the PKK both in southeastern Turkey and
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said
here today that the Turkish government troops are continuing
their cross-border military operations, which started on May 14
in pursuit of the PKK rebels in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish armed forces would continue their
mission in northern Iraq until they achieve their goal, adding
that Turkey would not keep its presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that a large number of Turkish troops had
withdrawn from its cross-border military campaign in northern
Iraq and some Turkish troops are still staying in the region.
But he failed to give the number of the Turkish troops who
remain in the region.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Turkish government troops launched the massive
military incursion on May 14 under a request for help by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mesud Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has said that at least 2,500 PKK rebels
had been killed in the latest military operation.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for
autonomy, which has claimed over 23,000 lives in eastern and
southeastern Turkey.

BRUSSELS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Foreign
Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said today countries
wishing to join the EU must be committed to the principles of
democracy and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"The EU cannot and will not accept as a member any country
which is not fully committed to the principles of rule of law and
democracy," the commissioner said at a conference in Noorddijk,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
He said the process of joining the EU requires an independent
judiciary and changes in national legislation in applicant
countries.
</P>
<P>
Education, training and a gradual evolution of daily practice
would be needed to bring about these changes.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania have applied for
EU membership. Cyprus and Turkey also hope to join.
</P>
<P>
However, failure to reach agreement at the EU's Amsterdam
summit last week on the Union's major institutional reforms to
prepare the bloc for eastward expansion, has cast a shadow over
the enlargement process.

breezed past Romanian Dinu Pescariu to advance to the second round

LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British shotputter Paul Edwards
failed in a High Court bid on Monday to lift a four-year drugs ban.
</P>
<P>
His failure meas that he could not compete at the Athens World

<HEADLINE> US MFN Debate Harms US Interests, Chinese Scholar Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States' annual debate
about extending China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status is
not in the US's long-term interests and "affects the healthy
development of trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries," Chen Wenjing, a senior economist and vice-president of
the Chinese Academy of International Trade, told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that MFN is merely an ordinary and normal trade
relationship between countries, rather than something involving
special treatment. He said that using MFN as a "favor" to put
pressure on China every year hinders not only the US's normal
trade and economic exchanges with China, but also the smooth
development of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He criticized some US congressmen for making China's MFN a
"political lever" in their partisan struggle in Congress at the
cost of normal trade relations with China and of the interests of
the US people.
</P>
<P>
According to a US Government estimate, the cost to the US of
stopping China's MFN status will be 170,000 jobs and 500 million
US dollars added to Chinese products. Those who suffer most will
be low-income Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that some US congressmen fail to understand
China's real situation. China, he said, has lowered the general
level of tariffs to 23 percent and eliminated many non-tariff
barriers, and it also made a commitment in the Individual Action
Plan at the APEC Manila meeting in 1996 to reaching in 2020 the
trade and investment liberalization goal set by the organization.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that, "China cannot do everything overnight, and
will not do what is beyond its capacity." What the country can do
is to open the domestic market step by step and only in this way,
it can develop steadily and create a healthy and stable
environment for investment, he explained.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Clashes Displace 10,000 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 10,000 residents were
forced to abandon their homes in western Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, due to renewed clashes between government troops and
Muslim rebels in the last few days, the Philippine News Agency
said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second massive displacement in Pikit town,
Maguindanao province, since the first quarter of 1991 when armed
men massacred several persons due to land conflict.
</P>
<P>
Pikit Mayor Motin Malingcon, who estimated the number of the
displaced at 10,000 to 30,000, was quoted as saying the evacuees
came from eight villages around the town, where soldiers and Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels have clashed several times
since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the evacuees trooped by foot to the town proper and are
now housed in evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the Sixth Infantry
Division, said the evacuees were not direct victims of the armed
conflicts in the town.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said some of the evacuees, whose homes were relatively
far from the site of conflict, voluntarily fled their homes on
fears that the armed conflict might escalate in their villages.
</P>
<P>
The evacuees badly need food, medicine, mats, blankets and
clothing as the condition in evacuation centers is fast
deteriorating due to congestion, a social worker said.
</P>
<P>
The departments of health, social welfare and development and
the church have begun to provide help to the displaced.
</P>
<P>
Since last Tuesday, at least 23 people have been killed in
sporadic fighting between the government troops and the MILF
guerrillas in Pikit town.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out after the MILF rebels took hostage 43 oil
workers in the province last Monday, who were soon rescued by the
military.
</P>
<P>
In the latest clash on Sunday morning, two marines were killed
and five others wounded when the MILF rebels attacked the
government marine troops in Sultan Sa Barongis town, the military
confirmed today.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Alerted of Attack from Mercenaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 23 (Xinhua) - The military junta in Sierra
Leone today alerted neighbouring Guinea of an attack by
mercenaries against both Sierra Leone and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The mercenaries, said a statement broadcast by state radio,
were financed by former S.Leonean Deputy Defence Minister Hinga
Norma and some supporters of the ousted government headed by
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Toppled S.Leonean President Tejan Kabbah and at least six
of his former ministers including Norma are now in exile
in Conakry.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the mercenaries who will attack
from Sierra Leone "would wear Guinean military uniforms, an act
which may likely force the Guinean authorities to respond
militarily against Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
"The attack will be initiated against Guinea, who has adopted
a neutral stand on the Sierra Leone situation and who is also
against military intervention", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting which began Sunday evening in the
southern town of Koribundo, continued today betweeen a group of
Kamajors and soldiers of the 38 battallion, military sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Kamajors armed with rockets and grenades, attacked the troops
from three fronts but were repelled.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people including eight civilians, four soldiers and six
Kamajors died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kamajors unrest is reported in five of the 12 districts in the
east and south of the country.

ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish gendarme today seized
40.43 kilograms of pure heroin in southeastern Turkey bordering
Iran and arrested four persons involved.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said that through a
tip-off, the country's Gendarme Commandership teams detained two
people in Caltikuru village of Hakkari province, who are in
connection with drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Following the confessions of the suspects, the gendarme teams
found the heroin, worth some 700,000 U.S. dollars, buried in the
village and captured another two suspected smugglers including
one Iranian citizen, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Turkish police seized 4.4 tonnes of heroin,
accounting for 40 percent of the world's total haul, 12.3 tonnes
of hashish, 233 kilograms of opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine and
1,157 kilograms of base morphine.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Education Should Aim At Men, Says UN Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Men as well as women needed to
take responsibility for protecting themselves and their partners
from AIDS in developing countries, a United Nations AIDS expert
said today.
</P>
<P>
Education aimed at women on the grounds that men were
considered too irresponsible to protect their partners needed to
be rethought, Purnima Mane told reporters in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Mane, planning coordinator with the Geneva-based UN HIV-AIDS
program, said women had been urged to take responsibility for
condom use, negotiating about sex and mutual monogamy with their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
But few women actually had control over such matters, with most
decisions about sex made by men.
</P>
<P>
"For a large number of women in developing countries, the only
single risk factor for them is being married," said Mane, who is
from Bombay.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have always seen men as irresponsible, emotionally
immature. This epidemic was seen as too important and women are
important so we needed to focus on women."
</P>
<P>
"I am not disagreeing entirely with the argument that we need
to focus on women, but I feel very strongly that we need to bring
men in and make them feel responsible for protecting women and for
protecting themselves," Mane said.
</P>
<P>
So aiming AIDS prevention messages at men had to start when
they were extremely young, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mane cited the example of a project in Gambia in which men were
being helped to talk to their sons about sexual risks.

<HEADLINE> New Airport For Southeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An initial flight ceremony was held
today at the Changle International Airport in the capital of
Fujian Province, a state key project, which will be able to handle
6.5 million passengers and 200,000 tons of cargoes annually upon
completion.
</P>
<P>
The airport is being built in several phases. Work on the
first-phase began in June of 1994, and the airport can now handle
3.5 million passengers yearly.
</P>
<P>
The 800-ha. airport can also handle the world's largest
aircraft. Local aviation officials say that Yixu, the city's other
airport, which was used for civil and military aircraft, had
reached its capacity, meaning that a larger airport was extremely
important.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, two million people passed through the
airport in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's event, vice-premier Zou Jiahua, said that
the new airport will help with reforms and opening-up in Fujian,
which is an old revolutionary base, as well as the home of many
overseas Chinese. He said he hopes that an effort will be made to
build it into a first-class airport.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin wrote the name of the airport.

<HEADLINE> Tokai Bank Foresees Lower Japanese GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The rise in Japan's consumption tax
from three to five percent in April this year will bring the
Japanese economy's real growth rate for fiscal 1997 to only 1.1
percent, lower than the government target of 1.9 percent, a
leading bank said today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) growth will
slow down to 1.1 percent for the year starting April 1 from the
previous fiscal year's 3.0 percent, a Kyodo news report quoted
Nagoya-based Tokai Bank as forecasting.
</P>
<P>
The commercial bank said real GDP growth will further
decelerate to 1.0 percent in fiscal 1998 as the government makes
deeper cuts in budgetary expenditure to try to rectify Japan's
fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted the yen-dollar exchange rate would average
115 yen in fiscal 1997, a level signifying a mild depreciation of
the yen against the dollar from the previous fiscal year's 112.6
yen.
</P>
<P>
A weak yen generally bolsters the Japanese economy as it helps
increase the international competitiveness of the country's
export-oriented industries such as automakers and electronics
equipment makers.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1998, the bank forecasts the dollar will weaken
modestly to 110 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Derek Fatchett, a British
minister of state at the Foreign Office, arrived here today for a
two-day visit to Kuwait on promoting bilateral relations and
the latest developments in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett is expected to hold separate talks with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, acting Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Speaker of
Kuwaiti National Assembly Ahmad Al-Sadoun and other ministers,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that Fatchett would also discuss with Kuwaiti
officials obstacles facing the pending arms deal worth up to 150
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Britain was told more than a year ago that Kuwait would buy
British surface-to-surface Sea Skua missiles aimed at arming eight
fast patrol boats. But Kuwaiti parliamentary members raised
questions as to why the government decided to buy expensive
British weapons instead of cheaper ones offered by France.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett is on a Gulf tour that already took him to Oman and
will also take him to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Oman Sultan Qaboos Bin Said Sunday, Fatchett
reaffirmed his country's commitment to economic and security
cooperation with the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a senior British official to
the Gulf since the Labor Party came to power in elections
last month.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Ambassador to London Khaled Al-Duweisan underlined
Sunday that Kuwait's relations with Britain are historic and
strong under both the Labor and the Conservative parties,
according to Kuwait News Agency reports.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Groups Should Speed up Development: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo,
speaking at a meeting on large enterprise groups here today, said
that bolder efforts should be made in developing large enterprise
groups.
</P>
<P>
The groups have a strategic importance in China's economic
growth and reforms, and government departments at all levels
should create conditions favorable for the development of
enterprise groups, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese entrepreneurs to learn from global economic
developments. Since large enterprises and enterprise groups play a
leading role in China's modernization drive and socialist market
economy, efforts should be made to build them faster, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pilot groups have increased their economic power since an
experiment with them started six years ago, and they have made
progress in establishing a modern enterprise system, setting an
example for other enterprises, the Vice-Premier said.
</P>
<P>
The state will not provide lifetime guarantees for these
groups, he noted, and if any performs poorly, it will be asked to
quit. The central government will provide special assistance to
promising enterprises, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to six things that could help improve the work:
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up the use of a modern enterprise system in large
enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
-- Helping enterprise groups establish market superiority.
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting the development of enterprise groups in structural
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the groups' management systems.
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing efforts to train managers.
</P>
<P>
-- And, supporting reforms.

<HEADLINE> Budget Cuts Leave Russia's Nagano Fate Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Nagano-bound Winter
Olympic team will be severely harmed by the planned cuts to the
federal budget, senior sports officials here have warned.
</P>
<P>
"So far we haven't disrupted any training sessions," said
Vladimir Vasin, the Russian Olympic Committee's first
vice-president. "But I do not know what could happen tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Although sports were allocated 647 billion rubles (111.5
million U.S. dollars) for 1997, only 54 billion rubles (9,3
million U.S. dollars) have been paid out in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported that the overall sports budget would be
reduced to 305 billion rubles (52.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Russian Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry thus had no
choice but to focus on sports which have a good chance of winning
medals in Japan, such as cross-country skiing, biathlon and figure
skating.
</P>
<P>
Only 45 leading Russian athletes are expected to have a medal
chance in Nagano.

<HEADLINE> President of Christian Council Defends Christianity in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- It is totally groundless for some
foreign people to criticize China of "religious persecution" on
the pretext of the Xu Yongze case, Dr. Han Wenzao, president of
the Christian Council of China, said to Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some foreign people had articles published in
newspapers, attacking China's religious policies and fabricating
so-called "religious persecution" cases, Han said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, they played up the Xu Yongze case and spread a
large amount of rumors, taking the case as further evidence of
"religious persecution" by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Wenzao, Xu separated himself from the "Crying
Sect" in early 1980s and established "Holistic Sect" cult,
proclaiming that crying was the only way of communicating with
deities and that "one must cry loudly, only in this way can they
be reborn and salvaged." Believers were urged to cry in prayer,
gatherings, and church services.
</P>
<P>
"Xu also confused and poisoned people's minds by spreading the
views that 'the end of the world is coming, and disasters are
falling down', illegally gathering and instigating people to do no
normal work but cry collectively every day. Many people became
distraught and could not cope with their own life. And the normal
life and production of local people were also seriously affected,"
said Han.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Bible, Han Wenzao said that gods instruct people
not to fall into disorder, but teach them to be quiet and
happy. Xu Yongze spread the saying of "the end of the world,"
which is the same fallacy advocated by various cults in the
current world.
</P>
<P>
"Xu's doings entirely ran counter to the teachings of the Bible
and the true canons of Christ. Xu is not a Christian at all," Han
said.

<P>
In March this year, public security departments in Zhengzhou
City of Henan Province detained Xu in accordance with the
Regulations on the Registration and Administration of Social
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The detaining of Xu is definitely not persecution of Christians
by the Chinese government, but a normal handling of a criminal
prosecution," Han Wenzao said.
</P>
<P>
Years ago, the governments of the United States and Japan took
severe measures against the Branch Davidian sect and the Aum
Shinrikyo religious cult, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the quote to an American acquaintance, Han said
that if a Christian breaks the law in the United States and is
detained, that falls into a legal system. But if a similar case
takes place in China, it is taken as a persecution of Christian
believers.
</P>
<P>
"Why should double standards be used to assess such incidents?"
Han asked.
</P>
<P>
Han noted that any organization and individual, including
religious organizations and believers, should act within the
fields stipulated by the country's Constitution and other laws,
enjoying their civil rights and undertaking responsibilities
in line with the law.
</P>
<P>
"This allows of no doubt, and is a universal way around the
world," Han said.
</P>
<P>
As long as their activities conform with the law, religious
believers will be protected by the law and enjoy their rights
granted by the law, he added.
</P>
<P>
"A Christian should not only do things according to the
teachings of the Bible, but also abide by the law," Han said.

MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
composite index, a basket of some 30 companies, fell by 73.08
points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 2,808.65 points last week.

The latest plunge at the Philippine Stock Exchange came just

</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the recovery culminated as the stock index
surged by 2.9 percent to close at an eight-week high of 2,905.97
points. It ended the week up with an upswing of 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the recovery, some analysts even predicted that
the market would further consolidate and may even top 2,900 points
again as it did last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate the country's currency of peso, the Philippine
Central Bank raised again its closely watched overnight borrowing
rate from 12.75 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, rattled foreign investors who had just
begun increasing their holdings, triggering heavy selling, said
sources from the Research Department of the Philippine Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippines has been enjoying relatively good
export numbers. In April, the country's revenue from the
merchandise exports grew by 40 percent to reach 2.08 billion
dollars. During the first four months this year, exports receipts
went up 22.8 percent to 7.6 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Massive Assets And Capital Check-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economic center will
begin a massive check of assets and capital in its collective
enterprises for the first time, the municipal government has said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting it was announced that the comprehensive
probe will cover more than 20,000 collective enterprises. The
check is similar to the one conducted in state-owned enterprises
in 1995 and will give authorities information about the
public-owned economic sector as a whole and help promote healthier
growth, said Chen Bulin, director of Shanghai Municipal State Assets
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The collective sector has developed rapidly in Shanghai since
the national reform and open-up drive started in the late 1970s,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The check-up will be finished this year.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Cooperation Between China's inland And Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 23 (Xinhua) -- He Guangwei, president of China's
National Tourism Administration, has said that after the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland, the tourism industry of both sides
will expand, providing more chances for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua recently, He said that he
sees "great prospects" for the increasing exchanges and expansion
between china's inland and Hong Kong tourism sectors. "Hong Kong
is a tourism leader in Asia. Its expertise in management and
service should be learned by the inland," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to be a transfer point for
international visitors to China's inland areas," he said, adding
that more than 30 percent of the tourists in Hong Kong go on to
tour the inland, which had nearly 35 million visitors from Hong
Kong last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1997, the number of Hong Kong visitors
increased by 10 percent over the same period last year, and the
number of inland tourists going to Hong Kong has been on rise. In
1996 the number reached 420,000, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cooperation between tourism administrative offices
will increase, he predicted, adding that executives of CNTA and
the Hong Kong Tourism Association often meet to discuss business
and the latter recently opened an office in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, tourism services in China's inland areas have
participated in the annual Hong Kong International Tourism Fair.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Pearl River Delta tours, a collaboration
between China's inland, Hong Kong and Macao tourism sectors, have
been successful, he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banker Says Shanghai Becoming Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kiyoshige Akamatsu, president of
the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
Japan, said recently in Shanghai that the city is on track to
becoming an international financial center, but that it still
needs to let in more overseas financial institutions and improve
the capital, off-shore finance, and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
There are many indications and indicators showing Shanghai is
evolving into an economic, trade, financial and transportation
center, the Japanese banker said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's GDP grew at an average of 12.9 percent a year from
1991 to 1995 and reached 13 percent last year. Per capita GDP this
year is expected to exceed 3,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports through Shanghai port soared to 52.9
billion US dollars last year from 20.4 billion US dollars in
1991. The number of overseas-funded projects has reached 16,000,
with overseas investment of nearly 50 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai enjoys geographical advantages and its influence
extends to the Yangtze River valley, a region in great need of
capital, Akamatsu said.
</P>
<P>
"If the growth momentum is maintained, Shanghai can reach the
international level in about ten years," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There are 40 overseas bank branches in Shanghai, nine of which
have been approved by the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, to do business in the Chinese currency on a limited basis in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area.

attended a symposium in Beijing today to greet the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Amat, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of

that with the return of Hong Kong approaching, it has become
obvious that economic growth and national strength are important
to maintaining the independence and dignity of a nation.
</P>
<P>
To build a modern country and meet the common goals requires
that various ethnic groups unite and work together, he said,
noting "We must hold the banner of patriotism high, consolidate,
and promote unity among ethnic groups to make the Chinese nation
stand more firmly in the world."
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will further promote patriotic
enthusiasm among all ethnic groups, and will increase people's
confidence and determination to safeguard the reunification of the
motherland, enhance unity among all ethnic groups, and accelerate
the pace of economic growth, said Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Land Commission Ends Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Land Commission
held its 35th meeting here today, ending its historical mission.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the commission's last one. The commission
will be dissolved on June 30, 1997, in accordance with Annex III
to the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) Government, matters related to land leases will, in
accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR, be handled by the
HKSAR on its own by formulating laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the Land Commission reviewed its work in
the 12 years since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after today's meeting, both
sides held that, since its establishment, the Land Commission has
"conscientiously performed its duties as specified by Annex III to
the Sino-British Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the Land Commission has made positive
contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition, its continued
economic development and the improvement of the life quality of
local citizens.
</P>
<P>
Chen Rongchun, chief representative of the Chinese side, and
Leung Po-wing, chief representative of the British side, met
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration
states that no more than 50 hectares of land can be granted a year
during Hong Kong's transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Since the Sino-British Land Commission was established 12 years
ago, however, the Chinese side has been quite flexible in granting
land as it has always paid close attention to Hong Kong's economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years, Chen said, the Land Commission has
granted a total of 2,972 hectares of land, averaging 248 hectares
annually. It has granted 620 hectares of land for housing
construction, averaging 52 hectares a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This full demonstrates that the Chinese side attaches great
importance to the wish of Hong Kong citizens to improve their
housing conditions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hainan to Lead Trilateral Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor Ruan Chongwu of Hainan
Province is confident that his province may have a leading role in
further expanding cooperations among China's inland areas, Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables and fruits are a good medium since their export
volume to Hong Kong are on the rise thanks to some 270 vegetable
and fruit gardens run by Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
As China's southernmost province, Hainan island is the ideal
place to grow vegetable and tropical fruits. The investment
enthusiasm from Taiwan and the increasing consumption demand in
Hong Kong will help push the trilateral arrangement closer.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's return to the motherland is approaching,
establishing such trilateral cooperation seems all the more
significant, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong will probably spark a new round of
overseas investment in China's largest development zone in
Hainan's Yangpu area, whose infrastructure construction was
completed by a Hong Kong real estate developer with a total cost
of five billion Hong Kong dollars, said Ruan
</P>
<P>
"We hope to attract more capital from Hong Kong and through
Hong Kong more capital from around the world," said Ruan.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, Hainan and Hong Kong are doing well
in economic cooperation. Of a total four billion US dollar
overseas investment in the province, about 2 billion came from
Hong Kong. Half of the province's export-import trade depends on
the business between the two places.
</P>
<P>
Starting from January 1 1996, Hainan provides Hong Kong with
2.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas each year.
</P>
<P>
"The chances for further cooperation will be enhanced by the
impending return," the governor said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Threatens Australia's Wheat Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- John Cobb, vice president of the
New South Wales (NSW) Farmers Association, said today that minimum
rainfall over the next four months was necessary to save wheat
crop as some areas in the state had not even sown because it had
been too dry.
</P>
<P>
The NSW state is one of the main wheat growing areas in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Cobb told Australian Associated Press in Sydney that "If we can
get the bare minimum rainfall needed every month for the next four
months there could be a chance of harvesting a crop that will earn
about two billion Australian dollars (1.5 billion US dollars) for
the state's economy, even though El Nino is threatening," Cobb
said.
</P>
<P>
However, if the rain does not come, farmers who have been
forced to borrow from the bank to get the thousands of dollars
needed to finance the crop, will face ruin."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the minimum rainfall required varied from
area to area but, on average, about 40 mm would be adequate.
</P>
<P>
The lack of rain has left 45 percent of NSW state drought
declared but the harvest, which starts each year in early
November, would not be as bad as in 1994 or 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, while the wheat situation was looking shaky, Cobb said, it
was worse for sheep and cattle grazing, dams are running dry and
even if rain fell now, the warm days needed to promote pasture
growth are unlikely before October, he added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Reduces Projects in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has cut its budget
on Nigeria by 20 percent while the number of its projects in the
country has also been reduced from over 20 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut down the projects was made against the
background that the bank's commitments to Nigeria had not been
yielding the desired results.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the bank in Nigeria has described the
unsatisfactory result as a development attributable to the
distortions in the Nigerian economy, Business Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The offical did not elaborate the distortions but suggested that they
should be removed if confidence was to be elicited from the bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank has decided to shift attention to
other African countries for further investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the bank has started recalling some
of its key officials from Nigeria to its headquarters in
Washington and embarked on some restructuring exercise including
retrenchement of workers in its office in Lagos, Nigeria's
economic center.
</P>
<P>
The consultants and contractors of the bank have been put on
the alert about the unfolding development with many of them
having been told to leave as soon as their contracts lapse.
</P>
<P>
Although existing projects would continue to be financed by
the bank when due, fresh financial commitment may not be
considered, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the World Bank has frowned at the
retention in Nigeria's 1997 budget of the dual exchange rates
system, saying such commitment would not allow for proper
accounting and budgetary implementation.
</P>
<P>
Other grey areas to the bank include suspension of the
privatization of government parastatals and the closure of
certain sectors of the economy to private investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has in the past few years made some
remarkable improvement in maintaining stability in the exchange
rate, reducing inflation rate to below 20 percent and opening up
the economy through the promulgation of new investment decrees.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank believes much can still be done to
provide a more favorable investment climate.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the 5.5 percent targeted growth rate at
the end of this year is being threatened by falling consumer
purchasing power and low industrial capacity utilization, with
some experts recommending an action plan capable of activating
the productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lingering fuel crisis in one of world's leading
oil producing countries since the beginning of this year has almost
paralyzed commercial and social activities in such big cities as
Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says UN Resolution Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has considered "unacceptable"
the latest U.N. Security Council resolution demanding Iraq to
cooperate fully with the U.N. arms inspectors, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Any new conditions to be imposed on Iraq can not be accepted by
the country, said a statement issued Sunday following a joint
meeting of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council and Iraq's Command
of the Arab Baath Socialist Party chaired by President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the resolution is a "clear-cut" expression
that the Security Council is shirking its responsibilities, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Security Council to live up to its commitment
to Iraq and respect Iraq's sovereignty, and urged it lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Saturday adopted a resolution demanding
the Iraqi government to cooperate fully with the arms inspectors
of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will face even tougher sanctions if it obstructs the
UNSCOM inspection teams from entering some sites during their
search for banned weapons in the country, according to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis between Iraq and the Security Council has
been sparked by UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus, who reported to the
council earlier this month that the Iraqi side interfered with
UNSCOM helicopters while carrying out their inspection missions
and barred the U.N. arms inspectors from some compounds.

<HEADLINE> Japan Air System to Expand Asian Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan Air System (JAS) is planning
to expand its flights to Asian destinations while trimming
money-losing domestic services, Kyodo News quoted JAS officials as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
JAS is considering to expand services from Japan to China,
namely from Osaka to Beijing and Shanghai, a JAS official said,
adding that Asian routes are "expected to see increased passenger
demand, both among business people and tourists from now on."
</P>
<P>
The third-largest Japanese airline has three international
services, all in Asia. They comprise seven Tokyo-Seoul flights
per week, in operation since 1988, three flights per week between
Osaka and Guangzhou, China, since 1995, and four Osaka-Hong Kong
flights per week, which began earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to reopen its twice-weekly
Tokyo-Singapore service which it suspended in 1995 because the
route was in red, the company officials said.
</P>
<P>
JAS, which chiefly serves local cities in the domestic market,
has incurred an operating loss in the business year that ended in
March, for the fifth straight year of such a loss.
</P>
<P>
The company, which expects competition in the domestic market
is tense as new companies are entering the market, is planning to
streamline its 30 loss-making domestic services, said JAS
officials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Ruling Party Wins Majority in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's functional group
(Golkar) has been formally confirmed as the winner of the recent
election, sweeping 325 of the 425 seats being contested at the
House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
The United Development Party (PPP) won 89 seats and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) only 11 seats, chairman of the
General Election Institute (LPU) Yogie S. Memet said here today.
</P>
<P>
The DPR consists of 500 members. Another 75 seats are allocated
for the military whose members do not vote in the country's
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The number of seats won by Golkar and the PPP this year are
higher than that in the 1992 election when Golkar took 282 seats
and PPP 62.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 polls, PDI grabbed 56 seats. But because of the
sharp decline in PDI votes this year, it will be represented only
in seven province of the total 27 provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which won in all of the provinces, has swept every
election since 1971.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was 93.38 percent of the country's more than 124
million eligible voters in the May 29 election, Yogie said.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected members of the DPR members, along with other
appointed members in the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) will
choose the next president and vice president of the country in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the past five elections since 1971, voter turnout has always
been more than 90 percent, except in 1987.

<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The summit of the richest countries in the world held last
weekend in the U.S. city Denver was marked by the disaccord
between Europeans and Americans, notably on the issue of the fight
against pollution and on running their different economies. French
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also
did not appreciate being invited to pose as cowboys before cameras
by U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose lauding of the U.S. economic
model had annoyed them.
</P>
<P>
-- After Brazzaville, the capital of the Central African
Republic, Bangui was for its turn plunged into fighting which has
turned its streets into desert and terrorized its people. The
fighting opposing former mutineers and soldiers of the Chadian-led
African intervention force also has French troops in place to play
a key role in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The announcement by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to
fix the sum of the annual family allowances to below 25,000 francs
(about 4,300 U.S. dollars) has aroused strong protest from unions
and family rights groups. However, 63 percent of the French people
said that they support the reduction of the allowances, according
to a poll.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1996, 4,000 French enterprises signed contracts with
about four million employees on working hours management in
collective negotiations aimed at reducing unemployment and
increasing flexibility of labor contracts.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Singer Escapes Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's winner of the annual Oscar
award of Arab song for 1996 has escaped an assassination attempt
on the Iraq-Jordan highway by gunmen similar to those who fired at
President Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad Observer, an English-language newspaper published
here, said today that Iraq's "beloved singer" Kadhim al-Sahir
escaped the murder attempt while driving to Baghdad on the
1,000-kilometer highway from Jordan on June 18.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Sahir, who has the title of "Iraqi Song
Ambassador" and has been living outside Iraq for the last two
years, was to sing for the recovery of the 34-year-old Uday, who
himself survived an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
It noted that those who shot at Sahir were similar to those who
fired at Uday last year. "The faces are the same...the same
chaotic beards, the same bullets," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Sahir was not hurt and attended and sang at the party
organized later on to celebrate the recovery of Uday, it added.
</P>
<P>
Uday, who had been widely believed to be President Saddam's
heir apparent, was shot and took 14 bullets in an ambush on
December 12 while he was driving his car in the wealthy al-Mansur
district of central Baghdad. This case has not been cleared up to
date.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, he gained full recovery and left hospital
after six months' treatment.

<HEADLINE> 200 Iranian Policemen Killed in Anti-Drug Battles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 Iranian policemen were
killed and 500 others injured in anti-drug fightings with drug
traffickers over the past four years, Iran's Interior Minister Ali
Mohammad Besharati said here today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Besharati said these policemen sacrifised their lives to stop
drugs produced in the border areas between Afganistan and
Pakistan, known as the Golden Cresant, from being smuggled to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iran is often used as a transit route by traffickers to ship
drugs to Turkey and eventually Europe. It seized some 190 tonnes
of narcotics in the year ending March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Besharati declined to reveal the number of drug
dealers that were executed in Iran in the past 12 months.
Convicted drug smugglers get a mandatory death sentence under
Iranian law.
</P>
<P>
Besharati said that Iran had started digging trenches and
laying layers of rolled barbed wire along its 950-kilometer
mountainous border with Afghanistan to stop the infiltration of
Afghan drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran has imprisoned nearly
80,000 drug smugglers and addicts, accounting for some 58 percent
of the inmates in the country.

<HEADLINE> Imelda Asks Reversal of Court Ruling on Tax Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Former First Lady Imelda Marcos has
filed a motion for reversal of a Supreme Court ruling upholding a
23.3-billion-peso (889 million U.S. dollar) income tax assessment
on the estate of her late husband, former president Ferdinand
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Personally filing the motion at the Supreme Court here today,
Imelda expressed confidence that the decision of the court's
Second Division on June 5 will be reversed because of the new and
very substantive arguments she raised in her 16-page motion.
</P>
<P>
The most telling argument, Imelda said, was the Bureau of
Internal Revenue "included all the sequestered assets", which was
contrary to its own ruling on February 23, 1996 that "sequestered
assets should be excluded from tax assessments."
</P>
<P>
Imelda also said that the bureau's assessment of the value of
the gross estate of the Marcos properties was based on mere
presumptions and speculations and not on actual values. This is
another ground for its nullification, she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Second Division of the Supreme Court
upheld the ruling by the Court of Appeals in November 1994 that
part of the Marcos estate should be sold by the government to pay
for the family's 889-million-U.S.-dollar estate tax.
</P>
<P>
The court also said that the forfeiture by the Bureau of
Internal Revenue of 11 Marcos real estates in Leyte province was
valid after his heirs failed to contest on time the bureau's tax
assessment.
</P>
<P>
Marcos was toppled in 1986 and died in exile three years later
in Hawaii, the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is losing a big European
market as a result of poor handling of its fish products,
Philip Okundi, Managing Director of Kenya Bureau of Standards
(KBS), has warned.
</P>
<P>
A number of European countries have joined Spain in banning
imports of fish products from Lake Victoria because of the
presence of salmonella, a disease causing stomach-ache, Okundi
was quoted by today's East African Standard newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts from Europe are currently in Kenya to assess
how fish products are being handled, said the managing director at a
seminar here on the implementation of ISO 9000 standards in
industry.
</P>
<P>
Quality is the only weapon a small country like Kenya could
use to survive and thrive, Okundi stressed.
</P>
<P>
The KBS is planning to build a modern microbiology laboratory
in western Kenya to help ensure fish products from the region are
thoroughly tested for quality and diseases, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Rumors of Murder Attempt on President-Elect Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Mohammad Besharati denied here today a rumored assassination
attempt on the life of President-elect Mohammad Khatami early this
month.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly reject these rumors. Our country is the safest
country in the world," the minister said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Citizens in Tehran, the capital of Iran, are gossiping about an
unconfirmed murder attempt on the life of the 54-year-old new
president, who is expected to take office on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that Khatami's driver was wounded and
hospitalized in the assassination attempt early this month in an
unspecified place in Tehran. But there is no mentioning of who or
what reason is behind the rumored killing attempt.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, a relatively moderate clergyman, defeated his chief
competitor Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri in an overwhelming
victory in last month's presidential election, dealing a big blow
to the hardliners' bloc.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the minister's denial of the murder
attempt was the first such official response to the most sensitive
and wide-circulated rumors following the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Assassination attempts on lives of Iranian leaders are nothing
new to the country. In the 1980s, then Iranian president Ali
Khamenei was luck to survive, with minor injuries, a bomb
explosion next to the podium at a mosque as he was addressing a
crowd in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing President Hashemi Rafsanjani escaped from killing
attempt February 1, 1994 as a former security officer fired five
bullets at him inside the Shrine of the late Iranian spiritual
leader Imam Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Some 72 high-ranking Iranian officials were killed in June
1981 as a powerful bomb razed the headquarters of the Islamic
Republican Party (IRP).

<HEADLINE> India Breeds Fat Rats for Medical Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
established a colony of the world's fattest rats each weighing 1.4
kg against the normal 300 grams, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This new strain of overweight animals is being sought after by
biomedical researchers to be used as "models" to develop cures for
obesity and diabetes, two major problems afflicting people
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from India's National Institute of Nutrition (NIN)
said this pure strain of obese rats which they breed can help
medical research.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, the animals keep adding five grams
per day and become too fat to even stand up.
</P>
<P>
Among the fat rats, there is a group of animals which has
"impaired glucose tolerance." These will be excellent
experimental models to develop drugs for treating diabetes
associated with obesity.
</P>
<P>
The NIN currently maintains some 400 fat rats and further
breeding has been stopped due to lack of space in the animal house
of the institute.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Voters Registration Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- As thousands of voters in
different parts of Kenya rushed to beat Sunday's voter
registration deadline, the Electoral Commission has extended the
exercise by two days.
</P>
<P>
The registration started on May 19 and will end tomorrow, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.7 million people had registered by June 18 out of the
projected 10 million. However, the figure excluded 40
constituencies which had yet to file their latest returns.
</P>
<P>
Zaccheus Chesoni, the Chairman of the Electoral Commission,
said last evening that the commission had made the decision after
noting that thousands of Kenyans keen to get their cards had not
been registered by the close of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that with the extension of the
exercise, the commission will be able to register the targeted 10
million Kenyans by the end of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The commission called on the Kenyans to turn out in large
numbers on polling day to "make use of their constitutional right
to choose credible and responsible leaders."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chesoni ruled out any possible extension when
politicians from ruling Kenya African National Union and
opposition parties asked for a minimum of a three-month
extension.

<HEADLINE> Motorists Holding Cellphones to Be Banned in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African Transport
Department is drafting a legislation, which bans motorists holding
cellphones, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which will be enforced within a month, motorists
who use hand-held cellphones will face fines of up to 20,000 Rand
(4,444 U.S. dollars) and one year's jail, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, hands-free carphone kits will be allowed and emergency
services will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
All provinces' representatives voted to support the legislation at
a meeting of the Technical Committee for Road Traffic and Safety
Legislation last week, said road traffic legislation Deputy Director
Joubert Matthee.
</P>
<P>
"The days when drivers have one hand on the steering wheel and
one on the phone are numbered," Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
Action to ban drivers from using hand-held phones had been demanded
by the automobile association Drive Alive, a body dedicated to road
safety, and by the public, said Matthee.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a lot of complaints about people acting like hooligans
on the road because they are having a heated discussion and only have
one hand on the steering wheel," he said.
</P>
<P>
A safety campaign planned by the Transport Department would gain
momentum once insurance companies refused to pay out for accidents
where cellphones were a contributory factor, Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
Both Vodacom and MTN, the two major cellular network suppliers in
South Africa, have expressed support to the ban.

SHENZHEN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A hundred special families who
are known for regularly shuttling between Hong Kong and Lo Wu
District, Shenzhen, gathered recently to celebrate the return of
Hong Kong, which is only seven days away.
</P>
<P>
Among the five districts in Shenzhen, Lo Wu enjoys the most

addition to its longest boundary of administration with the region

All these families, with their members either in Shenzhen or in

<P>
"Hong Kong is my home, as well as Shenzhen," says the
67-year-old Xu Shunsheng, who goes to work in Hong Kong every day
and returns at night. "We will work together to build up our home
town." Xu, who went to Hong Kong in 1948, opted for residing in
Shenzhen as soon as the central government adopted the open policy
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Fen, who lives in Lo Wu, looks forward to Hong Kong's

Kong to help her husband's business every day and returns home in
Shenzhen to take care of her young daughter, who has not yet been

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Stressed in Nepal's Ninth Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Poverty percentage in Nepal will
be reduced from 45 to 32.5 during the Ninth Five Year Plan period
(1997-2002), a senior Nepali official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the National Development Council (NDC),
Vice Chairman of the National Planning Commission (NPC)
Mangalsiddi Manandhar said that to alleviate poverty, the emphasis
has been laid on production, food security, employment, increases
in income, supply of fertilizers, irrigation, rural roads,
electricity and technology.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the ninth plan has a long-term goal for poverty
eradication, Manandhar said the poverty alleviation campaign will
be boosted by setting up a special fund, with the emphasis on the
development and expansion of agro-based industries to create
additional jobs.
</P>
<P>
The process of industrialization will be accelerated by
developing agriculture, water resources, industry, tourism and
transport, he said, adding that the economic and social
disparities existing between various regions and communities will
be minimized.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a working paper on poverty alleviation and
employment, NPC member Kishore Kumar Gurugharana said that despite
massive mobilization of internal resources and foreign aid and
loans, 45 percent of the country's population remain below the
absolute poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He said the development strategies and the management and
implementation aspects of these procedures need urgent reforms.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Plans to Exploit Coal in Red River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has approved a plan to
exploit coal in the Red River Delta where total deposit of coal is
estimated at 30 billion tons, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The plan worked out by Vietnam Coal Corporation (VINACOAL) is
regarded as a key project of the coal sector for the year 2000 and
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
The VINACOAL is now calling for 460 million U.S. dollars of
foreign investments for its two projects in the delta.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, 100 million dollars will go to a coal
exploitation project at the Binh Minh Coal Mine in Hung Yen
Province and the remainder for the building of a 300-400 mw
coal-fueled power plant at the same site.
</P>
<P>
The mine has an estimated reserve of 100 million tons and is
designed to be exploited at one million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, Vietnam's demand for coal will rise by
seven to 20 percent, especially that for electricity production.
</P>
<P>
The VINACOAL forecast the domestic coal use of 11 million tons
by the year 2000 and 15-19 million tons by 2010 and an annual
export output of three-four million tons.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Expects Stronger Ties with Hong Kong SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
expects to increase its cooperation with Hong Kong in the
manufacturing and information industries, financing and tourism
after the latter's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
This view was jointly voiced here by over 30 economists,
businessmen from Hong Kong, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and other
countries and regions as well as Yunnan Province in a recent
conference on past and future exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the "one country, two systems" policy to be
practised in Hong Kong will ensure the region's prosperity and
exchanges with other places, both internationally and
domestically. And Yunnan's growing economy will also provide
business opportunities for Hong Kong investors.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Yunnan's rich natural and human resources will make it
the target zone for Hong Kong to transfer its labor-intensive
manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Chinese central government permits Yunnan to open its
banking and financing markets to regional and overseas
investors. The province is looking at Hong Kong, a financial hub
of the Asia-Pacific region, to venture into the market. Three
banks from Thailand have opened their offices in Kunming, capital
of Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
To improve its transport facilities, mountainous Yunnan is set
to develop its telecommunications and information industry to make
up for this deficiency. Tourism is also a rising sector in the
province rich with tropical glamor.
</P>
<P>
"All the sectors above provide Hong Kong with chances to take
advantage of its capital and technological expertise and to make
profit," a Yunnan economist said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province has been doing business with Hong Kong for more
than 50 years. Now Hong Kong is Yunnan's leading trading partner.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> From Queen's Head To Bauhinia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Queen's head design on the
obverse side of Hong Kong coins is being replaced by a bauhinia
flower, reflecting the historic change in Hong Kong from a land
under the British colonial rule to a special administrative region
of China.
</P>
<P>
Coins bearing the head of the British sovereign was last issued
in 1992, and in the following year the current series of coins
featuring a bauhinia blossom on the obverse was introduced.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, about 506 million pieces of Queen's head
coins had been withdrawn and scrapped since a coin replacement
program was launched in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Issued by the government, the Hong Kong dollar coin now has
become the only acceptable coinage, but one and half century ago a
variety of coins, including English coins, rupee of the East India
Company, Spanish and Mexican silver dollars and Chinese cash
coins, were circulated in Hong Kong with no single predominant
standard.
</P>
<P>
The first legal coinage was minted in 1863. Ever since,
portraits of five British monarchs appeared on Hong Kong coins,
including Queen Victoria, King Edward the Seventh, King George the
Fifth, King George the Sixth and Queen Elizabeth the Second.
</P>
<P>
Symbols of colonial connotations are fading out of Hong Kong
society with the approaching of July 1, 1997, when China resumes
its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Similar changes have
taken place in Hong Kong currency.
</P>
<P>
As the coin replacement program continues, the proportion of
the bauhinia design in all seven denominations to Queen's head
coins is rising rapidly. For the HK$ 2 and HK$5 coins, the flower
design now accounts for 70 percent of active circulation.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1985, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC), one of the three note-issuing banks in Hong
Kong, deleted the wording related to "colony" on its new series of
bank notes in six denominations, ranging from ten to 1,000 HK
dollars. Starting from 1993, its coat of arms, which bears a
crown, disappeared from its bank notes; and at the same time,
bilingual wording was printed instead of only English version.
</P>
<P>
Another note issuer, the Standard Chartered Bank, unveiled a
new pattern of bank notes between 1993 and 1994, replacing the
long-used royal coat of arms with a blooming bauhinia. The change
was made in preparation for the return of Hong Kong to China in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Not only designs of bank notes have changed, but also the
note-issuing banks. The HSBC, the Charted Bank and the Mercantile
Bank of India, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the HSBC
in 1959, were authorized note issuers in Hong Kong at the end of
last century. One hundred years later, the Bank of China (BOC),
the second largest banking group in Hong Kong, joined the HSBC and
the Standard Chartered to obtain the note-issuing status.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of notes issued by the BOC has risen steadily from
4.1 percent in 1994, to 5.5 percent in 1995 and 16 percent in
1996. The figure is expected to reach 26 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Paper money issued by the three banks used to be printed by a
Hong Kong-based private plant. The Hong Kong government bought the
plant from a British note printer de la Rue in 1996, putting an
end to a 100-year practice of entrusting note printing to the
private sector. Earlier this year, China Banknote Printing and
Minting Corporation, a subsidiary of China's central bank,
purchased a 15-percent stake in the Hong Kong note printing plant.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of currency in Hong Kong is backed by the Exchange
Fund, to which the three authorized banks are required to pay one
US dollar for every 7.8 HK dollars put into circulation. The
arrangement was made under a linked exchanged rate system, which,
introduced in October, 1983, pegged the Hong Kong dollar to the US
dollar at a fixed rate of 7.8 HK dollars against one US dollar.
</P>
<P>
Though financial volatility cropped up time and again over the
past decade, the exchange rate linked with the US dollar remained
stable and the confidence in the Hong Kong dollar remained strong.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, the Hong Kong dollar, as the legal tender
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, will continue to
circulate and be freely convertible, in accordance with the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
Renminbi which circulates in the interior areas will not take
the place of the Hong Kong dollar. Now at any exchange counter in
the street of Hong Kong, Renminbi can be converted into the Hong
Kong dollar, reflecting the great extent of economic exchanges
between the two areas.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return an Historic Event-Malaysian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to
China is a most historic event which marks the end of British
colonial rule in Hong Kong, Malaysian Deputy Minister of Land and
Cooperative Development Goh Cheng Teik said today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here, Goh said Hong Kong
was occupied by Britain by force some 150 years ago and this was
"a historic wrong."
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1 this year by China to get this historic wrong righted is
therefore truly an occasion for celebration by the Chinese in Hong
Kong and in the inland areas of China and by their friends and
well-wishers everywhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh, a historian, said: "It is a tribute to the Chinese
government and people that they are righting this wrong by
diplomatic negotiations, not by military force."
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems", is an idea of a
genius, he said. Without this concept, the return of Hong Kong
will not be proceeding as smoothly as it is, he said, adding that
history will remember Deng Xiaoping for this "creative" thought.
</P>
<P>
The promise by the Chinese government to maintain Hong Kong's
present system for at least 50 years and implement the policy of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" not only makes the Hong
Kong Chinese feel assured their livelihood will not be affected in
any way by a return to the motherland but also guarantees a a high
degree of autonomy in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong people will do better after July 1.
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
deliver the goods to the people of Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
He was also convinced that the strength of Hong Kong as an
international center for trade, finance and transportation will
remain, serving not only the Asia-Pacific Region but also the
world at large.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka aims for a six percent
growth rate during the next three and a half years through a
public investment program, according to the Ministry of Planning
today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the maintenance of the six percent average
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth would result in an
acceleration of GDP to 7.5 percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in economic growth would be achieved mainly in
the industry and service sectors while the agricultural sector is
also expected to improve its performance.
</P>

According to projections, the industrial sector is expected to
grow by 8.5 percent, the service sector 6.1 percent, plantation
agriculture 1.9 percent and other areas of agriculture 1.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the six-percent growth target, the government must
maintain gross domestic capital formation at 26 percent of GDP,
raise the national savings ratio to 21 percent of GDP and reduce
the current account deficit to 4 percent of GDP and the
government budget deficit to 5.1 percent.

The investment program over the next three years lays stress on
private sector investment, which would amount to 65 percent of
total investment estimated at one trillion Rs. (16.95 billion US
dollars).

The ministry said the military conflict in the North and East
of the country is the most serious factor hindering Sri Lanka's
economic growth.

rebels who have been fighting for a separate Tamil state in the
north and east of the island country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-related Data (3): One Country, Two Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- "One country, two systems"
refers to the coexistence of two social systems in one country.
</P>
<P>
The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said, "Specifically, it
means that, within the People's Republic of China, the socialist
system is practiced on the mainland with a population of one
billion, while the capitalist system is practiced in Hong Kong and
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Under the "one country, two systems" principle, socialism on
the mainland will continue as the mainstay in China and, at the
same time, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao regions will be allowed to
keep their capitalist system.
</P>
<P>
The harmonious coexistence of two systems within the same
country can make China's reunification a reality and also
facilitate the development of the different regions and accelerate
the march of the Chinese nation toward prosperity.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" means that Hong Kong will be administered by the local
people on their own.
</P>
<P>
For more than 100 years of British rule, Hong Kong has been
under the autocratic rule of governors appointed by the British
Crown.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the Chinese government, in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems," will implement the policy
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong." This shows the central
government's deep trust in the six million Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
When Deng Xiaoping met with Hong Kong visitors in June 1984, he
said: "There have to be some requirements and standards for Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong. That is, patriots should form the
main body of administrators."
</P>
<P>
He added, "By patriots, we mean those people who respect their
own nation, sincerely support the motherland resuming the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and do nothing to harm Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Become Economic Power in Future-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic achievements
so far would pave the way for the country to make a long but
feasible journey to join the six economic powers in the world, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
High economic growth, combined with low population growth, a
reduced number of people living below the poverty line and
continued national stability, would ensure Indonesia reaches "such
a respectable position," Coordinating Minister for Production and
Distribution Hartarto said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the start of construction of a building
owned by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (kadin), the
minister said rich natural resources are also instrumental in
bringing Indonesia to that position.
</P>
<P>
In its recent report, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted
that Indonesia would become the sixth largest economy in the
world, based on purchasing power parity, after the U.S., Japan,
China, India and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The forum also placed Indonesia in 15th place on its list of
most competitive economies in the world, a marked improvement
compared to last year's 30th position.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has set a target for it to become an industrialized
power by the end of the second long-term development program in
2010, with industries supporting 32.5 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, non-oil/gas exports growing annually by
16.8 percent and its economy growing by 7-8 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Plot To Kill President Under Investigation In Sri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Criminal
Investigations Department (CID) said today it had uncovered a plot
to assassinate President Chandrika Kumaratunga and last week's
arrest of former Minister Sirisena Cooray was in that connection.
</P>
<P>
Cooray, minister of housing and local government in the former
United National Party government who had been abroad for a year,
returned to Sri Lanka earlier this month to organize ceremonies to
mark the birth anniversary of the late former President Ranasinghe
Premadasa on June 29.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested and detained under Emergency regulations last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cooray was being questioned for an alleged plot to kill the
President, the CID said.
</P>
<P>
The evidence pertaining to this plot uncovered during the CID
investigations into the activities of Cooray is now being put
together, the CID said.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the CID also arrested another suspect who is
considered an expert marksman.
</P>
<P>
The CID said it will release details of the plot within the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
According to CID sources, there was evidence that attempts had
been made to hire underworld criminals to execute the plot.

<HEADLINE> 21 Rebels Killed in Clashes With Philippine Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 rebels have been killed
in the past three days in bloody clashes between government troops
and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides traded mortar fire again Friday near Buldon, a
town in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines. Eleven
rebels and one soldiers were killed in the fighting, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Government troops and the MILF have had several clashes in
Buldon since the beginning of the year. They signed a local truce
in March after dozens of people lost their lives, but the
ceasefire was often violated.
</P>
<P>
Their recent bloody clashes have been going on since Friday, as
the military intensified its drive against the MILF guerrillas who
took hostage 43 employees of the Philippine National Oil Co. last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 civilians, mostly mothers and children, have fled
to safe places in a neighboring province for fear of being caught
in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, about 100 MILF guerrillas fired mortars and
machine guns at the army's 78 Infantry Battalion in Sultan Sa
Barongis, a town in the south of Maguindanao province. The troops
responded by firing more powerful mortars and killed 10 rebels.
Four soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
The MILF broke away from the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) in the 1970s. After the MNLF singed a
peace deal with the government last year, the MILF also began
peace talks with the government early this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have so far held five rounds of low-level talks,
but made little progress in forging a comprehensive ceasefire, let
alone a final peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - HK Scientist to Offer Swifter Detection of Heart Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong scientist is
developing the world's fastest biosensor to diagnose heart attacks
in minutes rather than hours, according to local press report here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The potentially life-saving device can confirm a heart attack
within half an hour in a laboratory setting, local
English-language newspaper South China Morning Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Conventional means for such diagnoses usually take between
three and six hours.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Reinhard Renneberg, a chemist at Hong Kong University of
Technology and Science and co-editor of the international journal
Biosensors and Bioelectronics, hopes to cut down the time to
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Renneberg and Queen Mary Hospital's biochemist Edward Janus are
applying for a research grant to test the device on local
patients.
</P>
<P>
Heart disease is the second most fatal illness in Hong Kong
after cancer, killing more than 4,500 people each year.
</P>
<P>
Conventional tests by electrocardiogram fail to recognize 30
percent of acute heart attacks at an early stage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The currently available biosensor can detect the presence of in
the blood stream of a large heart muscle protein called creatine
kinase - a heart attack indicator - in three to six hours.
</P>
<P>
But Renneberg's new version, however, detects a molecule which
is 10-times smaller and can leak into the bloodstream much faster
because of its size.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Renneberg expressed the hope to get a commercial version of
the new biosensor ready in two years.

<HEADLINE> Soft International Loan Extended to Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An international syndicate of 24
leading banks has agreed to extend a soft loan of 2 billion
U.S. dollars to the Czech Republic in a move to bail the country
out of its present financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Czech National Bank and the
syndicate over the weekend, the Czech Republic is to repay the
loan in one year, according to a spokesman for the bank today.
</P>
<P>
The loan was made available after the Czech Republic appealed
to the international community to help solve its serious financial
problem.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the country has been suffering
from a strait budget with its deficit climbing to 12.2 billion
koruny (about 407 million US dollars) by the end of May, and
foreign exchange reserves dropping to 10 billion U.S. dollars. In
recent weeks, things went worse with government institutions
unable to pay their employees.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the government also strived to cut
the budgetary expenditure by 7.56 percent in the past two months,
streamline workforce, suspend the construction of luxury buildings
and even cancel the routine state banquets.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Overseas Chinese in Pakistan Celebrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chen Shenchang spent about three
hours at the weekend driving his nine-member family in the
sweltering heat to the picturesque capital city, one of the best
summer resorts in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
But the Pakistani-Chinese family who live in Abbottabad, about
200 kilometers north of here, were not coming for a shelter to
while away the hot summer time.
</P>
<P>
Instead, The Chens made the special trip to attend a grand gala
held by overseas Chinese in Pakistan to celebrate the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"As a overseas Chinese, I feel greatly encouraged and excited
about the return of Hong Kong and my whole family are so proud of
our motherland," said the 50-year-old Chen, who closed his
restaurant Saturday in Abbottabad for the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Chen was among hundreds of other overseas Chinese in Pakistan
who were moved to tears when a five-star red flag was hoisted in
late afternoon to the melody of the Chinese National Anthem, which
marked the beginning of the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"On July 1, the People's Republic of China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, wiping out the humiliation
it has suffered for 100 years, " said H.C. TSAI, Honorary Chairman
of the Overseas Chinese Welfare Trust in Pakistan, in his opening
address.
</P>
<P>
"Being a major event in the history of China, the return of
Hong Kong represents a signal victory for the Chinese people in
their struggle for the reunification of their motherland," said
Tsai, who led all his compatriots in Pakistan in donating money to
celebrate such a historic occasion.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong also shows the soundness of the
Chinese government's `one country, two systems' principle, which
embodies the vision, wisdom and courage of the Chinese
leadership," he added.
</P>
<P>
About 200 overseas Chinese, most of them put off their business
tours, joined in the celebrations to share the joy and jubilation
with their compatriots in China's mainland, in Hong Kong and in
every corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting for the day for generations," said the
grey-haired Hamid, who specially brought his two sons born in
Pakistan to the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"We feel so proud and happy that we are all descendants of the
Dragon and I want my sons to bear this in mind for over," said the
65-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, like all the compatriots back in China, are
confident that Hong Kong will maintain its prosperity and
stability after it returns to the embrace of the motherland," he
said.

<HEADLINE> British Royal Yacht Britannia Arrives in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The British Royal Yacht, HMY
Britannia, which will carry British VIPs out of Hong Kong
immediately after the historic handover scheduled for the midnight
of June 30, came here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Yacht was anchored at 09:00 local time between the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center and the 150-meter-long
British Royal Navy frigate HMS Chatham that is berthed in Victoria
Harbor adjacent to the Prince of Wales Barracks, where is located
the headquarters of British forces in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Unique in the British Royal Navy, the 125-meter-long HMY
Britannia serves as an official and private residence for the
Queen and other members of the royal family when they are engaged
on visits overseas or voyaging in home waters.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Yacht will remain here until the midnight of June 30,
when Hong Kong returns to China, and will depart with Prince
Charles, the last Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten and other
British VIPs on board out of Hong Kong after the solemn handover
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
With a gross tonnage of 5,862 tonnes and a crew of 19 officers
and 217 sailors, HMY Britannia has sailed more than a million
miles and has crossed the globe seven times during her 42-year
career.
</P>
<P>
While leaving, the Royal Yacht will be escorted by the HMS
Chatham, which arrived in Hong Kong earlier for assisting
remaining British forces here in the final stages of their
withdrawal by acting as a floating command and control center.
</P>
<P>
The anti-submarine frigate will also provide communications
facilities and support helicopter operations.
</P>
<P>
When Prince Charles arrives on June 28, HMS Chatham will take
on the duties of Royal Yacht Guardship and provide officers and
sailors for the final ceremonies before the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
On completion of her duties in Hong Kong, the frigate will
escort not only the Royal Yacht on her departure from Hong Kong
but also the three Bird Class patrol boats, sold earlier to the
Philippine government, to the Philippines, and will then return to
the Gulf via Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier, a big British landing ship RFA Sir
Percivale will also join the departing ships. The royal Fleet
Auxiliary arrived in Hong Kong in early May and is berthed in a
navy base at Stonecutters Island. She is assigned to remove the
military equipment and other items of freight requiring transport
to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Britain has stationed troops in Hong Kong since 1841 when the
British flag was first raised on Hong Kong Island as a result of
its military occupation.
</P>
<P>
British forces in Hong Kong had a strength of about 9,500
personnel in the early 1990s and were reduced to about 3,250 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The forces now have over 1,200 personnel including the Black
Watch Regiment's First Battalion of about 550 servicemen, who came
here in February as the last resident infantry battalion in Hong
Kong, to be withdrawn before June 30.

<HEADLINE> Acquisition Drive Gong Strong in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An acquisition drive is spreading
throughout the country as part of the implementation of the policy
of encouraging acquisition, standardizing the practice of
bankruptcy and carrying out re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, there have been more than 360 acquisition
and bankruptcy cases in the 56 cities experimenting with the ways
of optimizing capital structure in the country. In East China
alone,where state owned enterprises are in great concentration,
more than 2,500 enterprises were annexed in recent two years.
</P>
<P>
There has been a great re-organization and amalgamation among
Chinese enterprises, with state assets flowing from lame ducks to
large enterprises groups, said economic experts with the Chinese
academy of sciences.
</P>
<P>
In East China's Jiangsu province, one of the most developed
provinces in China that used to become famous for its notion that
"small vessels can turn about more flexibly", people have begun to
turn to the notion that "big vessels can resist big tides and
waves". In the province, where the per capita GNP has reached 1000
US dollars, people have found that its economic structure mainly
featuring medium-sized and small enterprises is unable to prop up
the province's economy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Through acquisition and merger, the province has formed 16
large enterprise groups, whose sales income reached 48 billion
yuan and gross profit, 4.3 billion yuan in 1996..
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, more than 700
enterprises have exhibited renewed vigor and vitality through
acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Dongfeng Machinery Group has formed a large
engineering machinery group by merger with the Xuzhou Engineering
Machinery Group of Jiangsu Province, the Anhui Forklift Group, and
the Qinghai Engineering Machinery Group. The conglomerate aims to
bring its annual sales to 10 billion by the year 2000, according
to Liu Hanwen, general manager of the Anhui Forklift Group.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai "Three Guns" Group brought seven bankrupt
enterprises under its aegis over the past six years. With its
operating assets expanded by 10-fold, the group has generated an
annual sales income 12 times more than before and increased its
economic efficiency by 100 times.
</P>
<P>
Without the acquisition drive, said Su Shounan, general manager
of the group, "we could make at most 300 million yuan in annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
Starting from last year, Shanghai began to support 110 large
industrial enterprises so that they will become superlarge
enterprises through acquisition and merger and bring their annual
sales to more than 100 billion before 2000 to edge into the top
500 industrial giants in the world, said Hu Xiongfei of the
Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission.

<HEADLINE> Acquisition Drive Gong Strong in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the most outstanding problem in the acquisition and merger
drive is the debts and employment of redundancies. The "Three
Guns" Group, for instance, has to bear a total debt of 358 million
yuan and a total loss of 150 million yuan after acquiring seven
loss-making enterprises. In addition, it has to provide jobs for
9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, the state has granted the favorable
policy of exempting or reducing the interests on debts and launched
a re-employment project to arrange jobs for workers laid off.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has spent more than 700 yuan on the re-employment
project. 670,000 of the more than 800,000 laid-off workers have
been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from related departments show that there are more
than 30 million redundancies in state owned enterprises. The
arrangement of these people is crucial to further development of
China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
The market-oriented economy and the acquisition drive means a
merciless screening of state owned enterprises, said a worker from
a television factory who was laid off during the acquisition drive
and is now opening a home electrical appliances repairs shop. The
days when an enterprise could live for ever and the workers are
holding the "iron rice bowl", without any risks, has gone for
ever, he asserted.

<HEADLINE> Acquisition Drive Going Strong in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the most outstanding problem in the acquisition and merger
drive is the debts and employment of redundancies. The "Three
Guns" Group, for instance, has to bear a total debt of 358 million
yuan and a total loss of 150 million yuan after acquiring seven
loss-making enterprises. In addition, it has to provide jobs for
9,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, the state has granted the favorable
policy of exempting or reducing the interests on debts and launched
a re-employment project to arrange jobs for workers laid off.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has spent more than 700 yuan on the re-employment
project. 670,000 of the more than 800,000 laid-off workers have
been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from related departments show that there are more
than 30 million redundancies in state owned enterprises. The
arrangement of these people is crucial to further development of
China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
The market-oriented economy and the acquisition drive means a
merciless screening of state owned enterprises, said a worker from
a television factory who was laid off during the acquisition drive
and is now opening a home electrical appliances repairs shop. The
days when an enterprise could live for ever and the workers are
holding the "iron rice bowl", without any risks, has gone for
ever, he asserted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An acquisition drive is spreading
throughout the country as part of the implementation of the policy
of encouraging acquisition, standardizing the practice of
bankruptcy and carrying out re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, there have been more than 360 acquisition
and bankruptcy cases in the 56 cities experimenting with the ways
of optimizing capital structure in the country. In East China
alone,where state owned enterprises are in great concentration,
more than 2,500 enterprises were annexed in recent two years.
</P>
<P>
There has been a great re-organization and amalgamation among
Chinese enterprises, with state assets flowing from lame ducks to
large enterprises groups, said economic experts with the Chinese
academy of sciences.
</P>
<P>
In East China's Jiangsu province, one of the most developed
provinces in China that used to become famous for its notion that
"small vessels can turn about more flexibly", people have begun to
turn to the notion that "big vessels can resist big tides and
waves". In the province, where the per capita GNP has reached 1000
US dollars, people have found that its economic structure mainly
featuring medium-sized and small enterprises is unable to prop up
the province's economy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Through acquisition and merger, the province has formed 16
large enterprise groups, whose sales income reached 48 billion
yuan and gross profit, 4.3 billion yuan in 1996..
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, more than 700
enterprises have exhibited renewed vigor and vitality through
acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Dongfeng Machinery Group has formed a large
engineering machinery group by merger with the Xuzhou Engineering
Machinery Group of Jiangsu Province, the Anhui Forklift Group, and
the Qinghai Engineering Machinery Group. The conglomerate aims to
bring its annual sales to 10 billion by the year 2000, according
to Liu Hanwen, general manager of the Anhui Forklift Group.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai "Three Guns" Group brought seven bankrupt
enterprises under its aegis over the past six years. With its
operating assets expanded by 10-fold, the group has generated an
annual sales income 12 times more than before and increased its
economic efficiency by 100 times.
</P>
<P>
Without the acquisition drive, said Su Shounan, general manager
of the group, "we could make at most 300 million yuan in annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
Starting from last year, Shanghai began to support 110 large
industrial enterprises so that they will become superlarge
enterprises through acquisition and merger and bring their annual
sales to more than 100 billion before 2000 to edge into the top
500 industrial giants in the world, said Hu Xiongfei of the
Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Women's Federation has
helped 27,000 laid-off women workers find jobs through retraining
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
An example is Zhou Lingling, who attended a training class
organized by the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation and was
employed by the Xinmin Hotel after staying jobless for a certain
period of time. She has been promoted to be a department manager.
</P>
<P>
Redundant workers like Zhou have got new jobs with the help of
the women's federation, which has organized more than 200
technical training classes and trained some 10,000 women
workers. About one-third of them have found satisfactory jobs
through such training.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federation has organized more than 600 job
fairs, through which some 8,600 women workers were employed.

<HEADLINE> New Leader Elected for Spanish Socialist Workers' Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Socialist Workers'
Party (PSOE) ended its 34th congress here today with Joaquin
Almunia, the party's spokesman in the parliament, elected to
succeed Felipe Gonzalez Marquez as its secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The new leader was elected after Gonzalez said he would like to
step down from the post he had been holding since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Almunia, a master degree holder and a former university
professor, was born in 1948 and joined the PSOE in 1974. Becoming

<HEADLINE> State Pilots Bond Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China's pilot program for
convertible bonds will draw mainly from the country's 512 key
State-owned enterprises, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Convertible bonds are exchangeable for stocks at a prestated
price. They are appropriated for investors who want a higher
income than available from common stock together with a greater
appreciation potential than regular bonds offer.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission as saying that the move reflects the central
government's increasing attention to the capital market in its
search for a solution to ease the capital shortage of the State
sector.
</P>
<P>
A bustling stock market upsurge from last year has encouraged
the government to try to widen connections between the reform of
State firms and expansion of the capital market, he said.
</P>
<P>
State quotas for stock issues, which stood at 5.5 billion yuan
(660 million US dollars) for 1995 and 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion
US dollars) for 1996, has climbed to 30 billion yuan ( 3.6 billion
US dollars) for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Securities authorities said State enterprises would be given
priority in selection of new share-issuers.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) also
announced it would allow the floating of four billion yuan (480
million US dollars) in convertible corporate bonds this year to
supplement the regular stock issuance.
</P>
<P>
CSRC said it will look to non-listed firms first for
convertible floating thus expanding the share-issuing group.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has decided to take bank loans as the
prime funding source for enterprises during the 1996-2000 period,
it has been allowing State enterprises to enlist the capital
market more frequently than expected.
</P>
<P>
Shared by so many enterprises, State bank funds are
insufficient even under the new sponsoring bank system arranged by
the government to ensure adequate lending from banks to State
enterprises. State banks are also more prudent in extending loans
now that transformation to real commercial banks gets under
way. The stock market, still hungry for new shares, is much more
generous.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK's Success Story Will Continue After Handover:          French Diplomat (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The post-handover Hong Kong will
be shown with its usual flair of dynamism, advanced communication
network and infrastructure to "make bold steps into the 21st
century", French Counsel General in Hong Kong Thierry Dana said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on prosperity demonstrated in the past decades, we
believe the success story will continue," said Dana in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Dana came to the Hong Kong last September and "has been loving
the city since then". At midnight on June 30, he will join some
4,000 global dignitaries witnessing the solemn handover ceremony
to be held in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center
Extension -- a new landmark on the waterfront of Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Dana highlighted the significance of the handover, saying that
Hong Kong's return to China marks a historic event and will glare
in the eyes of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"French people fully understand the idea of national identity,
and welcome the fact that Hong Kong is re-integrated with its
motherland," the 41-year-old diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 500 French companies operating in
Hong Kong, and some 5,000 French nationals working thousands miles
away from their homeland. "We make ourselves known through brand
names of haute couture products -- perfumes, fashion, shoes,
leather, wines and spirits," Dana said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the main thrust of French activities in Hong
Kong remains in such fields as construction and civil engineering,
banking and high technology.
</P>
<P>
From Kai Tak Airport runaway to the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center Extension and the escalator linking Central and
Mid-levels -- the longest one over the world, French contributions
to Hong Kong infrastructure have always been prominent, Dana
noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, French banks also make part of Hong Kong's
sophisticated banking services, with BNP, Credit Lyonnais, Societe
Generale, among others, being very active financing Hong Kong
trade and companies development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Like investors from other countries, French businessmen felt
quite at ease with the handover.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey by the French Business Association in Hong
Kong, grouping over 300 French companies, showed that over 95
percent maintain confidence in the business climate in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 factor has "positively" affected the investment
strategy of French companies, Dana said, since they believe that
the handover will give them better access to the lucrative Chinese
market, with Hong Kong acting as a springboard.
</P>
<P>
As Dana put it, Hong Kong's prosperity comes from a mix of
different factors -- a well organized liberalism, the rule of law,
and last but not least, proximity to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a bridge to do business with China, Hong
Kong will remain a regional hub, and this explains the increasing
number of French companies locating regional headquarters in Hong
Kong, such as Air France in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
"In the next five and 10 years, I see the place even more
oriented toward supplying high level services -- banking,
shipment, software, accountancy, law and so on" -- to companies
both in the Chinese mainland and in other Asian countries, Dana
said.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Interview: "I Like Challenging Job," Says HK Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- "Although business tours abroad
and dinner parties take much of my spare time, I still love my job
as a civil servant which is very challenging and important,"
Director of Immigration Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee said.
</P>
<P>
"I usually work at least ten hours a day," she said.
</P>
<P>
Having served in various posts in the Hong Kong government in
the past 22 years, Ip has never found her job boring. "Instead, I
feel honored and satisfied to serve my fellow people," said Ip in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She was assigned to the current post in August 1996 to be the
first female chief of the Immigration Department staffed by some
6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Ip and 20 other government secretaries will stay in their posts
after July 1 to serve the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), according to an announcement by Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa in February.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the work range of her department formed in 1961, Ip
said it is in charge of controlling people moving into and out of
Hong Kong; and the documentation of local residents, including
naturalization, the issue of travel documents and identity cards,
and the registration of births, deaths and marriages.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of the handover, the department is
performing a new duty, that is, the issue of the HKSAR passport.
</P>
<P>
Ip stated that everyone who is a Chinese citizen and has the
right of abode in Hong Kong is eligible to apply for a HKSAR
passport, whether he or she holds a British National Overseas
(BNO) passport or a Certificate of Identity (CI).
</P>
<P>
Local residents have shown a great interest in receiving the
HKSAR passport, Ip said, adding as many as 300,000 applications
forms for the passport were handed out during the first three days
after they became available.
</P>
<P>
The first group of the passports will be issued on July 3, the
first working day after the establishment of the HKSAR. July 1 and
2 are made public holidays for celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"I heard somebody say: 'A HKSAR passport will symbolize my
identity as a resident of the Region,'" Ip said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new passport will facilitate travels abroad, in
view of the growing international acceptability of the document.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, "To date, 28 countries have decided
to grant visa-free entry for HKSAR passport holders, while another
five countries have announced that they will treat the passport on
an equal footing with the BNO passport."
</P>
<P>
In terms of the ten most favorite travel destinations of Hong
Kong residents, such as Thailand, Japan, Singapore, the United
States, Canada and Britain, the treatment to be granted to HKSAR
passport holders and that given currently to BNO passport holders
are exactly the same.
</P>
<P>
"We have visited many countries to publicize the passport and I
have just come back from Southeast Asia," Ip said, noting that her
department's efforts are now successful.
</P>
<P>
She described the anti-counterfeit technique of the HKSAR
passport as state of the art, with photos digitized and reproduced
on a secure laminate.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, she said, Hong Kong residents will continue to
enjoy free entrance and exit, as prescribed by the Basic Law. "I
don't see any change in that freedom after the handover," she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong residents' children born outside Hong
Kong, in particular in the inland areas of China, Ip said, "These
children have the right of abode in Hong Kong in accordance with
the Basic Law, but they must come in a legal and orderly way."
</P>
<P>
"We will take measures to repatriate those who enter Hong Kong
illegally," she noted.
</P>
<P>
However, emigrants are warmly welcome to return to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the Local population has been
growing at a faster pace in the last several years as more and
more emigrants have returned to Hong Kong, Ip said.
</P>
<P>
The past two years alone saw some 100,000 emigrants returning
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Ip attributed the growing number of returned emigrants to the
fact that Hong Kong continues to enjoy economic prosperity and
social stability during the transitional period. "So, they have
shown an increasing confidence in Hong Kong after July 1," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old uniformed director said that she felt excited
about the handover. "A historic moment is coming," she said.
</P>
<P>
As a senior civil servant in the future HKSAR government, she
will play her part in the great cause of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong". "I hope I will not let Hong Kong people
down," she said.
</P>
<P>
"As head of an excellent disciplinary service, I should be very
careful with my words and deeds," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ip graduated from Hong Kong University, the cradle of a line-up
of local senior civil servants, with a Bachelor of Arts in English
Literature, before she was granted a Master of Letters in Britain
and a Master of Science in Management in the United States.
</P>
<P>
She speaks fluent Mandarin, and is fond of enjoying music,
watching movies, reading books on Chinese history and traveling
with her family.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK's Success Story Will Continue After Handover: French Diplomat (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to French figures, Hong Kong imported more than 24
billion HK dollars (3.1 billion US dollars) worth of goods from
France last year, with a third re-exported to the Chinese
mainland, while HK exports to France totaled 4.2 billion HK
dollars (540 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But there is still "ground for a significant expansion of
bilateral trade", the diplomat noted. "This is true for consumer
goods such as garments, foodstuff and cars, as well as for
industrial components and equipment re-exported to the Chinese
mainland. But I am confident it is the service sector which will
provide the greatest opportunities for our technology."
</P>
<P>
For ordinary French people, Hong Kong is better known as an
attractive tourist destination. There is a growing number of
French tourists coming to Hong Kong, very often on a tour of Asia.
</P>
<P>
"They are fascinated by the dynamism of the city, the beauty of
the harbor and its skyline. They enjoy shopping and the Chinese
cuisine, which they believe is the best cuisine in the world with
the French cuisine," Dana said.
</P>
<P>
France appeals to Hong Kongers the same. "Hong Kong tourists
have a growing interest in France. They are attracted by our
quality of life, our culture, as well as gastronomy and wine sold
at very reasonable prices."
</P>
<P>
In Dana's eyes, Hong Kong is an advanced international business
and financial center which also shows a high capability for art
appreciation, just like New York.
</P>
<P>
So it's natural that the French May, an annual arts festival
celebrating French culture in Hong Kong, has become more and more
popular in the city where the East meets the West.
</P>
<P>
"We believe cultural exchanges are just as important in our
interaction with the city as in business," Dana said.
</P>
<P>
The French May this year, the fifth of its kind, has been
particularly glittering with some 20 diversified programs,
highlighting the cultural exchanges between Europe and Asia,
between France and China.
</P>
<P>
Among them, From Beijing to Versailles, a prominent art
exhibition of about 150 invaluable pieces, traced the
long-standing artistic and diplomatic relations between France and
China from ancient dynasties up till the 17th and 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
The French May will come back here next year, and the French
Consulate in Hong Kong, organizer of the annual rendezvous, has
already been busy preparing for a 1998 edition, Dana said.

<HEADLINE> National Software Campaign Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is to launch a nationwide
campaign to recommend high-quality software starting this month,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, the fourth of its kind in recent years, is aimed
at sorting out the good from the bad for the public. The aim is
also to promote the commercialization of China's software.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign is expected to inject new vigor into China's
software industry," said Wu Kezhong, secretary-general of China
Software Industry Assn (CSIA).
</P>
<P>
China's software industry, although playing an important role
in the national economy, still lags behind the world's advanced
level.
</P>
<P>
"The industry's infrastructure is weak," said Yang Tianxing,
CSIA chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said China should develop the industry as it is the "soul"
of the future information age.
</P>
<P>
China's software sales amounted to 9.5 billion yuan (1.14
billion US dollars) last year, up 36 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Home-made software occupied 40 percent of the domestic market
share.
</P>
<P>
But operating software was dominated by foreign firms, Wu
said. Foreign manufacturers secured more than 95 percent of the
market for operating software.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese software developers enjoy the advantage of a cultural
background in application software," he said.
</P>
<P>
Home-made application software occupies between 80 and 90
percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 13,000 software manufacturers, involving
500,000 trained employees.
</P>
<P>
Development of the software industry has promoted the
development of the country's personal computer industry," Wu
said. In the past year, sales of personal computers (PCs) in China
increased 70 percent to 2.05 million PCs.
</P>
<P>
Gross sales are expected to hit 3 million this year. Meanwhile,
development of the personal computer industry will give incentives
to the software industry.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Subway Line Rolls into Trial Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A longed-for subway will
formally open in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong Province on
June 28, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Lin Shusen, mayor of
Guangzhou as saying that it is an underground dragon that
Cantonese have dreamed of for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Although only 5.4 kilometers of the 18.5-kilometer No.1 subway
route will be put into operation this time, local residents hope
it will ease the traffic jams. The entire No.1 route - from
Guangzhou Iron &AMP; Steel Plant to Guangzhou East Railway Station -
is scheduled for completion by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Gathered from home and abroad, about 6.12 billion yuan was
pumped into the construction. So far, 90 percent of the main
structural construction is finished, including building all the 16
stations.
</P>
<P>
To better serve its booming economy and growing population,
Guangzhou began to blueprint its own metro and light rail network
in 1989, which included the No.1, No.2 and No.3 subway routes, as
well as two light rails.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the subway project was kicked off by pulling down all
the buildings along No.1 route and moving half a million citizens
to their new houses, and the hard digging work under the downtown
area began in 1995, the paper says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has stepped up training of
sanitation workers and technical talents as the capital sees more
trash produced, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a big challenge in keeping the city clean while
its residents produce some 3,000-truck loads of trash every day,"
said Li Jun, an official with the educational department under the
Beijing Environmental Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Li's bureau is responsible for the work of clearing up and
treating rubbish and supervising the city's appearance: monitoring
whether streets are clean or billboards are up to the Advertisement
Law.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Environmental Sanitation Educational Centre, opened
last year with three different environmental sanitation schools,
trains professionals from skilled workers to administrative
personnel urgently needed in sanitation work.
</P>
<P>
Beijing municipal government has invested about 33 million yuan
(3.98 million US dollars) to build the center, which occupies
about five hectares in Daxing County in the southern part of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With modern equipment including computers and a language
laboratory, about 650 students are taking courses in computer
science and English apart from the main course in urban sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The center has just opened a new major in automated treatment
of daily rubbish in urban area in a move to train a new generation
of sanitation professionals.
</P>
<P>
The center, affiliated with Beijing Environmental Sanitation
Bureau, is also a place to improve the educational background of
employees. They are encouraged to sit in on classes during their
spare time, according to Li.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Diplomat Optimistic About HK Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's top diplomat in Hong Kong
sees a promising future for Hong Kong, which will return to China
on July 1, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian commissioner in Hong Kong Garrett Lambert believes
Hong Kong's return to China will be "a happy day for Chinese
people" -- those in Hong Kong and ethnic Chinese in other
countries, including Canada.
</P>
<P>
"He believes he can also see a promising future for Hong Hong,
despite warnings from human rights groups, Hong Kong opposition
groups, the British governor and some American politicians," the
Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Lambert praised Tung Chee-hwa,
who will become administrator of Hong Kong when it returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Tung is "a man of considerable integrity" who has kept his
promises since being named Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting last
November, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian diplomat "believes the process by which Mr. Tung
and his provisional legislature were chosen is a step up from the
way the British have acted during their time in Hong Hong."
</P>
<P>
"For 150-odd years, a man got off the ship or airplane in Hong
Kong and said `Hello, I'm your new ruler,'" he was quoted as
saying, referring to Britain's practice of naming a Hong Kong
governor without consulting Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Chinese government, saying it has kept its
promises made under the terms of the Joint Declaration with
Britain.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence whatsoever that I can find that the
government of China has ever done anything -- actually done
anything -- but lived up to its obligations," the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Neither China, the new Hong Kong administration nor the
thousands of international businesses based in Hong Kong will work
against Hong Hong's interests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If you're living here, you want this place to succeed. Why
would you do anything to cause it to go into reverse?" he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Summit of Eight Pledges to Meet Challenges, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven
industrialized countries and Russia today ended a three-day
summit, pledging to meet global challenges in the next century,
but papering over their differences on some major issues.
</P>
<P>
"We've agreed on new steps to organize our nations to lay a
strong foundation in the 21st century, to prepare our people and
our economies for the global marketplace, to meet new
transnational threats to our security," U.S. President Bill
Clinton said at the closing of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization brings with it problems none of us can conquer
alone," he told the leaders.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan, the U.S., Russia, Germany and the European Union (EU) said,
"The process of globalization, a major factor underlying the
growth for world prosperity in the last 50 years, is now advancing
rapidly and broadly."
</P>
<P>
"More openness and integration across the global economy create
opportunities fo increased prosperity," said the final communique.
"Our task, as we enter the 21st century, is to make the most of
these opportunities," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called for a worldwide ban on human cloning,
further research to achieve an AIDS vaccine and a new fight
against "high-tech" computer-assisted crime.
</P>
<P>
However, differences among the participants still remain in
several sectors, including the U.S. debt to the United Nations,
environment and Bosnia. Also Russia's full participation of the
summit is still a question.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans want a 15 percent cut of carbon dioxide and other
gases to combat global warming by the year 2010, but the U.S.,
which France say is "one of the world's largest polluters,"
rejected it and upheld "a realistic and pragmatic approach" to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The communique papered over the dispute. "Our ultimate goal
must be to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse
gases at an acceptable level," it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the U.N. some 1.3 billion U.S. dollars back dues.
Japan and others argued that Washington should pay the money
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. is mapping a plan of partial payment with many
conditions attached, demanding the U.N. cut budget, personnel as
well as the U.S. share of the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
Clinton prevailed. Without mentioning the name of any country,
the final communique said, "The U.N. system must be placed on a
firm financial footing through full and timely payment of
obligations, and development of a more logical and equitable scale
of assessment."
</P>
<P>
On Bosnia, the leaders issued a statement urging the Balkan
leaders to fully comply with the Dayton Peace Accords signed in
1995 with the trans-Atlantic differences still remaining on
whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
stabilization forces should pull out of the region by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly said that it would withdraw all its
8,500 troops from the region by the deadline. But the Europeans
fear that the withdrawal might result in a new round of bloodshed
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The most historic development of the summit process is Russia's
full participation. With the push from the U.S., Japan, France
and other members of the G-7 industrialized nations reluctantly
accepted the fact.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Russian President Boris Yeltsin is still excluded
from the economic and financial discussions by the G-7 leaders. He
met with U.S. businessmen Saturday while the other leaders
discussed macro-economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Japan and France believe that it is better for the group to
discuss economic matters without Russia's participation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that it will take at least another two to three
years for Russia, whose economic growth is still minus 6 percent,
to get a real full participation in the economic part of the
event.

<HEADLINE> US Prison Population Growth Slows Down in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The adult prison population in
the United states growth slowed a bit last year after a decade's
surge that more than doubled the number of inmates, the Justice
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The nation's federal and state prisons added 55,876 inmates to
set a record in 1996. That was a 5 percent increase, to just over
1.18 million inmates, as of December 31. Between 1985 and 1996,
the average annual increase was 8.1 percent, according to the
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, 1996, there were another 518,492 people held in
local jails, which are used primarily for sentences of less than
one year and for defendants awaiting or on trial.
</P>
<P>
Counting both the prison and jail inmates, there were more than
1.6 million adults behind bars as of last June 30. That is an
incarceration rate of 615 inmates for every 100,000 U.S.
residents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, state prisons were operating from 16
percent to 24 percent over capacity and federal prisons were 25
percent above capacity.

<HEADLINE> Eight Powers Warn Balkan Leaders on Peace in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Russia today called on the Balkan
leaders to protect peace in Bosnia and said they would face a
cut-off of aid otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"The international community will maintain a long-term
engagement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Balkan region as a
whole," the leaders said in a statement following their three-day
summit. "We are prepared to continue to help the states of this
region, but our continued commitment is not unconditional," they
declared.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia and
Yugoslavia to meet their "responsibilities and obligations."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Canada, Russia and the European Union also urged the
Bosnian authorities to "uphold fully the right of refugees and
displaced persons to return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
"We will support those communities that work cooperatively to
support returns. Those who fail to do so will lose access to
economic assistance," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It urged leaders in the region to fully implement the Dayton
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Full access to economic and other assistance, as well as
integration in regional and international institutions, is
dependent on compliance with these obligations," the leaders
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The statement papered over differences between the Europeans
and Americans on the U.S. decision to pull all its forces out of
Bosnia by June 1998.
</P>
<P>
European leaders at the Denver summit expressed their concern
to U.S. President Bill Clinton about the U.S. decision to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton refused to budge. Speaking at a press
conference after the summit, Clinton reiterated the policy of
withdrawing all its 8,500 troops from the region by the deadline.
