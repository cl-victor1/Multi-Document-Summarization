<HEADLINE> Census Bureau To Revive Sampling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the time has run out for bickering over  
methods, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt announced Wednesday the 
2000 Census will provide a traditional head count for congressional 
apportionment, to be followed by a ``more accurate'' number for 
other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've simply got to be doing it. We've got to move forward,''  
Prewitt told a news conference 13 months before his agency has to 
count the nation's estimated 275 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said his bureau will use traditional methods to make  
population estimates for the 50 states by Dec. 31, 2000, for use in 
distributing the 435 seats in the House. The Supreme Court required 
such counting for apportionment in a decision last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the job will not be finished then, Prewitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bureau will then undertake a statistical-sampling method it  
calls Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation to determine how many people 
were missed and to develop more accurate numbers. Those numbers 
will be released April 1, 2000, for use when states draw new 
congressional and legislative districts. They also will be 
available for use in distributing federal funds and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to use statistical sampling in the census have brought  
heated debate between the administration and Congress, and 
Prewitt's announcement drew prompt criticism from House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	``While congressional Republicans are committed to developing  
legal, community-based initiatives to count everyone in America, 
I'm disappointed that the Clinton-Gore administration apparently 
will not allow the professionals at the census bureau to actually 
count everyone,'' Hastert said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	After producing two census numbers in 1990 -- one with sampling,  
one without -- the bureau had been seeking to avoid confusion with a 
one-number count in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	To announce a two-number census now, Hastert said, is  
``hypocritical'' and a ``flip-flop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt said he doesn't see it as a two-number census but rather  
one number that is less complete, another that is more complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy debates over sampling have delayed preparations for  
Census 2000, and Prewitt stressed that there is no longer any room 
for discussion of methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the lateness of the hour, we must acknowledge the hard  
reality that we no longer have the luxury of debates about 
alternative designs or substitute procedures,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is likely to bring on continued conflict with House Census  
subcommittee chairman Dan Miller, R-Fla., who has introduced an 
$800 million package of proposals to improve the census, to include 
allowing local officials to ask the bureau to recheck its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult for us to design a census when congressional  
committees are, at this late stage, saying `let's do this instead 
of that,''' Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants to meet with Miller and ``talk about which of  
his ideas can be incorporated in a productive way and which 
cannot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new census was also attacked by the Southeastern Legal  
Foundation, which brought the lawsuit decided by the Supreme Court 
last month banning sampling for reapportionment. Matthew J. Glavin, 
the group's president, said he will file another suit to block the 
new plan, which he called unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William J. Daley, Prewitt's boss, endorsed  
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for the professionals at the bureau to be  
allowed to get on with producing the best census possible,'' Daley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.J., a member of the House  
Government and Oversight census subcommittee, praised the plan as a 
way to comply with the Supreme Court decision while still getting 
the most accurate count possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``In opposing the use of modern methods, ... the majority is  
insisting that we spend billions more for a less accurate census,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Census was the first to be less accurate than the one  
before. The sampling plan for 2000 was designed to avoid that. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, however, Prewitt admitted that the count will not be  
absolutely correct. ``The census is never going to be perfect,'' 
Prewitt said. ``The question is how close can we get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Census involves mailing forms to nearly 100 million  
households and sending thousands of workers to follow up the 
millions that don't reply. It's the federal government's largest 
peacetime mobilization, Prewitt noted.

	Independent Counsel Hearings Open  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should just let the independent  
counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon 
after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal ``is likely to be a 
mistake,'' former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a 
Senate committee today. He spoke to the Governmental Affairs 
Committee at its opening hearing on whether to renew, rewrite or 
let the law die. The 1978 statute is due to expire June 30. 
President Clinton, meanwhile, declined to comment on the issue but 
told reporters that White House lawyers will testify on the matter 
next week.

	Kosovo's Ethnic Albanians Unite  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rival ethnic Albanian  
factions today formed a coalition to push harder to secede from 
Serbia. The surprise announcement came a day after Kosovo peace 
talks concluded without any breakthrough on a deal to end a year of 
fighting in the southern Serbian province. The announcement spelled 
success for a long-term American and European goal -- getting ethnic 
Albanians to speak with one voice. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: U.S. Has Stake in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
has an interest in resolving the Kosovo conflict. ``I would argue 
we have a humanitarian interest,'' he said. ``The United States 
does have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the 
Balkans,'' Clinton said. Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 
U.S. troops as part of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to 
Kosovo for at least three years if a peace plan were implemented.

	1 Dead in Avalanche in Austria  
</P>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Helicopters rescued stranded tourists in  
western Austria and another killer avalanche brought new heartache 
today. The new avalanche struck just miles from where rescuers were 
digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The 
latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where a 
dead woman and three survivors were pulled from the snow and 
debris. Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency 
said. Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche 
yesterday.

	Prejudice May Be Heart Care Factor  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Subconscious prejudices among doctors may help  
explain why women and blacks complaining of chest pain are less 
likely than men and whites to receive the best cardiac testing, a 
study suggests. A new study of 720 physicians found that, with all 
symptoms being equal, doctors were only 60 percent as likely to 
order cardiac catheterization for women and blacks as for men and 
whites. For black women, the doctors were only 40 percent as likely 
to order catheterization.

	Greenspan Warns About Minimum Wage  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some  
teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. Delivering the Fed's semiannual 
economic report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage 
probably would push inflation higher. President Clinton, in his 
State of the Union address last month, proposed raising the wage by 
$1 to $6.15 by September 2000.

	8th-Grader Takes Principal Hostage

	MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An eighth-grade boy with a gun took his  
principal hostage this afternoon, apparently after the principal 
tried to discipline him for carrying the weapon in school. Montvale 
Elementary School Principal Jim Ratledge was taken hostage in his 
office shortly after 2 p.m., a spokeswoman for the school system 
said. No shots had been fired and no one was reported hurt, she 
said.

counts of first-degree murder in a series of sex slavery killings 
dating to 1984 and 1985. The jury also found special circumstances 
of multiple murder that make Ng, a 38-year-old from Hong Kong, 
eligible for the death penalty, to be determined in a separate 
penalty phase of the trial.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, mired at .500 12  
games through the abbreviated NBA season, fired coach Del Harris 
today. Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball 
operations, said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry 
Drew -- will handle the coaching duties for the rest of the season. 
The team made the announcement as it was adding Dennis Rodman to 
what on paper is one of the more talented teams in the league.

	PANAMA CITY (AP) -- The U.S. military will hand over a naval base  
to Panama about six weeks earlier than originally planned as part 
of the turnover of Canal Zone facilities, Panamanian officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodman naval base, built more than 60 years ago, will be  
turned over to Panama on March 11 instead of April 30 as originally 
scheduled, said officials at the Interoceanic Region Authority, 
which is trying to attract investment to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The base is on the Pacific side of the Panama Canal, which is to  
be turned over to Panama by the end of the year under the 1977 
Torrijos-Carter treaty. Rodman and four other remaining major bases 
house 4,000 U.S. military personnel. 
</P>

	The 2,194-acre base was a center of U.S. military activity  
during World War II.

	CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) -- Officials said Wednesday they have  
arrested six people accused of poisoning milk and snack foods to 
extort money from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Leonardo Castillo, attorney general of the central state of  
Morelos, said members of the group confessed to injecting poison 
into products at convenience stores in Mexico City and seven 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	They would then call product manufacturers and demand money in  
exchange for revealing the stores where the products had been 
poisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would call the companies, and they came right away,''  
Carlos Gomez Meza, one of the suspects, told reporters at a news 
conference arranged by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Castillo said the group obtained as much as $59,000 from a milk  
company.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has restored  
constitutional guarantees on Venezuela's tense border with 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The constitutional guarantees were suspended in 1995 to allow  
security forces to fight leftist rebels from the neighboring 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, Venezuelans living in the area will enjoy  
freedom of movement and assembly and have the right to refuse 
warrantless searches along the 1,300-mile border with Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	When he announced his plan to restore the guarantees 10 days  
ago, Chavez also issued a stern warning to Colombian rebels who 
might enter Venezuela, saying ``we demand that they not commit a 
single act in our territory because we will respond.''

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Chile's government Wednesday ordered the  
expulsion of three foreigners, accusing them of meddling in 
national affairs by supporting protests by Mapuche Indians in 
southern Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry identified the foreigners as Arnaud  
Fuentes, of France; Patricia Ballestero Vidal, of Spain; and Lee 
Pope, an American. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting Interior Minister Belisario Velasco said Pope and  
Ballestero joined a protest Feb. 18 by Mapuche Indians opposing 
construction of a $460 million hydroelectric dam at the Bio-Bio 
river, 350 miles south of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuentes, Velasco said, actively supported a Mapuche protest on  
Friday in Traiguen, 270 miles south of Santiago. The protest 
against a timber company triggered a clash that injured 8 police 
officers and led to the arrest of 28 Mapuches. 
</P>

	Fuentes was identified as a university student from southern  
France. Ballesteros told Chilean TV she was a tourist. No

former coup leader, promised to incorporate the poor into an 
ambitious ``military-civic'' plan to build roads and hospitals.

participants in the plan, which will include 70,000 soldiers and 
80,000 ordinary citizens.

<HEADLINE>  Britain Orders Reform of Race Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Declaring that the racially motivated killing of a  
black teen-ager shamed the nation, the British government today 
ordered a major overhaul of race laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The order followed today's release of an official report that  
said London's police force is riddled with racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still  
exists in our society,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told a hushed 
House of Commons. ``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government released the report of a judicial inquiry that  
said the police inquiry into the 1993 fatal stabbing of 17-year-old 
Stephen Lawrence was marked by ``professional incompetence and 
institutional racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five white youths suspected of killing Lawrence while he waited  
at a bus stop with a black friend have never been successfully 
prosecuted. All five denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister in charge of the  
police, announced that laws making racial discrimination an offense 
will be broadened to include the police and all government 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London  
and tighter disciplinary regulations for police. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, appeal judges may for the first time be empowered  
to permit suspects to be tried twice for the same offense if there 
is new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged  
again because they were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of Lawrence, whose Jamaican-born parents came to  
Britain 30 years ago, provoked a national debate. It has also come 
to epitomize what some see as underlying racism in a nation where 
race riots are rare and laws barring discrimination already are 
wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one reason for this murder. Stephen was  
black,'' Straw told lawmakers as the teen-ager's parents, Neville 
and Doreen Lawrence, watched from the visitors' gallery in the 
House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by retired judge Sir William Macpherson also said  
that an internal police inquiry into the handling of the Lawrence 
investigation was ``flawed and indefensible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A section of the report, which had been leaked to the media  
earlier, said London's overwhelmingly white Metropolitan police 
force was plagued by ``institutional racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be seen, or detected in processes, attitudes and  
behavior which amounts to discrimination ... which disadvantages 
ethnic minority people,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw said Lawrence's killing and its repercussions had given  
whites -- 93 percent of the population -- a look at what it is like 
to be black or Asian in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the truths are uncomfortable,'' said Straw, adding he  
wanted the report to be a catalyst for irrevocable change 
nationwide.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 144.75  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks beat a hasty retreat in the final hour of  
trading to close lower, after bond prices slid and pushed interest 
rates higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 144.75 
at 9,399.67. The Dow opened softer but quickly rallied in the 
morning, peaking at just over 9,600, or up 55 points, before 
trimming its gains in late morning and then staging an outright 
retreat in the afternoon. The price of the 30-year bond was down 
more than a point, or $10 for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, 
which moves opposite the price, moved above the critical 5.5 
percent to 5.51 percent. The rise in interest rates was 
particularly injurious to technology and financial stocks, which 
had been providing some leadership to the upside in recent 
sessions. The Dow was led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 2 3/8 at 70 3/4, 
and American Express, down 3 15/16 at 107 11/16. The Nasdaq 
composite index was down 36.97 at 2,339.48.

	Broadcasters Plan To Sue DirecTV  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters want a court to immediately stop  
the nation's largest satellite TV company from beaming CBS and Fox 
programs to its customers. DirecTV Inc. plans to directly offer 
customers nationwide tomorrow the option of buying a new package of 
broadcast network stations, including CBS and Fox affiliates. By 
dumping its supplier, PrimeTime 24, and directly offering the 
network programs itself, DirecTV contends it is not affected by a 
federal court order that would cut customers off from CBS and Fox 
signals on Sunday. But broadcasters disagree, calling DirecTV's 
plans ``a brazen attempt to ignore'' the court order issued last 
year by a federal judge in Miami.

	Computer Glitch Hits Schwab Trading  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Schwab became the latest Internet  
brokerage to frustrate online investors as a computer crash just 
minutes after today's opening bell left the industry's dominant 
player offline for most of the morning. The online system went down 
at 9:37 a.m. EST due to software problems with a new mainframe 
computer that was added to help Schwab handle its booming Internet

	Greenspan Warns About Minimum Wage  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some  
teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. He was responding to questions 
from House Banking Committee members while delivering the Fed's 
semiannual report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage 
probably would push inflation higher. But he said his main concern 
was ``individuals who become unemployed because of the minimum 
wage.'' He said that being unemployed as a teen-ager is detrimental 
to learning by training and becoming a productive member of the 
work force,'' he said. President Clinton has proposed raising the 
wage by $1 to $6.15 by September 2000.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Microsoft engineer rejected as ``completely  
unfounded'' a courtroom claim by Apple Computer that Microsoft 
tried to sabotage Apple's multimedia software. Eric Engstrom also 
argued forcefully that proposals to cooperate with Apple on 
Internet video and audio software stemmed from Microsoft's desire 
to help frustrated customers, not from a desire to eliminate 
competition. Later today, the government began questioning Joachim 
Kempin, the senior Microsoft executive responsible for the 
company's business deals with the nation's computer makers.

	ST. CATHARINES, Ontario (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will  
eliminate more than 1,100 jobs at two Canadian plants, most of them 
at a brake and axle factory that is losing a contract to supply 
truck axles, the No. 1 automaker announced today. Layoff notices 
will be issued starting Monday and the job cuts will begin in July. 
The workers' union contract and provincial labor law require at 
least 16 weeks of notice of layoffs. GM hopes to minimize the 
effect on workers by offering early retirements to some, spokesman 
Stew Low said.

of price fixing. U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning delayed 
sentencing Andreas and two others convicted in the conspiracy in 
order to gain more time to determine how much money ADM reaped and 
assess a possible fine. Andreas is a former executive vice 
president of the agribusiness giant. He was convicted together with 
Terrance Wilson, the former head of ADM's corn division, and 
imprisoned ADM biochemist Mark Whitacre. All three were to have 
been sentenced Friday.

	Brazilians Show Resentment of IMF

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- As Brazil negotiates with the  
Washington-based International Monetary Fund for help to fix its 
battered economy, a long-standing resentment of ``yankee'' 
influence is slowly reviving. The hostility could make it harder 
for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to make the budget cuts he 
promised to the IMF in return for a $41.5 billion loan package. 
Senate president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a veteran power-broker 
and conservative ally of Cardoso said recently that the 
government's need to seek IMF help is understandable. ``...But that 
doesn't mean the IMF can meddle in national problems...'' he added.

<HEADLINE> ESPN, Fox Fight Over America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN would pull out of the America's Cup before  
showing a Fox Sports Net logo during its broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America, a syndicate of the New York Yacht Club, signed a  
sponsorship deal with Fox last month and plans to have Fox Sports 
Net ads on its sails and hulls for the 1999-2000 America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But ESPN, which owns the U.S. broadcast rights, won't televise  
the event as long as the ads of one its primary competitors are on 
Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the option to pull out and we've indicated that if  
they can't deliver the event that we're buying, then we'll pull 
out,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice president of 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	If ESPN does withdraw from airing the event, as it threatened to  
do recently, it would likely affect fund-raising for the syndicates 
who count on American TV exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Another network, including Fox Sports Net, could pick up the  
event but would have trouble putting together a production team at 
this late date. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover said ESPN already has agreements in place with the two  
major organization bodies of the America's Cup -- the America's Cup 
2000 and the America's Cup Challenge Association. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's contract, which is expected to be signed this week,  
stipulates that the product is clear of competing network logos. 
</P>
<P>
	The America's Cup 2000 is the event organizer in New Zealand and  
the America's Cup Challenge Association represents the 
competition's 15 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But final approval hinges on an unanimous decision by the 15  
challenge teams -- including Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a straight-up deal with Fox after ESPN went public with  
its deal late last year,'' said John Marshall, president of Young 
America. ``We have binding contracts and we're just waiting for 
ESPN to agree to the final deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the agreement is signed, the syndicates will have 30 days  
to agree to the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel there's plenty of room for give and take so that ESPN  
will do the broadcast,'' Marshall said. ``But no one can make 
binding contracts between us and Fox disappear. ESPN wants some 
concessions, but we don't know how that will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox officials refused to comment on the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Re-sign Free Safety Thomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Orlando Thomas is staying with the Minnesota  
Vikings, and it looks like Jerry Ball and Derrick Alexander are on 
the way out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings re-signed Thomas, their starting free safety, on  
Wednesday to a four-year contract worth $11 million. The deal 
includes a $2.75 million signing bonus -- most of it deferred -- and 
incentive money aimed at improving Thomas' workout habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings hope that will help Thomas avoid the nagging  
hamstring injuries that have bothered him in recent seasons. When 
Thomas was healthy during his first two seasons he had 14 
interceptions; he has four over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very optimistic that he can regain that level (of  
1995-96) over the next few years,'' said Jeff Diamond, Minnesota's 
senior vice president for player personnel. ``We're going to work 
on some things to try to strengthen those hamstrings that gave him 
some problems last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Thomas became a priority after cornerback Corey Fuller  
signed with the expansion Cleveland Browns this month. Losing half 
of the starting secondary would have been devastating, especially 
with backup free safety Torrian Gray trying to return from a 
serious knee injury that cost him the final nine games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't enjoy the prospect of having to perhaps replace two  
starters in the secondary,'' Diamond said. ``Now we just have to 
find another corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' deal probably is the last one the Vikings will work out  
with their own free agents. That leaves Ball and Alexander, two key 
members of last season's defensive line, looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball, a 330-pound nose tackle, is coming off a season in which  
he tied teammate Ed McDaniel for the NFL lead with 15 tackles for 
losses. But he is seeking about $3 million a year, considerably 
higher than an offer Ball already has rejected in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who has played mostly at right end, has had a solid  
but unspectacular career since the Vikings took him with the 11th 
overall pick in the 1995 draft. He was second on the team last 
season with a career-best 7 1/2 sacks, but he has been bothered by 
injuries most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really pretty much there with our veteran guys now,''  
Diamond said.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers waived center Benoit  
Benjamin and signed 40-year-old free-agent Rick Mahorn, who played 
for the team nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahorn spent his last two seasons with the Detroit Pistons, who  
he played for from 1985-89 before joining the 76ers for the first

</P>
<P>
	Mahorn helped the Pistons win the NBA title in 1989 as a member

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits 17-Month High Vs. Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar hit a 17-month high against the  
British pound Wednesday as it rose broadly on speculation that 
interest rates may be hiked because of the strong U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen as Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin said that the Japanese economic outlook remains recessionary. 
The dollar also rose against the euro on the continued expectations 
of an interest rate cut by the 11 countries served by the new 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a dollar strengthening ... on expectations of a  
strengthening (U.S.) economy,'' said Elena Shperling, chief 
currency trader at Banco di Sicilia. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the British pound fell to $1.5962 from  
$1.6134. During the trading day, the pound fell to $1.5960, its 
weakest point against the dollar since Sept. 18, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in late trading, the dollar was quoted at 121.80 Japanese  
yen, up from 120.81 Tuesday. The euro was quoted at $1.0990, down 
from $1.1007. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders scooped up dollars Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan reiterated his testimony from the day before, 
telling the House Banking Committee that the economy is strong and 
should remain so. But analysts believe that Greenspan seems 
inclined to raise rates if the economy gets too strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Finstrom, a senior currency futures analyst for Salomon  
Smith Barney Inc., said U.S. Treasury bonds took the hint Wednesday 
as prices dropped significantly and yields rose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed may indeed feel a need to do something to cool it  
down,'' Finstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the pound came a day after British  
Prime Minister Tony Blair laid out a multimillion-dollar plan to 
adapt computers and cash registers for the euro. Britain is not one 
of the 11 countries that embarked upon euro use at the beginning of 
the year and has no immediate plans to join in. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors sold off pounds because they foresaw the weakening of  
the British currency or its demise and because they speculate the 
Bank of England will cut rates again to prime England's lagging 
economic pump. Lower interest rates make a country's currency and 
assets less appealing to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4485 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4477, and 1.4979 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4961. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7797 German 
marks, up from 1.7768; 5.9701 French francs, up from 5.9595; and 
1,760.56 Italian lire, unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns About Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some  
teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions from House Banking Committee members  
while delivering the Fed's semiannual report to Congress, Greenspan 
said increasing the wage probably would push inflation higher. But 
he said his main concern was ``individuals who become unemployed 
because of the minimum wage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Being unemployed when you're a teen-ager ... is very  
detrimental to ... learning by training and becoming a productive 
member of the work force,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his State of the Union address last month,  
proposed raising the wage by $1 to $6.15 by September 2000. House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Sunday that Republicans were 
willing to work with Democrats to find a middle ground on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said raising the wage wouldn't cause job losses  
immediately because, with unemployment at a 29-year low, demand for 
workers is huge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the economy turns down at some point ... we're going to  
find ... that teen-age unemployment will be higher than it would 
otherwise have been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vermont, asked Greenspan why he didn't  
oppose multimillion-dollar salaries paid to corporate chief 
executives. Greenspan conceded that shareholders may be ``wasting 
their money'' on CEO salaries but said his position was consistent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm arguing that the government should not be involved ... in  
both cases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other subjects, Greenspan said:  
</P>
<P>
	--Recent layoffs at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. reflected ``a very  
specific problem associated with the industry and with the 
company'' and were not a signal of a significant shift in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Farm exports have fallen dramatically, mostly because of a drop  
in demand in Japan and other parts of Asia, and, absent a revival 
of that demand, ``It's going to be difficult to work our way 
through this particular problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Domestic steel producers have been hit hard by a surge in cheap  
imported steel but, ``prices are stabilizing, ... orders are coming 
back a bit now, and the real pressures are easing in the steel 
industry.''

<HEADLINE> Chen Ready To Join Braves' Rotation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Bruce Chen, just 21 but already drawing  
comparisons to Tom Glavine, seems well qualified to join the 
Atlanta Braves' magnificent rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not quite.  
</P>
<P>
	His golf game stinks.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I went, I shot a 110,'' Chin said, smiling  
meekly. ``And we were playing mulligans, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chen, a native of Panama, only took up golf last year. Clearly,  
he is not yet ready to join the elite foursome that includes Tom 
Glavine, Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would probably be on the fifth hole while they're on the  
12th hole,'' Chen joked. ``I would like to go out with them. But 
first, I've got to catch up with their pitching, then I'll catch up 
with their golf. I don't want to be out there on the course with 
them going, `Gee, Bruce, you're killing us. We have to be home by 
5.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Give him time. Already, Chen has defied the odds by rising from  
Double-A at the beginning of last season to a likely spot in the 
Braves rotation behind Glavine (20-6), Maddux (18-9) and Smoltz 
(17-3) -- all Cy Young winners. 
</P>
<P>
	An opening was created when the Braves traded 16-game winner  
Denny Neagle to Cincinnati during the offseason, allowing Kevin 
Millwood (17-8) to take the fourth starter slot. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how does Chen cope with joining a group that combined to win  
72 games a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I'm not feeling any pressure,'' he said, sitting in  
the dugout after a spring training workout at the Disney World 
complex. ``I think I'm more relaxed and more loose this spring 
training. Last year was my first spring (in the big-league camp). 
Now, I know what to expect and what level of baseball they play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a taste of the big leagues last spring, Chen returned to  
Class AA Greenville, where he went 13-7 with a 3.29 ERA. He was 
promoted to Triple-A Richmond, pitching only four games but well 
enough (2-1, 1.88 ERA) to earn a late-season trip to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Braves running away with the NL East, Chen was able to  
make four starts in the big leagues. The left-hander was 2-0 with a 
3.98 ERA, his poise and style drawing comparisons to Glavine in the 
early years of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you're compared to Tom Glavine, that's great,'' Chen  
said. ``But everyone is different. He knows what he can do, and I 
know what works for me. I'm not trying to copy him. ... I want to 
learn from him. I want to know why he's successful. But I also want 
to be myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending NL Cy Young winner acknowledged the similarities  
in their pitching styles, though Chen's best pitch is a curve while 
Glavine relies more on his change-up. Personality-wise, they 
resemble each other as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a great demeanor, a great presence on the mound,''  
said Glavine, renowned for his stoic demeanor. ``At the same time, 
he doesn't have one luxury that John and I had when we first came 
up. When we got up here, we expected to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine and Smoltz both came to Atlanta in the late-80s, when  
the Braves were a last-place team that could afford to groom its 
young pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine went 7-17 with a 4.54 ERA as a rookie; Smoltz also  
struggled (2-7, 5.48) during his initial big-league season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When guys come in now, they're joining a winning ballclub  
that's expected to win and they're expected to be part of that,'' 
Glavine said. ``They don't have the luxury of struggling like we 
did or saying, `So what, it's not about winning.' It's all about 
winning now. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will add a little bit more pressure, a different kind of  
pressure for Bruce. We'll see how he handles it, but I suspect 
he'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating the longer big-league season, Chen worked hard over  
the winter to improve his upper-body strength. He also attended a 
quarter of classes at Georgia Tech, working toward a degree in 
civil engineering and improving his mental skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it helps my mind when it comes to remembering  
batters,'' he said of the college experience. ``Sometimes, your 
mind loses focus and your memory starts deteriorating. I was able 
to work my mind as well as my body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next up, a few more trips to the links.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to surprise those guys,'' Chen promised. ``They all  
say, `Oh, Bruce, he has never played before.' But one of these days 
I'm going to be shooting in the 80s or maybe even the high 70s.''

<HEADLINE> Moviegoers Ignore 'Thin Red Line' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Thin Red Line'' had everything going  
for it: an all-star cast, the return of Terrence Malick after a 
two-decade absence from filmmaking and seven Oscar nominations. But 
profits have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II epic opened on Christmas Day and expanded to  
wide release on Jan. 15. But it actually lost 2.4 percent of its 
business the weekend after the Oscar nominations were announced 
Feb. 9 and another 50 percent last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The $52 million film has grossed $34.4 million in North America.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question that it was a  
disappointment that it didn't do better with a (nomination) bump,'' 
said Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox Domestic Film Group. 
``I have a feeling that because of the kind of movie it was -- more 
of an art movie that went really wide -- the people who had wanted 
to see it went to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other best picture nominees, ``Saving Private Ryan'' (in  
re-release), ``Elizabeth,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is 
Beautiful,'' all got a post-nomination bounces, as did last year's 
``Titanic,'' ``L.A. Confidential,'' ``Good Will Hunting,'' ``As 
Good As It Gets'' and ``The Full Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Directed by Malick, ``The Thin Red Line'' received mostly  
glowing reviews for its poetic, visually stunning story of the 
battle of Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
	The film features a cast with stars such as Nick Nolte and Sean  
Penn in supporting roles, and cameos by John Travolta, George 
Clooney and Woody Harrelson. Getting the most screen time are 
relative unknowns Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics found its plot convoluted, the characters  
underdeveloped and the voiceovers confusing. The movie also ran 
more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	After it was nominated for picture, director, screenplay,  
editing, sound, score and cinematography, the film lost just 2.4 
percent of its business while also losing 345 screens. Then came 
the bad news last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fascinating that this film has just died,'' said box  
office analyst Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc. ``I just don't 
understand why the film isn't catching on. Are people just 
comparing it to `Saving Private Ryan.' Is it just too `out there?' 
Is Fox not marketing it right?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reclusive Malick doesn't do media interviews. But one of the  
film's producers, Mike Medavoy, said there was still time for ``The 
Thin Red Line'' to at least break even, and it has strong prospects 
overseas. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> $65M Offer To Buy Out Marge Schott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A group headed by Larry Dolan, a member of the  
family that owns Cablevision, has offered $65 million to buy Marge 
Schott's controlling interest in the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is the first step in what figures to be a drawn-out  
process to determine the ownership of the team after Dec. 31, 2000, 
when the current partnership agreement expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's group made the offer for 5 1/2 of Schott's 6 1/2 shares,  
including the general partner's share, according to a baseball 
official with knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition he 
not be identified. The deal was first reported by The Cincinnati 
Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's group has not yet signed a definitive contract, the  
source said, and Dolan's next step would be to meet with the team's 
limited partners, who control 8 1/2 of the 15 shares. If Dolan's group 
signs a contract, the limited partners would have the right to 
match it. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dolan is not expected to sign a deal until he knows the  
limited partners' intentions. If he signed a deal and they didn't 
match, he could wind up controlling a partnership whose status is 
uncertain after December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan was away from his office when called for comment. His son,  
Paul Dolan, 40, a lawyer in the his father's firm, declined to 
discuss details of the offer but said it is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of a process. We've got some ways to go  
yet,'' Paul Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when the deal could be concluded, he said: ``I don't know.  
It could be weeks, it could be months. I don't think anything's 
imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National League is aware of the proposed deal, spokeswoman  
Katy Feeney said today in New York. Baseball will not take action 
until limited owners of the Reds first decide whether to exercise 
their right to match the Dolan group's offer, Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan has attempted to buy other sports franchises, including  
the NFL expansion Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins and New 
York Yankees. The 68-year-old lawyer is the brother of Charles 
Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems Corp., a major cable 
television provider and the owner of Madison Square Garden, the New 
York Knicks and New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	According to published accounts, Larry Dolan's wealth was built  
largely upon his ownership of stock in Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has barred Schott from day-to-day  
involvement in the management of the Reds because of comments 
deemed insensitive to minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
	She is not permitted to discuss a possible sale, but previous  
accounts said she was asking $78 million for 5 1/2 shares with the 
hope of keeping one share and maintaining at least a ceremonial 
role with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott could not be reached, and Reds managing executive John  
Allen declined comment, saying he was not involved.

<HEADLINE>  Serb Declare Victory After Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Jubilant Serb negotiators returned  
home today, saying they prevailed against Western pressure at the 
Kosovo peace talks by keeping foreign troops out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	State media joined in the exultation, describing the results  
from 17 days of talks in Rambouillet, France, as a victory for the 
government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, a mood of defiance prevailed among Kosovo's  
Albanian leaders, who were unable to gain an agreement for full 
independence for Kosovo, a southern province of Serbia with an 
overwhelming ethnic Albanian majority among its 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks were recessed Tuesday until March 15 after Western  
mediators extracted only partial agreement between warring Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians on a political framework for separatist-minded 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The military part of the proposed accord -- which provides for  
stationing 28,000 armed NATO peacekeepers, including Americans, in 
Kosovo -- was left unresolved because of Serbia's steadfast refusal 
to allow foreign troops on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian President Milan Milutinovic told reporters at Belgrade  
airport today that the talks had achieved ``significant initial 
success'' in solving the problems in Kosovo, where more than 2,000 
people have died in fighting the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our principal efforts to preserve the territorial integrity  
and sovereignty of our country were affirmed,'' Milutinovic said. 
</P>
<P>
	An air of triumph was echoed on Serbia's state television, a  
government mouthpiece, which ran four times overnight and this 
morning Milutinovic's description of attempts to pressure the Serbs 
into accepting NATO peacekeepers as a ``farce and a circus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, Adem Demaci of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army told  
the Albanian-language daily Kosova Sot that he and the KLA will 
continue working on full independence as a ``final solution to the 
Kosovo problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was huge pressure on us to accept because (Milosevic)  
was rejecting the agreement. But we, Albanians, should not accept 
something just because Milosevic rejects it,'' Demaci was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian sources said the Albanian delegation in France,  
which was unable to get international officials to go along with 
its demand for an independence referendum, has decided to form a 
new ``government'' that will function until elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will be a coalition of the KLA and two major  
political parties -- Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo 
and Rexhep Cosja's Union of Democratic Movement -- the KLA's news 
agency Kosovo Press and Rugova's party reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was seen as an attempt to bring unity to the  
often disparate Kosovo Albanian political parties, and also 
reflects the guerrillas' rising influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova, who until the talks had ignored the rebels, has for  
seven years headed a self-described ethnic Albanian government that 
is not recognized by Serb authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief Albanian delegate in France, Hashim Thaci, has already  
cautioned Kosovars not to ``expect much'' from the next round of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Russia, President Boris Yeltsin -- like U.S. and British  
officials a day earlier -- hailed the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that they have been able to reach a  
tentative political accord that would envisage autonomy for Kosovo 
while preserving Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity,'' spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin quoted Yeltsin as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Yeltsin said through his spokesman, ``It's important to  
observe a cease-fire and avoid any action that would undermine the 
fragile accord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has strongly opposed NATO's threat of airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising not to ``sugar coat'' what transpired in talks in  
Rambouillet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Congress 
today there was ``zero chance'' that a peace plan for Kosovo could 
succeed without U.S. participation in a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary obstacle'' remains Milosevic, she testified, but  
the hard-line leader ``no longer has a choice'' but to accept the 
deal -- or be subjected to NATO bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Albanians are worried that the coming weeks, especially as  
the weather warms, will bring more bloodshed in a conflict that has 
left 300,000 people homeless since Milosevic sent troops last 
February to crush a KLA rebellion.

man. Yesterday, the jury found John William King guilty of capital 
murder for tying James Byrd to a pickup truck and dragging him to 
his death on June 7. Jurors today start considering whether King

	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serbs agreed in principle yesterday  
to give limited self-rule to majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, 
but the two sides failed to conclude a deal for ending their 
yearlong conflict. More talks were scheduled for March as a new 
round of violence shook the province. The partial settlement puts 
on hold, at least temporarily, NATO's threats to bomb Serb targets 
if they don't withdraw troops from Kosovo and accept NATO 
peacekeepers.

reported. Four of the 10 who were swept away were pulled out of the 
snowslide -- shaken but alive -- by rescuers. Six remained missing, 
Austrian state radio said. Just hours earlier, Austrian soldiers

unidentified sources, said Dolan's group made the offer for 5 1/2 of 
Schott's 6 1/2 shares, or about one-third of the ballclub.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 144.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks beat a hasty retreat in the final hour of  
trading to close lower, after bond prices slid and pushed interest 
rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the closing bell on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 144.75 at 9,399.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow opened softer but quickly rallied in the morning,  
peaking at just over 9,600, or up 55 points, before trimming its 
gains in late morning and then staging an outright retreat in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although (stock) market internals don't look so bad, the  
weakness in bonds is a problem,'' said Scott Bleier, chief 
investment strategist at Prime Charter. ``There doesn't seem to be 
any great desire to one thing or another, except that bonds are 
lower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year bond was down more than a point, or $10  
for every $1,000 valuation. Its yield, which moves opposite the 
price, moved above the critical 5.5 percent to 5.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in interest rates was particularly injurious to  
technology and financial stocks, which had been providing some 
leadership to the upside in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 2 3/8 at 70 3/4, and  
American Express, down 3 15/16 at 107 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The late decline in technology stocks pushed broad indicators  
lower as well. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which had been in 
record high territory earlier in the session, was off 17.77 at 
1,253.41. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was higher 
most of the day but finally capitulated, too, ending 36.95 lower at 
2,339.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers late in the day on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume was moderate and well below 
Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds weakened after the Treasury sold a total of $15 billion in  
new, two-year notes at 5.009 percent, a six-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	And neither market was helped by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's testimony before a Congressional committee. Making his 
second appearance in two days on Capitol Hill, Greenspan reiterated 
signals that the Fed is more likely to raise interest rates over 
the near term than to shorten them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the Fed expects the U.S. economy to slow to a  
growth rate of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent this year, down 
from about 4 percent in 1998. But, he warned that the economy is 
``stretched'' after eight years of expansion and suggested the Fed 
may need to raise interest rates if the growth in the economy does 
not slow as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors would not welcome higher interest rates, which  
would raise corporate borrowing costs and could eat into earnings.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leader Warns Against Infighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican National Committee chairman  
Jim Nicholson says he'll ``blow the whistle'' on GOP presidential 
candidates who begin attacking each other and voters will punish 
those contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to GOP activists just a year before the first  
presidential primaries and caucuses, Nicholson said the party can't 
endure another bruising primary season if it hopes to recapture the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an adversary and it is not us, it is them,'' Nicholson  
said. ``It is the Democratic Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson said he would serve as the GOP's referee, crying foul  
when a Republican begins attacking another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I am pulling on the striped shirt and I will blow the  
whistle on any candidate or campaign that tries to tear down 
another Republican with personal attacks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site for his speech was chosen with care. Iowa's precinct  
caucuses traditionally are the opening round in the nominating 
season and the campaign in 1996 was brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes jumped in late and based his hopes on a  
television advertising campaign that blasted eventual nominee Bob 
Dole. Dole said that assault weakened him in the general election, 
and Nicholson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, we looked at '96 in taking the steps that we're  
taking,'' he said. ``I think Senator Dole was hurt by personal 
attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nicholson quickly added that his latest effort was aimed at  
the entire GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not aimed at anyone in particular,'' he said. ``It is  
aimed at seeing it doesn't happen again and we're trying to head it 
off at the pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While party leaders have little ability to enforce discipline,  
Nicholson said voters will enforce the new campaign standard.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Plans Head Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau will conduct a traditional  
head count for congressional reapportionment but plans to produce a 
second number using statistical sampling, the bureau announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the task of the Census Bureau to produce the best  
numbers possible, not to decide how they will be used,'' Director 
Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference. ``The more complete 
census counts will be made available in a form that allows them to 
be used, if it is so decided,'' for any other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	A census using sampling for some purposes and not others is  
expected to be considerably more expensive than the $4 billion 
already budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampling has been a point of severe dispute between Republicans  
in Congress and the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt laid out plans for the 2000 census, which is scheduled  
to begin April 1 next year. He said there is no longer time to 
debate how it will be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the lateness of the hour, we must acknowledge the hard  
reality that we no longer have the luxury of debates about 
alternative designs, or substitute procedures. No matter how 
well-intentioned, we cannot now take a chance on untested 
operations or late additions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could lead to conflict with Congress, where Rep. Dan  
Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House census subcommittee, backed 
by the GOP leadership, has introduced an $800 million package of 
measures aimed at increasing accuracy without using sampling. The 
bill would allow local officials to ask the Census Bureau to 
recheck its findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt's briefing also was to detail the results of three  
census dress rehearsals earlier this year. Sampling was used on 
some areas and not others, providing a comparison of accuracy in 
the count. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 census involves mailing forms to nearly 100 million  
households and sending thousands of workers to follow up the 
millions that don't reply. Planning has been hampered by the 
disputes over the method of counting and some sources say the 
planning effort is at a stage it should have been two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court last month rejected the administration's  
effort to employ statistical sampling for generating figures used 
for determining how many House members each state gets. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan that Prewitt was set to submit to his superiors at the  
Commerce Department would allow the bureau to generate an official 
number based on the sampling models after an actual count was 
conducted for the purposes of reapportionment, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sample-augmented numbers would be used for a variety of  
other purposes, including the distribution of more than $180 
billion in federal funds each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt also planned to announce plans for a national publicity  
campaign and a partnership with community-based organizations to 
reach out to people who ordinarily don't respond to census takers. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over the once-in-a-decade measurement triggered a  
bitter partisan fight in 1998 and the administration's latest 
sampling plan is likely to reignite it. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Republican congressional staffer, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, noted that the bureau had previously rejected the 
idea of developing two numbers as overly complicated and difficult 
to manage. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1990 census missed an estimated 4 million people, many  
of them minorities, the National Academy of Sciences endorsed 
statistical sampling for the next count. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans complained that reapportioning the 435 House  
seats based on sample-based numbers could work to the advantage of 
Democrats. They challenged the administration's earlier plan before 
the Supreme Court, arguing that it violated a constitutional 
requirement for ``actual enumeration'' of all Americans every 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In year-end budget talks last October, the two sides were so far  
apart on the census that they finally decided to approve money for 
the Commerce Department, which contains the Census Bureau and other 
agencies, only through June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The first sampling plan developed by the administration called  
for counting first 90 percent of the populace by traditional means, 
but accounting for the last hard-to-reach 10 percent by sampling.

<HEADLINE> Austria Avalanche Kills at Least 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Austrian soldiers took advantage of a  
break in heavy snowfall today to mount a rescue of avalanche 
victims from a stricken Alpine town, joining villagers who dug with 
their bare hands in a frantic effort to reach those buried below. 
</P>
<P>
	The confirmed death toll from Tuesday's avalanche at Galtuer  
stood at 10 early today, but was expected to rise, provincial 
governor Wendelin Weingartner told reporters. He said 31 people 
were still missing in the village in the Tyrol province, near the 
Swiss border. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers have recovered at least 17 injured, seven of whom  
required intensive care. They were being flown in by helicopter to 
the hospital in nearby Landeck, where rescue operations were 
headquartered 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything humanly possible to rescue people,''  
said Austrian army spokesman Maj. Thomas Schoenherr in Landeck. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that soon after daybreak, about a dozen helicopters  
ferried some 200 troops to the avalanche site and also carried some 
of the injured back to hospitals in Landeck, 25 miles away. The 
main road into Galtuer was blocked by an earlier avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Children, some of whom had been playing in the streets when the  
snow rumbled over them, were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters, tourists and residents joined in the search for  
survivors, some digging in the snow with their bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible day for Tyrol,'' Weingartner said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Schoenherr said that people caught in the open by the slide had  
little chance of surviving more than a few minutes but those 
trapped in their homes, where they had air to breathe, had a chance 
of surviving considerably longer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States, Germany and Switzerland had all  
offered to lend helicopters to the rescue efforts, and officials 
were evaluating how best to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galtuer avalanche was one of the worst to strike Central  
Europe this winter as the region continues to endure its heaviest 
snowfall in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of travelers were stranded in train stations,  
traffic jams and isolated resort towns across France, Italy 
Switzerland and Austria as the avalanches buried homes, roads and 
railways. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 people have died in avalanches in Europe this year.  
</P>
<P>
	In Austria's western Vorarlberg province, rescuers near  
Gargellen found a man and a woman Tuesday who were buried a day 
earlier when an avalanche swallowed a mountain restaurant, APA 
reported. The man was still alive, but bad weather prevented an 
emergency flight to a hospital, and he died later of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Where helicopters could fly, rescuers flew in food and tons of  
mail to entire valleys that had been cut off by heavy snow. Some 
20,000 tourists were stranded in Tyrol province, and thousands of 
others in Vorarlberg. 
</P>
<P>
	In northwestern Italy, a mass of snow and debris tore through  
the small village of Morgex on Tuesday, killing a 52-year-old woman 
in her home and injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the border in the Swiss state of Valais, avalanches  
thundered down repeatedly into a mountain valley Tuesday, propelled 
by fresh snow and winds gusting up to 95 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers in Evolene, Switzerland, found five more bodies Tuesday  
from avalanches on Sunday. Three people were still missing.

<HEADLINE> Padres Could Sell Out in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- Baseball officials expect a sellout for  
the first international opener in major league history, even though 
it will cost many Mexican fans more than two days' wages for the 
cheap seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons for having these games is to underscore the  
presence of baseball in these countries and the possibility in the 
future that major league baseball would come to a country like 
Mexico,'' Sandy Alderson, the new executive vice president of 
baseball operations in the commissioner's office, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Montreal Expos and Alderson's former team, the  
Oakland Athletics, unsure of their future, Alderson didn't sound as 
if another round of expansion is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure it's likely that there will be any expansion in  
the next four or five years, regardless of location,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14,000 tickets for the April 4 opener between the NL  
champion San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies go on sale in Mexico 
on Thursday. Another 12,000 tickets for the game at the 26,000-seat 
Estadio Monterrey are reserved for the two teams, sponsors, 
officials and dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The cheapest seats in the outfield will be on sale for 100  
pesos, nearly $10 at the current exchange rate and 2.5 times the 
minimum wage earned by a large percentage of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	More expensive tickets range from 150 pesos to 600 pesos --  
roughly $15 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball takes a back seat to soccer in most of Mexico, but its  
roots here go back for generations and Mexican sports commentators 
often noted last year that Mexico has more internationally 
successful baseball players than soccer players. 
</P>
<P>
	Monterrey is the heart of an urban area of about 3 million  
people at the edge of the eastern Sierra Madre mountain range and 
is one of Mexico's most dynamic business centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres and New York Mets played a three-game series at  
Estadio Monterrey in August 1996, the first regular-season games 
outside the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego sold 40,000 tickets in the Baja California city of  
Tijuana during the 1998 season and last year opened a retail store 
there, according to Mike Dee, the team's vice president of business 
operations. Dee also said that 20 percent of the team's fans are 
Hispanic and a ``significant portion'' come from Mexico. Of the 
team's nine probable opening-day starters, five will be of Mexican 
or Latin American descent, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not view Mexico as an extension of our market,'' he  
said. ``We view Mexico as our home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials are planning more promotions in Mexico and  
are studying a plan to allow All-Star balloting in the country.

<HEADLINE> Two-Year World Cup Plan Fades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter backed off his  
controversial plan for a World Cup tournament every two years and 
said today the international soccer schedule needed to be 
reorganized before the idea could become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of soccer's world governing body met with the head of  
European soccer, Lennart Johansson, who has opposed the plan 
because it threatened the prominence of European competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, the president of UEFA, said he was still doubtful  
about the idea although he hadn't ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``UEFA has not closed the door,'' he said. ``It still does not  
support the idea, but it has not closed the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, who had been pushing hard for a biennial World Cup,  
said adjusting the world schedule would take about 18 months and 
had to come first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to present the idea to the executive committee,''  
Blatter said after meeting with Johansson, who opposed him last 
year for the FIFA presidency. ``They have a right to know what went 
on here. But I'm not going to take it to a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the international schedule was now the top item.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not withdrawn the idea of having a World Cup every two  
years, we have just put it in the backyard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson said he and Blatter ``agreed we needed to talk about  
the calendar and to study it before addressing the idea of a World 
Cup every two years.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Saddam Won't Intimidate US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today accused Saddam Hussein  
of trying to score ``a symbolic victory'' by targeting U.S. 
warplanes over Iraq, but said America will not be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint news conference with President Jerry Rawlings of  
Ghana, Clinton also said the United States had not given up hope of 
eventually restoring United Nations inspections of Iraq's weapons 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, speaking hours after U.S. and British warplanes  
attacked targets on the outskirts of the Iraqi capital, said, 
``They're trying obviously for the symbolic victory of shooting one 
of these planes down and perhaps trying to intimidate us from 
enforcing the no-fly zone, which we're still bound to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``We have not given up on the prospect of restoring  
inspections'' in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his second meeting with reporters since the Senate  
acquitted him of perjury and obstruction of justice charges on Feb. 
12 in connection with his affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, events overseas dominated the questioning.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States has an interest in resolving the  
Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does the United States have an immediate selfish interest in  
what happens on some lonely road in Kosovo to some poor family 
driving some wagon with horses that are underfed because they 
haven't been able to get food? No. I would argue we have a 
humanitarian interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States does have a direct interest in whether there  
is instability in the Balkans,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 U.S. troops as part  
of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to Kosovo for at least 
three years if a peace plan were implemented. Peace talks in France 
ended this week without a solid agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings said assistance from the United Nations would be  
helpful in peacekeeping, and he would be willing to lend troops to 
such a force. But he said other countries may have to contribute as 
well, because African nations are struggling under the burden of 
responding to conflict in other parts of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our resources are stretched to the very limit,'' Rawlings  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Touching on domestic issues, Clinton said he has ``some ideas''  
about whether the independent counsel statute under which Kenneth 
Starr investigated him should expire, but said he will not make 
them public until others air their views. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be better for me at this time to say less so  
that others can say more,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said White House lawyers will testify before Congress  
about the independent counsel law next week, and he would make his 
feeling known at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which was inspired by the Watergate scandal, expires  
this summer and many legislators in both parties are anxious to see 
it expire or undergo a dramatic overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton refused to comment on allegations by a Little Rock,  
Ark., woman, Juanita Broaddrick, who says she was sexually 
assaulted by him in 1978. Clinton, who was attorney general at the 
time, said he stood by his the statement of his attorney, who has 
called the allegations ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he dismissed the claim by some Republican lawmakers that  
they can't trust him in the wake of the Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their feelings are not important here,'' he said. ``Just like  
my feelings are not important. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an oath to fulfill, and a responsibility to fulfill.  
We were hired to do the public's business,'' he said.

	DAKOTA CITY, Neb. (AP) -- IBP Inc., the world's largest meat  
processor, recalled 10,000 pounds of wholesale ground beef earlier 
this month after consumers reported finding what appeared to be 
round, pinhead-sized glass particles. 
</P>
<P>
	IBP said it believes the product appeared in fewer than 30  
stores, mostly in Indiana and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries or illnesses have been confirmed, IBP spokesman Gary  
Mickelson said Wednesday. He said the company was investigating 
what it characterized as a handful of calls from consumers with 
minor health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the meat was sold wholesale and repackaged, there is no  
brand name, product code or production lot number that people can 
check on meat in their refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it did not know how or where the ground beef  
may have been contaminated. IBP said that once it shipped the meat, 
it was ground again and repackaged by retailers before being sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The 75 percent-lean ground beef involved in the recall was  
produced at IBP's Finney County, Kan., plant during one hour of 
production Jan. 18, the company said. Three IBP customers in 
Indiana, Ohio and Florida received the meat but IBP does not have a 
list of retail outlets that those IBP customers supply. 
</P>
<P>
	IBP said it voluntarily recalled the beef Feb. 6, initiated its  
own investigation and contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it recovered about 43 percent of the recalled  
meat and that the rest had likely been used or destroyed by now 
because it carried a ``use by'' Feb. 5 date.

<HEADLINE> Spotlight Is Off D-Backs' Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Matt Williams isn't the focus of attention  
at spring training this year, and he loves it. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he was arguably the biggest name in the clubhouse of  
the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, and what followed was one of 
his toughest seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's quietly preparing for what he hopes will be a comeback  
year with fewer nagging injuries and lots more RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' Williams said. ``I may  
hit a whole bunch of homers this year. What I'm going to try to do 
is be as consistent as possible. Consistency is the key. Whether I 
hit five home runs or 40 home runs, my job is to drive in runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is no rah-rah guy, no big talker. Not rude but not  
outgoing, either. He's intense and extremely self-critical. So last 
year's statistics were frustrating -- a .267 batting average with 20 
home runs, his fewest since 1992, And worst of all, 71 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a difficult year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, he was as good as ever. He had 11 errors, none in  
the last 35 games, and finished fourth among NL third basemen with 
a .972 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	But both ankles and both hands were hurt at one point or  
another, either by foul balls or by pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly make no excuses,'' he said, ``but it's not fun  
going out there with both hands hurting and your feet hurting. It 
took me probably to mid-November or December to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hit into 19 double plays and struck out 102 times in 510  
at-bats. All the while, he felt the glare of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams, 33, has been around long enough to know that it's  
just one year. He has had at least 20 homers in each of the last 
nine seasons, something no other current player has accomplished. 
He's one homer short of the 300 mark for his career. And he's come 
back before. 
</P>
<P>
	``In '92 I had a down year,'' he said, ``I played everyday. I  
wasn't injured, but I had a down year, and I came back the next 
year and had a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics bear him out. In 1992, his sixth of 10 seasons  
with the San Francisco Giants, Williams hit .227 with 20 homers and 
66 RBIs. The next year, he hit .294 with 38 homers and 110 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	His huge year was the strike-shortened 1994 season, when he hit  
43 home runs in 112 games. People talked about him breaking Roger 
Maris' record of 61. He joked last season, as he watched Mark 
McGwire go through the intense media attention, that he'd probably 
have refused to talk to anyone as the pressure got higher. 
</P>
<P>
	During the offseason Williams worked out rigorously.  
</P>
<P>
	``Running, lifting, treadmill work, agility work, running the  
stairs in the stadium -- you name it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was married -- to actress Michelle Johnson -- in a lavish  
ceremony at his home in the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	As reporters and television cameras crowded around the lockers  
of others this spring, Williams happily stayed in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we're getting closer to creating a better and  
better atmosphere that doesn't put all the focus on one guy having 
to carry the weight,'' manager Buck Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was traded to Arizona from Cleveland, he signed a  
five-year, $45 contract extension that begins with this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm physically able to go out there and compete at a high  
level, then I'll continue to play,'' he said. ``When the day comes 
where I can't compete anymore physically, where I'm not able to get 
to that ground ball or I'm not able to hit the ball the way I want 
to, then I'll hang them up and have no regrets. Until that day 
comes, I'll go out and give them hell.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Hasek Will Sit It Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek has been so good for so long  
that the Buffalo Sabres sometimes take their superstar goaltender 
for granted. That is, until he gets hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get used to him making great saves,'' defenseman  
Darryl Shannon said. ``But that doesn't mean we don't skate as hard 
when he's in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He usually doesn't give up more than two goals,'' Sabres coach  
Lindy Ruff said. ``In the beginning of the season when we really 
didn't play well as a team he filled the holes in a couple of games 
where we gave up 20 to 30 scoring chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even machines break down when they run too hot for too long.  
When Hasek injured his groin in a 3-2 loss to Toronto last week it 
proved he was human. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always want to be on the ice, but I cannot be on the ice if  
I am not healthy or my groin is not good enough,'' Hasek said. ``I 
have to be careful. I hope I'll be back this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff said Hasek probably would practice Thursday and play  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he ever admits he needs a rest,'' Ruff said.  
``That's the kind of thing where I have to start stepping in and 
just give him a rest even when he doesn't want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is never. ``He likes to play, he likes to work,'' Ruff  
said. ``With today's schedule, it's the mental part of the game 
that wears a player down most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until sidelined by injury, Hasek had started all but three of  
the Sabres' 55 games and faced 1,553 shots, second most in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwayne Roloson had made only three starts when he got the call.  
He stopped 30 shots in a 4-2 victory over San Jose and made 34 
saves in a 4-4 tie with defending league champion Detroit on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who led the league in save percentage each of the past  
five seasons and won the Hart Trophy the past two seasons as the 
NHL's most valuable player, has raised a lofty standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best goalie in the world right now and I'll just  
learn whatever I can from him and hope that things work out,'' 
Roloson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roloson knows he's no Dominik Hasek. But at times this season,  
even Hasek hasn't been himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was starting to show signs of wear after playing his  
sharpest hockey at the beginning of the season. The NHL named him 
its player of the month for December, in which he had a 1.45 
goals-against average and four shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Jersey chased Hasek off the ice early in the second  
period of a 7-4 victory on Dec. 28. The Devils scored goals on 
their first three shots and four goals on six shots. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing an overtime game to Anaheim two nights later, Hasek  
gave up seven goals on 31 shots in a 7-2 loss to Anaheim on New 
Year's Day. Roloson got his first two starts soon after. 
</P>
<P>
	As Buffalo struggled earlier this month Hasek criticized the  
team for what he identified as a lack of effort. He didn't name any 
names, but his teammates got the point. 
</P>
<P>
	Media, players and fans braced for a Hasek meltdown, but the  
team turned things around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, he's had a better a season than last year,'' Ruff  
said. ``The first 30 games he was unbelievable. Any goaltender can 
have a couple games where you would like some goals back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others try to emulate Hasek's acrobatic flops but few have the  
quickness. Sabres goaltender Martin Biron, a 21-year-old who has 
shown promise playing in Rochester this season, believes it helps 
to pay attention to Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Dominik has been playing the last couple of years has  
been changing a lot of things for goalies,'' Biron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he lies on his back in the crease when there is a  
scramble, the way he throws his stick away and uses his blocker,'' 
said Biron, a first-round draft choice for the Sabres in 1995. 
``These are things that Steve Shields started doing when he was 
here a couple of years ago. Dwayne Roloson is starting to do them 
and now I'm starting to do them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if they could just find someone who could do them as well.

<HEADLINE> Justice Blackmun Has Hip Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Supreme Court Justice Harry A.  
Blackmun underwent hip replacement surgery Tuesday after falling 
and breaking his hip, a court spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun, 90, was resting comfortably after the surgery at  
Arlington Hospital in suburban Arlington, Va., said court 
spokeswoman Kathy Arberg. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Blackmun suffered a fracture to his left hip from a  
fall at his home on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After surgery yesterday he told everyone (on his court staff)  
to get back to work,'' Ms. Arberg said. ``He was conversational, 
obviously, and alert after surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Dottie, and three daughters were with him, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Blackmun was named to the court by President Nixon in 1970 and  
retired in 1994. He is best known as the author of the 1973 Roe vs. 
Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Hoffman Talks Contract With Padres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- San Diego Padres general manager Kevin  
Towers and closer Trevor Hoffman spent four hours discussing the 
player's pending free agent status at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was pretty productive,'' Towers said of the Tuesday  
night meeting, declining to give details. ``I felt pretty good when 
I left. Hopefully it was mutual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman left Wednesday's workout early to tend to his wife  
Tracy, who is expecting the couple's third child. Reached through a 
spokesman, he declined to comment his talk with Towers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres have offered Hoffman a $24 million, four-year  
extension, but he is believed to be seeking $30 million over four 
years with a no-trade clause. Talks between the two sides broke off 
in December, so the dinner represented the first discussions since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never at all looked at by going in and having dinner with  
him I was going to come out and have him signed,'' Towers said. 
``More than anything it was just to talk, just as friends, and find 
out what his thought process was. I think I left the dinner having 
a pretty good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towers said they didn't talk about salary. He didn't elaborate,  
except to say, ``Trevor likes San Diego. I'll let him talk for 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Towers also said left-handed reliever Randy Myers likely won't  
be at camp until Saturday. That will be nine days after the 
pitchers and catchers reported, and four days after the 
full-squad's reporting date. 
</P>
<P>
	Towers is frustrated that he hasn't heard from Myers. Towers  
left a telephone message with Myers about nine days ago telling him 
he'd really like him in camp by Feb. 23. The mandatory reporting 
date for is March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, who has a history of reporting late to camp, is  
reportedly spending the extra time working with his charitable 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may have a good excuse, but just to be late to be late, I  
don't think is right,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Continue Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) --Grain and soybean futures retreated again today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, weighed down by a pessimistic outlook 
for export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybeans led the declines, pressured by government  
forecasts this week that supplies will continue to grow while 
global economic troubles curb demand from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans have faced the heaviest pressure amid expectations of  
increased U.S. plantings this spring and large competing crops from 
Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for March delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to  
$2.49 a bushel; March corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.13 1/4 a bushel; March 
oats fell 1/2 cent to $1.01 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 6 cents to 
$4.68 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell 0.07 cent to 67.55 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle rose 0.13 cent to 74.10 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell 0.80 cent to 44.45 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 
1.45 cents to 51.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> $65M Offer To Buy Out Marge Schott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A group headed by the brother of Cablevision's  
chairman has offered to buy controlling interest in the Cincinnati 
Reds, the first step in a lengthy process that will end up with 
Marge Schott selling most of her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's limited partners have the right to match the offer by  
Larry Dolan's group and keep control of baseball's first 
professional franchise in local hands. The limited partners have 
indicated they are willing to match any offer. 
</P>
<P>
	No sale is expected for months because there are so many steps  
left in the process and details to work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process is just beginning,'' Dolan's son, Paul, said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Dolan, who is based in Cleveland, has been part of groups  
that attempted to buy other sports franchises, including the NFL 
expansion Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins and New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 68-year-old lawyer is the brother of Charles Dolan, chairman  
of Cablevision Systems Corp., a major cable television provider and 
the owner of Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks and New 
York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's offer, first reported in The Cincinnati Enquirer and  
later confirmed by a baseball official who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified, would give Schott $65 million for 5 1/2 of her 
6 1/2 shares in the team. By holding onto one share, Schott could 
still keep a ceremonial role with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, agreed last year to sell her control over the team  
rather than accept another suspension. The current ownership 
arrangement expires on Dec. 31, 2000, when the limited partners can 
vote her out. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed into a corner by major league baseball and the  
partnership's upcoming expiration, Schott has been listening to 
offers to sell. Paul Dolan, a lawyer in his father's firm, said 
that the Reds were an attractive franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Ohio, it's nearby to us, it's a storied franchise and  
it's baseball,'' Paul Dolan said in a telephone interview from his 
law office in Cleveland. ``For us, it's comfortable. It's not our 
hometown, but it kind of feels like it's a cousin, if you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan declined to say whether his group has contacted any of the  
team's limited partners. If the partners decide to match the offer, 
Dolan's group would not be interested in trying to obtain a limited 
role, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in being one of the limited partners,''  
Dolan said. ``This is something we'd want to own and control. 
Whether we do that with partners or without them is dependent upon 
this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's group has not yet signed a definitive contract, the  
baseball official said. Dolan's next step would be to meet with the 
limited partners, who control the other 8 1/2 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dolan's group signs a contract, the limited partners would  
have the right to match it. Dolan is not expected to sign a deal 
until he knows the limited partners' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dolan signed a deal and the limited partners didn't match, he  
could wind up controlling a partnership whose status is uncertain 
after December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott did not return telephone messages on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lauryn Hill Is Best New Artist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill won four Grammys for  
her solo debut, Madonna -- now that she's turned 40 -- won her first 
musical Grammys Wednesday and the ``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart 
Will Go On'' continued to sail on. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after winning an Academy Award for best song, ``My Heart  
Will Go On'' won three Grammys, including song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna, who opened the CBS telecast with a Japanese-themed  
performance of `Nothing Really Matters,'' won best pop album for 
her excursion into electronica, ``Ray of Light.'' She also won best 
dance recording and best short form music video. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such a surprise. I'm honored,'' said Madonna, whose  
famed blonde hair has been replaced by straight black tresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian  
Setzer Orchestra each were double winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill won best new artist, something of a misnomer since she won  
two past Grammys with the Fugees. She read a passage from the Bible 
and thanked her children for, among other things, ``not spilling 
anything on mommy's outfit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Hill, who led with 10 nominations in nine  
categories, also won best rhythm and blues album for ``The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' Her hit song, ``Doo Wop (That 
Thing)'' won best R&AMP;B song and best R&AMP;B vocal performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, whose music mixes rap and R&AMP;B and touches on family and  
political issues, tied Carole King for most Grammys ever by a 
female artist in one night. King won four in 1971 for ``Tapestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No hip-hop artist has won song, record or album of the year.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides song of the year -- a songwriting award -- ``My Heart Will  
Go On'' also won the female pop vocal for Celine Dion and as best 
song written for a motion picture or television. James Horner and 
Will Jennings picked up the writing trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner told the Shrine Auditorium and national television  
audiences he initially only considered the song as a movie theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spoke to a lot of people,'' Horner said backstage. ``It  
obviously was very romantic in a wistful, timeless way.'' He 
admitted he no longer listens to the song. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Award for best song was one of 11 Oscars for  
``Titanic.'' The soundtrack was the top-selling album of 1998, with 
more than 9 million units sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor-rapper Will Smith won best rap song for his good-natured  
``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.'' He paid tribute to God, ``the jiggiest 
wife in the world'' (actress Jada Pinkett Smith), and his son, 
about whom he received bad news in his first parent-teacher 
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rhyming skills are down,'' Smith said. ``I swear -- that's  
what the teacher told me. That's just pure parental neglect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another rap category, Jay-Z's ``Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life''  
won best album. The rapper had said he would skip the show because 
he doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap. The Beastie Boys won 
duo or group performance for ``Intergalactic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 12th Grammy victory of the 1990s, Eric Clapton won male  
pop vocal for ``My Father's Eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crow won best rock album for ``The Globe Sessions'' and paid  
tribute to A&AMP;M Records, just swallowed up in a corporate merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a really nice thing for me,'' she said, adding, ``I  
want Lauryn Hill to produce my next record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks' ``Wide Open Spaces'' was an upset winner for  
best country album over the better-known Garth Brooks and Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're freaking out,'' the tearful trio said in accepting the  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're Still the One'' won best country song for Twain and  
husband Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and female country vocal 
performance for Twain. Vince Gill won best male country vocal 
performance for ``If You Ever Have Forever in Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best female rock vocal performance went to Alanis Morissette for  
``Uninvited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Setzer Orchestra, riding the swing revival, captured two pop  
honors, performance by a duo or group and instrumental performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The male R&AMP;B vocal Grammy went to Wonder for ``St. Louis  
Blues.'' The tune also earned him and two colleagues the award for 
instrumental arrangement with vocals. The two Grammys brought 
Wonder's career total to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	That ties him with Pierre Boulez, who also won two Wednesday  
night -- orchestral performance and opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sir Georg Solti, Quincy Jones and Vladimir Horowitz have  
won more. 
</P>

	Brandy &AMP; Monica won the R&AMP;B duo or group performance trophy for  
``The Boy Is Mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Bacharach had his first win since 1986, giving him Grammys  
in three different decades. He and Elvis Costello won for pop 
collaboration with vocals on ``I Still Have That Other Girl.'' It 
was Costello's first Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Cash, Mel Torme, Smokey Robinson and the late Sam Cooke  
and Otis Redding each received lifetime achievement awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at the 41st annual 
Grammy Awards. Rosie O'Donnell served as master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The songwriting teams of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe,

<HEADLINE> Surgery Shown on Experimental Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a live demonstration of the promise of a  
superfast Internet, a physician in Washington collaborated 
Wednesday night over a special high-speed network with surgeons 
working on a patient at a hospital in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The remote ``operation'' took place over the $500 million  
Abilene Network, a new data pipeline that links more than three 
dozen research universities nationwide. It works at speeds 45,000 
times faster than the best telephone modems that people now use to 
surf the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2.4 gigabits a second, the computer connection is faster than  
all but a few experimental federal government networks. It was 
largely financed privately by corporations and is run by a 
nonprofit group based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Rogers, the director of the Abilene Network, said the  
advances in research from the network promise to revolutionize the 
Internet familiar to most computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Internet of today will be as different than TV is from  
books,'' Rogers said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Abilene Network will be used solely by academics and other  
professional researchers, with no way to let home users dial in. 
But its benefits are expected to trickle down to consumers in just 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inevitable that applications would migrate to the  
consumer Internet for the benefit of all users,'' said Stephen 
Wolff, executive director of Cisco Systems Inc.'s advanced Internet 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco supplied about $5 million worth of high-tech plumbing for  
the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration linked Dr. Jerry Johnson, at Washington's  
Union Station rail terminal, with a surgical team at Ohio State 
University's hospital, performing laparoscopic surgery by snaking a 
miniature video camera inside a volunteer patient suffering from a 
gastrointestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a doctor and researcher at Ohio State, talked with his  
colleagues using wireless microphones and a video camera, with the 
words and pictures transmitted across the high-speed Internet 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Remote surgery is not feasible with today's Internet, in part  
because of the potential for gridlock caused by the huge flow of 
other data -- everything from Web sites to office jokes circulated 
via e-mail to computer games played across the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid such Internet traffic jams, hospitals typically use  
expensive closed-circuit video systems sent over satellite links 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is named after the town in Kansas that was an  
important railhead in the nation's history.

<HEADLINE>  NASA May Repair Hubble Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mechanical problems that threaten to shut down  
the astronomical observations of the Hubble Space Telescope may 
prompt a repair mission six months earlier than planned to the $1.7 
billion spacecraft, NASA officials told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is ailing gyroscopes, said Daniel Goldin, the  
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
Gyroscopes are used for the stability and fine pointing the Hubble 
needs to gather light from stars billions of light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of all gyroscopes would mean the space telescope could  
not make astronomical observations, but it would not threaten the 
spacecraft, officials said. Instead, the failure of the gyros would 
cause the craft to go into an automatic ``safe mode'' until the 
repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble was launched in 1990 and immediately had problems.  
Astronomers discovered that the 2.4-meter mirror on the telescope 
had been ground to the wrong curvature and the instrument, in 
effect, was nearsighted. 
</P>
<P>
	But a new set of optics installed by astronauts in 1993  
corrected the problem. And since then, the Hubble has made 
photographs of tens of thousands of previously unseen galaxies, 
giving unprecedented views of the heavens. Some of the stellar 
targets are more than 13 billion light years away, near the 
theoretical edge of the universe. The Hubble was designed to remain 
operational until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubble needs three gyroscopes to work properly and it has  
lost two of its six. Another gyro ``is sick and may go down in 
three months,'' Goldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Hubble loses a fourth gyro, it will have to be shut down  
until a space shuttle crew goes up to the orbiting telescope and 
installs a new set of gyroscopes, he said. A decision about an 
emergency mission is expected no later than next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For practical planning, the spacecraft is already on the edge of  
losing gyroscope control because one of the remaining four control 
instruments ``is quite ill,'' said David S. Leckrone, senior 
project scientist for the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``If another gyro fails, we would not put the fourth gyro back  
into service,'' he said, meaning that the Hubble is only one 
failure away from being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is in wires that carry power to the rapidly spinning  
gyroscopes. The gyros can operate on either of the two wires, but 
when one wire breaks, it causes an increase in voltage carried by 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier gyroscope failures, engineers saw a sudden increase  
in voltage carried by one wire. Within weeks, that wire also 
failed. One wire has already failed in the ailing gyro, said 
Leckrone. 
</P>
<P>
	Should all of Hubble's gyroscopes shut down, he said, the  
spacecraft would switch automatically to a safe mode that keeps its 
solar power array pointed at the sun. As long as the craft is 
powered by the sun, engineers on the ground can control it. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA already had planned for a June 2000, Hubble servicing  
mission that would include replacing all of the gyroscopes, along 
with a computer and some other instruments. But Leckrone said he 
and others at the Goddard Spaceflight Center have proposed that an 
emergency mission be flown this October to change out the ailing 
gyros, and that the rest of the serving be done on a mission in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier servicing mission to change cameras and other  
equipment was flown in 1997, and a final servicing mission is 
planned for 2003.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Offerman Takes It in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Don't expect Jose Offerman to do what Mo  
Vaughn did for the Boston Red Sox. And don't expect the $26 million 
man to apologize for a contract criticized as too rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agency cost the team Vaughn, who hit 40 homers last season,  
and brought them Offerman, who has 22 since he arrived in the 
majors in 1990 with Los Angeles. While the Red Sox wouldn't give 
Vaughn the $80 million contract Anaheim did, they rewarded Offerman 
with a four-year deal averaging $6.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a .278 career hitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what people say,'' Offerman said Wednesday. ``I  
believe they paid me for a reason and thank God it happened with 
them because there was another team that was interested in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland appeared to be Boston's main competition for Offerman,  
although he said Baltimore and Seattle also were interested. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism of the contract ``really doesn't bother me,'' Red  
Sox general manager Dan Duquette said. ``We're paying him about 
what we pay (third baseman) John Valentin. That, to me, is like the 
going rate for qualified established major-league infielders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, though, and his connection with Vaughn could make  
Fenway Park fans impatient for Offerman to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to compare myself with him,'' Offerman said.  
``We are two different players, and the things he can do are hard 
for me to do. My job is to be on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did that well the past three years with Kansas City, hitting  
.303, .297 and a career-high .315. He led the majors with 13 
triples last season and was fifth in the American League with a 
.403 on-base percentage and 45 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to Kansas City after the 1995 season in a trade from Los  
Angeles. During his stay with the Dodgers, he led the majors in 
errors in three times, causing strained relations with manager 
Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
	His defense and hitting both improved in Kansas City, where he  
was the everyday second baseman the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference was that I was a lot more comfortable there,''  
Offerman said. ``It was hard for me to play (in Los Angeles). There 
was a lot of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second base is his favorite position, although he could see time  
as at first and at designated hitter with Boston. He took grounders 
at second with the other starting infielders Wednesday, although 
his main competitor for the starting job, Jeff Frye, has a strained 
rib area that limited his activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young in LA,'' said Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez,  
a fellow Dominican and Offerman's teammate on the Dodgers in 1993. 
``It was a rough field. It's not only Jose who had some problems in 
the past in Dodger Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez may have eased Offerman's transition to Fenway Park;  
more Dominican fans showed up when Martinez pitched. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there will be the focus on Vaughn's departure and  
Offerman's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to try to do the things he does because my job is  
a lot different than his,'' Offerman said. ``He's got a lot more 
power than me. My job is to be on base for the rest of the guys. 
The money is no reason for me to change.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Remain in Solitary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson was ordered Wednesday to remain  
in solitary confinement for 20 more days after throwing a 
television in a recreation room at the Montgomery County jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been in administrative segregation since last Friday  
and won't return to the regular jail population until mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also lost phone and visiting privileges and will not be  
allowed to participate in group activities at the facility. He will 
be in an isolated environment for 23 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson faced accusations of disorderly conduct, destroying  
property and assaulting a correctional officer who was allegedly 
struck with shards of plastic from the television. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has not had contact with the other inmates since Friday,  
when he was placed in solitary confinement after his alleged 
outburst. Before then, he had begun a one-year sentence in a cell 
among the jail's regular population of inmates who are awaiting 
trial or serving sentences of 18 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was sentenced Feb. 5 after pleading no contest to charges  
he assaulted two men following a minor traffic accident last August 
but has until March 7 to appeal the sentence. Tyson's lawyer Paul 
Kemp said he would decide on the appeal by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said Tyson's alleged outburst occurred after jail officials  
began withholding his daily dose of Zoloft. Tyson received no 
medication Thursday or Friday, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jail psychiatrist won't give medication to inmates unless  
they consult with him, said Kemp, who added that Tyson doesn't want 
to see the doctor because he has been under the care of a private 
psychiatrist. The judge recommended Tyson remain on the medication 
when he sentenced Tyson, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is a patient of Dr. Richard Goldberg, chairman of the  
psychiatry department at Georgetown University Medical Center, who 
saw him on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was 
released from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. 
Indiana officials are considering whether to revoke his probation 
based on his legal problems in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in 7 Church Burnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The curiosity of a campus police officer has  
led to the arrest of a man authorities say has confessed to burning 
as many as 50 churches in 11 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department announced Tuesday that Jay Ballinger, 36,  
has been arrested and charged with setting fire to seven churches 
in Indiana dating to 1994. He was arrested earlier this month after 
being questioned at a hospital where he was being treated for 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities also said they were looking into whether  
Ballinger and two co-defendants have any connection with the 
burnings of predominantly black churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aggressively pursuing leads in Tennessee and Alabama  
regarding these Indiana-based defendants,'' said Jim Cavanaugh, 
director of Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' 
Tennessee-Alabama division. ``We think they have traveled 
extensively down South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Ballinger confessed to setting up to 50 church  
fires between 1994 and 1998 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, 
Georgia, Indiana, Ohio and Alabama. Authorities refused to identify 
the four other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Also charged are Angela Wood, 24, of Athens, Ga., identified in  
court documents as Ballinger's girlfriend, and Donald Puckett, 37, 
of Lebanon, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests were made with the help of the National Church Arson  
Task Force, established in 1996 after a series of fires at black 
churches in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood has admitted to serving as a lookout during some of the  
fires, according to court documents, and both Wood and Puckett are 
believed to have helped Ballinger burn down the Concord Church of 
Christ in Lebanon in 1994 after satanic symbols were scrawled on 
the porch. 
</P>
<P>
	All three suspects are white and most of the church burnings in  
Indiana have involved rural churches with predominately white 
congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Stewart, U.S. Attorney for southern Indiana, would not  
comment on a possible motive. The ATF said searches of Ballinger's 
home turned up a gasoline container and satanic books and writings. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests came after Ball State University Sgt. Steve Hiatt  
overheard an emergency radio call for help at a Muncie address on 
Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiatt, an 18-year campus officer, recognized the Ballinger name  
from a previous church arson investigation. He went to a hospital 
and interviewed Ballinger's father, who said his son was badly 
burned when he came home early Feb. 7. An Ohio church had been 
burned the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer notified federal investigators, who in turn listened  
to Ballinger's alleged confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger was being held in federal custody while undergoing  
skin grafts for burns at Wishard Memorial Hospital. Wood was in 
federal custody in Georgia and Puckett was being held in 
Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Jay-Z Set to Start National Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a hurricane of noise and activity at the  
Manhattan offices of Roc-A-Fella Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay-Z, co-founder and lead artist of the label, is starting a  
national tour in just a few days. Also on the tour: fellow hip-hop 
big dogs DMX, Method Man, Redman and DJ Clue. 
</P>
<P>
	There are photos to take, and last-minute details to work out,  
and everyone seems to be talking and rushing every which way -- even 
though the official workday ended hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But every hurricane has an eye, a center of complete calm.  
</P>
<P>
	The eye of Roc-A-Fella's storm is casually flipping through the  
pages of a magazine. Jay-Z's tall, lanky frame is stretched out on 
a couch in an office, with his feet propped up on a desk. 
</P>
<P>
	His face doesn't give away much. If he is nervous about the tour  
-- a tour that many say will make hip-hop history -- he doesn't show 
it. When it comes to hip-hop, Jay-Z knows exactly how good he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know people think I'm very arrogant,'' he said. ``I think  
I'm very confident with my skill level. Overall, I'm not a cocky 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also understands the power of hip-hop.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sets trends, tells you what's cool, sheds light on things  
that are going on in ghettos across the United States,'' he said. 
``It marks the time of your life. If you hear a hip-hop song, you 
know what you were doing at that time. It's a musical diary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His records are anthems of street life, of the struggles that  
come from trying to survive in the environment where he grew up. 
His concern is for the people who still live in that environment, 
not for gaining accolades and awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really try to let a lot of people know that I understand  
their struggle, and the things that they're going through,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, is a native of New York. He grew up in  
the housing projects in Brooklyn. As a teen and young man, he 
hustled drugs for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he lives in New Jersey, and his business is hip-hop. But  
Jay-Z, who won't disclose his age, hasn't forgotten his past. On 
the contrary, where he came from influences everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
	His latest release, ``In My Lifetime, Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life,''  
entered the charts at No. 1 and stayed at the top for five weeks. 
Previous releases have gone gold and platinum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hard Knock Life tour opens Saturday (Feb. 27) in Charlotte,  
N.C., and will continue until mid-April. The way Jay-Z figures it, 
the fans have it made. ``Redman and Method Man are incredible 
performers, and I think me and DMX, we have some of the hottest 
records out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jay-Z portrayed himself in the semi-autobiographical  
short film, ``Streets Is Watching.'' The film's soundtrack included 
the hit single, ``It's Alright,'' and introduced some of 
Roc-A-Fella's brightest new rising stars -- Memphis Bleek, Rell, 
Diamonds in the Rough and the Ranjahz. 
</P>
<P>
	Can he see a day when he won't be performing? Sure, ``that's  
cool with me,'' he said. He wants to make Roc-A-Fella a strong 
company. And if that means giving up performing to concentrate on 
business, he'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the end, this isn't the apex. I haven't arrived. I  
have other things to do. I have other goals to achieve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jay-Z was nominated in all three rap categories at the  
Grammys this year, ``I don't really think about that because the 
Grammys don't really respect rap music in the way I think they 
should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said DMX -- with two No. 1 albums in one year -- didn't receive  
a single nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you do that?'' he asked.

<HEADLINE> Campos' Dad Discusses Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The father of Mexican soccer star Jorge  
Campos said Wednesday that his captors told him they had been 
mistaken to take him hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the people, all of Acapulco, all of Guerrero (state)  
love you,'' Alvaro Campos said his kidnappers told him during his 
six days in captivity, the Televisa network reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after being freed, Campos spoke briefly from a  
second-story window to reporters gathered on the street outside his 
home in Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	The silver-haired Campos said he was in good health, and he even  
joked about his ordeal. ``They fed me better than my wife,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campos, 66, was released Tuesday morning along a highway outside  
of Acapulco, the resort city in the western state of Guerrero. He 
did not say whether a ransom had been paid, and his son has told 
reporters he wasn't aware of any payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed men seized the elder Campos on Feb. 17 at a sports field  
named for his son near Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidnapping has become a growing criminal industry in Mexico, but  
the crime stunned many because of the great affection for Jorge 
Campos, a star in the U.S. and Mexican soccer leagues who played in 
the 1994 and 1998 World Cups.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Enquirer, on income tax cuts:  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, has proposed cutting income tax rates  
by 10 percent, returning about $375 billion to taxpayers over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	This secular tithe should be a no-brainer. The feds are living  
high on the surplus hog, thanks to average Americans' hard work and 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	But as usual, the White House is twisting the argument.  
Spokesmen from President Clinton on down claim it would be 
irresponsible to ``spend'' -- an Orwellian choice of words -- any 
surplus on tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House wants to have it both ways. It counts on decades  
of surpluses and good economic news to project its Social Security 
fix. But the minute tax cuts are proposed, we hear doom and gloom 
and class-warfare slogans about ``tax breaks for the rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History has shown that the best way to encourage growth and  
prosperity is to cut taxes to a reasonable level that doesn't drain 
the economy. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 10  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on Mexico and drugs:  
</P>
<P>
	What to do when a nation's drug trafficking and corruption are  
growing increasingly worse? Why, you reward them, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	That's essentially what President Clinton is proposing after his  
summit with President Zedillo of Mexico. Clinton praised Mexico's 
effort to ``root out this scourge.'' He is expected to ask Congress 
to re-certify Mexico's anti-drug compliance, which would avoid 
trade and economic sanctions. Mexico, the president says, is 
``fully cooperating'' on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	True, Mexico has announced ``a total war against drug  
trafficking.'' Government officials vowed to spend close to $500 
million over the next three years on better radar, ships and planes 
to patrol its drug corridors. But this new strategy was 
conveniently announced just 10 days before Clinton's visit to 
Mexico. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 21  
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on possible attack in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Air Force stealth fighters from Holloman departing for the  
potential war zone bring the increasing tensions over Kosovo in 
Yugoslavia home to New Mexico. But even without the prospect of 
pilots from New Mexico going into action, the escalating rhetoric 
over NATO response to Serb intransigence on a settlement of ethnic 
conflict in the Yugoslavian province should be more carefully 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., warned of the possibility of U.S.  
casualties if American ground forces were committed to a 
peacekeeping force, as proposed by President Clinton. Domenici said 
he had no objections to NATO air strikes to persuade Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to see the error of his ways -- but air 
strikes alone will never decide the issue. One has only to consider 
the intransigence of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to acknowledge 
that American air power is a hollow instrument of coercion when 
applied alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy of atrocities against the Albanian ethnic majority  
in Kosovo cry out for solution, but a reflexive military response 
with no long-term plan could multiply the tragedy without solving 
the problem. NATO and the United States should carefully plan a 
complete operation in a form that has some reasonable possibility 
of success before committing forces to action.

<P>
	Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune, on Y2K readiness:  
</P>
<P>
	Warnings that fear of the year 2000 computer glitch might cause  
more problems than the ``millennium bug'' itself may not surprise 
many retirees. Having survived the Great Depression, several wars 
and the generational revolution of the '60s, they aren't likely to 
panic over a few zeros. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In some systems, when the computer's internal clock rolls over  
to 00 on Jan. 1, the computer won't know it means the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors are likely to approach the so-called ``Y2K'' glitch as  
if it were a hurricane, taking many of the same precautions they 
would for such a storm -- putting away some cash, topping off the 
gas tank in the car and storing a few days' supply of food and 
other staples. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Computer systems analysts and project managers remain divided in  
their projections of the impacts of the Y2K problem. But there's a 
strong consensus on what not to do -- panic. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Some good advice ... transcends not only seasons but the passage  
of time and the acceleration of the computer age. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on Ken Starr:  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial is over, but Independent Counsel Ken  
Starr's costly and mostly fruitless probe into William Jefferson 
Clinton's life continues. 
</P>
<P>
	How much money must be spent and how many lives ruined before  
Starr's lust for Republican revenge is satisfied? 
</P>
<P>
	Enough is enough. Call off your dogs, sir.  
</P>
<P>
	Starr's original intentions might have been good. Somewhere  
along the way, however, Starr's quest for the truth lost any 
resemblance to business and became strictly personal. 
</P>
<P>
	He's obsessed with bringing Clinton down. The Senate has  
acquitted the president, but now Starr is talking about indicting 
the president himself. Some insiders say Starr has already made up 
his mind to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's case doesn't hold water. The impeachment process proved  
that. He cannot be allowed to waste more tax dollars on this witch 
hunt. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had his chance and failed. Rather than being a sore loser,  
the independent counsel should take his lumps and get over it. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Antelope Valley Press, Palmdale, Calif., on Elizabeth Dole:  
</P>
<P>
	Dole for President? Again? ... No, not that Dole. That was Bob  
Dole. He lost in a run for president a couple of years ago, but he 
may make another bid for the White House -- as the nation's first 
first gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a Harvard-educated lawyer who's worked for  
presidents since Lyndon Johnson in the mid-60s, is showing all the 
signs of running for president in 2000. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, 62, is smart, smooth, quick on her feet, and she  
knows the issues. ... It's way too early for endorsements, but we 
welcome Elizabeth Dole to the table. It's about time a woman had a 
legitimate shot at the highest office in the land. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole knows how to go about things. Take education. The  
Republicans get into trouble when they bash education and allow the 
Democrats to paint them as ``anti-child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than ranting and raving about what's wrong, there's a  
better way to go about it, and Dole gets it. Speaking before the 
American Council on Education ... she laid out an education 
platform centered on teacher quality. 
</P>
<P>
	She advocated school choice and accountability, cornerstones of  
the GOP vision for education. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If Elizabeth Dole can use these same methods -- solid principles,  
no alienation -- in all other planks of her platform, she could be a 
formidable candidate indeed. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 18  
</P>
<P>
	The Morning News, Florence, S.C., on the Buckle Up, America  
campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	Probably no one is surprised that President Clinton's boundless  
compassion extends to our automobiles. His Buckle Up, America, seat 
belt initiative calls for 85 percent of drivers to be buckled in by 
2000, 90 percent by 2005. After being stuck at 60 percent, seat 
belt usage climbed to 65 percent last Memorial Day and 70 percent 
last Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, it was not because motorists were getting  
smarter; it was because of stepped-up police enforcement under 
primary and secondary seat belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Under widespread secondary laws, police can ticket a driver for  
not wearing a seat belt only after pulling the driver over for 
another offense like speeding. Under primary laws, a driver can be 
pulled over and ticketed solely for not wearing a seat belt. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Safety experts believe all the Americans who will voluntarily  
use seat belts are now doing so. If compassion and common sense 
won't get us to that 90 percent mark, maybe traffic court will.

</P>
<P>
	The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, La., on curbing alien species:  
</P>
<P>
	Science-fiction fans perked up earlier this month when President  
Clinton signed an executive order that creates an interagency 
Invasive Species Council -- and proposes additional federal spending 
to fight alien entities. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was issued the same week that the Fox network was  
hyping a ``X-Files'' episode that promised to detail an alien 
race's plans to take over the earth. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The ``aliens'' at issue here are terrestrial ones -- plants,  
insects and other animals that escape from their original habitats 
and begin multiplying somewhere else. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials are discussing a variety of ways of  
controlling the spread of unwelcome species. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is to give agricultural inspectors more power to  
stop the importation of certain plants and animals. Another is to 
require ships to discharge ballast water before they enter American 
harbors. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately some officials are rather soft on the  
alien-invader issue. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt thinks 
America can only meet ``modest goals of containment.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	Whether they come from across the ocean or across the galaxy,  
you have to fight them tooth and nail.

<P>
	La Repubblica, Rome, on Kosovo talks:  
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo talks in Rambouillet must not be regarded as a  
failure. Talks are not over, and will resume in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rambouillet the Contact Group has obtained a result which  
could be hardly predicted at the beginning of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is an 80-page document which describes in detail  
what sort of autonomy a sovereign State (Yugoslavia) must concede 
to one of its provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither party has signed the agreement. Kosovars want a full  
independence, Serbs oppose the presence of a military force on 
their territory. They both oppose the creation of a police force to 
lead the country's reconciliation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	These are main points to disagree on, and it is still very  
possible that both parties decide to pull back, instead of moving 
forward on the peace path. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace is a long and exhausting process, which disregards all  
predictions. What's important is that, in the end, Europe and the 
United States force Serbs and Kosovars to at least tolerate each 
other without shooting at one another. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Berliner Morgenpost, on Kurdish protests in Germany:  
</P>
<P>
	One can only hope that the government finally stops having fun  
in Bonn and starts to work. If the arbitrariness of their past 
decisions was worrisome, their relaxed approach to internal 
security should set off alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	That Bonn knew nothing about Ocalan's whereabouts for days is  
bad enough. What's worse is that when he was captured late at 
night, Bonn's civil servants did not dare to wake members of 
Germany's domestic security forces. Anyone who has even a remote 
understanding of the Ocalan/PKK affair would know what havoc 
Ocalan's capture would unleash in Germany, home to 10,000 PKK 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	This government has to realize that governance is hard work and  
that its citizens' safety comes first. Why do we have a secret 
service that knows nothing about Ocalan, or an internal security 
system that knows nothing about the PKK in Germany? 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians are allowed to sleep, but only after they have done  
some work. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 23  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on India-Pakistan talks:  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the two-day visit by the Indian Prime Minister to  
Pakistan, the leaders of the world's newest nuclear powers 
committed themselves to extending their moratoriums on nuclear 
testing, notifying each other about ballistic missile tests and 
warning each other of accidental incidents that could lead to war. 
</P>
<P>
	These are the minimum steps necessary for coexistence. They do  
not chart a path for improved relations, promise an end to 50 years 
of mutual hatred or outline how they will tackle the underlying 
cause of tension, the unresolved issue of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, this first summit in either country for a decade  
does, as the Indian press has enthusiastically remarked, break the 
ice. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 23  
</P>
<P>
	Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on visit of Indian prime minister to  
Pakistan: 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is the first Indian  
prime minister to visit Pakistan in a decade, and under most 
circumstances, any improvement in relations between these two 
countries, which have been strained by the Kashmir problem, ought 
to be welcomed. But both countries could have built up their mutual 
trust and improved their ties without developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, high-ranking officials from both countries have  
talked about the need to turn the `balance of terror into something 
more stable' and have made other statements praising this nuclear 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	How brazen of them to attribute their improved relations to the  
balance of terror! They are simply encouraging other nations in the 
Middle East and Asia that can't wait to get their hands on nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	It is clear that the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  
framework is a far cry from the ideal of total abolition of nuclear 
weapons. Moreover, both the United States and China, which have 
been hounding India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty, have not ratified the treaty, a fact that India and 
Pakistan have pointed to when trying to justify their own nuclear 
tests. 

</P>
<P>
	Feb. 23  
</P>
<P>
	Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, on Nigeria:  
</P>
<P>
	When Abdulsalam Abubakar took over power in Nigeria in June of  
last year, he promised to lead the country to democracy. Free 
elections would take place, a peaceful transition of power would be 
ensured, the 15-year military leadership would be ended. 
</P>
<P>
	There are increasing indications that Abubakar meant what he  
said. Significant skepticism is still justified, the pitfalls are 
still many. Nigeria is a country with great intrinsic tension, the 
economy has been driven to the bottom, society is shot through with 
corruption and Nigerians have heard promises of democracy before. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the steps forward should be noted. Nigeria has  
up to now gone through with elections to local and regional 
assemblies, and on the weekend a parliamentary election was held. 
</P>
<P>
	There are reports of stolen ballot boxes and votebuying, but  
taken as a whole it seems the election went calmly and peacefully. 
... And the successes are a hint of what can be expected when 
Nigeria takes its final step in the transition to civilian rule.

<P>
	Feb. 24  
</P>
<P>
	Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on possible deportation of  
Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet: 
</P>
<P>
	To mark World Peace Day on Jan. 1 this year, Pope John Paul II  
issued a statement in defense of human rights. ... These words 
appear to make inexplicable the news that the Vatican wrote to the 
British Foreign Office late last year, urging it to block former 
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet's extradition to Spain to 
stand trial on human rights abuses. Instead, the Vatican argued, he 
should simply be allowed to go home. ... 
</P>
<P>
	These connections expose a questionable side of the Chilean  
church's role during the dictatorship. But there was another side, 
too. The church was the only significant institution allowed to 
function outside the military's control after 1973. It used its 
independence to defend the persecuted and speak out on their 
behalf. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean church, in other words, was as divided as Chilean  
society. Evidently, the Vatican feels that both church and society 
are still divided in Chile and that to put Pinochet on trial risks 
tearing the country apart again. Maybe so. But many Chileans are 
now among those who believe greater harm would be done if Pinochet 
is allowed to go free. On Jan. 1, the Pope appeared to have joined 
them.

<HEADLINE> NYC May Ease Demonstration Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani agreed to a limited  
reopening of the City Hall steps and the surrounding plaza to 
demonstrations and news conferences -- bringing to an end an 
administration policy that all but cut off public access to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter the city's top lawyer sent to U.S. District Judge  
Harold Baer Jr. on Wednesday, the administration proposed allowing 
up to 50 protesters at a time to gather in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar number could speak or protest on the steps if they  
were accompanied by a member of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Baer had ordered the city to come up with reasonable rules of  
access after several groups sued, saying the ban was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear if the judge would accept the  
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't go far enough. ... There should be no restriction  
of up to 50 people,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the 
New York Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in the 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, following the bombing of two U.S. embassies in  
Africa, the city tightened security at City Hall and ordered the 
steps and surrounding area off limits, except for employees and 
people on city business. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to complaints that Giuliani was stifling dissent and  
stomping First Amendment rights -- charges he denies.

<HEADLINE>  Slumping Lakers Fire Del Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. AP) -- In with the Worm, and out with the  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The slumping Los Angeles Lakers, considered one of the teams to  
beat in the NBA this season, fired coach Del Harris on Wednesday on 
the heels of three road losses in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced while Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading  
rebounder the last seven seasons, was participating in his first 
practice session with the team after signing a contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew -- will 
succeed Harris for at least the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka will handle the head  
coaching duties Thursday night against the winless Los Angeles 
Clippers in Anaheim before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, 
both former Lakers players. 
</P>
<P>
	West didn't say when a final decision would be made, and added  
he had not spoken to former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson or 
anyone else because things happened so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	West also pointed out the Lakers usually hire coaches from  
within, and Harris said he hoped Rambis or Drew would get the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel the last two games we've played have not been  
acceptable,'' West said, referring to a 117-113 overtime loss in 
Denver on Monday night and a 93-83 loss at Vancouver on Tuesday 
night. ``I just felt like there was a deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's victory was only its second in 10 games this season,  
and the Grizzlies had never beaten Los Angeles in 12 previous 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to (owner) Jerry Buss this morning and we just felt  
like the time was right now,'' West said. ``Right now, we look like 
we're floundering. That's not what the fans pay to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses left the young, talented Lakers at 6-6 with 38 games  
remaining in the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Particularly for me, the thing that makes it so awkward is  
that Del has been a friend for many years,'' West said. ``The 
direction of a team is very important. We do feel like we have the 
talent here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season. He guided the Lakers to a  
224-116 record and improved their regular-season record in four 
consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only eight other coaches 
in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like a loser today,'' Harris said. ``There will  
be other doors that will open for me. There always have been when 
other doors have closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping today to tell my team that everybody's laughing  
at us today, but we're going to have the last laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has been under criticism from many directions the last  
few years despite his team's improvement every year. Two years ago, 
the Lakers lost to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference 
semifinals and last spring were swept by the Jazz in the conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that star Shaquille O'Neal missed 22 games last  
season, the Lakers had a 61-21 regular-season record -- one of the 
best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will mature,'' Harris said. ``It's already an  
outstanding team. Forget 6-6. This team is better than 6-6. I don't 
have any excuses to make. This team could go on a 10-game winning 
streak whether I was here or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a reasonable decision,'' Harris added of being  
fired although he admitted he was disappointed he couldn't at least 
finish the season. ``I enjoyed being with this bunch. Whoever takes 
my place will not have failed if they don't win it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' contract runs out after this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of the team that won almost three-quarters of its games and  
reached the conference finals is back this year, but the Lakers 
have been on-again, off-again since the start of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they are 0-3 in nationally televised Sunday  
games, losing at home to Utah and Indiana and last Sunday at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has 556 career victories to rank among the top 20 of NBA  
coaches. He previously coached the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he was ``very shocked'' to hear of the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfortunate that a good guy like Del is blamed  
for our lack of cohesion, our lack of effort, our lack of energy,'' 
O'Neal said. ``However, one reason I came here is because of my 
faith in upper management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss Del, personally. The only thing I can do is  
wish him well. I'll always be a big fan of his because he taught me 
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said he was looking forward to coaching Rodman, and the  
eccentric forward said the now-former Lakers coach was put in a 
``no-win situation'' because the team is expected to go to the NBA 
finals every year.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Brings Out Fans, Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Mark McGwire was back behind the  
microphones Wednesday, laughing off predictions of 80 home runs and 
defending his use of muscle pills. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like he never left.  
</P>
<P>
	As about 100 reporters watched and three sports networks  
broadcast the spring training news conference live, McGwire said he 
was willing to discuss his record 70 home runs only until the new 
season starts in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mentally prepared to talk about last year up until the  
last day of spring training,'' McGwire said. ``Once the season 
starts, talking about 70 is gone. I think it's foolish to think I'm 
going to carry this over and talk about last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he would continue using androstenedione, the  
controversial muscle-building supplement that is prohibited by the 
NFL, NCAA and International Olympic Committee. At a drug conference 
last month, IOC vice president Dick Pound said baseball had allowed 
McGwire to become a ``souped-up hero'' by not banning andro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league baseball is not the IOC,'' McGwire said. ``And it  
has absolutely nothing to do with me hitting a baseball. I don't 
endorse the produce. I never did. Someone stuck a nose in my 
locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At spring training last year, only about 20 reporters showed up  
for the first full-squad workout. But that was before McGwire beat 
Roger Maris' single-season record by nine home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, fans crowded against the fence to watch McGwire  
and his teammates go through their first full-squad workout, a 
mostly humdrum routine. They even kept track of the 12 home runs he 
it in batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the turnout from the fans,'' McGwire said.  
``That was amazing. Then all of you guys. I've never been in a 
first day of spring training like this ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He talked almost disbelievingly about all the attention he  
received in the offseason, being interrupted in restaurants by fans 
who told him how much his accomplishment meant to them -- where they 
were when it happened and how some had named their children after 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never had so many people join me for dinner,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest revelation during the hour-long news conference was  
that the most pressure he felt last season came after he topped 
Maris and had to fend off Sammy Sosa. McGwire had insisted that he 
didn't care who ended up with more homers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sammy Sosa had a pretty damn good year and he was right there  
with me,'' McGwire said. ``When I broke that record, I knew there 
was a lot of time left in the season, and I knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``All across America, the most-asked question was, `Did he hit  
one?' That's sort of tough when you're playing a team sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two major milestones are up ahead for McGwire. He needs 43  
homers to become the 16th player to reach 500, and can become the 
first to hit 50 or more in four consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Can McGwire top 70?  
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Tony La Russa predicted 75 for McGwire in January and  
new teammate Carlos Baerga forecasts 80. 
</P>
<P>
	That brought another laugh from McGwire.  
</P>
<P>
	``Geez, I'd definitely retire if I did that,'' he said.  
``There's no more reason to play after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McGwire said he won't be disappointed if he falls far short  
of 70. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure that no matter what I do this year, if I don't hit  
70, someone will say I had an off year,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he'd like to play at least five more years, but  
that he would ``walk away'' from baseball if there was another work 
stoppage. The current labor agreement is likely to expire after the 
2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also criticized a story last week that exaggerated his  
security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I do not have bodyguards,'' he said. ``I don't need any  
bodyguards. I don't want any.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Remain in Solitary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson will spend another 20 days in  
solitary confinement for throwing a TV set in a jailhouse 
recreation room. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-member disciplinary panel on Wednesday ordered Tyson to  
remain isolated from other prisoners until March 16. He has been in 
solitary confinement since his outburst Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has lost phone and visiting privileges and won't be  
allowed to participate in group activities at the Montgomery County 
jail. He will be in an isolated environment for 23 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, accompanied by a senior jail staffer, appeared before the  
panel after officials accused him of disorderly conduct, destroying 
property and assaulting a correctional officer who was allegedly 
struck with shards of plastic from the shattered TV set. 
</P>
<P>
	He was not represented by an attorney because lawyers are not  
allowed at the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of those hearings, Mr. Tyson was given ... 25 days  
full disciplinary restriction, effective Feb. 19,'' said Eric 
Seleznow, spokesman for the Montgomery County Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his outburst, Tyson had been serving a one-year sentence  
in a cell among the jail's regular population of inmates who are 
awaiting trial or serving sentences of 18 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced Feb. 5 after pleading no contest to charges he  
assaulted two men following a minor traffic accident in August. He 
has until March 7 to appeal the sentence, and Tyson's lawyer, Paul 
Kemp, said he would decide on the appeal by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the hearing, an emotionally upset  
Monica Tyson urged a review of her husband's punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that two days before the outburst, jail officials  
reduced and then eliminated the dosage of Zoloft prescribed by his 
therapist, Dr. Richard Goldberg, to control the boxer's depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Goldberg spoke to the therapist at the detention center  
and informed him that it would be medically inadvisable to 
discontinue the medication. However, the decision was 
implemented,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The corrections department said Tyson was offered his medication  
``throughout his entire stay'' at the jail, although the rules 
require inmates to see staff doctors to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemp said the boxer did not want to see the jail's therapist  
because he already was under Goldberg's care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were upset that the disciplinary review board, with the  
misunderstanding about the medication, chose to make administrative 
recommendations for some penalties for segregation for this 
incident concerning the damaging of the television set,'' Kemp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson also is on probation in Indiana for raping a beauty  
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. He was 
released from prison in March 1995 after serving three years. 
Indiana officials are considering whether to revoke his probation 
based on his legal problems in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, Tyson's probation officer, George Walker, said  
authorities there still are awaiting to hear whether the boxer will 
appeal his sentence in Maryland before taking any action. ``We're 
still waiting,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Ron Howard  
</P>
<P>
	 *Image:* If Quentin Tarantino is the Mr. Cool of American  
cinema, then Ron Howard is its King of Corn: the sweet, sincere 
square whose films have made his name synonymous with 
sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Howard was born in Duncan, Okla., on March 1,  
1954. He grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of 
Southern California.

18 months old. When he was 6, Howard got the role of Opie Taylor on 
television's ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' He graduated to Richie 
Cunningham of ``Happy Days,'' the teen-age geek with the goofy 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
	He also appeared as the wholesome teen-ager of the classic  
George Lucas film, ``American Graffiti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Directing:* Howard directed his first film, ``Grand Theft  
Auto,'' in 1977. The film, shot in 20 days, was a typical car-crash 
action movie. But it grossed $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard's list of hits includes ``Splash,'' ``Cocoon,''  
``Parenthood,'' ``Backdraft,'' ``Far and Away,'' ``The Paper,''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Brings Out Fans, Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- It was just like last year for Mark  
McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run king chuckled and shook his head in wonder when he  
sat down today in front of a microphone. Fans had crowded against 
fences to watch him go through the Cardinals' first full-squad 
workout of the spring, and about 100 reporters came to his first 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe the turnout from the fans,'' McGwire said.  
``That was amazing. Then all of you guys. I've never been in a 
first day of spring training like this ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither had the Cardinals, who drew about 20 reporters for their  
first workout last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire's news conference lasted about an hour and included the  
revelation that the most pressure he felt last fall came after he 
broke Maris' record and worried about keeping it from the 
fast-charging Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	All last fall, McGwire had maintained that he didn't care who  
ended up with more homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that new teammate Carlos Baerga thought McGwire was capable  
of hitting 80 homers this year, McGwire laughed again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Geez, I'd definitely retire if I did that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't plan to stop taking the muscle-building  
supplement androstenedione. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league baseball is not the IOC,'' McGwire said,  
referring to the International Olympic Committee's ban on 
androstenedione. ``And it has absolutely nothing to do with me 
hitting a baseball. I don't endorse the produce. I never did. 
Someone stuck a nose in my locker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who kept a low profile for most of the offseason, said  
he'd like to play at least five more years, but that he would 
``walk away'' from baseball if there was another work stoppage. The 
current agreement is likely to expire after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also criticized reports of security measures the  
Cardinals are taking to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I do not have bodyguards,'' he said in his opening remark.  
``I don't need any bodyguards. I don't want any.''

<HEADLINE> Nets' Gatling Asks To be Traded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets sixth man Chris  
Gatling has asked the struggling team to trade him, general manager 
John Nash said Wednesday night after the team lost its fifth 
straight game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash said the Gatling and Nets coach John Calipari spoke before  
the game and discussed the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the first time he's suggested that it might be better  
if he was in a different situation,'' Nash said after the Nets blew 
a 14-point lead and dropped a 94-85 decision to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We previously told his agent (David Falk) that if he can find  
something out there that would be in everyone's interest we would 
be willing to listen,'' Nash said. ``We would entertain anything, a 
trade, a draft choice, that's in the best interests of the New 
Jersey Nets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gatling was not in the Nets' locker room after the game. The  
power forward played 11 minutes and he did not score, missing two 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatling asked to be traded after the Nets acquired him from  
Dallas in February 1997. He averaged 19 points that season and 11.5 
in 57 games with New Jersey last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatling has played in all 11 games this season averaging a  
little more than five points.

<HEADLINE> Alien Deportation Defense Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave the government a big  
victory Wednesday in its 12-year effort to deport Palestinians 
accused of supporting foreign terrorists. Their lawyer says the 
decision limits all aliens' free-speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-member majority of the nine-member court ruled that  
aliens who are in the United States unlawfully have no right to ask 
federal courts to thwart deportation based on alleged selective 
enforcement of immigration rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians' lawyer, Georgetown law professor David Cole,  
called the decision both sweeping and shocking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court effectively has ruled that aliens have no First  
Amendment rights; that they can be singled out for deportation for 
engaging in the kinds of First Amendment activities that every 
citizen unquestionably has a right to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The First Amendment protects freedom of speech.  
</P>
<P>
	``This remarkable holding ... is, indeed, a sad day for aliens  
in this country,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Hobson, a lawyer for the conservative Criminal Justice  
Legal Foundation, praised the decision. ``As America faces a 
growing threat of terrorist acts, it has become critically 
important that our government be able to identify and quickly 
remove foreign nationals who encourage such acts from our midst,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court that ``as a general  
matter ... an alien unlawfully in this country has no 
constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense 
against his deportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining him in that conclusion were Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and 
Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	When granting review last June, the court specifically excised  
that constitutional issue from the case and said it would review 
only whether aliens can get into federal court and pursue 
selective-enforcement claims before their deportation hearings are 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	By an 8-1 vote Wednesday, the justices said federal courts  
cannot handle most claims by aliens before a final judgment is made 
on the deportations sought by immigration officials. By the 
separate 5-4 vote, the court then ruled that selective-enforcement 
claims almost never can be raised to challenge a deportation, no 
matter the timing. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has been trying since 1987 to deport seven Los  
Angeles-area Palestinians and the Kenyan-born wife of one of them. 
Immigration officials say they are members or supporters of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the U.S. 
government has labeled a terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The aliens say they are victims of selective enforcement of U.S.  
immigration laws, and that they are being persecuted for 
fund-raising activities that should be protected by free-speech 
rights. They contend that they only published leaflets seeking 
support and money for the Palestinian group's lawful activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest court's decision did not clear the way for the  
aliens' deportations, but removed a significant hurdle the 
government had faced. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
officials now are free to schedule deportation hearings for the 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Justice David H. Souter voted to let aliens go into federal  
court with a selective-enforcement claim before their deportation 
hearings. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 
Stephen G. Breyer voted against allowing federal court challenges 
before deportation hearings in such cases, but did not reach the 
constitutional issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1996 enacted an anti-terrorism law that makes it a  
crime for anyone -- citizen or noncitizen -- to provide financial 
support to a foreign organization labeled as terrorist by the 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that the new  
immigration law did not bar a federal trial judge from studying the 
eight aliens' free-speech case. The Supreme Court set aside that 
ruling.

<HEADLINE> Summit on Fighting Corruption Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Corruption in one country can trigger  
economic, environmental and leadership crises in nations around the 
world, Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country can seal itself off from the impact of corruption  
beyond its borders, and therefore every nation must work with every 
nation to fight corruption wherever it is in the world,'' Gore said 
in remarks opening a three-day conference on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum, chaired by the vice president and organized by the  
State Department, attracted representatives of 79 nations, here to 
outline strategies against corruption in their judicial, economic 
and national security systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that while the United States has made strides in  
guarding itself against corruption domestically and abroad, it is 
not immune to weakness. ``No nation has a monopoly on virtue. None 
has a corner on corruption,'' he said. ``And no nation has the 
right to lecture any other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example, Gore pointed to the arrest this month of three  
U.S. immigration employees responsible for patrolling the Mexican 
border near Nogales, Ariz. They were arrested for allegedly 
participating in a drug-smuggling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``The alleged role was simple -- looking the other way,'' Gore  
said. ``The alleged crime was vile -- betraying the trust of their 
country and selling out the millions of young people we seek to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who opened the conference  
with a brief welcome, suggested a pay increase for border guards, 
because increased salaries would make them less susceptible to 
accepting bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said better world leaders and a decreasing tolerance for  
crime are forces helping battle corruption worldwide. A growing 
trend toward government reform also is helping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many cases, the very steps you would take to reform  
government to reduce corruption are the same steps you would take 
to reform government to increase efficiency,'' he said. He 
suggested adoption of fewer, clearer regulations, demolition of 
monopolies and increased accountability among government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent technological advances, specifically, easier access to  
the Internet, also has helped because it has allowed more 
information to reach a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Information is the natural enemy of corruption,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Overhaul Bill Pushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As personal bankruptcies continue to soar,  
lawmakers of both parties have begun pushing legislation backed by 
credit card companies that would make it harder for people to wipe 
away their debts in Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The House last fall passed similar legislation to overhaul the  
nation's bankruptcy laws, bringing a veto threat from the Clinton 
administration, which said it was too harsh on debtors. The Senate 
adjourned last year without voting on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new Congress getting to work, some lawmakers and a  
deep-pocketed coalition of banks, credit card companies and 
retail-business groups are gearing up again to push for quick 
enactment this year. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey urged President Clinton to  
endorse the House bill proposed Wednesday, which had attracted 
support from 34 lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's bankruptcy laws make it too easy to run up debt and  
walk away from it,'' Armey, R-Texas, said in a statement. ``With 
these reforms, Congress can send a strong message that no one 
should be allowed to act irresponsibly and leave others to pay the 
price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said the administration, which  
supports overhauling the bankruptcy laws, needed to examine the new 
bill to determine ``whether it strikes a balance'' between the 
legitimate needs of debtors and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic opponents and consumer groups denounced the bill,  
saying it catered to credit card companies and would plunge 
financially strapped people and families into debt for the rest of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill ``hurts families with kids who are trying to work their  
way out of debt,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading 
critic of bankruptcy overhaul legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union said the  
measure would leave ``families in crisis stranded while giving 
credit card companies free rein to continue to engage in misleading 
and coercive practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents insist that the credit card networks, and the banks  
that control them, share the blame for mounting debt by 
aggressively mailing millions of solicitations to entice consumers 
to take on more debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing  
personal bankruptcies last year reached a record 1.4 million, up 
more than 300 percent since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Big credit card companies, notably Visa and MasterCard, and  
retail-business groups have said their losses from forgiven debts 
in bankruptcy have forced them to raise interest rates for 
consumers who handle credit responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated $50 billion in consumer debt erased in  
bankruptcy, the higher rates translate to a ``hidden tax'' of $550 
a year on the typical American family, said Rep. Rick Boucher, 
D-Va., one of the bill's drafters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bankruptcies of convenience'' are fueling the increase in  
court filings, Boucher maintained. ``Bankruptcy ... is becoming a 
first stop rather than a last resort because our current bankruptcy 
system encourages people to walk away from their debts regardless 
of whether they have the ability to repay any portion of what they 
owe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, bankruptcy judges would be allowed to determine  
case-by-case a debtor's ability to repay. But in addition, an IRS 
standard would be used to estimate living expenses and calculate 
whether the payback could be 25 percent or more of the total debt 
within three years, in which case the debtor would be forced into a 
Chapter 13 reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Boucher and other backers said the bill would give highest  
priority among debts to child support and alimony payments, putting 
them ahead of credit card debt and other obligations. Critics say 
they fear that debtors still would be intimidated by commercial 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a political flap last spring, consumer groups and Democrats,  
including Hillary Rodham Clinton, complained that provisions in 
earlier versions of the legislation would make thousands of single 
mothers and children who are owed support take a back seat to 
credit card companies in debt collection.

<HEADLINE> Ex-President Ford Touts Gov. Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) -- Former President Ford had kudos for  
Elizabeth Dole, but says Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the GOP's 
best hope to regain the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spoke at the Harry S. Truman Library at the opening Tuesday  
of an exhibit detailing the presidency from Franklin D. Roosevelt 
through the first term of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky scandal damaged the institution of the presidency,  
Ford said, but the Republicans rather than President Clinton 
suffered the most in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it ended up very inconclusive,'' Ford said of  
Clinton's impeachment trial. ``I don't think there's any question 
of it having had an adverse impact on the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans have moved too far to the right, just as  
Democrats moved too far left with liberal nominees George McGovern, 
Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to win if you retain the policies of the hard  
right,'' he said. ``The Democrats lost with hard-left policies. I 
think we can win if we're wise enough to go down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush is talking a lot more moderately than his  
father,'' Ford said of the son of former President Bush. 
``(Republicans) aren't going to win on one issue. They've got to 
have a broader view. And it doesn't do any good to finish second, I 
can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the issue of a woman president, Ford said he felt Mrs. Dole,  
wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole, might not be 
successful in the Iowa caucuses, but could be a formidable 
candidate in the open primary of New Hampshire, splitting the 
Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But a more likely scenario for the country to have its first  
woman president would be if she was the vice presidential candidate 
on a ticket with a man, and then had to serve out a term if he 
``should die or get shot or whatever,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's the last time,'' Ford said to the applause of the  
audience, ``that we'll ever have a male president.''

<HEADLINE> McCurry Praises Chelsea Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chelsea Clinton has survived a youth in the  
White House fishbowl and ``has her head screwed on a little bit 
better than her mom and dad, in many ways,'' said former 
presidential press secretary Mike McCurry. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published in the latest edition of George  
magazine, McCurry also told the magazine's editor, John F. Kennedy 
Jr., that White House staffers viewed Monica Lewinsky ``as someone 
who was infatuated with the president and who he liked to flirt 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, McCurry admitted first being flustered by ABC White  
House correspondent Sam Donaldson ``flapping his wings'' and 
``putting on some kind of tantrum all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I soon realized that all Sam wanted to do was see how  
brittle we were in reacting to him,'' McCurry said. ``If someone 
screamed at him and told him to get lost, then he would know, `Hmm, 
there must be some problem.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McCurry stepped down as President Clinton's spokesman on Oct. 1  
and has since hit the lecture circuit and taken a job with The 
Public Strategies Group, a Washington consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	In the George interview, he defended his approach of not asking  
Clinton or his lawyers too many questions about the president's 
affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	McCurry said if he had asked, ``then you would have had Mike  
McCurry out there compounding the lie that Bill Clinton was telling 
his wife, his staff and his closest friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said some members of the media have problems with Clinton  
because he is a fellow Baby Boomer, and ``too much like the student 
body president you didn't like in high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCurry did credit reporters with leaving Chelsea Clinton alone  
throughout junior high and high school. She is now a sophomore at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure this is something you can appreciate,'' McCurry told  
Kennedy, son of the late president. ``I mean, Chelsea had an 
experience as a child in the White House that is totally different 
from what other presidential children have gone through. She grew 
up in the White House and turned out a pretty good kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion, she has her head screwed on a little bit better  
than her mom and dad, in many ways.''

<HEADLINE>  Nordic Event Stopped by Blizzard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAMSAU, Austria (AP) -- The Nordic Ski World Championship's  
combined team event was postponed for a day because of a heavy 
snowfall on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had so much snow in 25 years,'' said organizing  
committee head Wolfgang Mitter. ``We need a day without competition 
to clear the snow away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A blizzard that lasted nearly 24 hours added about 2 feet of  
fresh snow overnight, and the organizers could not deal with the 
amount of snow in the stadium and at the bottom of the ski jumping 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't have enough time to clear the incredible mass  
of snow from the stadium,'' Mitter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even snow-clearing machines had trouble getting through the  
mountains of snow. Heavy trucks and snow plows were being used in a 
continuous effort to remove the fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Few roads were open and the official shuttle service had trouble  
keeping with the schedule. Many abandoned cars hindered the job of 
snow plows. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad weather since the start of the championship Friday has  
caused organizers to suffer ``considerable financial losses,'' 
Mitter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 105,000 fans had come out for the first five days of  
competition, 50,000 below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe, though, that we can reach the figure of  
200,000 by the weekend,'' Mitter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many owners of concession stands said they would not cover the  
expensive rent because of the fewer number of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,600 volunteers have been working up to 16 hours of days  
in their battle against the wintry conditions.

<HEADLINE>  Ryan Minor Set To Sub for Ripken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ryan Minor will forever be known as  
the man who replaced Cal Ripken at third base on the night the Iron 
Man finally decided to sit out a game. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a label Minor can live with, if only because he knows he  
still has plenty of time to enhance his list of accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``All winter, people asked me about replacing Cal for that one  
game. That's something that's always going to be there,'' Minor 
said Wednesday. ``Hopefully I'll have an opportunity to play for a 
long time and get a chance to establish myself as not only the guy 
who played that night but someone who played a long time as a very 
productive baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minor, 25, got his first major league start last Sept. 20, when  
Ripken voluntarily ended his consecutive games streak at 2,632 in 
the Orioles' home finale against the New York Yankees. Afterward, 
the baseball Hall of Fame asked Minor for a couple mementos of the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	So, despite playing in only nine major league games, Minor has  
his bat and shoes in Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I never get back to the big leagues, I can always say I  
played that day. But that's not good enough for me,'' Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
	After making an impression on the Orioles during spring training  
last year, Minor spent the summer at Double-A Bowie before being 
called up by the Orioles on Sept. 11. He had 17 homers and 71 RBIs 
with Bowie, then hit .429 in nine games with Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	He impressed the small crowd at Fort Lauderdale Stadium by  
hitting three home runs in three swings during batting practice 
Wednesday, but Minor knows he will almost certainly be back in the 
minors in April. He's not quite ready for the majors yet, and 
Ripken certainly isn't ready to give up job at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do this spring is show them I still want to  
work hard and that I've improved over last year,'' Minor said. 
``You always want to be there right now, but things don't always 
work out that way. My situation is this: There's still a legend 
playing at third base and he will play there as long as he wants 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Minor starred in basketball at Oklahoma, but  
decided to make a living playing baseball. There were times last 
season when he wondered whether he made the right decision, 
especially after he got off to a rocky start at Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was struggling at the plate and I didn't know how to shake  
the slump,'' he said. ``I started thinking some days, `Maybe I 
should play basketball again. Maybe I wasn't cut out to play 
baseball.' That was the first time I ever failed at anything in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With help from his family and fiance, Minor shook those negative  
thoughts. He now intends to stick with baseball for as long as he's 
got a chance to play in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor may not have to wait too much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	``You watch him take ground balls and you watch him hit, and  
then you say, `This is a talent. This is a good athlete,''' manager 
Ray Miller said. ``Because of an injury or whatever, maybe he gets 
here sooner than anyone thinks. And I think he's going to be a 
player.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Andy Garcia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Andy Garcia is an actor who can  
make a mobster look sexy, so if anyone can make the role of a 
ticket scalper seem hot, it's him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old Cuban-born actor hit it big, first with his role  
in ``The Untouchables'' in 1987 and then three years later in 
Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Godfather: Part III.'' He became a 
true Hollywood star -- winning glossy magazine covers and Oscar and 
Golden Globe nominations for his role in the Coppola film. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia went on to star opposite Meg Ryan in ``When a Man Loves a  
Woman.'' He then worked in quirkier films like ``Things to Do in 
Denver When You're Dead'' and ``The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca'' 
about the famed Spanish poet. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in ``Just the Ticket,'' Garcia stars as Gary, a love-struck  
ticket scalper who tries to woo his ex-girlfriend Linda (played by 
Andie MacDowell) while trying to make it as a hustling ticket 
seller in New York. When he finds out Pope John Paul II is coming 
to Yankee Stadium for Easter Mass, Gary has to find a way to get 
past the competition to win big -- and win back Linda. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was a producer for the movie, which was 10 years in the  
making, and also wrote songs for the film's Latin-influenced 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat down in a Beverly Hills hotel on a recent afternoon. A  
dapper olive-green suit and matching silk shirt add class to his 
already handsome looks. 
</P>
<P>
	1. After spending so much time on this project, do you feel  
added pressure for it to do well? 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: It's not pressure. It's just an enormous amount of work.  
We shot the movie two summers ago. We had to cut the movie, finish 
it, sell it, you know. Then the studio (MGM) bought it. They wanted 
to sell it. They wanted to test it some more and cut a couple of 
things out. ... But I am very proud that we were able to pull it 
off and that it's a real film. 
</P>
<P>
	1 1/2. How did you get interested in a project about a ticket  
scalper in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: If you look at what I have done in the past years, I  
certainly have not picked movies that are necessarily commercial 
films or mainstream. ... It's just something that has to grab you 
when you read it. You go, 'This is a beautiful script and this is a 
story I want to get behind.' A lot of times people who are thinking 
with a more overall commercial value in your life will go, 'I don't 
think it's a good idea for your career.' But I go, 'Yeah, why 
shouldn't I do it? It's why I'm here.' 
</P>
<P>
	2. Your family left Cuba when you were 5 years old to escape  
from Fidel Castro. Do you miss Cuba? 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: Every day ... (But) it's not easy to go back. You have  
to take a stand against something like that. And it would be a 
great betrayal to go there. I obviously think about going back all 
the time, but it's like asking a Jew to go visit Nazi Germany. ... 
I hope that one day democracy will exist and (Castro) will no 
longer be there. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Whom do you admire?  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: I've always said that the only heroes in my life are my  
mother and father. Luckily, I don't have to look for heroes outside 
of my own house. 
</P>
<P>
	3 1/2. What did your parents teach you about life?  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: Their work ethic was extraordinary. That was really  
helpful. My father used to say, 'Never take a step backward -- not 
even to gain momentum' and that's helped me tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
	3 3/4. How have you juggled your fame with family life?  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: I'm married with three daughters -- 15, 11 and 7. I've  
been married since 1982 and we went out seven years before that. 
It's been a long time. ... I have a blessed life and there is 
nothing to be bitter about. Ultimately, what is more important than 
the health and happiness of your own children? 
</P>
<P>
	4. You began acting as a teen-ager and continued in college.  
What brought you to Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: I had a friend out here. He said, 'Hey there's lots of  
work out here.' I said, 'Great. I'm there.' I came out here and 
that success didn't come to me that easily. I left in 1978 and 
started to make a living as an actor in 1985. I worked as a waiter, 
a roofer, on the docks, as a mover -- whatever jobs were going on. 
</P>
<P>
	5. What's next for you?  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia: I have a movie that I want to direct that I have been  
developing that deals with the cabaret scene in Havana circa 1959 
at the turn of the Revolution -- sort of the end of that era and the 
tragedy of what happened there and the destruction of families 
because of the political process. And I want to record an album of 
my own music. Music is a great part of my life. I play every day.

<HEADLINE> Fabregas Finds Home in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Jorge Fabregas, who spent much of the  
past two years filling out change-of-address forms, hopes he has 
finally found a home with his hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
	The well-traveled Miami native was acquired in a trade last  
November by the Florida Marlins, the catcher's fifth club since May 
1997. No one has ever been happier to join a team coming off a 
108-loss season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a dream come true,'' Fabregas said Wednesday.  
``Ever since Miami got a team, I was thinking that it'd be nice to 
play for them. But when Charles Johnson was here, they had a very, 
very good catcher, and I figured my chances were limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed when the Marlins gutted their championship roster.  
Johnson, a winner of four Gold Gloves, went to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers last May in a deal that sent Mike Piazza to Miami. Piazza 
caught five games and was also traded, a comical sequence of events 
that summed up Florida's dismal decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Gregg Zaun took over behind the plate, hit .188 and was traded  
to Texas in November. Now the job goes to Fabregas, acquired from 
the New York Mets for reliever Oscar Henriquez and cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old catcher gives the Marlins three things they  
need: veteran leadership, steady defense and a boost at the box 
office. Fabregas' family and friends will fill plenty of seats at 
Pro Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody who is anybody that's related to me lives in  
Miami,'' he said. ``When I played for Arizona and we came to Miami, 
I had 60 people on the pass list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're all thrilled that Fabregas is with the Marlins, and new  
manager John Boles is happy, too. He said Fabregas' leadership will 
be valuable to a team loaded with young players, especially on the 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an experienced major-league player, and he's not going to  
faint,'' Boles said. ``He's been around awhile, and he's 
comfortable. That's good, because for so many guys this is new to 
them. Hopefully some of that rubs off on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fabregas began his career with the Angels' organization and  
spent parts of four seasons in the majors before being traded to 
the Chicago White Sox in May 1997. He had his best season that 
year, hitting .280 with 48 RBIs in 100 games for Chicago, then went 
to Arizona in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowed by injuries last year, the left-handed hitter batted .199  
in 50 games for the Diamondbacks and continued to struggle after 
being traded in July to the Mets, hitting .188 in 20 games. 
Defensively he fared better, throwing out 21 of 49 runners on 
stolen base attempts last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``1997 started a roller-coaster ride,'' he said. ``I'd like to  
stay with a team a full year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a modest goal he'll likely achieve. But with Fabregas in  
the final year of a two-year contract that pays him $1.85 million 
in 1999, his time with the cost-conscious Marlins could be brief. 
Top prospect Ramon Castro, 22, finished last season in Double-A and 
could be in the majors by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, however, the job belongs to Fabregas. On opening day  
he'll take his position behind the plate, glad to be at home.

<HEADLINE> IOC's Coles in Bribe Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers were to produce air  
travel vouchers, courtesy notes and lodging reservations on 
Thursday as evidence that Salt Lake boosters lavished favors on an 
Australian member of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee planned to publicly back up a  
finding by an internal ethics panel that Phil Coles took 
expense-paid junkets in 1995, the year Salt Lake City was awarded 
the 2002 Winter Games. Coles has repeatedly claimed the report is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC says it has records that a reservation was made for  
Coles at the posh Goldener Hirsch Inn, a 20-room lodge at the Deer 
Valley ski resort, 26 miles east of Salt Lake City, but that the 
reservation was canceled. The organization was not divulging other 
lodging records on Wednesday. The documents include courtesy notes 
bid officials wrote to Coles on his trips to Salt Lake, SLOC 
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles came under scrutiny in a lengthy report Feb. 9 from an  
ethics committee for the Salt Lake committee that said he treated 
his official IOC visits ``like vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Salt Lake bid boosters paid for four U.S. visits  
by the families of Coles and another IOC member, Willi Kaltschmitt 
of Guatemala. On one of the visits, Coles was treated to a Super 
Bowl game in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has called the allegations unfounded or inaccurate. In  
particular, he has denied staying at the Deer Valley lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said the committee was sending copies of all the supporting  
documents, including airline receipts, to Coles and the IOC. The 
material was inadvertently left out of an appendix of the 300-page 
ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't seen the evidence and we wanted to get it off to  
him,'' said Shaw, who declined to provide copies of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are not supposed to accept gifts worth more than  
$150, and Coles is under investigation by the IOC for possibly 
breaking that rule. Coles stepped down from the organizing 
committee of the 2000 Sydney Games a day after he was named in the 
Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said ``some IOC members treated their site  
visits more like vacations,'' and then discussed the case of the 
Coles and Kaltschmitt families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels  
and followed the same recreational itinerary. Two of these trips 
were only four months apart in 1995, including a Super Bowl trip 
that does not appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City. 
Mr. Welch served as their host at the Super Bowl; the expenses were 
paid as reimbursements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has strongly denounced those allegations and challenged  
Salt Lake officials to produce the documentation. He complained 
that the only thing missing from his media treatment was ``the 
guillotine in the city square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his denials Tuesday for The Australian newspaper,  
saying that he and his family spent Christmas 1995 with fellow IOC 
member Jim Eason at Eason's condominium in Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed there. We cooked our own meals and did everything  
ourselves, and my records show that,'' Coles said. ``These people 
have got it wrong again.''

<HEADLINE>  Thousands March To Honor Dead Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Watched over by police, thousands of demonstrators  
marched through Berlin today to honor three Kurds killed in 
protests over the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8,500 people followed two silver hearses decorated with  
flowers and carrying the coffins of Sema Alp, 18; Ahmet Acac, 24; 
and Mustafa Kurt, 29, all from Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	They were shot Feb. 17 by Israeli guards while trying to storm  
the Israeli consulate -- reportedly in response to rumors that 
Israeli agents helped Turkey trace Ocalan to Kenya, where he was 
arrested Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Israel denied any involvement in Ocalan's capture, many  
marchers chanted ``Israel -- terrorist'' as they moved through snowy 
central Berlin carrying poster-sized pictures of the three victims 
and of Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 police were deployed to prevent violence, and  
organizers called on marchers to remain peaceful. At least 44 
people were detained, mostly for displaying symbols of Ocalan's 
Kurdistan Workers Party, which is banned in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, occupants of an apartment house in the heavily  
Turkish neighborhood tossed something onto the passing crowd and a 
few marchers responded by throwing stones and rushing the building. 
But police blocked them from entering and the demonstrators 
eventually rejoined the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Berlin officials banned all demonstrations last weekend, fearing  
violence, but agreed to the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that many Kurds and friends of Kurds, who can't  
be automatically classified as extremist or prone to violence, wish 
to publicly express their sorrow over the death of their 
countrymen,'' said Berlin's Interior Minister Eckart Werthebach. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were to be flown to Turkey for burial Thursday. Some  
29 other Kurds involved in the storming of the consulate face 
charges, including causing bodily harm.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill won four Grammy  
Awards tonight for her solo debut album, including best new artist. 
Madonna won her first musical Grammys. And the ``Titanic'' ballad 
``My Heart Will Go On'' won three Grammys, including song of the 
year. Madonna won best pop album for her excursion into 
electronica, ``Ray of Light.'' Hill, who led with 10 nominations in 
nine categories, won best rhythm and blues album for ``The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' Her hit song, ``Doo Wop (That 
Thing)'' won best R&AMP;B song and best R&AMP;B vocal performance.

	Senate Approves Military Pay Hike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to give  
the nation's military a benefits increase. The legislation includes 
an across-the-board 4.8 percent pay increase with further boosts in 
future years. The nation has 1.4 million active-duty military 
members. The bill, the first passed by the Seante this year, now 
goes to the House.

	Broaddrick Details Alleged Assault  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At times tearful, Juanita Broaddrick appeared  
on NBC's ``Dateline'' tonight describing an alleged sexual assault 
by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. In the interview, taped Jan. 20 but 
held by the network until tonight, Mrs. Broaddrick cried briefly as 
she detailed the alleged assault. She said of Clinton, ``my hatred 
for him is overwhelming.'' Clinton, who was attorney general of 
Arkansas in 1978, refused comment earlier today on Mrs. 
Broaddrick's allegations, saying he stood by the statement of his 
attorney, David Kendall, who called the accusations ``absolutely 
false.''

	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche struck Western  
Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging 
for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The latest 
torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where two people 
were killed and two survivors were pulled from the snow and debris. 
Seven miles away, in Galtuer, the death toll rose to 16, with 15 
still missing.

<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a moderate party's  
election headquarters today as reformers and hard-liners bickered 
over candidates in Iran's first local elections in 20 years. 
Witnesses said there were no casualties in the attack, in which a 
passenger on a motor scooter sprayed bullets. The shooting 
highlighted the tensions before Friday's polls, which pit 
supporters of reformist President Mohammad Khatami against his 
hard-line rivals in the Islamic government.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court rejected O.J.  
Simpson's appeal for custody of his two children today, and he 
faces a new custody trial that would include evidence on whether he 
killed their mother. The court unanimously denied review of a 
lower-court ruling that set aside a judge's order giving Simpson 
legal custody of his daughter Sydney, 13, and son, Justin, 10. 
Simpson, reached at home, said he was prepared to face another 
trial against his ex-wife's parents.

	Report: Net Increases Hate Groups  
</P>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Internet is to blame for a dramatic  
increase in the number of hate groups operating in the United 
States, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. Their ranks swelled 
to 537 last year, up from 474 in 1997, the center said in its 
annual Intelligence Project report. ``The Internet is allowing the 
white supremacy movement to reach places it has never reached 
before -- middle- and upper-middle class, college-bound teens,'' 
said Mark Potok, a researcher for the center.

<HEADLINE> Wildcats' Turner Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky point guard Wayne Turner, six  
games shy of a national record for career games played, left 
Wednesday night's game against Vanderbilt briefly after hurting his 
knee. He returned for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was hurt with just over eight minutes left in the first  
half. After stealing the ball from Atiba Prater, Turner went in for 
a layup. But he appeared to leave his feet awkwardly and missed the 
shot, landing in a heap under the Kentucky basket. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, who has played in three straight national title games  
for Kentucky, was helped off the court and went to the locker room 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not expected to return, Turner was back on the court  
for the start of the second half, wearing a black band around his 
knee and showing no ill effects. He stripped Prater of the ball 
twice more at the start of the half, converting breakaway layups 
both times to help Kentucky to a 45-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner had been honored in Senior Night ceremonies prior to the  
game, his final appearance as a player at Rupp Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	With his appearance against the Commodores, Turner tied former  
teammate Jared Prickett's school record for career games played 
with 143. With six additional games -- Kentucky's regular-season 
finale Sunday at Tennessee and five postseason games -- Turner would 
break Christian Laettner's national record of 148 games, set while 
Laettner was at Duke from 1988 to 1992.

<HEADLINE> Source: Buchanan To Launch Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the television commentator who  
stunned the Republican establishment by winning the New Hampshire 
primary in 1996, will return to the state next week to launch his 
third presidential campaign, officials involved in the effort said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manchester, N.H., address next Tuesday will be the first  
stop in a swing through at least 13 cities in Primary states, said 
the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful candidate may also unveil a toll-free campaign  
number: 1-800-GO-PAT-GO, an official said. The adviser quipped that 
the pitchforks are already being sharpened, a reference to 
Buchanan's 1996 battle cry after winning New Hampshire: ``All the 
peasants are coming with pitchforks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, 60, began a leave of absence Wednesday from CNN's  
``Crossfire'' to mount the uphill campaign. He has told friends and 
associates he is bored with the television business and believes 
the early GOP front-runners, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and 
Elizabeth Dole, are vulnerable. Neither has formally entered the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan exceeded expectations with low-budget, high-voltage  
campaigns in 1992 and 1996. He staggered the candidacy of George 
Bush in 1992, drawing more than 37 percent of the vote in New 
Hampshire. He won the primary four years later with 27 percent of 
the vote, threatening the candidacy of Bob Dole. Both Bush and Dole 
recovered to win the nominations, as Buchanan ran out of steam and 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is said to believe his populist message can still  
resonate if he focuses on the loss of jobs in a shaky global 
economy and exploits the anxieties of workers who don't know how 
long the economy will keep them at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his 1996 team is gone. Terry Jeffrey, who managed the  
campaign, is now editor of a conservative magazine. Greg Mueller, 
his 1996 communications chief, is expected to work for Steve 
Forbes, a failed 1996 candidate also planning a return appearance. 
Strategist Connie Mackey is already signed up with activist Gary 
Bauer, who is seeking the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field that also is expected to include Rep.  
John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Sen. 
John McCain of Arizona and former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., announced his campaign this month.  
</P>
<P>
	His candidacy could further divide the votes of social  
conservatives already being courted by Smith, Quayle, Bauer and 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
are the only announced candidates for the Democratic primary. 
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry is considering running, but members 
of Congress and others who have talked to him recently believe 
Kerry will soon announce that he is not getting in.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Budget Might Exceed Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new House speaker signaled Wednesday that  
Republicans might exceed spending limits enacted two years ago with 
President Clinton, placing the GOP in the politically ticklish 
position of evading strictures aimed at shrinking government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying we're going to bust them or not bust them,''  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some top Republican aides went further, saying that in private  
consultations, the House GOP seemed to be moving toward surpassing 
the spending limits for fiscal 2000 by billions of dollars. The 
aides said no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget Clinton sent Congress this month claimed to obey the  
limits for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. But Republicans have 
accused him of breaking those caps by paying for extra expenditures 
with higher tobacco taxes, user fees and other savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending issue is among several in which Clinton's budget  
attempts to corner Republicans as Congress begins crafting a 2000 
budget. He has proposed using hundreds of billions of dollars in 
projected budget surpluses to shore up Social Security and 
Medicare, two widely supported programs, daring them to use some of 
that money for tax cuts the GOP wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a habit of trying to put us in a box on every issue,''  
said Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., a senior member of the House 
Budget Committee. ``We've just got to work through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Republicans have made reducing the size of government  
a philosophical tenet. They won billions in cuts after taking 
control of Congress in 1995, but spending has since crept upward. 
Last fall, they acceded to Clinton's demands for extra spending and 
added some increases of their own to produce a session-ending 
measure that exceeded 1999 budget limits by $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, many Republicans are concerned that staying within  
the limits for 2000 would entail cutting popular programs and 
perhaps a risky budget fight with Clinton. In addition, both 
parties want to boost the Pentagon's budget, making it even harder 
to stay within spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world changes every day,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis,  
R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee's 
subcommittee that oversees military spending. ``We can't pretend 
we're operating in a rigid forum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 budget-balancing pact enacted by Clinton and the  
GOP-controlled Congress would limit discretionary spending in 2000 
to $536 billion, or less than one-third of next year's $1.77 
trillion budget. Discretionary spending covers all defense and 
domestic programs, excluding benefits such as Social Security and 
Medicare, plus interest on the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That budget deal, designed to balance the budget by 2002,  
squeezed tighter and tighter on spending with each passing year. 
Both sides conceded at the time that it would be tough to obey its 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget analysts say that 1999 spending is so high that it would  
take $10 billion in cuts just to stay within that 2000 cap. And 
that excludes any increases in spending for defense, education and 
some other programs favored by many members of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The move toward increasing the limits is far from unanimous  
among Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in favor of keeping the caps,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood,  
R-Ill. ``I think that's the one thing our party does stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many other Republicans believe an early decision to exceed  
the limits would be a bow to the inevitable. They say the high 
spending level set by last fall's budget bill made it virtually 
impossible to stay within the limits set for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	They also say surpassing the limits now would inflict minimal  
political damage on the party and avoid an autumn spending showdown 
with Clinton like last year's. Their capitulation to many of 
Clinton's spending demands angered many conservatives and hurt the 
GOP in last November's voting, many Republicans say. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget  
Committee, plans to propose a 2000 budget on March 17. Asked if a 
decision on exceeding the limits had been reached, Chambliss said, 
``We haven't solved that question yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is also  
crafting a budget, and there are similar pressures in the Senate to 
exceed the spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget caps should be lifted,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter,  
R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee 
that controls health and education programs. ``The president should 
show some leadership.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Skaggs, Earle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Not long before he died, bluegrass  
founder Bill Monroe confided to country music star Ricky Skaggs 
that he was worried his brand of music was dying, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe passed away in September 1996, but bluegrass hasn't.  
Skaggs and a handful of other well-known and not-so-well-known 
artists have seen to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs released his ``Bluegrass Rules!'' album in 1997 and  
followed it up this year with ``Ancient Tomes.'' Nashville outlaw 
Steve Earle and onetime Monroe band member Del McCoury also have 
new bluegrass albums that are superb. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluegrass has been stigmatized, Skaggs said. ``It's  
`Deliverance,' it's `The Beverly Hillbillies' ... 
get-drunk-at-a-bluegrass-festival-and-fall-over kind of music. And 
it's not. There's so much more depth to it than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe should have known his music would survive. During his  
lifetime, bluegrass weathered the rise of rock 'n' roll and the 
cold shoulder of the country music industry, which still treats it 
like an embarrassing relative. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the original alternative country music,'' Earle said.  
``It's fun. It's the most fun I have playing music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs, 44, a former bluegrass prodigy who scored a string of  
No. 1 country singles in the 1980s, said bluegrass deserves a 
larger role in the current country market. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Garth Brooks') music ... may be the legs and the hands and  
the head right now of country music, but I'm telling you, the heart 
and soul of this music beats in tradition. It beats in bluegrass,'' 
said Skaggs, whose new album includes updates of bluegrass numbers 
by Monroe and The Stanley Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	It got its name from Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys who invented  
the form in the 1930s. Fast, intricate and dominated by acoustic 
strings and tight vocal harmonies, bluegrass became marginalized in 
the 1950s when country music artists reacted to the rise of rock 
'n' roll by putting more emphasis on drums and electric guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluegrass, still primarily acoustic and drumless, benefited from  
the folk music revival of the 1960s and has developed separately 
from the rest of country music ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	It is popular enough today to support more than 500 music  
festivals each summer. It's also blessedly free of having to kowtow 
to radio programmers, since country music stations won't play 
bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back in the '50s you'd hear Bill Monroe and Flatt &AMP; Scruggs  
and Ernest Tubb and Roy Acuff all on the same station,'' McCoury 
said. ``Then of course (bluegrass and country) got segregated as 
years went by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that outside of live shows and an occasional  
public radio station broadcast, it's hard to hear bluegrass music 
without buying an album. That's a shame, given the deep talent pool 
in modern bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
	New albums by McCoury, master dobro guitarist Rob Ickes and J.D.  
Crowe and the New South illustrate the diversity and excellence of 
modern bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes interprets Herbie Hancock on his jazzy ``Slide City''  
album, while Crowe and his band play hard country Merle Haggard and 
Charley Pride hits on ``Come on Down to My World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Family,'' a new album by The Del McCoury Band, shows the  
best current bluegrass band and singer at the top of their game. 
The Del McCoury Band also backs Earle on his album, ``The 
Mountain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Earle, a gifted songwriter who has hopscotched across folk,  
rock and country over the years, making ``The Mountain'' presented 
a writing challenge and an opportunity to record the kind of 
country music he loves. 
</P>
<P>
	Earle, 44, who said he no longer cares about what's going on  
with mainstream country music, and when he goes out in Nashville, 
it's to listen to bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
	For those looking to get a taste of bluegrass, a good starting  
place is the newly released second volume of Vanguard's 
``Generations of Bluegrass'' featuring everything from classics of 
The Osborne Brothers and Monroe to contemporaries like Sam Bush, 
Jerry Douglas and Skaggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also worth seeking out is last year's ``Clinch Valley Country''  
by legendary band leader Ralph Stanley. Country singers including 
Marty Stuart, Vince Gill and Patty Loveless perform on the double 
CD of duets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little hard to convince people to give (bluegrass) a  
try,'' Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throw away everything you've ever heard about bluegrass. This  
is a new day, there are new musicians. You've got people like Del 
McCoury, Blue Highway, Alison Krauss -- there's great musicians out 
there bringing a quality music that has substance, it has heart and 
soul. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a great time right now for bluegrass to rise to  
the occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in country music...  
</P>
<P>
	RECORD: Vince Gill's appearance on A&AMP;E's ``Live by Request'' was  
the most popular in the history of the program, beating efforts by 
Tony Bennett, James Taylor and Phil Collins. The live show Jan. 30 
attracted 1.65 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	SOUNDTRACK: Tim O'Brien, Dirk Powell and John Herrmann have  
created a soundtrack to the best-selling novel ``Cold Mountain.'' 
The trio scoured the Civil War-era Charles Frazier novel for 
mentions of old-time songs, then recorded them for ``Songs From the 
Mountain,'' released by Howdy Skies Records.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pirates Scout Howie Haak Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Howie Haak, a Pittsburgh Pirates scout for 38  
years who discovered Robert Clemente, Manny Sanguillen, Rennie 
Stennet and Tony Pena, has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak died Monday at the Palm Springs Health Care Center near his  
home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 87. Haak suffered two strokes 
since Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak was a Pirates scout from 1950 to 1988 and helped build  
Pirates teams that won three World Series and nine division titles. 
He got into baseball after two stints in the Navy as Dodgers owner 
Branch Rickey hired him as a bullpen catcher for Brooklyn's minor 
league team, the Hollywood Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	After two years, Rickey made Haak a scout and brought him to  
Pittsburgh in 1950. In 1955, Rickey sent Haak to scout the Dodger's 
minor league club in Montreal. The manager refused to play Roberto 
Clemente, but Haak saw his talent during batting practice and 
persuaded Rickey to pick the Puerto Rican in the minor league 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the best in the Caribbean. He had one of the best  
memories. He met a player and five years later, he still knew the 
birthday and everything,'' said Pablo Cruz, a Pirates scout for 24 
years based in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak conducted tryouts and scouted extensively in Latin America  
before many major league teams made that commitment, discovering 
Sanguillen in Panama, Stennet in the Dominican Republic, Pena in 
Puerto Rico, Omar Moreno in Venezuela and Al McBean in the Virgin 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``One statement would sum up everything. The Pirates would not  
have been as good if it wasn't for some of the things that Howie 
did,'' former Pirates general manager Harding ``Pete'' Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak made national headlines in 1982 when he said fans were  
staying away from Three Rivers Stadium because the Pirates fielded 
an all-black team. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak said he didn't believe that was true, but he had heard  
people say that. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Pirates, led by then-captain Bill Madlock, supported Haak  
after his remarks were made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak left the Pirates in 1988 after a confrontation with  
then-general manager Syd Thrift and scouted for the Houston Astros 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak continued watching baseball on television and offered free  
talent evaluations over the telephone from his Palm Springs home. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak's wife said he wanted no funeral service or obituary.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I'll haunt you if you don't do that. He wanted to be  
cremated. He said, `Just throw me in the trash can.' He was a tough 
old bird,'' Crystal Haak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haak used his memory and two notebooks, a red one for the  
American League and a green one for the National League, to make 
scouting reports three times a year -- after spring training, at 
midseason and at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Haak would type her husband's reports and send them to the  
Pirates.

<HEADLINE> New Wheat Type To Be Unveiled / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) -- Researchers plan to release this summer  
a dryland white wheat especially developed for western Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Two new red wheat varieties will also be released this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	The still unnamed hard white variety, which has consistently  
outperformed most red varieties in western Kansas, is the third 
released by Kansas State University breeders in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're billing this as a western Kansas dryland wheat  
variety,'' said Kansas State wheat geneticist Joe Martin, the 
researcher who developed it. ``It's had a better performance record 
than virtually anything at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the Past three years, the new variety consistently  
produced a four-bushel yield advantage over KSU-variety 2137, one 
of the better hard red winter varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	The seed grows well under irrigation, but it is not being  
recommended for irrigated acreage because it does not have the same 
advantage over red wheat varieties as shown on dryland fields, 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has shown excellent winter hardiness, Martin said. It has a  
tolerance to wheat streak mosaic, one of the worst disease problems 
in western Kansas. It also has a resistance to soil borne mosaic 
and a moderate but effective resistance to leaf rust. 
</P>
<P>
	The new variety, listed as KS95HW62-6 by researchers, also has a  
``pretty good level'' of resistance to pre-harvest sprouting,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	That has been one of the biggest problems with other Kansas  
white wheat varieties because the grain in the ripened plants can 
germinate before it is cut if it rains just before harvest, Martin 
said. 
</P>

	STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma State University president  
James Halligan says he will recommend that OSU relocate its smelly 
swine farm about a mile from campus because it ``is the only 
logical move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I concur with our dean of agricultural sciences and natural  
resources, Sam Curl, that the move to McElroy best serves the 
long-term interests of both OSU and Stillwater,'' Halligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSU Swine Research and Teaching Facility, with 800 pigs, is  
one of the first sights to greet eastbound motorists entering the 
city on Oklahoma 51. 
</P>
<P>
	University agriculture officials recently announced plans to  
make $2.5 million in improvements. Pigs would be kept in modular 
buildings as part of the effort to eliminate 90 percent of the 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
	But some residents wanted the farm moved rather than renovated.  
They suggested a location about a mile away next to the 
university's horse barns and arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Halligan said he agreed and will recommend to the OSU regents,  
who are expected to consider the situation Friday, that the 
facility be moved to land next to the university's equine, sheep 
and cattle research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm convinced McElroy is a good choice with the odor-control  
options we now have available to us and I plan to tell the regents 
that,'' Halligan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Halligan said the McElroy site would include odor control  
measures designed to eliminate 90 percent of the smell associated 
with a swine facility.

<HEADLINE> House Bill Targets Debt Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government agencies would have to try harder  
to collect billions of dollars in outstanding debt and streamline 
the process for awarding federal grants under separate measures 
approved Wednesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill targeting waste and fraud passed 419-1 and was sent to  
the Senate, which would not consider identical legislation last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're bringing the bill back before the American people  
because we believe it is the right thing to do,'' said Rep. Pete 
Sessions, R-Texas, a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government is owed $50 billion, excluding taxes.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure would amend existing law to expand the use of  
private collection firms, among other provisions, said Rep. Stephen 
Horn, R-Calif. Federal agencies also would be allowed to keep a 
portion of the delinquent debt recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would permit agencies to bar late payers from being  
eligible for the award or renewal of any federal financial 
assistance, such as a loan, or any federal permits or licenses.

duplicate or conflict with each other. As examples, they said 11

across 15 different agencies, they said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Legal Fund Raised $4.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Helped by a direct-mail campaign attacking  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the congressional impeachment 
process, President Clinton's legal defense fund raised $4.5 million 
last year, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The money ranged from small donations of $10 and $20 up to  
$10,000 from Clinton's Hollywood pals and corporate chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the donations was being released today by the  
Clinton Legal Expense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund raised about $2.3 million from more than 30,000 donors  
since August, when the president testified before a federal grand 
jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, acknowledging 
that he had misled the nation and his family about their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first six months of fund-raising last year, the fund  
raised $2.2 million from 17,000 contributors. Among the big-ticket 
donors were celebrities such as directors Steven Spielberg and Ron 
Howard 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have amassed legal bills  
approaching $9 million, but some of those expenses have been paid, 
two officials said, insisting on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton Legal Expense Fund was a follow-on effort to an  
earlier fund-raising drive which raised $1.32 million from 9,376 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the original fund, the new fund allowed the active  
solicitation of contributions. The donation cap also was raised 
from $1,000 to $10,000.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G May Sell Coast Soap Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. says it might sell its  
Coast brand of bar soap, which was introduced nationally in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said Wednesday it is soliciting offers but will keep the  
brand if no acceptable bid is received. 
</P>
<P>
	The brand, now sold throughout North America, is profitable but  
does not fit into P&AMP;G's long-term business plans, management said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's skin care and cosmetics unit prefers to focus on  
its global brands such as Oil of Olay, Zest and Safeguard, said 
Robert Blanchard, president of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, P&AMP;G has sold -- or offered for sale -- several  
brands that management believes do not have potential for worldwide 
sales increases. 
</P>
<P>
	If P&AMP;G sells Coast, the company expects to reassign most of its  
employees now working in the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast represented less than 1 percent of P&AMP;G's total sales of  
beauty care products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. The 
Cincinnati-based consumer products company had worldwide sales of 
$37.2 billion for that fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> The Artists: The Modern Masters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, who  
were both companions and competitors, helped define modern art. 
</P>
<P>
	And the connection between the two masters becomes strikingly  
clear in ``Matisse and Picasso: A Gentle Rivalry,'' an exhibit 
running at the Kimbell Art Museum through May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years in the making, it is composed of more than 100  
paintings, sculptures and drawings from collections around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso and Matisse began their rivalry in 1906, but the exhibit  
tracks them through the later stages of their careers, up to and 
after Matisse's death in 1954. It illustrates how they mimicked 
each other, borrowed from each other, respected each other and 
became best friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picasso really looked at Matisse toward the end of his life  
and after, but it's far less known that Matisse looked at Picasso 
very hard, as well,'' said the exhibit's guest curator Yve-Alain 
Bois, professor of modern art at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing these great works together for the first time ``is like  
a dream come true. I'm so happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kimbell's director, Timothy Potts, said the works haved been  
studied and exhibited from many angles, but ``there has not before 
been an exhibition that documents the keen and often touching 
rivalry, born of a strong mutual respect, between the two artists 
in the years of their maturity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit begins with works from 1929, when Matisse lacked  
inspiration and was nearly unable to paint, and Picasso was in top 
form. The Spanish artist parodied Matisse's style by painting 
acrobats and dancers, which observers have speculated was an 
attempt to revive his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years later, Matisse resumed work. Picasso became  
fascinated with a series of the older French artist's earlier 
sculptures and paintings and produced similar works. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1933, Matisse was ready to respond to Picasso's challenge.  
His ``Daisies'' of 1939 features flowers identical to the primitive 
white daisies in Picasso's ``Basket of Flowers and Pitcher'' of 
1937. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the eeriest sections of the exhibit chronicles works from  
1940-44. The two artists exchanged works, but had minimal direct 
contact with each other because of World War II -- the Nazis 
prohibited Picasso from exhibiting, and Matisse kept a low profile. 
Yet each painted with the other in mind, trying to anticipate his 
next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Matisse and Picasso produced some of their most similar works  
during these years. Matisse's ``The Dream'' in 1940 is nearly a 
carbon copy of Picasso's ``Woman With Yellow Hair'' from nine years 
earlier. Both are side views of blond women leaning to the left and 
resting their heads across folded arms in sleep. Both rely heavily 
on yellow, pink and black. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso painted ``The Rocking Chair'' in 1943, echoing Matisse's  
``Dancer in Repose'' of a year earlier. Both works feature women 
leaning back in chairs with their legs folded underneath them, and 
both are on backgrounds of undulating tiles. While Matisse's 
faceless dancer wears a blue dress, Picasso's woman has distorted 
facial features and wears an amorphous frock of white, yellow and 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the war ended, the two men reunited. They became closer  
than ever, meeting often and exhibiting together frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	After Picasso painted ``Reclining Nude on Blue Bed'' in 1946,  
Matisse recreated the work almost identically with pencil and paper 
in a sketchbook two years later. Both are on display, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit concludes with a series of Picasso's paintings after  
Matisse's death in 1954, which Bois says is the most moving part 
for him. Picasso, who had always been terrified by death, was 
devastated by the loss of his friend and rival, and refused to 
answer the phone when he expected it would be a call with news of 
Matisse's death. He didn't even attend Matisse's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Picasso, who would outlive Matisse by 19 years, did, however,  
posthumously honor him through art. Reflective of Matisse's 
``Interior With Egyptian Curtains,'' the works use large amounts of 
black to create a contrast with blank white canvas space. Many of 
them picture empty studios, reminiscent of Matisse's large 
interiors. 
</P>
<P>
	The final piece of the exhibit, Picasso's ``Woman in a Rocking  
Chair'' of 1956, fuses both artists' styles. It has Matissean 
bright colors, a faceless woman sitting in a patterned chair and a 
palm tree visible in the background through a window. But Picasso 
adds his signature twisted body parts: The woman has a sharklike 
belly, a phallic arm and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really is able to tell the world, 'I really like  
Matisse,''' Bois said. ``There's no irony, no pity. The way it's 
painted, the way the white of the canvas vibrates, the pattern on 
the back of the rocking chair, all that is pure Matisse.''

<HEADLINE> Database May Flag Prescriptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Using a computer database to flag  
prescriptions potentially harmful to older folks can persuade their 
doctors to try an alternative considered safer, according to the 
country's largest pharmacy benefit manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck-Medco Managed Care, a subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant  
Merck &AMP; Co., said such changes can help prevent nasty -- and costly 
-- side effects that often result in hospitalizations or dizziness 
causing falls and broken bones. Occasionally, medication errors 
cause death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the elderly, 17 percent of hospitalizations are due to a  
medication misadventure,'' and those hospital stays cost as much as 
$10 billion annually, said Dr. Mark Monane, senior director of 
geriatrics for Merck-Medco. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which processes pharmacy claims or directly mails  
medications to one in five Americans, including 10 million over age 
65, in 1995 began its Partners for Healthy Aging program. Its aim 
is to reduce adverse drug reactions caused by prescribing the wrong 
drug or the wrong dosage to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older population is growing rapidly, and it is not unusual  
for older people to be taking several medications,'' Monane said in 
a telephone interview after presenting his study, the largest to 
date, last month at the National Managed Health Care Congress 
meeting on Medicare and Medicaid in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	As people age, he said, the way their body breaks down  
medications and how quickly it excretes them changes, ``so a drug 
that was good for them at 40 no longer is at 60 or 70.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, few pharmacists and physicians have specialized  
training in geriatric medicine, and even pharmacists find it 
difficult to know every possible side effect or interaction a drug 
could have. In addition, an elderly patient's primary doctor may 
not be familiar with drugs prescribed by a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	So Merck-Medco compiled the best research on geriatric medicine  
and, with a panel of experts, developed a database focusing on 11 
types of medications commonly used by seniors. The system 
automatically alerts a pharmacist at one of the company's 13 mail 
service facilities, and the pharmacist then calls the prescribing 
physician to point out the drug's dangers and suggest alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine whether the system is preventing patients from  
receiving the potentially dangerous drug, Merck-Medco examined a 
nationwide sample of 23,269 patients whose prescriptions triggered 
a total of 43,007 alerts from April 1996 through March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 24 percent of 24,266 cases, where pharmacists were able to  
discuss the prescription with the physician, he or she then opted 
for a different medication, another dosage or some other strategy, 
such as a dietary change. Most of the alerts and medication changes 
involved antidepressants such as Elavil and tranquilizers such as 
Valium. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that obviously there's a need for,'' said  
Michael Donio of the People's Medical Society in Allentown, Pa. 
``We know that when drug manufacturers set a dosage ... it doesn't 
take into account that someone might be 78 or down to 100 pounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some individual and chain pharmacies have such warning systems,  
but at others the computer system merely determines the price, 
prints the label and tracks inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedy Cohen, vice president of nursing at the Institute for Safe  
Medication Practices in Warminster, Pa., said raw data from a 
survey it is conducting among U.S. hospital pharmacies so far 
shows, ``the hospitals have not been able to adequately adapt 
warnings into their computer systems.''

<HEADLINE> Capitol Architect Has Many Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first architect of the Capitol was  
literally the architect of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alan Hantman, the 10th architect of the Capitol, is  
variously a human resource administrator, threat analyst, union 
negotiator, crisis manager and bean counter. He oversees a $250 
million budget and 2,000 employees, balancing the competing goals 
of openness and security in ``the people's house'' and other 
buildings on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The early architects were brought on to do architecture,'' he  
says not at all wistfully. Nowadays, Hantman's job tests diplomacy 
as much as artistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed by President Clinton two years ago, the former chief  
architect at New York's Rockefeller Center has been sued over 
employment grievances that predated his term, accused of moving too 
slowly on a new building and blamed for maintenance problems at 
existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials howled at a report finding the architect's  
office has the highest occupational injury rate in the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional hearings were called to explore a report of fire  
hazards in the Capitol and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	After two Capitol police officers were shot to death last year,  
members of Congress complained that Hantman was taking too long 
with plans for a new, security-oriented visitors center. ``Build 
it, already,'' demanded an editorial in last week's Roll Call 
newspaper that criticized Hantman by name. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, Hantman has pressed for more money to patch leaks  
in the Capitol dome and improve computer wiring to hundreds of 
congressional offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about office politics: Hantman, 56, practices architecture  
at ground zero of American political life. As architect of the U.S. 
Capitol -- a federal position dating to the work of the first 
architect, William Thornton, in the 18th century -- he must answer 
to congressional committees as well as his own aesthetic standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Others might call it a giant headache. Hantman calls the job ``a  
magnificent challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of folks who don't understand that everything  
can't be done immediately,'' Hantman said. ``You have to request 
money from the federal budget a year in advance, do the design 
work, go through federal procurement processes -- you can't just 
snap your fingers and get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman, who earns $125,900 annually, moved to Washington from  
Teaneck, N.J., in 1997 after serving as vice president for planning 
and architecture at the Rockefeller Center. The American Institute 
of Architects recommended him for the federal post, Congress 
endorsed him and Clinton selected him for a 10-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect has authority over the Capitol, eight  
congressional office buildings, the Library of Congress buildings, 
the Supreme Court building and other structures, including the 
Capitol's own power plant, plus murals, statues and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The architect reports to a Senate committee, a House commission  
on matters related to House office buildings and the House speaker 
on questions related to the House side of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many responsibilities and so many masters, the architect  
of the Capitol has to wear many hats. Little wonder that Hantman's 
predecessor, George White, was not just an architect but an 
engineer, lawyer and graduate of Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	White, now semi-retired after 25 years on Capitol Hill, said  
controversy is a fact of life there. 
</P>
<P>
	``On most things Congress does, there's not unanimous  
agreement,'' he said. ``So even if you have Congress pass a law by 
60 to 40, you have 40 percent of the people that don't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Hantman, the most recent flare-up concerned fire safety.  
</P>
<P>
	The House inspector general reported in December that the  
Capitol and five House office buildings failed virtually every test 
of fire preparedness, with inaudible fire alarms, inadequate escape 
routes and inoperative fire-suppression sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hantman released a statement calling talk of fire traps  
``journalistic hyperbole.'' He said his office is hard at work on 
fire safety upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	White said his successor has done good work in a tough job.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the attacks are a little -- I won't say exaggerated --  
but emphasis is put on them that makes them newsworthy,'' White 
said. In 25 years on the Hill, he has learned to choose his words 
diplomatically.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Civilian Site Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi gunners shot down a missile fired by  
U.S. planes Wednesday, while other American missiles hit a civilian 
site, killing or wounding several people, Iraqi authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military officials said Air Force and Navy aircraft  
attacked two Iraqi surface-to-air missiles sites near Al 
Iskandariyah, about 30 miles south of Baghdad, in response to 
anti-aircraft artillery fire and an Iraqi aircraft violation of the 
southern no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said America wound not be intimidated by Iraqi  
attacks against U.S. warplanes, calling them an attempt by Saddam 
Hussein to score ``a symbolic victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking hours after the allied sorties, Clinton also said the  
United States had not given up hope of eventually restoring U.N. 
inspections of Iraq's weapons arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspections halted after U.S. and British planes carried out  
airstrikes on Baghdad and other sites on Dec. 16-19. The strikes 
came after U.N. inspectors accused the Iraqi government of 
obstructing their search for weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. Central Command said an  
unspecified number of F-15E and F/A-18 aircraft carried out the 
attacks. It did not say what kind of weapons were used. The sites 
are at the extreme northern edge of the southern no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi Information Ministry said air defense batteries shot  
down a missile fired by the U.S. planes, but other American 
missiles ``struck one of our civilian sites, killing and wounding a 
number of citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Iraqi armed forces nor the Information Ministry gave  
precise numbers of casualties and it was not possible to confirm 
the reports independently. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes conduct daily patrols in the no-fly zone  
that was established in 1992 to protect rebels from air attack by 
government forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Iskandariyah is the home of a large military industrial  
factory, which has been attacked in previous confrontations between 
Iraq and the western allies.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Sprinter Wins 60m Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS (AP) -- Veteran sprinter Merlene Ottey wiped out  
competition -- and any talk of retirement -- as she breezed to 
victory in the 60 meters Wednesday at the European Athletics 
Association Indoor Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jamaican, who hopes to run in the 2000 Sydney Olympics just  
before her 40th birthday, clocked 7.05 seconds and said she could 
have done better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did try,'' Ottey told reporters. ``Everybody said this was a  
fast track but its wasn't. I'm not going to pressure myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey sailed past Greece's Katerina Thanou, who finished in 7.16  
seconds, and Nigeria's Glory Alozie who was third with 7.20. 
</P>
<P>
	A surprise win by Nigeria's Sunday Emmanuel in the men's 60  
meters with 6.56 seconds left American Brian Lewis in third place 
at 6.59. Greece's Giorgos Theodoridis, tied the American's time but 
took second place after winning his heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Andres Diaz of Spain set a European indoor record in the 1,500  
meters with a time of 3:33.32, ahead of Kenyans William Tanumi, who

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie Loses in Match Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Welcome to America, Monty. Now go home.  
</P>
<P>
	Colin Montgomerie, the golfer Americans love to hate, had a  
distressful opening round in the Andersen Consulting Match Play 
Championship on Wednesday. No. 6 on the Official World Golf 
Ranking, Montgomerie was quickly dismissed by local favorite Craig 
Stadler, who won 5 and 3 at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	Stadler got on Montgomerie early, going 4-up after eight holes.  
As it became clear on the backside that Montgomerie's round could 
end on any hole, a few spectators let him have it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Stadler admitted that ``I might have angered him a few  
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Montgomerie missed a short putt on No. 13, someone in the  
stands clapped. Before Montgomerie's second shot on 15, someone 
yelled, ``You've got one shot left!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't exactly sporting like, and I might have given him  
a longer and deeper glare than Monty did,'' Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fan wasn't far off base. Two shots later, the Scotsman  
conceded to Stadler, who's in this $5 million tournament thanks to 
his third-place finish at Pebble Beach, which vaulted him from 70th 
to 59th in the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie's drive on 15 landed in the rough, and his second  
shot clattered through some tree branches and landed well short of 
the green. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd refrained from cheering ... despite his  
personality,'' said an elderly gentleman in the gallery. Monty 
didn't hear that one, or numerous other taunts. If he had, his face 
really would have been red. 
</P>
<P>
	Stadler said his second shot on 15 was ``my best shot all day.  
He drove it in the left rough and was just dead. I had about 128 
yards or so and just hit a little 9-iron in there about six feet. 
It was time to step it up and just kind of say goodbye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie's chip shot landed 20 feet beyond the hole and he  
conceded the hole and the match, shaking Stadler's hand and walking 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Stadler went 5-up when Montgomerie melted down on the par-4 10th  
hole, hitting his second shot out of a trap and into the rough 
behind the hole. Stadler, meanwhile, was on in 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On the par-4 13th, Montgomerie wasn't pleased that Stadler  
wouldn't concede the short putt, and the hole was halved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy North told me afterward that he gave me a good little  
glare on 13,'' Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you know, if it's to stay in the match and he has got four  
feet, I am not going to give it to him. He can glare all he wants. 
It wasn't because it was him or anybody else. I won't give it to 
anybody else. Doesn't bother me. ``There's no love lost in match 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' Supervision Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans questioned Wednesday whether  
federal supervision of the Teamsters has done enough to prevent 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-month investigation of the union's 1996 presidential race  
revealed abuse of power, financial mismanagement and a ``profound 
lack of accountability by past Teamsters leaders,'' said Rep. Peter 
Hoekstra, R-Mich., who chairs the House Education and the Workforce 
Committee's oversight and investigations panel that conducted the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings raise questions about whether the 1989 court order  
that put the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union under the 
supervision of the federal government is working well enough in 
preventing corruption not related to organized crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite sharp criticism from Democrats, the subcommittee agreed  
by voice vote to approve a report summing up the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal monitors overturned former Teamsters President Ron  
Carey's re-election in 1996 over James P. Hoffa after investigators 
found that his campaign had improperly benefited from donations the 
union made to third-party political organizations. In a new 
election last December, Hoffa won the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats contended the subcommittee abused its investigatory  
powers, wasted taxpayer money, implied guilt where none was proven 
and turned up nothing that hasn't already been revealed by other 
government probes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``contains nothing new,'' said Rep. Tim Roemer of  
Indiana, the panel's top Democrat. ``This subcommittee spent over a 
million dollars to discover that it could not find any illegal 
activity that was not already being redressed. I question the use 
of this much money to conduct an entirely duplicative effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than raise questions about the effectiveness of current  
law, the investigation showed the system is working as intended, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roemer also accused the GOP majority of turning its  
investigation ``into a partisan effort,'' and ridiculed sections 
that questioned whether union leaders were considering the rank and 
file's best interests when they gave millions of union dollars 
almost exclusively to Democratic candidates and parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in New York have been looking into the union  
since 1997, but Hoekstra said he believed their investigation has 
been ``stalled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since three Carey campaign consultants have pleaded guilty in  
September 1997, federal prosecutors have ``managed to obtain only 
guilty pleas from two minor players, and the indictment of the 
(union's) former political director,'' Hoekstra said. ``Not one 
individual has gone to trial.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Mazda Worker $4.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A federal jury has ordered Mazda Motor Corp. to pay  
$4.4 million to a former employee who said her boss repeatedly 
touched her, chased her around the office and hit her with a 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriella Arango also said Masaki Nakashima of the Japanese  
automaker's office in Miami said: ``If you obey what I say, you'll 
get anything you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda denied the harassment allegations and will fight the Feb.  
17 jury award. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Miami attorney, Courtney Wilson, said Mazda will  
ask the court next week to cut the award to about $1.3 million. 
That would bring it into line with federal civil rights law, which 
has stricter limits on compensatory damages, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arango's attorneys filed suit under Title VII of the Civil  
Rights Act -- a federal anti-bias law -- and under state laws that 
allow higher damage awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Arango $3 million for emotional pain and  
suffering and $1 million for Mazda's ``negligent supervision and or 
retention'' of Nakashima. The award also included $300,000 for 
future wages and benefits, $90,400 in lost wages, $20,000 in future 
medical, psychological or psychiatric expenses and $300 in past 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Arango says she told the company in writing and on the telephone  
about the harassment. The company says it did receive complaints 
from both Arango and Nakashima, but they were about personality and 
office conflicts, not harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Arango worked at Mazda's Miami office for five years before  
being fired in June 1996. She started as a secretary and rose to a 
marketing position in which she helped to arrange auto shows in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda says Arango had shouting matches with Nakashima and didn't  
get along with another employees in the small office. Three times, 
Wilson said, the company sent a human-resources executive in to try 
to resolve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Arango said she was sometimes forced to lock herself in the  
office bathroom to get away from her boss. He occasionally ordered 
her to sit in a corner because she'd been ``a bad girl,'' Arango 
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Bright Lights' Dims on Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not just the memory of his ex-wife that  
haunts the young hero of ``Bright Lights Big City,'' a new musical 
at off-Broadway's New York Theater Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hovering over his shoulder is the ghost of the theater  
company's last big musical success, ``Rent,'' a show that moved to 
Broadway and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Such travels do not appear to be in the cards for ``Bright  
Lights Big City,'' a bland reworking of Jay McInerney's trenchant 
tale of urban angst and flight from responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparisons are inevitable -- and unfortunate. Both shows have  
pop rock scores and the same director, Michael Greif. Yet ``Rent'' 
has a spirit and drive, two qualities missing from ``Bright Lights 
Big City,'' which, incidentally has dropped the comma from the 
book's title. 
</P>
<P>
	The musical is the handiwork of Scottish composer Paul Scott  
Goodman, who wrote the book, music and lyrics. It's a virtually 
sung-through piece that has most of the performers playing several 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
	In its translation from page to stage, Goodman has diluted  
McInerney's cutting and often hilarious observations on living and 
working in New York. He opts instead for a sentimentality that 
works against the cold, calculating environment of a story set 
firmly in the excesses of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's tunes, even with an occasional arresting melody,  
eventually grind the audience down, making the second act seem much 
longer than it should be. And his lyrics tend to the obvious, 
pushing for a rhyme even when he doesn't have a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	McInerney's novel, published in 1984, perfectly captured a time  
and place. Its hero, unnamed but called Jamie in this stage 
version, works as a fact checker for a magazine called Gotham, a 
thinly disguised stand-in for The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie is a glum, self-centered guy who finds refuge in drugs and  
drink. He has reasons. Wife Amanda, a high-fashion model, went to 
Paris several months ago and then phoned to say she was not coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie's job at the magazine is in jeopardy, even as he struggles  
to fact check a complicated article by its restaurant critic. And 
then there is his mother's death, a fact Jamie refuses to face as 
the first anniversary of her demise approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one major difference in structure from the book, which  
was written in the second person. To keep that distance and to 
smooth some rocky transitions, Goodman has injected himself into 
the show as a sort of all-purpose narrator. It is a jarring 
conceit. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Wilson, a fine singer who was an impressive Billy  
Bigelow in the national tour of the most recent ``Carousel,'' works 
very hard. Yet he is stuck with an impossible role, particularly as 
Goodman has written it. This Jamie has very little humor, 
preferring to wallow in self-pity and sentiment much more than the 
character in the book did. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other strong voices in the show. Annmarie Milazzo, who  
also did the show's vocal arrangements, stands out as the mother. 
So does Napiera Daniele Groves as Amanda, the unfaithful wife, and 
Jerry Dixon as Jamie's party-loving, coke-sniffing friend. 
</P>
<P>
	The utilitarian, all-purpose stage design of a catwalk and  
sliding panels is symptomatic of the musical as a whole. It may 
allow Greif to move the show more quickly from scene to scene, but 
it unroots the musical from its very specific environment. This 
``Bright Lights Big City'' is as generic as its nondescript 
setting.

<HEADLINE> Speaker: GOP May Exceed Spend Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert today left  
open the possibility that Republicans would exceed spending limits 
in the nation's balanced-budget accord as they fashion a spending 
plan for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying we're going to bust them or not bust them,'' he  
told reporters. He said previous spending commitments include 
forward funding that would require as much as $17 billion above 
levels permitted under the caps. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending caps, which were put in place two years ago to hold  
domestic spending in check, constitute one of numerous thorny 
issues that Republicans are grappling with as they labor over their 
budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. Tax cuts are 
another, as is the use of the federal surplus and its impact on 
Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, meeting with reporters in a ceremonial office just off  
the House floor, said a meeting Tuesday that President Clinton 
called with congressional leaders was a ``good first step.'' In his 
job less than two months, Hastert added, ``Sometimes you feel like 
a new kid on the block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had ``made a point to the president that we need to  
work together on a real plan to save Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Republican renewed his pledge to work in a  
bipartisan fashion on the legislative agenda. A former deputy whip, 
Hastert said, ``If you don't have the votes you can't pass 
something,'' and if the president won't back it, legislation can't 
become law. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a narrow, six-seat majority in the House, the  
slimmest in decades, complicating GOP efforts to fashion an agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	On the budget, Republicans have accepted Clinton's call for  
setting aside 62 percent of anticipated surpluses to help secure 
Social Security. Clinton wants another 15 percent set aside for 
Medicare, but Hastert, as have other Republicans, declined to 
endorse that. He noted that a bipartisan Medicare commission is 
expected to issue a report shortly, and said that should first be 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's meeting at the White House was the first since  
Clinton's acquittal at a Senate impeachment trial, and also the 
first prolonged meeting with the bipartisan congressional 
leadership since July 15, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no substantive, specific progress on any of the issues  
they will address this year. But with each side eager to 
demonstrate that it has moved beyond impeachment to policy making, 
each said they were willing to try working through their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president knows full well that what the American people  
expect from their political leaders in Washington is to work 
together and get their business done,'' White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said. ``And that's exactly what today's meeting was 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding almost the identical theme was Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to work together, hopefully across the party lines  
in the Congress and with the administration, to do what the 
American people expect of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and House Hastert, however, declined several opportunities  
to say they trust Clinton. When the impeachment trial ended Feb. 12 
with Clinton's acquittal in the Senate on perjury and obstruction 
of justice charges in the Monica Lewinsky affair, Lott questioned 
whether he could trust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is, will we work together to get our job done? That  
is the real issue,'' Lott said Tuesday in parrying the question. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hastert: ``We are starting to work to put together ideas,  
and that's the first step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue also came up inside the 80-minute meeting, said aides  
from both parties who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	They said Lott and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,  
told Clinton that overhauling Social Security and Medicare are so 
politically sensitive that Republicans would first have to believe 
Democrats would not use them against the GOP in next year's 
elections. Democrats have often accused Republican candidates of 
endangering the two programs, which serve tens of millions of 
elderly voters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hint of disputes to come, Clinton insisted that lawmakers  
reserve 77 percent of anticipated future budget surpluses to 
bolster Social Security and Medicare, participants said. 
Republicans have broadly agreed to dedicate 62 percent of the 
projected surpluses for Social Security, but want to use much or 
most of the rest for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton said 23 percent of the surpluses could be used for  
tax cuts, education and other domestic initiatives, Lott said that 
would squeeze the GOP's tax cut plans too tightly, said aides from 
both parties. Overall, surpluses are projected to total about $2.5 
trillion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders at the meeting indicated they backed  
Clinton's insistence on setting aside 77 percent of the surplus for 
Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it is the threshold decision,'' said House Minority  
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Upstaged on First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- On his first day with the Los Angeles  
Lakers, Denis Rodman was actually upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
	It took the firing of coach Del Harris to push the flamboyant,  
controversial Rodman into the background. 
</P>
<P>
	``Already problems,'' Rodman joked during a Forum news  
conference. ``Since the coaching job is vacant, maybe I should be 
coach. Wouldn't that be something? I'd come out there with a 
pimp-daddy hat. That would be groovy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who finally signed a contract with the Lakers on  
Tuesday, showed up for a voluntary practice Wednesday at the Forum, 
but met only a few of his teammates. Harris, in what may have been 
his last official act as coach, gave the regulars the day off. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal, who had pushed for the Lakers to sign Rodman,  
was at the Forum, but remained in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was critical of O'Neal and other Lakers earlier in the  
week, and Rodman was asked what the Lakers center said to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no hard feelings. Guys know my dedication. He just  
said, `Welcome to the team,''' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Rodman again began listing the Lakers' shortcomings.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to know what your role is, and I think I lot of guys  
don't know that, especially this team. ... These guys don't know 
the game of basketball,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you've been in the NBA two or three years, you shouldn't  
whine and complain what somebody else is doing or not doing, not 
when you're making $12-$13 million a year. There's no cohesion, no 
love between the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really don't have any connection. They get the ball down  
low, then nobody is trying to do anything more. They've got to 
learn. If they don't, we'll probably get knocked out in the first 
round of the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who got three NBA championship rings with Michael Jordan  
and the Bulls, added, ``They need to learn to go out there with 
that look, like we had in Chicago. I will instill some basketball 
knowledge and the toughness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he doesn't believe he'll play Thursday night, when  
the Lakers meet the Los Angeles Clippers in Anaheim, instead saying 
he expects to make his debut with the Lakers on Friday night at the 
Forum in a rematch of the LA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also reiterated he's in good physical shape and ready to  
contribute right away. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Kurt Rambis believes Rodman will make a big  
difference to the slumping Lakers, who have lost three straight 
games to fall to 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands the game of basketball,'' Rambis said. ``He  
picked up our plays just like that. He knows what we want him to 
do. We didn't have to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we saw today, he was nothing but excellent. He was  
excellent on the basketball court and off the basketball court. He 
brings a lot to the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said he had been looking forward to coaching Rodman.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't realize what Dennis Rodman is going to bring to this  
team,'' Harris said. ``He's going to rebound; he's going to set 
picks; he's going to pass the ball and get on those who don't. I 
was all armed and ready to go, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the firing of Harris, Lakers executive Jerry West  
said Rambis or fellow assistant Larry Drew will be selected as 
coach in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed conservatively by his standards, Rodman wore a felt-like  
cap and T-shirt to the press conference. Asked what color his hair 
was under the cap, he said, ``It's in transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Might Rodman, who reportedly signed for one year for the $1  
million veterans' minimum pro-rated to less than $500,000 due to 
the abbreviated season and games he's missed, play longer for the 
Lakers? 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how far we get,'' he said. ``If we get to the  
Western Conference finals, or the NBA Finals, then I've done my job 
and it becomes more, `What are you going to do for me?'''

<HEADLINE> Two-Year World Cup Plan Fades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter backed off his  
controversial plan for a World Cup tournament every two years and 
said today the international soccer schedule needed to be 
reorganized before the idea could become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of soccer's world governing body met with the head of  
European soccer, Lennart Johansson, who has opposed the plan 
because it threatened the prominence of European competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, the president of UEFA, said he was still doubtful  
about the idea although he hadn't ruled it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``UEFA has not closed the door,'' he said. ``It still does not  
support the idea, but it has not closed the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, who had been pushing hard for a biennial World Cup,  
said adjusting the world schedule would take about 18 months and 
had to come first.

	``I'm going to present the idea to the executive committee,''  
Blatter said after meeting with Johansson, who opposed him last 
year for the FIFA presidency. ``They have a right to know what went 
on here. But I'm not going to take it to a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the international schedule was now the top item.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not withdrawn the idea of having a World Cup every two  
years, we have just put it in the backyard,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson said he and Blatter ``agreed we needed to talk about  
the calendar and to study it before addressing the idea of a World 
Cup every two years.''

<HEADLINE> London Shares Close at New High / British Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Buoyed by the Prime Minister Tony Blair's euro  
plans and a stream of strong company results, share prices surged 
to a record high Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 152.4  
points, or 2.4 percent, to 6,307.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisional volume was 999.2 million shares, compared with 922.4  
million shares Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The closing eclipsed the previous record of 6,179, set on July  
20, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts cited strong profits reported by top companies over the  
last two days, and the prospect of Britain joining the single 
European currency sooner rather than later, as suggested by the 
National Changeover Plan proposed Tuesday by Blair.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bulls Struggle Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The shots were falling, the United Center was  
rocking and, for a while at least, it looked a lot like the good 
old days for the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Then reality came calling. A couple of untimely misses, a  
no-call and the buzzer was sounding on yet another loss for the 
team formerly known as the NBA champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a few chances. More than one chance,'' Toni Kukoc said  
after Chicago rallied from 13 down Tuesday only to fall 90-88 to 
Milwaukee. ``We're all disappointed at how we ended the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Chicago was going to be bad this year was a given. With  
Michael Jordan retired, Scottie Pippen shipped to Houston and 
Dennis Rodman staging yet another drama, the Bulls went from 
six-time champions to an expansion team in about the time it takes 
to say ``fire sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've already put together a seven-game losing streak. They  
tied the franchise low in points scored in an embarrassing 79-63 
loss at New York on Sunday -- their one game on NBC this season. 
They're 2-9 for the first time since 1976-77, way back when Jordan 
was a skinny teen-ager with hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Charlotte (1-7) and the L.A. Clippers (0-8) have worse  
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it is kind of hard to deal with,'' said Dickey  
Simpkins, one of just five players left from last year's playoff 
roster. ``To lose as many games as we have in a row is tough 
considering last year. But we still keep in mind it's going to take 
us time to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago has its poor shooting to thank for many of its problems.  
The Bulls are shooting 38 percent from the field, worst in the NBA. 
Their scoring average of 79 points is also a league low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls are sticking with their famed triangle offense, but  
the newcomers are still having trouble grasping it. Mark Bryant, 
who scored a season-high 16 points against Atlanta on Monday and 
matched it Tuesday against Milwaukee, said he'd been thinking too 
much and trying too hard in earlier games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to think early on when they're learning and  
sometimes you don't play as instinctively when you're going through 
that,'' coach Tim Floyd said. ``Every day they make progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toughest part may be Chicago's woes at home. The United  
Center used to be the toughest place in the NBA to play, with the 
Bulls never losing more than two games in a row at home before this 
season. Even when Jordan was off playing baseball, the Bulls never 
let anyone make themselves at home in their house. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chicago has now lost five straight at the UC -- one more home  
loss than the 1995-96 and 1996-97 Bulls had combined. The Clippers 
are the only other team still looking for a victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're frustrated,'' Brent Barry said. ``We're real hungry. We  
just want to win one at home. We've got another one Thursday, so 
we're going to come out real hungry again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For as bad as the Bulls have been, though, they've also shown  
flashes of respectability. No, they're not going to be a playoff 
team anytime soon and Chicago is going to have to find another 
excuse to party in Grant Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've managed to hang in there. They gave Utah more of a  
game than anyone expected in the season opening rematch of the NBA 
Finals before finally falling 104-96. They lost to Washington by 
one basket. They beat Atlanta on Monday night, though the Hawks 
were playing without Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Milwaukee, the Bulls had a chance to win, but Kukoc  
missed a 3-pointer with 11 seconds to go. Then Randy Brown tripped 
on a Glenn Robinson pick that he thought was an offensive foul, and 
Robinson went in for the easy, game-winning dunk with four seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been playing tough games all year, they've just not  
had much basketball luck,'' Milwaukee coach George Karl said. 
``They're going to get better every game and they're going to win 
some of these games.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Unions Target Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Add another name to the growing list of  
adversaries going after the tobacco industry in court: unions suing 
for nearly $2 billion to recover the medical costs of treating 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Already taxed heavily, sued vigorously and targeted by President  
Clinton, Big Tobacco is facing this new opponent this week in U.S. 
District Court in Akron, Ohio -- the first of more than a dozen 
similar lawsuits by health plans to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming two weeks after a $51.5 million verdict against Philip  
Morris in California and several months after a $246 billion 
settlement with the 50 states, it raises the question: How much can 
the industry take before the gouges start leaving permanent damage? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody suggests the industry is ready to crumble. While  
cigarette company stocks are way down, the two biggest players, 
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco are involved in far more businesses 
than just tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't call it Big Tobacco for nothing. It's not on its  
knees yet,'' said Carl Bogus, a product-liability expert at Roger 
Williams University in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 Ohio labor union trust funds that joined the  
class-action suit join a litigant list that is spreading beyond 
smokers to health plans that are seeking seeking damages for 
smoking's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The union lawsuit, filed in May 1997, claims tobacco companies  
advertised heavily using Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man because 
they knew such images influence less-educated blue-collar workers 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing illegal about that, the companies contend; it's simply  
advertising. However, one defendant, the Liggett Group Inc., an 
industry maverick, settled and plans to cooperate with the unions' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs against cigarette manufacturers have run the gamut:  
flight attendants; the nations of Guatemala, Panama and Bolivia; a 
pediatrician with emphysema who is the lead plaintiff in a $200 
billion class-action suit filed on behalf of all Florida smokers. 
And now Clinton has threatened to sue tobacco companies to recover 
smoking-related Medicare expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is under siege,'' Paul Patton, the governor of  
the tobacco-growing state of Kentucky, said last month. ``There's a 
limit to what this product can bear, and we're coming close to that 
limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union plans like Ohio's -- and any suits on behalf of Medicare --  
form another ring of plaintiffs. One name for them: ``secondhand 
entities,'' organizations or governments that claim financial 
damage rather than individuals who are sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine union cases have been thrown out. In one last year, a  
federal judge in Florida -- calling the claims too far away from the 
people actually damaged -- said the tobacco industry had become 
``the whipping boy of American political discourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These claims are too remote. They've been a resounding  
failure,'' said Steven Rissman, assistant general counsel for 
Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Akron is certainly an aberration,'' he said. ``We're not  
concerned about floodgates. This one has slipped through the 
cracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, a victory for the Ohio plaintiffs ``would clearly  
break new ground,'' said Richard Daynard, chairman of the 
anti-cigarette Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Because last year's settlement with the state attorneys general  
immunized the companies from individual states' lawsuits, he said, 
many believed the industry ``would be basically home free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now apparent that they're far from it,'' Daynard said.  
``If they settle this, they're in very bad shape,'' because 
``presumably you have other health-care providers in the wings. If 
they lose, they're in even worse shape because they've proven to 
people there's no reason these suits can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helping future litigants are industry documents made public in  
earlier cases, including in-house research dating to the 1950s that 
links smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits alleging financial rather than personal damage are more  
about economics than justice, says Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton 
University health economist. He calls the union suits ``a 
profitable roulette game'' but says it won't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, the judicial system is probably going to put a  
stop to it. Because they'll say they're killing an industry,'' 
Reinhardt said.

	stock quotes graf, additional analysts  


</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst with Solomon Smith Barney,  
acknowledges the high-profile cases -- and the internal documents 
they've dislodged -- can depress value and scare investors. But he's 
hardly staying away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big settlements encourage the plaintiff bar to seek further  
ways of profiting from the tobacco pot,'' Feldman said. ``But at 
the end of the day, they face an industry that's well-funded and 
substantially has the law on its side.''

</P>
<P>
	It was Wilstein's 17th APSE writing award since 1988.

trades, such as Kevin Brown's $100 million contract with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, and a profile of Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner.

follow,'' Walker said. ``On Steinbrenner, he did a nice job of 
putting him in perspective.''

<P>
	Dahlberg was runner-up for stories that included the final round

family differences. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes for Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he was to  
blame for reporters asking questions that seem out of place at his 
news conferences with foreign leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really my fault because I don't let them ask me enough  
questions on other occasions, so I'm forcing them to use this 
opportunity to pepper me,'' Clinton said at a news conference with 
President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize,'' the president said. Predictably, most of the  
questions from the U.S. press dealt with subjects other than 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has not held a full-scale news conference since last  
July 3 when he took questions from reporters in Hong Kong. The only 
other opportunities to ask questions have been the abbreviated news 
conferences with foreign leaders, except for quick photo 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings said he had been warned in advance that American  
reporters would probably ask about domestic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton would do  
another limited press conference with Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema next week. After that, Clinton plans to hold a 
full-scale news conference in the middle of March and then set a 
target of meeting with reporters about every six weeks to two 
months, Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Stabler To Call Alabama Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Ken Stabler, who returned to his alma  
mater last season as the color analyst for Alabama football games, 
signed a three-year contract extension Wednesday with The Crimson 
Tide Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabler, an All-American quarterback for the Tide known as ``The  
Snake,'' debuted last season on the network. He originally signed 
on for just one season, partly because he wasn't sure how well he'd 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than I expected, more fun than I expected,'' he  
said. ``It was a pleasure to be back, to be at Alabama football 
games and be able to bring my children. It was a very positive 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stabler is teamed in the booth with Eli Gold, who is entering  
his 11th year as Alabama's play-by-play man. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials announced Stabler's contract extension during a  
press conference, but declined to say beforehand what the 
announcement would be. That led fans across the state to speculate 
Gold might be leaving Alabama to concentrate on his NASCAR 
broadcasting career. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Henry, general manager of Crimson Tide Sports Marketing,  
said that was a sign of the popularity of Alabama's broadcasting 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably have the two most recognized voices in the South  
on our radio network,'' Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabler said he agreed to the contract extension because of how  
much he enjoyed being part of Alabama football again, as well as 
his belief the program is headed in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no patience in this business, but you have to be with  
this Alabama team because time is in Alabama's favor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stabler said he learned quickly how to balance his love for  
Alabama and his need for impartiality in the radio booth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold said his counterpart adapted well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We just clicked immediately,'' he said. ``He's taken snaps and  
I've never been under center before, so he can add something that I 
am not able to.''

<HEADLINE> Government Questions Microsoft Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Another videotape presentation by Microsoft  
Corp. was questioned by the government during the antitrust trial 
against the computer software company. 
</P>
<P>
	The video was intended to demonstrate the apparent ease computer  
makers have in customizing their desktop, the first screen a user 
sees after turning on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft played the video in court before the government  
cross-examined the software maker's latest witness, Joachim Kempin. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department attorney David Boies immediately questioned a  
segment of the tape that featured the startup sequence for Compaq 
Computer Corp., the world's largest computer maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies got Kempin, the senior Microsoft executive responsible for  
the company's business deals with computer makers, to admit that 
two videotapes were made. The tape played in court Wednesday 
featured on the desktop an icon for Netscape's Internet browser, 
which competes with the one made by Microsoft. Kempin acknowledged, 
however, that the tape originally prepared for court and filmed 
last November lacked a Netscape icon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It basically shows how quick this industry changes,'' Kempin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies said the omission illustrated the impact on computer  
makers of Microsoft's restrictive contract licenses. The government 
has alleged those restrictions illegally hurt Netscape, Microsoft's 
primary Internet software rival. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written testimony submitted to court earlier in the week,  
Kempin has argued that Microsoft allows computer makers to install 
whatever rival software they choose and to make it easily 
accessible for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies was to resume his cross-examination of Kempin today.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, a Microsoft engineer rejected as ``completely  
unfounded'' claims that it tried to sabotage multimedia software 
made by Apple Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Engstrom also argued forcefully that proposals to cooperate  
with Apple on Internet video and audio software stemmed from 
Microsoft's desire to help frustrated customers, not from a desire 
to eliminate competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft encouraged Apple to adopt  
its own proprietary technologies, which would have required Apple's 
Quicktime customers also to use Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple executive Avadis Tevanian testified previously in the  
trial that Microsoft designed parts of Windows to bypass Quicktime 
and created misleading error messages. 
</P>
<P>
	But Engstrom said Microsoft blamed the problem on Apple's own  
faulty software, an explanation verified by some independent 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing to me that Dr. Tevanian could come in here and  
make the claim that we sabotage Quicktime,'' Engstrom said. ``At 
Microsoft, our company would never do anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Studies Paul Robeson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The towering figure of Paul Robeson cast an  
oddly diminished shadow for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Robeson's rich, rumbling bass sounded as deep as the  
Mississippi. It was ``the voice of the century,'' as one biographer 
put it. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an all-American football player, Phi Beta Kappa scholar,  
attorney, author and stage and film actor. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also an activist whose commitment to black and radical  
causes earned him the enmity of his own country and turned him from 
one of the most widely admired Americans into one of the most 
despised. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Robeson's punishment was historical obscurity. Any  
scant attention inevitably was marked by willful misinterpretation, 
according to his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prescribed spin was, 'Too bad he got so political, strayed  
away from the interests of his own people. Great artist, 
well-meaning guy, but tragic victim of his own political 
misjudgment,' '' said Paul Robeson Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 100th anniversary of the artist's birth last year  
brought new attention to Robeson that continues with a PBS 
documentary as complex as the man himself -- and, at two hours, 
barely long enough to contain this remarkable life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul Robeson: Here I Stand,'' debuting 9 p.m. EST Wednesday as  
part of WNET's ``American Masters'' series, paints a respectful but 
honest picture of Robeson, whose brilliance and passion made him 
seem superhuman, but who had his share of human frailties. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary allows us to meet him firsthand -- through news  
clips, movies and songs -- and through his friends and detractors, 
and to weigh him for ourselves. Rare film and documents amassed by 
Robeson Jr. add invaluable depth. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first film that gives Paul Robeson the floor to be  
himself, without any filter. Here he comes on civil rights, on 
communism -- warts and all by the way,'' his son said in an 
interview. ``There are people on camera who are highly critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most compelling, of course, is the charismatic Robeson himself,  
whether singing what became his trademark song, ``Ol' Man River,'' 
explaining his acclaimed interpretation of the title role in 
``Othello'' or staking out his philosophical turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``The artist has to fight for freedom or slavery. I have made my  
choice,'' he said in a 1937 speech. It was a bruising battle that 
claimed payment in money, freedom and health, but which engaged him 
nearly until his death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandson of a slave and son of a minister, Robeson was born  
April 9,1898, in Princeton, N.J. He won an academic scholarship to 
Rutgers University and lettered in baseball, basketball, football 
and track. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from Columbia Law School and running headfirst  
into the limitations imposed on a black attorney, he began to 
explore his creative gifts. He was encouraged by his ambitious and 
devoted wife, writer-anthropologist Eslanda Goode. 
</P>
<P>
	Robeson became, in short order, a cultural sensation.  
</P>
<P>
	He earned acclaim for his stage work, including Eugene O'Neill's  
``The Emperor Jones,'' while his recordings of popular and folk 
songs, spirituals and classical music made him the equivalent of a 
modern-day superstar. 
</P>
<P>
	His movies often abused his dignity and talent, turning him into  
a cartoon African or a naif, and drawing criticism from black 
leaders like Marcus Garvey. There were exceptions, largely the 
so-called ``race'' films made for black theaters and black 
audiences, in which Robeson portrayed intelligent, realistic and 
dynamic characters. Robeson's charm shone through both the good and 
the bad films, and he became a box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a splash abroad with concert tours, musicals and plays,  
including his critically praised ``Othello.'' And he gained a 
global political view as he was exposed to the labor struggles of 
Welsh miners and colonial oppression in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1934 trip to the Soviet Union proved most influential.  
</P>
<P>
	``Here, for the first time, I am treated as a full human being.  
I walk in full human dignity. You cannot imagine what that means to 
me as a Negro,'' Robeson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus began a lifelong support of communism and socialism that  
made him the target of protests as well as investigations by the 
U.S. Department of State and the FBI. The protests and probes 
effectively buried his career for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the white elite, he was 'our special Negro.' They were  
outraged that 'our Negro would turn against us,' '' said his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Robeson never was officially a Communist Party member, but  
believed communist nations offered a bulwark against race and class 
oppression, said Robeson Jr. He continued to support the Soviet 
Union even after Stalin's murderous tyranny was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That decision was based on the question of what's the main  
enemy: the right wing of the United States or Stalinism, communism, 
Maoism. ... One can argue whether my father was right or wrong, but 
it was a conscious choice in the interest of the progressive world, 
of African Americans,'' Robeson Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
	His political battles were made fiercer by his race.  
</P>
<P>
	``The real Robeson image is the most powerful African American  
male image of this century, and perhaps ever. .... And this is what 
the establishment found threatening. The politics was significant 
but secondary,'' said his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had he been white ..., it wouldn't have had the same power,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However Robeson's politics are judged, his extraordinary  
personal journey is moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tote that barge, lift that bale; get a little drunk and you  
land in jail. .... I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin','' are 
the ``Ol' Man River'' lyrics Robeson sang early in his career. But 
the tune changed when he did, the documentary shows us. 
</P>
<P>
	``You show a little grit and you land in jail,'' an older  
Robeson sang in concert, altering the original Oscar Hammerstein 
lyrics to express something of his own defiance. ``I keep laughing 
instead of crying. I must keep fighting until I'm dying. And ol' 
man river, he just keeps rolling along.''

<HEADLINE> Phillips Tries To Rebuild Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips, whose NFL career  
short-circuited after two seasons, will try again this summer in 
NFL-Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the troubled running back from Nebraska who was the  
sixth overall pick in the 1996 draft, was chosen in the 10th round 
of Tuesday's NFL Europe draft by the Barcelona Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was released four days into training camp last summer  
by the Miami Dolphins, where he landed in 1997 after being released 
by the St. Louis Rams. That came four weeks after his latest brush 
with the law, one that resulted in six months probation after a 
confrontation with a woman in a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	His 19 months in St. Louis were marked by three arrests and 23  
days in jail for violating probation after a drunken-driving arrest 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips gained 632 yards as a rookie and 633 yards before being  
released in November after he regularly missing meetings. In two 
years, he averaged just 3.3 yards per carry during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has been a controversial figure since his college days.  
</P>
<P>
	He was considered a Heisman Trophy contender as a junior, but  
was suspended two games into the 1995 season after he pleaded no 
contest to assaulting a former girlfriend. He was reinstated for 
the Fiesta Bowl, then skipped his senior season with the 
Cornhuskers to turn pro.

<HEADLINE> US Senators Consider Punishing IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - Senators are looking at ways to financially  
punish the International Olympic Committee if the organization does 
not clean up its operations, a congressional aide says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Commerce Committee Chairman John  
McCain, R-Ariz., expect to decide Thursday whether to hold hearings 
next week on possible sanctions against the IOC, according to 
Trevor McCabe, Stevens' legislative director. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens is looking at several options to force change in the  
aftermath of the corruption scandal surrounding the 2002 games in 
Salt Lake City, McCabe said. The options under consideration 
include taking away or limiting the IOC's tax-exempt status and the 
revenue it earns from broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move could cripple the committee, since the United States  
is home to nine of the IOC's 11 worldwide sponsors. Each pays $40 
million to $50 million every four years.

<HEADLINE> Tom Wolfe, Tangled Up in White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white suit is not your everyday suit.  
</P>
<P>
	Don't touch, the slightest blemish can't be hid. Dry cleaning?  
It may cost more than the suit. And there's the style itself: 
elegant or shout-out-loud, few can pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Tom Wolfe. He's been wearing white suits for about 30  
years, whether day or night. When he's at his summer beach house, 
he leaves the suit behind, but still wears white from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
	He has other clothing -- ``I do not live in white suits,'' he  
says. But white suits are clearly, certifiably, unmistakably his 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since his first real fame in the early 1960s (chronicling  
the nation's countercultures, from the bell-bottomed drug scene to 
surf-crazed Californians and on to astronauts and Wall Street 
bankers, all while taking potshots at literary bastions like The 
New Yorker), Wolfe has had this thing for white suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's a novelist, writing huge epics of life-as-we-live-it.  
On the back flap of ``A Man in Full,'' his new 742-page best seller 
-- there he is, resplendently attired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dress tells other people how you want to be treated. And what  
you expect,'' he says one windy winter day, wearing -- what else? -- 
a three-piece suit of cream white and razor-sharp lapels, shoes 
capped heel and toe in black, a watch fob in the vest pocket. 
``It's amazing to what extent people will grant your implicit 
request.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the look of a throwback, a dandy, a star. Formal, a touch  
Southern, clean to the point of untouchable. Cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``One does not dress like this unless one wants people to stare.  
What does he want people to stare at?'' says Tibor Kalman, who, as 
a designer, toys with the images that people and products present 
to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe is still thin at 68, his hairstyle unchanged from a photo  
on the mantel taken decades ago. His ears are big for his head. He 
is soft-spoken -- nothing like the hammered attack of his writing, 
though the carefully chosen phrases are almost as precise. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe considers the suits, then offers this explanation: ``I  
guess you could say advertisement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tries again: ``Mark Twain had also worn white suits,  
particularly toward the end of his career. I think he had white 
tails, everything. He was asked about it by a reporter. He said, `I 
would never want to be conspicuous. On the other hand I don't 
terribly object to being noticed.' That probably sums it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tells a 37-year-old story: How he came to New York in 1962  
with a white suit too heavy for the summer and wore it in the fall 
despite the old saw that such suits are only to be seen between 
Memorial Day and Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just annoyed people terribly,'' he says and smiles, as if  
that explains everything. (His first white suit, however, was worn 
when he went to Cuba for the Washington Post. And he recalls the 
details of his father's white suit down to its pleats and belt.) 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe has honed his nuisance to an art. He chooses from among  
``about nine'' white suits, all custom-made by the same tailor down 
Madison Avenue from his Upper East Side home overlooking Central 
Park. At one time, he had 15 or so, all white and bright. 
</P>
<P>
	But white is unforgiving. Even with excellent care (``you have  
to find good cleaners''), the suits last only about five or six 
years. ``These suits, over time, are going to become more and more 
yellow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he throws them away. They do cost upward of $3,500  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're like police horses, they've been through too much to  
be sent off to the knackers plant,'' he says. They are still put to 
use -- in the closet, as padding on hangers below the new suits, the 
ones that get seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really the way to care for a suit, to have a great big  
wooden hanger and another jacket below. It just keeps its shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the ties -- never bow, always tied  
four-in-hand. Shoes -- 20 pairs or so. Canes -- he's sporting one 
made from the vertebrae of an animal. And bowlers, straw hats, 
fedoras. 
</P>
<P>
	Style, obviously, is important. Wolfe winces at the clothes  
people wear on the street. He would never wear his only pair of 
jeans in public (they're punishment, to be worn when he's racing 
for a deadline and can't leave his writing desk), and takes pride 
in criticism that in his novels, clothing serves as insight into 
character. Clothing is character, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who say that they don't care about such things are the  
ones who do the most. Except they're not dressing to stand out, but 
to fit in.'' On his windowsill are busts of Balzac, the prolific 
chronicler of 19th-century France, and Twain -- the white-suited 
satirist of American 19th-century life. 
</P>
<P>
	Are the suits, as he jokes, a plea for attention? Or the  
opposite -- a way to mask the REAL Tom Wolfe, to hide the details? 
The Virginia upbringing. The Yale education. The wife and two kids. 
The Jack Russell terrier named Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit of a contradiction,'' a detached observer  
who refuses to blend in, says Mark Edmundson, an English professor 
at the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfe considers that and tells another story -- a day in the  
mid-1960s when he left the white suits behind. He tried to dress as 
he thought a race car fan at the track might look: green tweed, 
brown suede shoes, fedora. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't go over. People wouldn't open up to that Tom Wolfe. He  
was losing the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the message. I wasn't fitting in and it wasn't like I  
was going to fit in.'' He took that lesson to heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to fit in can be a trap. ... If you think you're hip,  
you're fitting in, you can't ask those questions'' so necessary to 
report and observe. So he dressed as he felt comfortable, white 
suits and all, regardless of whether others might see it as 
bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must be more like the man from Mars. `The man from Mars is  
here and he doesn't know what's going on, and he wishes somebody 
would fill him in.' People are filled with information and they 
love to tell you things you don't know,'' he said. ``Never again 
did I ever try to fit in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the white suits remained, multiplying in Wolfe's closets as  
his literary stature grew. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a look inside that closet?  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Wolfe -- the writer who gets so close to his characters that  
readers can hear the spiteful thoughts of the surfers in ``The Pump 
House Gang'' and smell the sweat of Charlie Croker in ``The Man in 
Full'' -- smiles and says no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never open my closet to the press.''

<HEADLINE> Low Demand Sinks Grains, Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the  
Chicago Board of Trade Wednesday amid indications that demand will 
continue to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans tumbled to new lows amid reports that buyers of palm  
oil and Brazilian soybean oil had canceled shipments. That was taken 
as an indication that demand for U.S. products will not pick up some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybean prices already had been pummeled to their lowest levels  
in more than 12 years on expectations that demand from Asia region 
will remain low throughout 1999. Big crops anticipated in Argentina 
and Brazil also affected prices. 
</P>
<P>
        Even more vexing to traders are forecasts for American farmers  
to plant record soybean acreage this spring. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat sank as market participants eyed extremely low prices  
offered by competing French exporters for an Egyptian purchase. That 
reinforced views that prices must go much lower to stimulate demand 
for exports. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures retreated in sympathy with the plunging wheat  
and soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.44 1/4 a bushel;  
March oats fell 6 1/4 cents to $2.08 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 
1 3/4 cents to $1.00 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 16 1/2 cents 
to $4.57 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        April live cattle fell .17 cent to 67.45 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .40 cent to 73.57 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell 1.83 cents to 43.42 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell 1.95 
cents to 50.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Faces Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The law that empowered Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr is due for at least a major overhaul and many 
lawmakers from both parties are questioning whether the statute is 
needed at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``The burden of persuasion rests with those who want to retain  
the statute,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., as he opened a 
hearing into whether the law should be extended beyond its June 30 
expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has few fans on Capitol Hill. Republicans have opposed  
it since it was enacted by a Democratic Congress in 1978. Many 
Democrats soured on the statute during Starr's five-year 
investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've either got to fix it or drop it and look for another  
mechanism,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a principal author of 
the 1978 statute that was supposed to take the politics out of 
investigating high-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of today's hearing, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of  
Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the Governmental Affairs 
Committee, appealed for a dispassionate examination of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can let go of the anger and passions that have  
consumed the Congress in recent times,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two senators, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn.,  
said Tuesday that the law should simply be allowed to expire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the law's problems, said Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who  
chairs the committee, are the tendency of prosecutors under public 
pressure to deliver a ``rougher justice'' to some officials, and to 
get ``more involved in the impeachment process'' than is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on whether he was referring to Starr's probe of Clinton  
specifically, Thompson declined to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the panel's ranking  
Democrat, is one of the few lawmakers willing to give change a try. 
But even he admits having no ideas how to accomplish that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have more questions than answers,'' Lieberman said this week  
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The original 1978 law was spawned by Watergate. It requires the  
attorney general to seek the appointment of an independent counsel 
when there is substantial and credible evidence of a crime by any 
one of 49 top federal officials, including the president. A panel 
of three federal judges then picks a lawyer for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor has an unlimited budget to hire aides and  
investigate his target -- a frequent point of criticism. Starr has 
spent nearly $50 million on the Clinton investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	With approval from the attorney general and the appointing  
judges, the independent counsel can broaden investigations far 
beyond the original mandate, another target of the law's critics. 
Starr's mandate, for example, began with inquiries into Clinton's 
land deals and widened repeatedly, finally to the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal that led to his impeachment and trial. The Senate acquitted 
Clinton Feb. 12 on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress' frosty regard for the law began when Starr was  
still on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the 1980s. 
Republicans were the first to complain of the law's abuse during 
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's seven-year Iran-Contra 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy prompted Congress to let the law lapse for 18  
months during the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, it was Clinton who successfully campaigned for the  
law's renewal in 1994. Two years ago, already under investigation 
by Starr, Clinton said that the law's costs had outweighed the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters Tuesday  
that ``there seems to be a bipartisan consensus that the 
independent counsel statute, as written, needs a very serious look 
and some reforms if it's to be reauthorized. ... We agree with that 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what kind of reforms, he said: ``We haven't come to any  
firm conclusions here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Deputy U.S. Attorney Eric Holder told reporters that  
the Justice Department also wants Congress to ``tinker'' with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees plan to hold hearings that could  
last well into the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as they prepared to get under way, Starr's role was an  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said Starr probably won't appear before his committee  
before April. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an effort to keep the proceedings from becoming a  
referendum on Starr, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., who will head the 
House subcommittee hearings on the law, has refused to invite 
Starr.

<HEADLINE>  Ghana Seeks U.S. Aid for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he supports a  
move by the Ghanaian parliament to extend dual citizenship to black 
American descendants of African slaves. ``I thought it was a rather 
clever idea myself,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference with Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings,  
Clinton said he would not block black Americans who seek to accept 
Ghana's offer. Americans can hold dual citizenship with some other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ghana does this, it certainly won't hurt in trying to get  
more Americans interested in Ghana, going to Ghana and contributing 
to Ghana's future,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings said his parliament soon would vote on a bill to grant  
dual citizenship to black Americans, as a gesture of good will over 
its past as a slavery port. He seemed irked when a reporter asked 
why his country was making the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``My continent is the mother not of all continents, but humanity  
today,'' Rawlings said. ``There is no reason why I would deny my 
fellow black African the right to enjoy the same citizenship that I 
enjoy as an African.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders spoke after a midday meeting at the White House.  
Clinton emerged from that session saying he would support 
``whatever necessary force'' is required to ensure peace in Congo, 
which has been seized for months by civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have a stake in the resolution of the problems of the  
Congo,'' Clinton said. ``I was hoping we could avoid the bad year 
we've had in the Congo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's remarks came a day after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi  
Annan said U.N. peacekeepers probably will be necessary in the 
former Zaire if a settlement is negotiated there. But Annan said 
American troops likely would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Clinton did not commit to the idea of offering soldiers,  
but said the United States would take part, if asked, in ``an 
internationally recognized'' peacekeeping effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly would do my best to support whatever necessary  
force to ensure the peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese  
soldiers and opposition politicians took up arms in August, 
accusing President Laurent Kabila of misrule, corruption and sowing 
ethnic hatred. Backed with troops and armor from Rwanda and Uganda, 
they have advanced through Congo's eastern half, fighting 
government troops and Kabila's allies from Zimbabwe, Angola, 
Namibia and Chad. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings said assistance from the United Nations would be  
helpful in peacekeeping, and he would be willing to lend troops to 
such a force. But he said other countries may have to contribute as 
well, because African nations are struggling under the burden of 
responding to conflict in other parts of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our resources are stretched to the very limit,'' Rawlings  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States has provided more than $75  
million in humanitarian assistance to refugees and victims of 
violence in Africa over the past 18 months. He said he would like 
to increase the U.S. contribution to ECOMOG, a West African 
peacekeeping force, ``and I hope Congress will support my proposal 
to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton praised the trade relationship of ``mutual respect and  
mutual benefit'' that is developing between the United States and 
Ghana, and cheered Ghana's participation in peacekeeping efforts in 
Lebanon and Bosnia, as well as the all-African forces now working 
in Liberia and Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the words of the black intellectual W.E.B. DuBois, who  
maintained dual U.S.-Ghanaian citizenship, that ``the difference 
between 100 and 1,000 years is less than you might think'' when 
change that once seemed painfully slow finally begins to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something else of far-reaching importance is happening in  
Africa,'' Clinton said. ``You are doing so much of what must be 
done. It will live eternally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rawlings said even though poverty and war are on the decline  
in Africa, they cannot be completely erased without a greater 
commitment from the United States. Many struggling African nations 
need debt relief, as well as help in resolving ``tragic strife'' 
that hinders U.S. business investment in Africa, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here, on behalf of my fellow citizens from this  
continent, to invite America to join us to put an end to hunger, 
deprivation, starvation and conflict on my continent,'' Rawlings 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton greeted Rawlings in freezing temperatures on the White  
House South Lawn. Rawlings, bundled in a heavy gray overcoat, joked 
that he appreciated the cold -- especially after Clinton received 
``the treat of the African sauna bath'' when he arrived in Ghana in 
102-degree weather in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get the feel of the air-conditioned atmosphere of  
the American weather,'' Rawlings said. ``So, ladies and gentlemen, 
here I am with you, and enjoying your weather, even if you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was the first American president ever to visit Ghana. He  
was met by 500,000 people there, the largest crowd of his 
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Competitors Subpoenaed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge is allowing Microsoft to  
subpoena documents from America Online, Netscape and Sun 
Microsystems about AOL's proposed purchase of Netscape for $4.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Tuesday the papers are ``extremely relevant'' to  
its defense of government antitrust charges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the  
antitrust case and has expressed unease about AOL's pending 
purchase of Netscape, agreed to Microsoft's demands for the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the AOL-Netscape deal announced last November, Sun  
would distribute Netscape's business-level software in exchange for 
AOL's purchase of Sun's powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it is seeking documents related to the purchase  
and its potential impact on online services, Internet software, 
computer operating systems and other technology platforms and Web 
sites called ``portals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online, the world's largest Internet provider with more  
than 16 million subscribers, would become owner of two of the four 
most popular such ``portal'' sites on the Web if the sale is 
approved by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would become owner of Netscape's popular Internet  
browser software, which competes with Microsoft's Internet Explorer 
browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun developed a new technology, called ``Java'' that lets  
consumers run software on a variety of operating systems other than 
Microsoft's Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``This deal is designed to really reshuffle and reshape this  
industry,'' Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said. ``This deal 
shows that competition in the marketplace will take care of 
consumers far better than government interference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to America Online and Netscape weren't immediately  
returned late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun spokeswoman Lisa Poulson acknowledged receiving Microsoft's  
subpoena demanding e-mails about Sun's contract with AOL and about 
whether the agreement might have an impact on the antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Poulson also said Microsoft wanted copies of any communications  
about the AOL deal among Sun and Apple Computer Inc., IBM Corp., 
Novell Inc. and Oracle Corp. She said Sun was negotiating the 
release of documents with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jackson said in December that AOL's purchase of Netscape  
``might be a very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has argued that the AOL-Netscape deal, announced after  
start of its antitrust trial, illustrates the viability of a 
computer industry that does not need government intervention to 
ensure competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a Microsoft executive acknowledged in trial testimony  
Tuesday that his company offered Netscape ``several inducements'' 
to stop competing in the Internet browser market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We offered them several inducements if they adopted several of  
our technologies,'' testified Dan Rosen, Microsoft's general 
manager for new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rosen has denied repeatedly that his company ever threatened  
Netscape. He said Microsoft simply tried to provide technological 
tools that would have allowed Netscape to make its Web browser 
compatible with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen is a key witness because he was present at a disputed June  
21, 1995 meeting between Netscape and Microsoft officials. The 
government claims Microsoft offered to split the Internet browser 
market with Netscape.

<HEADLINE> Nev.: Nuke Waste To Stay Around US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Nuclear waste would remain stored at 77  
sites around the country -- instead of at a temporary site in Nevada 
-- under a Clinton administration plan, the state's political 
leaders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the state's congressional delegation and Gov. Kenny  
Guinn said U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was expected to 
present the idea at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson had met earlier in the week with Guinn and Sens.  
Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn said Richardson would back the idea of dry-cask storage of  
such wastes at 77 sites throughout the nation where the wastes are 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Department spokesman Stu Nagurka had no comment late  
Wednesday about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid spokeswoman Jenny Backus said Reid was cautious ``but it  
looks pretty good. It would take Nevada from fighting two battles, 
on temporary storage and a permanent dump, to one battle on the 
permanent dump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy wants to create a permanent dump at  
Yucca Mountain, northeast of Las Vegas. Pending completion of that 
project, waste was to have been temporarily stored at the Nevada 
Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wendy Dixon, the Las Vegas-based manager of the Energy  
Department's environmental review for Yucca, said at an 
informational meeting Tuesday in Reno that the expected alternative 
of keeping the waste where it was generated was under strong 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The DOE effort to build the dump has been pushed heavily by the  
nuclear energy industry for several years and has been fought just 
as vigorously by Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yucca Mountain site is not expected to be available until at  
least 2010.

<HEADLINE> Magazine: Lewinsky Recalls Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky recalled feelings of terror  
during the past year and partly blames Linda Tripp for having made 
her feel suicidal, according to TV Guide interviews with the two 
journalists who have talked with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The former White House intern reportedly told Jon Snow of  
Britain's Channel Four her despondency in the aftermath of her 
relationship with President Clinton was partly the result of 
actions by Mrs. Tripp, who secretly recorded their telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Lewinsky) literally runs out of damnation for Tripp,''  
Snow says in the March 6 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	He and ABC News' Barbara Walters -- the only journalists to have  
interviewed Ms. Lewinsky -- spoke to the magazine about their 
separate interviews with her. 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release Tuesday, the magazine quotes Snow as saying  
Ms. Lewinsky disclosed the ``very specific moment when she did feel 
suicidal'' and said Mrs. Tripp contributed to her despair. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters, whose interview will air in a two-hour broadcast of  
``20/20'' on March 3, said she addressed allegations that Marcia 
Lewis condoned her daughter's relationship with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monica feels that her mother has been misportrayed. This is  
very painful for Monica,'' Walters says in the magazine. ``(Monica) 
could not have gotten through this year without her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' last week that the  
former intern became suicidal not merely as a result of Clinton 
``dumping her'' but out of fear he would learn she had confided to 
others about the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow's interview will air March 4 on Britain's Channel Four and  
in 32 other countries. TV Guide said the British station paid a 
``reported $600,000'' for the interview, and ABC paid nothing.

<HEADLINE> La. Tech To Play Florida State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State finally has a season  
opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles filled a void on their schedule Wednesday by  
announcing an Aug. 28 home game against Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally-televised game replaces a scheduled Sept. 2 bout  
with Auburn, which the Tigers canceled earlier this month at a 
$500,000 price. That game would have featured a matchup between 
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden and the team that ousted his son, 
Terry Bowden, as its coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The replacement game will display two of the nation's top  
returning quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay led the country in total offense  
last season, averaging 403.3 yards per game. With one of the 
country's top receivers, senior Troy Edwards, as Rattay's favorite 
target, the Bulldogs also compiled more offensive yards than any 
other Division I-A team. 
</P>
<P>
	A neck injury kept FSU quarterback Chris Weinke out of the  
Fiesta Bowl against Tennessee, but Weinke finished the season with 
a streak of 218 passes without an interception. He is expected to 
be ready to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's decision to pull out of the game left the Seminoles  
scrambling to find a quality opponent. The Tigers decided to open 
against Appalachian State, a Division I-AA team, but the Seminoles, 
considered a national title contender, wanted to play a Division 
I-A team to help their strength of schedule rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cooperation and assistance we received from our television  
partners, the Atlantic Coast Conference and the NCAA during this 
frantic process was very gratifying,'' FSU athletic director Dave 
Hart said in a statement. ``The chances of landing a Division I-A 
opponent and maintaining a broad base of television exposure were 
not very good going into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game will be broadcast on ESPN2 -- the Seminoles' fourth  
appearance on the network. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have played three times before, with Louisiana Tech  
winning two of them. Their last meeting was a 1988 Florida State 
victory in Tallahassee.

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Chair Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton accepted Wednesday  
an invitation to serve as honorary co-chairpersons of this summer's 
Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous honor for the Women's World Cup and the  
organizing committee,'' said Donna de Varona, the tournament's 
chairperson. ``The President and First Lady have always championed 
efforts to increase opportunities for women, and the Women's World 
Cup is truly a breakthrough event for women's athletics. We look 
forward to having the First Family share in the largest female 
sporting event in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament, in which the United States is one of the  
favorites, begins June 19 at East Rutherford, N.J., and concludes 
July 10 at Pasadena, Calif. The third Women's World Cup -- the 
United States won in 1991 and Norway is the defending champion -- 
will feature 16 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not known if the Clintons will attend any games.  
</P>
<P>
	Other venues for the games are Foxboro (Mass.) Stadium; Soldier  
Field in Chicago; Portland (Ore.) Civic Stadium; Spartan Stadium in 
San Jose and Stanford Stadium, both in California; and Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium in Landover, Md.

<HEADLINE> Biogenetic Treaty Plan Scuttled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Opposing an accord approved by more  
than 125 nations, the United States and five other countries 
scuttled efforts Wednesday to forge an environmental protection 
treaty on trade in genetically modified plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said it was protecting the world's food trade from  
potentially crippling regulatory burdens. But critics said it was 
doing the bidding of multinational businesses, whose 
laboratory-produced crops could one day sow ecological catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
	The breakdown after 10 days of talks marked the first time in  
more than 20 years that a major international environmental 
negotiation has concluded in disarray, said Michael Williams, 
spokesman for the U.N. Environmental Program. The negotiations are 
to resume within 16 months at an undetermined time and place. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union and more than 110 other nations at the  
U.N.-initiated talks agreed late Tuesday to forge a so-called 
Biosafety Protocol, an outgrowth of the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States, Australia, Canada, Uruguay, Argentina and  
Chile blocked the proposed compromise, which would have permitted 
nations to restrict imports not only of experimental organisms but 
also of genetically altered crops such as soy, corn, cotton and 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States has dominated these negotiations and they've  
now sabotaged them. They're obviously trying to force genetically 
modified food down the throats of consumers,'' charged Louise Gale, 
a spokeswoman for the environmental group Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, the world's main biotech exporter, wanted a  
narrowly focused treaty that ``protected the environment and yet 
avoided unduly restraining international trade'' in a rapidly 
growing mutibillion-dollar industry, said U.S. delegation chief 
Melinda Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
	Biotech products such as insect-resistant crops and vaccines  
born of gene-splicing are touted by proponents as guarantors of 
future global food security and improved human health. 
</P>
<P>
	They produce higher yields than traditionally crossbred hybrids  
with fewer chemical insecticides and herbicides. Their patents are 
mostly owned by a handful of companies -- from Monsanto of St. Louis 
to Novartis of Basel, Switzerland, who insist the products are 
rigorously tested and safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, however, worry about the possibility of still  
unfathomable and possibly catastrophic consequences if the products 
goes awry. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries want international safeguards to protect  
themselves against potential biogenetic disaster. They want biotech 
companies legally liable for any damage to biodiversity or human 
health -- another provision opposed by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Europeans also distrust genetically engineered products.  
Governments such as Austria and Luxembourg have banned certain 
biotech crops and regulations are widespread mandating the labeling 
of biogenetic food products for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although genetic engineering experimentation began two decades  
ago, development of biotech foods, vaccines and byproducts has only 
recently taken off. Worldwide, more than 67 million acres of 
genetically altered crops were sown in 1998, up from about 2 
million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, between 25 percent and 45 percent of some  
major crops are already genetically modified. Industry officials 
expect some 90 percent of U.S. agricultural exports to be 
biogenetic within a decade.

	The jury that found John William King guilty Tuesday of  
kidnapping and murdering James Byrd Jr. last June now must decide 
whether to sentence King to death. 
</P>
<P>
	As the punishment phase continued today, Dr. Edward Gripon told  
jurors that experts tend to base the predictions of future violence 
on two things. ``One is past history because it's the best way to 
predict,'' he said. ``The second is the sheer magnitude of some 
offense. Some are so extreme and so dramatic they remove all doubt 
what a person is capable of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gripon, who reviewed King's writings and photographs of his  
racist tattoos, saying the tattoos provided insight into the 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the reason was to make a statement, to make himself  
someone feared,'' Gripon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also testifying today was a Jasper County investigator, Joe  
Sterling, who said King threatened to assault him when King refused 
to leave the jail for a January court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he took it as a threat, Sterling replied: ``Yes, sir, I  
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A county jailer, Kenneth Primrose, testified how on that same  
day, King picked up a television in his cell and smashed it. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was transferred to another cell, deputies conducted a  
search, finding a homemade knife made from a radio antenna and a 
noose made from electrical cord. The discovery prompted officials 
to put King on a suicide watch, said Primrose, who was the final 
state witness during the punishment phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys, who contend a life prison term would be  
appropriate for King, called a psychologist as their first witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Quijano, a former chief psychologist for the Texas prison  
system and now in private practice, said King's lack of drug 
history and the fact that he'd used no weapons during previous 
crimes contributed to his conclusion that a life term would fit 
King. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that in Texas, a life term means at least 40 years in  
prison before an inmate is eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be about 64 when released,'' Quijano said. ``The  
probability of people at age 64 committing violence is very low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If King is sentenced to death, he would become the only white  
among 452 Texas inmates to be awaiting death for killing a black 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say that Byrd, 49, was picked up by the suspects  
June 7 as he walked home after a party. He was then savagely beaten 
and chained to the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	A pathologist testified Byrd was alive and in excruciating pain  
as he was dragged along a bumpy county road, held fast by the 
24 1/2-foot logging chain. For part of the way, Byrd tried to prop 
himself up on his elbows to protect his head. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, it was a black man who delivered the news that could  
send King to death row. 
</P>
<P>
	King leaned forward slightly, drawing near to one of his  
attorneys apparently in hopes of avoiding the aim of a photographer 
as the jurors filed into the courtroom to announce the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The only black juror, who had been elected foreman of the  
12-member panel, gave the papers with the jury vote to the bailiff, 
who handed them to state District Judge Joe Bob Golden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We the jury find the defendant guilty of the offense of  
capital murder,'' Golden read. 
</P>
<P>
	Some spectators applauded, and Byrd's family broke into tears.  
``I am relieved,'' said Stella Brumley, Byrd's sister. ``That's all 
we wanted, was justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other white men, Shawn Berry, 24, and Lawrence Brewer, 31,  
await trial in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is that there's one down and two to go,'' said Ross  
Byrd, the victim's son. 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks from the courthouse, Craig Johnson, owner of the  
World of Sounds music store, later suggested a punishment for King: 
``He needs to go the same way that man did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying thrust Jasper into a national spotlight that many in  
this racially mixed east Texas timber town of 8,000 said was 
unfair. Members of the Ku Klux Klan and New Black Panthers came to 
demonstrate outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said nationwide expressions of outrage over  
Byrd's death ``demonstrate that an act of evil like this is not 
what our country is all about.'' He added: ``Our work for racial 
reconciliation and an end to all crimes of hatred in this country 
will go on.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Rebukes Clinton Critic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge rebuked a Clinton  
administration critic Wednesday for asking personal questions of 
Linda Tripp's former stepmother, a minor player in the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Larry Klayman promised not to question the woman about  
her personal or professional life, but did so anyway, U.S. District 
Judge Royce Lamberth wrote. Lamberth ordered Klayman to pay J. Lowe 
Davis' legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first such setback for Klayman in his $90 million  
suit alleging Clinton administration mishandling of FBI files. 
Klayman has won court permission to question a host of current and 
former Clinton staffers, including Tripp herself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deposition of Ms. Davis last June, Klayman and his  
conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, wanted to know where Ms. 
Davis learned that Tripp blamed her for the breakup with Tripp's 
father, the judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman also asked about an incident in which Tripp allegedly  
vandalized her father's car because he wouldn't let her attend a 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Testimony on why Davis and her ex-husband were divorced and  
the story of Tripp allegedly vandalizing her father's car clearly 
involves private family matters,'' Lamberth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch also asked several questions related to Ms.  
Davis' job as a newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp, a Pentagon secretary, recorded conversations with Ms.  
Lewinsky about her young co-worker's relationship with President 
Clinton. She turned the tapes over to Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, leading eventually to Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman wanted to know more about the source of a New Yorker  
magazine article last year that said Tripp was arrested in 1969 but 
hid the arrest when she later applied for a Pentagon security 
clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judicial Watch was seeking to determine whether the  
information published by Jane Mayer of the New Yorker came from 
White House files, such as FBI files, or Ms. Davis,'' Klayman said 
Wednesday. ``Obviously if the information was accurate, it was more 
likely that it came from Ms. Davis. Judicial Watch inadvertently 
did not explain this well to the court,'' Klayman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman said he never intended to get into matters that were not  
already public, and said he will ask the judge to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Davis' lawyer, Robert Bernius, did not immediately respond  
to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Lamberth moved to release court documents  
related to Klayman's allegation that a White House lawyer made a 
possibly menacing reference to Klayman's infant daughter. Klayman 
had asked that the records remain sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Klayman had complained that during another deposition, a lawyer  
for Hillary Rodham Clinton asked about the child by name. The 
remark could be taken as a threat, Klayman said. White House 
lawyers said it was innocent.

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Walker at Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- As Larry Walker launched batting practice  
pitches into the parking lot behind right field, his agent Pat 
Rooney and Colorado Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard observed 
from above. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney and Gebhard sat together in a tower at the Rockies spring  
training complex for about 45 minutes Wednesday, swapping baseball 
stories from the past and trying to clear up Walker's plans for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, who will make $5.075 million this year, is seeking a  
contract extension before the Rockies open the season April 4 in 
Monterrey, Mexico. Judging from lagging negotiations, it could come 
down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no indication where it's going to go,'' Rooney said.  
``There's not much happening right now. There's nothing to 
report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before receiving a fax from Walker's agents earlier this week,  
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris said he had no counterproposal to use 
as a starting point for negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax said Walker was ``not necessarily'' seeking an  
eight-year deal worth $15 million per season. Reports have said 
Walker last month turned down a four-year offer worth about $11 
million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney said the two sides ``have an understanding'' how  
negotiations are going to progress and another face-to-face visit 
could come next week. Neither he nor Gebhard would elaborate on 
what the next move will be. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney, a former minor-league player, and Gebhard have a  
baseball history together. Gebhard traded him from the Montreal 
Expos to the New York Yankees for Tim Burke in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* Gebhard also met with Todd Helton's agent. Helton,  
runner-up for NL Rookie of the Year in 1998, made $190,000 last 
season and has said he is willing to sign a multi-year contract, if 
he thinks it's a fair offer. Gebhard would only say that he and 
Mike Moye ``visited'' and will talk again. ... The Rockies have 
signed pitchers Lariel Gonzalez and Mike Kusiewicz to one-year 
contracts.

<HEADLINE> Turner Creates New Cable Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Ted Turner is fixin' some Southern-fried  
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Broadcasting System announced Wednesday it plans to  
launch Turner South, a cable network that hopes to keep y'all 
coming back to watch country music, Southern lifestyle shows, and 
all-time stars of pro wrestling such as Jesse ``the Governor'' 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South will debut in the fall as the first regional cable  
entertainment network, targeting six southeastern states. Analysts 
said the regional network seems a good way to offer a programming 
identity among the melange of channels, and should attract 
advertisers looking to target their messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely still a Southern identity that exceeds what  
I've found in the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast,'' said Tom 
Agan, a Massachusetts native and retail consultant for Kurt Salmon 
Associates in Atlanta. ``There's a certain set of values and images 
and stories that only Southerners get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Reagan Wilson, director of the University of  
Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture, said a 
network whose initial lineup will include shows such as ``World 
Championship Wrestling Classics'' might give rise to stereotypes. 
But it underlines the growing popularity that traditionally 
Southern forms of culture -- such as wrestling, country music and 
stock-car racing -- have gained nationwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Burke, president of the TBS Superstation, will head Turner  
South for parent Time Warner Inc., where Turner now serves as vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke announced the new network before a breakfast of cheese  
grits, biscuits and peach cobbler. He said the strategy of 
celebrating Southerners' strong regional identity should prove both 
popular and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be movies packaged as ``Kudzu Theater-Movies that  
Grow on You,'' a play on the ever-spreading vine. They won't all be 
Southern-based, but among titles planned are old favorites such as 
``Cool Hand Luke'' and recent movies such as ``Places in the 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said that not only do Southern-themed shows such as ``Andy  
Griffith'' play particularly well in the region, some movies such 
as ``Dumb and Dumber,'' a slapstick comedy without a regional link, 
have gotten unusually high regional ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South will also carry games of the TBS-owned pro sports  
franchises -- baseball's Atlanta Braves, basketball's Hawks, and 
hockey's Thrashers -- not being carried on other networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among original shows planned are country music from Nashville's  
Bluebird Cafe; a weekly series developed with Southern Living 
magazine; ``The College Show'' using tapes submitted from regional 
campus stations; and ``WCW Classics'' with favorites including the 
current Minnesota governor who wrestled as Jesse ``The Body'' 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said the company will step up talks with other cable  
operators to secure space and expects its long regional ties to 
help. The network could reach up 6 million homes in Georgia, 
Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner, the nation's largest cable operator, already has  
strong holdings in the Carolinas and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South joins the wide-ranging lineup of TV networks  
created by Turner, including CNN, TNT and Cartoon Network, and 
represents something of a return to his TV roots. In 1976, Turner 
made Atlanta-based TBS into the first ``superstation'' by using 
satellite to reach homes around the nation, featuring Braves and 
Hawks games and old TV series such as ``Andy Griffith.''

<HEADLINE>  Witnesses Say King Still a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The white supremacist convicted of the  
dragging death of a black man acted up in jail and is capable of 
more violence, prosecution witnesses testified today. A defense 
expert found mitigating qualities in the man. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury that found John William King guilty Tuesday of  
kidnapping and murdering James Byrd Jr. last June now must decide 
whether to sentence King to death. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Courts Seen Unfair to Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too many Americans believe the nation's courts  
do not provide equal justice for racial minorities, the American 
Bar Association's president said, as the group released a poll 
showing nearly half of Americans feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious problem ... we cannot afford to  
ignore,'' Little Rock, Ark., lawyer Philip Anderson said Tuesday. 
``We are concerned that the current perception of bias will 
eventually erode confidence in our system of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1,000 people surveyed by telephone in August, 47 percent said  
they strongly disagreed with a statement that ``the courts treat 
all ethnic and racial groups the same.'' Only 39 percent agreed 
with the statement, and 14 percent voiced no view. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether courts treat men and women alike, 55 percent said  
yes, 30 percent said no, and 15 percent expressed no view. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson noted that another recent ABA poll indicated great  
disagreement between white and black lawyers over the justice 
system's racial fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``This raises the obvious question that if people believe the  
justice system is tainted with bias, how long can they expect the 
courts to remedy bias elsewhere in our society?'' Anderson said. 
``Right now, the high degree of confidence in the courts exists 
side by side with the perception of bias in the courts. As the 
minority populations increase in America, will the perception of 
bias increase?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the 350,000-member ABA ``will intensify our efforts to  
eradicate gender and racial bias in our courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Tuesday contains some seemingly inconsistent  
findings. For example, most people -- 51 percent -- believe the 
justice system ``needs a complete overhaul,'' but 80 percent also 
believe America's system is the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
	A large majority of Americans, 78 percent, also voiced  
confidence in the jury system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those numbers are high, and we can feel good about them,''  
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the poll's other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--90 percent believe wealthy people and companies often wear down  
their opponents by dragging out legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	--77 percent say it costs too much to go to court.  
</P>
<P>
	--27 percent believe the best lawyers are selected to serve as  
judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said the poll indicates most Americans need and want to  
know more about the justice system. One tool, he said, could be 
increasing public access to the nation's courtrooms by televising 
more proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot think of a better civics lesson than ... to be able  
to see and hear every argument before the Supreme Court of the 
United States,'' Anderson said. ``One television camera in the 
Supreme Court will educate more people more effectively in one 
morning than the traditional methods can reach in one year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All federal court proceedings currently are closed to radio and  
television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll has margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage  
points.

<HEADLINE>  Slumping Lakers Fire Del Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- In with the Worm, and out with the  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The slumping Los Angeles Lakers, considered one of the teams to  
beat in the NBA this season, fired coach Del Harris on Wednesday on 
the heels of three road losses in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced while Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading  
rebounder the last seven seasons, was participating in his first 
practice session with the team after signing a contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew -- will 
succeed Harris for at least the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka will handle the head  
coaching duties Thursday night against the winless Los Angeles 
Clippers in Anaheim before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, 
both former Lakers players. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John Black said Wednesday night the team hoped to make  
a decision on a successor to Harris ``in the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had not spoken to former Chicago Bulls coach Phil  
Jackson or anyone else because things happened so quickly, but felt 
confident Rambis or Drew ``will be the person that will be able to 
get us to where we want to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always difficult to talk about hypotheticals, but if that  
situation is presented, I know that Phil would look at that 
carefully,'' Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, said by telephone 
when asked if his client might be interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	West pointed out the Lakers usually hire coaches from within the  
organization, and Harris said he hoped Rambis or Drew would get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel the last two games we've played have not been  
acceptable,'' West said, referring to a 117-113 overtime loss in 
Denver on Monday night and a 93-83 loss at Vancouver on Tuesday 
night. ``I just felt like there was a deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's victory was only its second in 10 games this season,  
and the Grizzlies had never beaten Los Angeles in 12 previous 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to (owner) Jerry Buss this morning and we just felt  
like the time was right now,'' West said. ``Right now, we look like 
we're floundering. That's not what the fans pay to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses left the young, talented Lakers at 6-6 with 38 games  
remaining in the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Particularly for me, the thing that makes it so awkward is  
that Del has been a friend for many years,'' West said. ``The 
direction of a team is very important. We do feel like we have the 
talent here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season. He guided the Lakers to a  
224-116 record and improved their regular-season record in four 
consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only eight other coaches 
in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like a loser today,'' Harris said. ``There will  
be other doors that will open for me. There always have been when 
other doors have closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping today to tell my team that everybody's laughing  
at us today, but we're going to have the last laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has been under criticism from many directions the last  
few years despite his team's improvement every year. Two years ago, 
the Lakers lost to the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference 
semifinals and last spring were swept by the Jazz in the conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fact that star Shaquille O'Neal missed 22 games last  
season, the Lakers had a 61-21 regular-season record -- one of the 
best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team will mature,'' Harris said. ``It's already an  
outstanding team. Forget 6-6. This team is better than 6-6. I don't 
have any excuses to make. This team could go on a 10-game winning 
streak whether I was here or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a reasonable decision,'' Harris added of being  
fired although he admitted he was disappointed he couldn't at least 
finish the season. ``I enjoyed being with this bunch. Whoever takes 
my place will not have failed if they don't win it this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' contract runs out after this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of the team that won almost three-quarters of its games and  
reached the conference finals is back this year, but the Lakers 
have been on-again, off-again since the start of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, they are 0-3 in nationally televised Sunday  
games, losing at home to Utah and Indiana and last Sunday at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has 556 career victories to rank among the top 20 of NBA  
coaches. He previously coached the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he was ``very shocked'' to hear of the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unfortunate that a good guy like Del is blamed  
for our lack of cohesion, our lack of effort, our lack of energy,'' 
O'Neal said. ``However, one reason I came here is because of my 
faith in upper management. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss Del, personally. The only thing I can do is  
wish him well. I'll always be a big fan of his because he taught me 
a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris said he was looking forward to coaching Rodman, and the  
eccentric forward said the now-former Lakers coach was put in a 
``no-win situation'' because the team is expected to go to the NBA 
finals every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business is ruthless, there's no security in this  
business at all,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman joked at the start of his brief news conference after a  
limited practice that ``Already there are problems.'' He was poking 
fun at himself and referring to the coaching change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he expects to play his first game on Friday night  
against the Clippers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Buss issued a statement saying: ``I have enjoyed my relationship  
with Del. He is a true gentleman. I want to reiterate that I think 
he's done a truly outstanding job coaching the Lakers. While we 
feel that a coaching change is necessary at this time, I want to 
publicly thank Del for the many things he has accomplished with the 
Lakers and the steady improvement the team made under his 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers were 33-49 in the 1993-94 season -- before Harris took  
over -- and missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, a member of four Lakers championship teams in the 1980s  
who turns 41 on Thursday, expressed mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really sad to see Del go,'' Rambis said. ``He taught me a  
lot about life, a lot about basketball. He was trying to do the 
right things, I know that. He's going to get another opportunity. I 
really enjoyed him; he gave me the opportunity to coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis, under consideration for the Clippers' coaching job last  
summer, also said coaching the Lakers would be a great opportunity 
for him, and added, ``It's not an easy job, head coaching in the 
Los Angeles area, because of the high expectations. I can't settle 
for anything less than winning a championship. That's all I looked 
at as a player, and that's all I look at as a coach.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Star Makes Right Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- The coach who recruited her was  
fired, her Purdue teammates were leaving and Stephanie 
White-McCarty considered quitting, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior's decision to stay put in 1996 has paid big dividends  
-- a Big Ten championship, the No. 1 ranking in women's basketball 
and hopes for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarthy has averaged 20.7 points this season for the  
record-setting Purdue Boilermakers while becoming the ninth player 
in conference history to score 2,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Indiana Miss Basketball, the 5-foot-11 forward shares  
the credit for her team's success with her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue goes into this week's Big Ten tournament in the RCA Dome  
with a conference-record 23 consecutive victories. In January, 
White-McCarty recorded the first triple-double in school history 
against arch-rival Indiana and is among the conference leaders in 
nearly every statistic while justifying her selection as a 
preseason All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous honor to be considered one of the top  
basketball players, but I knew when I was coming in that I was 
coming in with a great group of girls,'' she said. ``The 
opportunities that we had ahead of us ... Yeah, I'd like to be an 
All-America pick at the end, but none of that is going to come 
about without the success of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (25-1) regained the No. 1 position in this week's  
Associated Press poll after becoming the second women's team in 
conference history to go through league play without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't seem likely when former head coach Lin Dunn and her  
assistant MaChelle Joseph were fired following White-McCarty's 
freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in shock when I heard it. We (the team) didn't know  
where we were going from there,'' White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was decimated when several of her teammates transferred  
and the program appeared to be in trouble following allegations of 
NCAA violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``You come to a program with big goals and you don't want those  
kind of violations to distract from that,'' White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided I was going to see who they brought in, and make my  
decision whether I was going to leave or stay then,'' White-McCarty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA investigation of the allegations resulted in no serious  
disciplinary action and White-McCarty decided to stay after meeting 
Dunn's replacement, Nell Fortner. 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects seemed bleak in the 1996-97 season with only three  
experienced returnees and four walk-ons on a squad of 11 players. 
The Boilermakers were picked to finish eighth in the Big Ten 
preseason poll and struggled early before winning 11 of its last 16 
games to finish 17-11 and winning a share of the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole sophomore year was about getting back my love for the  
game,'' White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fortner left after that season to become coach of the U.S.  
National team and former assistant Carolyn Peck replaced her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transition from Nell to Carolyn wasn't as difficult  
because we had the same staff, we had the same style, the same 
offenses and defenses,'' White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program moved forward behind the leadership of White-McCarty  
and her roommate of three years -- guard Ukari Figgs, a former 
Kentucky Miss Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Peck became the third women's coach in NCAA Division  
I history to lead her team into the regional finals of the NCAA 
tournament in her first year. Purdue finished 23-10. The 
Boilermakers began the season ranked fifth in the preseason poll 
and moved into the top spot when it snapped the 46-game winning 
streak of three-time defending national champion Tennessee in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	But a loss at Stanford cost the Boilermakers the top ranking  
until they moved past Tennessee this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ranking really doesn't mean much to us now. It's nice to  
have, but it doesn't prove anything,'' White-McCarty said. ``We're 
not looking past our next game. The Big Ten is very even and then 
we have to prove ourselves in the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next for Purdue is a second-round date with eighth-seeded Iowa  
or ninth-seeded Northwestern on Saturday in the Big Ten 
quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE>  Slumping Lakers Fire Del Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- In with the Worm, and out with the  
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The slumping Los Angeles Lakers, considered one of the teams to  
beat in the NBA this season, fired coach Del Harris on Wednesday on 
the heels of three road losses in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was announced while Dennis Rodman, the NBA's leading  
rebounder the last seven seasons, was participating in his first 
practice session with the team after signing a contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew -- will 
succeed Harris for at least the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka will handle the head  
coaching duties Thursday night against the winless Los Angeles 
Clippers in Anaheim before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, 
both former Lakers players. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman John Black said Wednesday night the team hoped to make  
a decision on a successor to Harris ``in the next 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West said he had not spoken to former Chicago Bulls coach Phil  
Jackson or anyone else because things happened so quickly, but felt 
confident Rambis or Drew ``will be the person that will be able to 
get us to where we want to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always difficult to talk about hypotheticals, but if that  
situation is presented, I know that Phil would look at that 
carefully,'' Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, said by telephone 
when asked if his client might be interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	West pointed out the Lakers usually hire coaches from within the  
organization, and Harris said he hoped Rambis or Drew would get the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel the last two games we've played have not been  
acceptable,'' West said, referring to a 117-113 overtime loss in 
Denver on Monday night and a 93-83 loss at Vancouver on Tuesday 
night. ``I just felt like there was a deterioration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's victory was only its second in 10 games this season,  
and the Grizzlies had never beaten Los Angeles in 12 previous 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to (owner) Jerry Buss this morning and we just felt  
like the time was right now,'' West said. ``Right now, we look like 
we're floundering. That's not what the fans pay to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses left the young, talented Lakers at 6-6 with 38 games  
remaining in the abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Particularly for me, the thing that makes it so awkward is  
that Del has been a friend for many years,'' West said. ``The 
direction of a team is very important. We do feel like we have the 
talent here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season. He guided the Lakers to a  
224-116 record and improved their regular-season record in four 
consecutive years, a feat accomplished by only eight other coaches 
in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like a loser today,'' Harris said. ``There will  
be other doors that will open for me. There always have been when 
other doors have closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping today to tell my team that everybody's laughing  
at us today, but we're going to have the last laugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has been under criticism from many directions the last  
few years despite his team's improvement every year. Two years ago,

semifinals and last spring were swept by the Jazz in the conference 
finals.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vince Gill is probably known better for his  
country-singing voice, than for his guitar-playing. 
</P>
<P>
	So he got an extra thrill Wednesday when he won a Grammy with  
Randy Scruggs for best country instrumental performance for ``A 
Soldier's Joy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a blast for me. I don't think that the whole world knows  
that I play, and that's OK,'' Gill said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was counting on my fingers. It started in '90 and I didn't  
know this was the 10th year. It's pretty neat. The 12 Grammys I've 
won are pretty diverse. The fact that it's got that balance really 
means a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gill later Wednesday night won for best male country vocal for  
``If You Ever Have Forever in Mind,'' bringing his career total to 
13.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arturo Sandoval celebrated his Grammy win  
Wednesday as well as his recent U.S. citizenship. The political 
refugee from Cuba became naturalized this past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are, for 40 years, under one of the worst dictatorships  
ever,'' Sandoval said, holding his Grammy for best Latin jazz 
performance. ``Some people don't know the reality that is going on. 
People are starving, homeless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandoval said he can't return to Cuba for political reasons, but  
wouldn't want to even if he could. He spoke out against other stars 
going to the island to do work, such as shooting music videos. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cuban government always uses celebrities ... for political  
propaganda purposes,'' he said. ``I'd really like those people to 
think about it a little bit and don't let the Cuban government use 
their image for propaganda.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the middle of winter, but it looked and  
felt like summer Wednesday as Grammy nominees strolled onto the red 
carpet in front of the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin singing legend Celia Cruz, who was nominated for best  
tropical Latin performance, wore a lavish blue gown and shawl. Her 
caked-on makeup looked like it was about to drip under the 
81-degree heat. ``I don't drink water. I don't like water, but with 
this weather, I will,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian songstress Shakira went with a vampire look, with a  
long red cape over her black dress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sweating. It's so hot,'' Shakira said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rising mercury, black velvet and dark leather  
prevailed. Members of the Goo Goo Dolls wore long black pants, 
while Bonnie Raitt wore a black pantsuit with a heavy paisley 
shawl.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After singing professionally for 51 years,  
Patti Page won a Grammy Wednesday on her first and only nomination 
-- for best traditional pop vocal performance for ``Live at Carnegie 
Hall, The 50th Anniversary Concert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She accepted her trophy with thankfulness and humor. When the  
first of her 11 grandchildren was born, Page noted backstage that 
her family members asked what they should name the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grammy,'' Page replied, ``because I'll never get one. Now they  
can call me grandma.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If anyone should get an award for lasting  
through the changing times, it's Burt Bacharach, who has won a 
Grammy in three different decades. 
</P>
<P>
	He received his first in 1967, two in 1969 and another in 1986  
before winning again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really very significant for me and my work as I have been  
able to span as many decades -- I'd like to go another 10,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year he and singer Elvis Costello won for best pop  
collaboration with vocals for ``I Still Have That Other Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say I've learned any of Burt's secrets because I can't  
write like him,'' said Costello, who has gained fame for pop songs 
like ``Veronica.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costello said the two have enjoyed working together and just  
finished recording music for the upcoming ``Austin Powers'' sequel 
the night before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been among the most exciting things I have ever  
done,'' Costello said. ``It was great to sit at the piano and write 
together.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Country music star Garth Brooks drew one of  
the biggest laughs at Wednesday night's Grammy Awards ceremony -- 
and he wasn't even there. 
</P>
<P>
	As Vince Gill accepted a Grammy for best male country vocal  
performance, he took a little jab at Brooks, who skipped the show 
to participate at the San Diego Padres' training camp at Mesa, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill put the trophy's small Gramophone up to his ear and said,  
``Somebody told me that if you listen real close, you can hear 
Garth Brooks play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, whose lifelong dream has been to become a professional  
baseball player, is attending spring training on a non-roster basis 
as a way to jump-start his charitable foundation. Rather than pay 
him a salary, the team is donating about $200,000 to Brooks' 
foundation.

<HEADLINE> Lauryn Hill Breaks Grammy Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill broke a record for  
female artists with five Grammy Awards Wednesday, and the 
``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart Will Go On'' sailed on with four 
awards, including song and record of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so amazing ... this is crazy because it's hip-hop  
music,'' said Hill, who stepped away from the Fugees to win album 
of the year for ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and best new 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a rap artist had ever won the major album  
Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna, now that she's turned 40, won her first musical  
Grammys, including best pop album for her excursion into 
electronica, ``Ray of Light.'' She also won best dance recording 
and best short form music video. 
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian  
Setzer Orchestra each were double winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Hill, who led with 10 nominations in nine  
categories, also won best rhythm and blues album. Her hit song, 
``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' won best R&AMP;B song and best R&AMP;B vocal 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's best new artist win was something of a misnomer since she  
won two past Grammys with the Fugees. She read a passage from the 
Bible and thanked her children for, among other things, ``not 
spilling anything on mommy's outfit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, whose music mixes rap and R&AMP;B and touches on family and  
political issues, beat Carole King's record for most Grammys ever 
by a female artist in one night. King won four in 1971 for 
``Tapestry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My Heart Will Go On'' also won the female pop vocal for Celine  
Dion and as best song written for a motion picture or television. 
James Horner and Will Jennings picked up the writing trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Dion thanked James Cameron, director of ``Titanic,'' for  
``letting this song be part of this magic moment -- a beautiful 
movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horner told the Shrine Auditorium and national television  
audiences he initially considered the song just a movie theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spoke to a lot of people,'' Horner said backstage. ``It  
obviously was very romantic in a wistful, timeless way.'' He 
admitted he no longer listens to the song. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Award for best song was one of 11 Oscars for  
``Titanic.'' The soundtrack was the top-selling album of 1998, with 
more than 9 million units sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor-rapper Will Smith won best rap song for his good-natured  
``Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.'' He paid tribute to God, ``the jiggiest 
wife in the world'' (actress Jada Pinkett Smith), and his son, 
about whom he received bad news in his first parent-teacher 
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rhyming skills are down,'' Smith said. ``I swear -- that's  
what the teacher told me. That's just pure parental neglect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another rap category, Jay-Z's ``Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life''  
won best album. The rapper followed through on his threat to skip 
the show because he doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap. The 
Beastie Boys won duo or group performance for ``Intergalactic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 12th Grammy victory of the 1990s, Eric Clapton won male  
pop vocal for ``My Father's Eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crow won best rock album for ``The Globe Sessions'' and paid  
tribute to A&AMP;M Records, just swallowed up in a corporate merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a really nice thing for me,'' she said, adding, ``I  
want Lauryn Hill to produce my next record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dixie Chicks' ``Wide Open Spaces'' was an upset winner for  
best country album over the better-known Garth Brooks and Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're freaking out,'' the tearful trio said in accepting the  
award. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're Still the One'' won best country song for Twain and  
husband Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and female country vocal 
performance for Twain. Vince Gill won best male country vocal 
performance for ``If You Ever Have Forever in Mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best female rock vocal performance went to Alanis Morissette for  
``Uninvited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Setzer Orchestra, riding the swing revival, captured two pop  
honors, performance by a duo or group and instrumental performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The male R&AMP;B vocal Grammy went to Wonder for ``St. Louis  
Blues.'' The tune also earned him and two colleagues the award for 
instrumental arrangement with vocals. The two Grammys brought 
Wonder's career total to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	That ties him with Pierre Boulez, who also won two Wednesday  
night -- orchestral performance and opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sir Georg Solti, Quincy Jones and Vladimir Horowitz have  
won more. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandy &AMP; Monica won the R&AMP;B duo or group performance trophy for  
``The Boy Is Mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Bacharach had his first win since 1986, giving him Grammys  
in three different decades. He and Elvis Costello won for pop 
collaboration with vocals on ``I Still Have That Other Girl.'' It 
was Costello's first Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Cash, Mel Torme, Smokey Robinson and the late Sam Cooke  
and Otis Redding each received lifetime achievement awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at the 41st annual 
Grammy Awards. Rosie O'Donnell served as master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The songwriting teams of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe,  
Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller 
were honored with trustees' awards for outstanding contributions by 
nonperformers.

<HEADLINE> Gant Wants To End La Russa Fued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Ron Gant wants Tony La Russa to know  
he's sorry. Most of all, the Philadelphia Phillies outfielder wants 
the war of words with his former manager to be over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I apologize to the fans, to my fans, to the families. This  
shouldn't have happened,'' Gant said Wednesday after the Phillies' 
first full-squad workout. ``We both are adults, and we have to put 
it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa, the St. Louis manager, and Gant have been ripping each  
other since the Cardinals traded Gant to Philadelphia three months 
ago. Gant criticized La Russa's lineups, and La Russa fired back 
about the slugger's lack of production. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gant named several players who didn't like La Russa  
and were mistreated by him. All the players were black, leaving the 
comments to be interpreted as an accusation of racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant didn't address that Wednesday, apologizing in a brief  
statement to reporters and then saying, ``No more questions.'' La 
Russa has said he was trying to find out Gant's phone number so the 
two could talk, but La Russa said Wednesday in Jupiter that he 
still didn't have the number. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said what was on my mind,'' Gant said. ``I said some things  
that I shouldn't have. I apologize, and let's move on. We both have 
a job to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would talk with La Russa if the manager called, Gant  
said. ``Probably so. I'm that type of person. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's behind me. I hope it's behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant initially angered La Russa after the trade when he said the  
manager's quirky lineups -- with Mark McGwire batting third and the 
pitcher eighth -- made the Cardinals ``the laughingstock of the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa retorted that, ``The only one it didn't work for was  
Ron Gant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was whiff, whiff, whiff,'' La Russa said. ``I really hope  
he goes to Philly and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us, and 
we'll see what excuse he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Gant listed the players who didn't like La Russa and  
said he pushed Ozzie Smith into early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey Henderson didn't like him, Royce Clayton didn't like  
him,'' Gant said. ``He treated Ozzie Smith like dirt. Brian Jordan 
didn't like him. I don't know too many people who did like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do the math,'' he added. ``Something's not right there.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Gant-La Russa spat added controversy to a Phillies camp that  
is quiet other than the ongoing speculation about Curt Schilling's 
future with the team. But on Wednesday, the feud was relegated to a 
joke in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you ask me about Tony La Russa?'' closer Jeff  
Brantley said. ``That seems to be the hot topic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from his comments about La Russa, Gant has taken a  
leadership role on the Phillies in the early days of camp. He led 
the veterans on an optional run after batting practice Tuesday, and 
has impressed young stars like Scott Rolen with his presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's put in his time in the game'' Rolen said. ``It's a  
calming, settling feeling to see him here. I'm looking forward to 
watching him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant hit .240 with 26 homers ad 67 RBIs in 121 games for St.  
Louis last season, but was hampered by a persistent right hamstring 
injury.

earned it. He also was runner-up for the Grimsley award. 
</P>
<P>

White and whether the University of Tennessee asked for a donation

trades, such as Kevin Brown's $100 million contract with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, and a profile of Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner.

follow,'' Walker said. ``On Steinbrenner, he did a nice job of 
putting him in perspective.''

family differences. 
</P>
<P>

of boxing great Jimmy Bivins' fight for his life in Cleveland; 
Jacksonville's Eddie Pells was third for a story on Auburn hero 
Terry Beasley's concussions.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Consolidate Control of Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Denise DeBartolo York, seeking to clarify  
the lines of power in the San Francisco 49ers organization, on 
Wednesday put her husband in charge of the team and moved to cut 
off co-owner Eddie DeBartolo's access to club coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Singer, spokesman for the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.,  
confirmed the report by the San Francisco Examiner, which said it 
obtained a memo detailing the team's new command structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This memo released today just gave clear direction to the team  
that Denise is in charge of the team for the foreseeable future,'' 
Singer said. ``We don't know when Eddie will return, but Denise is 
happily taking helm of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development is the strongest sign yet that DeBartolo's exile  
from the team, which arose due to legal problems in Louisiana, 
won't end any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said last month that the banishment  
of DeBartolo, who withdrew from active management of the team in 
December 1997, would likely be extended at least through the 1999 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known how the latest management changes will affect the  
49ers' already stalled plans for a $525 million stadium and mall. 
York has put that project on hold because of soaring construction 
cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that you can appreciate my efforts to provide you clear  
direction and to assure compliance with NFL directives,'' York said 
in the memo obtained by the Examiner and distributed to all 49ers 
employees at a staff meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please be assured that Eddie was provided a copy of this ...  
before it was issued. While I would not be surprised if he is not 
in agreement with some of these decisions, I know that he 
understands my concerns and appreciates that this memorandum was 
issued at my direction to provide everyone with a clear set of 
guidelines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	York, who is chairwoman and chief executive officer of the 49ers  
parent firm, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio, 
gave her husband, John York, and an aide, Keith Lenhart, oversight 
responsibility for the team. John York is a DeBartolo Corp. senior 
vice president and member of the board of directors. Lenhart is the 
corporate controller. Both men will add the title of 49ers vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Mrs. York, in consultation with her brother, had named  
former 49ers head coach Bill Walsh team vice president and general 
manager, making him responsible for the team's day-to-day 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said the football operations have been unaffected by the  
ownership tumult, but conceded that plans for a new stadium are 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't honestly think there is any difference at this time  
between how Eddie DeBartolo would be managing this team and Denise 
DeBartolo's management,'' Walsh said. ``I don't see any difference 
in philosophy. ...Now, stadium-wise, I'm not sure of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo had no immediate comment and did not return a phone  
call to his San Mateo office. League spokesman Greg Aiello said the 
NFL viewed the management moves as a team matter. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo stepped down as head of the team's operations in  
December 1997 when his role in a federal gambling and bribery case 
in Louisiana became public. He pleaded guilty in October to a 
federal felony -- failure to report an alleged extortion attempt in 
connection with the government's prosecution of former Louisiana 
Gov. Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo, the Examiner said Denise York ordered 49ers  
personnel not to answer DeBartolo's questions about club management 
unless they are put in writing and forwarded to club executive John 
McVay, with copies sent to her. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said she must pre-approve any request by DeBartolo for  
cash reimbursements for his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Eddie was involved in the direct management of this team,  
he enjoyed many of the benefits, which are earned when undertaking 
such responsibility. He no longer functions in that capacity,'' 
Denise York wrote.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen at midday  
Thursday on profit-taking. Japanese stock prices advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.46 yen at midday, down 0.16 yen from late  
Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 121.80 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 63.52 points, or 0.44 percent,  
ending the morning session at 14,418.97. On Wednesday, the average 
closed down 145.20 points, or 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell back as U.S. funds and  
Japanese investment trusts took profits after the currency's gain 
sparked by comments from U.S. Treasury officials, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in Seoul  
that the Japanese economy is ``still very troubling'' and urged 
Tokyo to take effective steps to generate strong domestic 
demand-led growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was en route for Tokyo, where he was to participate in a  
financial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday in Washington, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said  
Japan is ``still in a recessionary mode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's rise, which was triggered by the  
comments, then prompted dollar-selling to take profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 133.74 yen, up from 133.23 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started higher on  
expectations the United States will pressure Japan to do more to 
stimulate its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section added 2.77 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,123.06. The 
TOPIX closed up 2.52 points, or 0.23 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond stood at 1.880  
percent, unchanged from Wednesday's finish. Its price remained at 
99.36 yen.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Irabu Out of the Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu is happy just to fit in these  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of commotion going on around me last year.  
It's a lot nicer this year,'' Irabu said Wednesday. ``I know what I 
need to know here at spring training. It is more relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attending his second spring training, Irabu appears better  
prepared both physically and mentally. He seemed relaxed and 
confident Wednesday as he threw strikes during his first 
batting-practice session of the spring against live hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to believe as the time passes, you're going to get  
into it a little bit more,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``It 
has to be more difficult coming from another country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, no longer facing a daily barrage from the American and  
Japanese reporters, spent time Wednesday talking about conditioning 
and pitching with five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, 
obtained from Toronto last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger said when he was young, he learned a lot from Nolan  
Ryan,'' Irabu said through interpreter George Rose. ``It will help 
that I can be able to learn from his experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, starting the third season of a $12.8 million, four-year  
contract, has been criticized in the past by the Yankees for lack 
of conditioning and lackadaisical efforts. He was 6-3 with a 2.91 
ERA in the first half of last season, then tailed off and went 7-6 
with a 5.21 ERA in the second half. He didn't throw a pitch in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was more normal than 1997, when his rights were  
assigned to San Diego by his Japanese team, he held out and forced 
a trade to New York, then made his major league debut following the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think last year, starting out with camp, having the full  
season and being with these guys -- I feel like I fit in now,'' 
Irabu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other starters, Orlando Hernandez and David Cone, also threw  
10 minutes of batting practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to make my hitters look good,'' Cone joked. ``It went  
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, scheduled to throw batting practice for the first time  
Friday, will not pitch in the exhibition opening home-and-home 
series against the Blue Jays on March 4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to avoid that since it just happened last week,'' Torre  
said. ``Not anything other than the media thing, And again, he 
hasn't been in camp as long as everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre did not rule out Clemens starting the March 6 home game  
against Boston. Clemens, who has been working out before and after 
the regular spring training sessions, will continue his long toss 
regiment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good,'' Clemens said. ``I'm getting with the  
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Seventeen-year old Dominican right-hander Ricardo  
Aramboles, who underwent major elbow surgery last October, remains 
on target to pitch extended spring training games in April and 
possibly join Class-A Greensboro by early May. ... Welcome to the 
majors Alfonso Soriano. After hitting two consecutive home runs off 
Hernandez fastballs, the highly-regarded infield prospect was 
frozen by a sharp breaking ball. ... Venezuelan outfielder Jackson 
Melian, who received a $1.6 million signing bonus as a 16-year old 
in 1996, will continue his climb through the minors and start at 
Class-A Tampa this season.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock 
Market, and American Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	
</P>
<P>
 *American Greetings Corp. fell 11 3/16 to 23 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said revenues in fiscal year 2000 will be reduced by  
$100 million by a ``productivity initiative'' designed to get cards 
to market faster. The company expects to report fiscal 1999 
earnings of $2.60 to $2.70 a share, and fiscal 2000 earnings of $2 
to $2.10 a share, excluding restructuring charges. Analysts had 
expected earnings of $2.97 for fiscal year 2000, which begins March 
1, 1999, and $2.65 for fiscal 1999. 

</P>
<P>
 *Boeing Co. fell 1 3/4 to 35 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	An internal Boeing study, confirmed by the company, found that  
one-quarter of the $13 billion the company is investing in its 
product lines will produce no meaningful returns. 

</P>
<P>
 *Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 3 1/16 to 61.    	
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. named Delta its ``Focus 1'' stock of the  
week, saying it was attractively priced and that new management 
could produce annual earnings of $8 to $10 a share. Merrill raised 
its 1999 earnings-per-share estimate to $6.70 from $6.50. The 
company earned $6.87 a diluted share in 1998. 

</P>
<P>
 *Biomatrix rose 8 15/16 to 64 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Better-than-expected earnings and recent federal approval to  
ship an arthritis product helped drive the shares higher, the 
company said. BancBoston Robertson Stephens substantially raised 
its earnings estimates and stock-price target for the company. On 
Tuesday, Biomatrix reported fourth-quarter earnings of 61 cents a 
share, outstripping analysts' consensus forecast of 50 cents per 
share. 

</P>
<P>
 *Capital Re Corp. rose 2 to 16 13/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter operating profits were 69 cents per share, easily  
topping analysts' estimate of 59 cents.

</P>
<P>
 *Ciena rose 2 5/8 to 27 1/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	BancBoston Robertson Stephens upgraded the stock to buy from  
long-term attractive, saying the company should benefit from 
``robust and accellerating'' demand for fiber-optic systems. 

</P>
<P>
 *Advanced Fibre Communications Inc. fell 1 7/16 to 8 1/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	NationsBanc Montgomery Securities Inc. cut its first-quarter  
earnings projection because of concerns that slower orders from 
Mexico, Venezuela and China are keeping international business 
below targets. 

</P>
<P>
 *Xylan Corp. rose 3 5/8 to 25 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Nutmeg Securities analyst Andy Schopick, said the company has  
``performed beautifully'' on a promise to deliver double-digit 
revenue growth in every quarter of the year. 

</P>
<P>
 *Twinlab fell 2 1/2 to 7.    	
</P>
<P>
	The vitamin maker restated first-, second- and third-quarter  
results for 1998, effectively reducing numbers. Twinlab also said a 
slowdown in nutritional supplements sales hurt fiscal 1998 
earnings. 

</P>
<P>
 *S3 Inc. rose 1 5/32 to 9 5/32.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company revealed that a top-five personal-computer

<HEADLINE> Knee Surgery for Astros' Alou Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Moises Alou  
will have surgery March 3 to repair damage to the anterior cruciate 
ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou was hurt last Thursday at his home in the Dominican  
Republic when he lost his balance trying to adjust a treadmill that 
was going too fast. He hoped the injury was not serious, but an MRI 
in Houston on Monday revealed the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will be performed by Dr. Richard Steadman in Vail,  
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, 32, hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs last year and  
finished third in the NL MVP voting behind Sammy Sosa and Mark 
McGwire.

<HEADLINE> Frerotte, Seahawks Like Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- The Seahawks like Gus Frerotte -- and he  
likes them. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is what's stopping the former Washington Redskins'  
quarterback, now a free agent, from signing with Seattle 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``As is usually the case, when you talk the first time, there's  
a little difference of opinion,'' new Seahawks coach-general 
manager Mike Holmgren said Wednesday. ``This is no different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte, 27, said he enjoyed his two-day visit and workout, but  
still plans to visit Detroit and Chicago. He plans to work out for 
the Lions this week and the Bears next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have ``proposed something, but it's just something  
we want to take a little more time to look at and think about right 
now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Down to one quarterback, Jon Kitna, after releasing Warren Moon  
and John Friesz, the Seahawks were hoping to lure Doug Pederson, 
Holmgren's backup quarterback in Green Bay, to Seattle as a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pederson signed last week with the Philadelphia Eagles.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have created $1.3 million of salary cap room by  
restructuring the contracts of free safety Darryl Williams and 
offensive tackle Howard Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is trying to restructure several other contracts.  
</P>
<P>
	Senior vice president Mike Reinfeldt, who followed Holmgren to  
Seattle from Green Bay, talked to Ralph Cindrich, Frerotte's agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of think he would like to be here,'' Reinfeldt said.  
``He's a good fit for us. I think all else being equal, he comes 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren developed Brett Favre in Green Bay and it sounds like  
if the Seahawks come up with the right money, he'll get a chance to 
resurrect Frerotte's career in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach Holmgren has such a good reputation as a quarterbacks  
coach and he is really a winner,'' Frerotte said. ``He's been to 
the Super Bowl. Ever since you were a little kid, you dream about 
playing in a Super Bowl and I think it's a great opportunity to get 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frerotte, a Pro Bowler for Washington in 1996, was released by  
the Redskins this month. The Redskins avoided paying him a $1.25 
million roster bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	At Washington, where he was a seventh-round draft choice in  
1994, he started 45 games, including one last season when he lost 
his starting job to Trent Green. 
</P>
<P>
	If Frerotte joins the Seahawks, he would be given a chance to  
start. Kitna replaced Moon as Seattle's starting quarterback for 
the final five games last season under fired coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren wants to bring four quarterbacks to training camp.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Life: Ronin DVD Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- DVD movie disks are nothing new. Online  
celebrity chats are even older news. Put them together though, 
adding loads of behind-the-scenes goodies, and you have a 
breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Bypassing the limitations of Internet bandwidth constraints,  
which prevent quality real-time video feeds, MGM Studios is packing 
its regular DVD disk of the 1998 John Frankenheimer movie ``Ronin'' 
with extensive additional footage, most of it accessible only via 
the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The novel concept will allow film fans and high-tech buffs to  
take part live in an online event March 14 with Frankenheimer where 
he'll reveal moviemaking secrets, display storyboard sketches, 
on-set still photos and much more, accompanied by high-resolution 
video clips showing what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Robert De Niro and Jean Reno, the ``R'' rated film set  
in France is a thriller about international intelligence agents and 
mercenaries who lost their government jobs at the end of the Cold 
War. It features some of the best car chase sequences ever filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankenheimer, 69, is a living film legend whose credits include  
``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Seven Days in May,'' ``Grand Prix'' 
and ``The Birdman of Alcatraz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The multimedia marriage of Internet and DVD intrigues  
Frankenheimer, who admits that although he has witnessed tremendous 
technical development during his life and is highly computer 
literate, he remains mystified by the rapid growth of the World 
Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankenheimer says he would never have imagined it 10 years ago.  
``I'm not a great visionary,'' he said in a telephone interview 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Ronin'' online event, everything but the video will be  
transmitted over the Internet, while the clips come from the movie 
disk to make playback quick and high-quality regardless of modem 
speed. The clips, encoded so they can be seen only by logging onto 
MGM's Web site, feature additional footage not used in the film's 
final edit, behind-the-scenes clips showing how stunts were staged, 
and a few blooper outtakes. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic description doesn't do it justice. The end result is a  
rich, visually stunning presentation that feels like a multimedia 
film school lecture hall, with the professor, Frankenheimer, 
discussing moviemaking problems and solutions while the film clips 
show the results. 
</P>
<P>
	He's excited by the idea of sharing his work with thousands via  
the Internet, while recognizing that revealing too many secrets 
behind movie wizardry can spoil the audience's fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way it does bother me, because in another generation and  
another time I don't think anybody really cared that they shot 
`Casablanca' on the Warner Bros. backlot,'' he said. ``It was just 
a good movie, and it was an illusion. Sometimes it's better not to 
know how it was done, and just enjoy the magic of it. But that's 
not the age we live in anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For people who can't resist seeing how directors perform movie  
magic but can't take part in the live online event, and for those 
who want to see it again and again, the presentation will be 
recorded and saved on an Internet server so disk owners can view it 
anytime 
</P>
<P>
	And all the online access extras included on the disk that hit  
store shelves Feb. 23 are free. 
</P>
<P>
	The disk, which can be used to play the film normally on DVD  
players and computers equipped with DVD drives, has a list price of 
about $25, no more than regular DVD movie disks and less than many 
that, like ``Ronin,'' also offer some extra footage and director 
commentary that buyers don't need an Internet hookup to view. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a first-time effort for MGM that has wide-reaching  
implications since the studio holds video distribution rights to 
more than 6,700 other films dating back decades, many of which are 
classics that would be prime candidates for similar combined 
online-DVD efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The format also could extend far beyond movie marketing, with  
alternative possible applications including other performing arts, 
sports, education, business, even military training. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniting so many forms of media in a single presentation presents  
a tantalizing look at the future of multimedia. It may also 
frighten traditionalists who don't like the Internet and home 
entertainment centers making inroads into a domain still dominated 
by the old-fashioned movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankenheimer, however, has no fears about cinema ever becoming  
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's ever going to happen. I think there's  
something about the group experience, going OUT to see a movie, 
that's a part of our existence,'' he said. ``And it would be a 
shame if it did, leaving just total isolation. That whole group 
experience, I think that's special.''

<HEADLINE> Lou Henson on Threshold of 700 Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- There are times when Lou Henson wonders  
why he can't shake his craving for competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then I think, this is ridiculous,'' Henson said.  
``I'm putting too much pressure on myself. It's not like I'm trying 
to save my job. I'm not 35. I don't have four kids (to support).'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Henson, who turned 67 last month, still has is the ability  
to turn out winning basketball teams. He's done it so well for 36 
years that he's one win away from becoming only the 13th coach in 
Division I to win 700 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his second stint at New Mexico State, Henson's career  
record is at 699-353 going into Thursday's game against Utah State 
in Las Cruces. 
</P>
<P>
	The impending 700th win has become a major topic in New Mexico.  
House and Senate members in the state Legislature gave Henson a 
standing ovation when he visited this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson's road to 700 started 44 years ago with his graduation  
from New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to decide whether I wanted to coach or go into  
administration,'' Henson said. ``I was thinking about getting a 
high school job somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson was a high school coach in the late '50s and early '60s.  
But the legacy of the dapper-dressing, success-driven and congenial 
Henson is what he accomplished since then at Hardin-Simmons, 
Illinois and New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
	He came out of retirement last season to take over the program  
at his alma mater. NMSU athletic director Jim Paul replaced Neil 
McCarthy with Henson, who agreed to be the interim coach for a 
salary of $1 a month. After the season, Henson signed a four-year 
contract that will run through his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once back, Henson realized he had lost none of his love for  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even after 40 some years, you put pressure on yourself to do  
it. It doesn't change,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State coach Rob Evans, who played for Henson at New  
Mexico State in the late '60s and was his assistant for six years, 
said Henson absolutely hates to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the most competitive person I've ever been around,''  
Evans said. ``Very few people know he's a champion checkers player. 
You don't want to play him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henson honed his talent for checkers and dominoes while growing  
up in Okay, Okla. (population 300 when Henson lived there). 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to do in Okay but play checkers and  
dominoes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a basketball court, said Evans, there are few coaches better  
than his old boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was tough, really tough on us. You knew when you hit that  
floor he was the boss and you were the worker,'' Evans said. ``But 
we could, after a ballgame, sit down and play cards with him. Very 
few people can balance both things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant coach Rus Bradburd described Henson as ``the George  
Foreman of college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like George, everybody thinks he's a nice guy and he is a  
genuinely good person. But you strip away the niceness, the smile 
and good nature and you find a fierce competitor,'' Bradburd said. 
``There's no complex formula. He just outworks people and now 
because of his experience, he outsmarts them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from New Mexico State, Henson was hired at Las  
Cruces High School as the junior varsity coach, then promoted to 
head coach. The school won three state championships and 103 of 119 
games in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, colleges were recruiting him.  
</P>
<P>
	Henson turned down an assistant's job at New Mexico to be the  
head coach at Hardin-Simmons. In four seasons there, Henson had a 
67-36 record. He returned to New Mexico State for 10 years, leading 
the Aggies to five NCAA tournaments and an overall 191-83 record. 
In 1969-70, the Aggies went 27-3, losing to UCLA in the semifinals 
of the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, Illinois hired Henson. In 21 seasons there his record  
was 423-225, and included 12 trips to the NCAA tournament and the 
Final Four in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson retired in 1996, but agreed to help NMSU when McCarthy  
was removed two days before the start of practice last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't going to coach again,'' Henson said. ``I had started  
playing golf. When Jim Paul approached me, I was shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now Henson plans to finish out his contract and doesn't  
think about what might have happened had he chosen an 
administrator's chair instead of a courtside bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I made the right decision,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Cubs' Wood Hospitalized for Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was hospitalized for  
precautionary testing Wednesday after the NL Rookie of the Year 
missed his third straight day of spring training workouts because 
of a lingering illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for putting him in is to get some blood cultures  
and see if we can pin down exactly what the cause is and just be 
careful and stay ahead of it,'' Cubs team physician Dr. John 
Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 21, struck out 20 batters in just his fifth major league  
start last year. He was bothered by a sore elbow at the end of last 
season, and began his offseason workout program earlier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, he developed an upper respiratory ailment. Then  
last week, Wood was hospitalized briefly with gastrointestinal 
problems that included diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. 
According to Marquardt, Wood lost 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we put him in was to get him rehydrated, which he  
did. He responded well,'' Marquardt said. ``And then over the 
weekend, he started with a cough. He started on medication Monday 
and he has persisted to have chills and fever in the early 
mornings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, having trouble keeping his energy level up, has been  
feeling better since beginning the medication. But Marquardt said 
the team wanted to do ``some more investigating to see if we can 
find if there is anything else going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 13-6 last year, participated in Sunday's first day of  
drills for pitchers and catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt good Sunday morning and then he started to get dizzy  
as the day went on. His temperature was about 101 and he 
struggled,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said missing time early in the spring  
isn't crucial. The full squad is scheduled for its first workout 
Friday, although Sammy Sosa won't participate until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love spring training, but we don't need six weeks,''  
Riggleman said. ``In this case, you are glad you got extra time. 
Kerry can catch up on his conditioning once he gets his strength 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood could remain in Mesa Lutheran Hospital for two days until  
test results are available, Marquardt said.

<HEADLINE> Govt Sets Up Medicare Fraud Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older Americans should learn to spot  
overcharges and other fraud on their Medicare statements, then 
report problems to the government, Attorney General Janet Reno and 
other officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare beneficiaries are the first line of defense'' against  
billing fraud, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients know the dates and times they see their doctors and  
what the doctors did, Reno said. Charges for anything else should 
trigger the suspicion that fraud might be involved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators and enforcement officials at a news conference  
tried to draw more attention to anti-fraud efforts, pointing out a 
government hotline and new public service advertisements that 
depict Medicare fraud as a dripping faucet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're actually asking you to be the eyes and ears of the  
Medicare system,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala said. ``If you're suspicious, call.'' Shalala said the 
patient's doctor or the HHS fraud watchdog line at 1-800-HHS-TIPS 
should be called. 
</P>
<P>
	Close scrutiny of Medicare bills are likely to turn up more  
examples of billing mistakes than of actual fraud, officials said. 
Reno and Shalala both characterized most doctors and hospitals as 
honest and suggested many billing problems can be corrected with a 
simple call to the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the anti-fraud campaign represents an insulting wedge  
between doctors and patients, said American Medical Association 
President Dr. Nancy Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's tactics are lamentable,'' Dickey said in a  
statement. ``It is counterproductive to demonize the entire medical 
community with the broad brush of fraud, waste and abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare lost about $12 billion -- 7 cents of every dollar spent  
-- to fraud, waste and mistakes in 1998, government auditors said 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss is about half what it was two years ago, due in part to  
stepped-up enforcement, Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a survey released in conjunction with the anti-fraud  
effort indicated Americans believe fraud runs rampant in the 
health-care system and that little is done to curb it. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 90 percent of those surveyed believe health-care fraud is  
increasing or holding steady, and close to eight in 10 said they 
are unaware of efforts to reduce the problem, the survey released 
by AARP suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of those surveyed thought health-care fraud is  
either extremely widespread or somewhat widespread. 
</P>
<P>

	Rap Artist Sets Grammy Award Record  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Breaking a record for female artists, hip-hop  
star Lauryn Hill Won five Grammy Awards Wednesday night. Another 
big winner was the ``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart Will Go On'' 
taking four awards, including song and record of the year. Hill 
stepped away from the Fugees to win album of the year for ``The 
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and best new artist. Madonna won 
three Grammys, including best pop album. Shania Twain, Stevie 
Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer Orchestra each were 
double winners.

	China Eyes Macedonia Punishment  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Punishing Macedonia for establishing ties  
with Taiwan, China said Wednesday it will cast its fifth veto in 
history to block the extension of a U.N. peacekeeping force in the 
former Yugoslav republic. Diplomats and human rights officials 
decried the decision, saying the peacekeepers were the only 
remaining barrier preventing the ethnic violence in Serbia's Kosovo 
province from spilling across the border into Macedonia. China 
severed ties with Macedonia after it established diplomatic 
relations with Taiwan last month.

	Americans Favor Troops in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than half of Americans say they favor  
U.S. participation in a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, but four 
out of five think President Clinton should get approval from 
Congress first, says a new Gallup poll. People were about evenly 
divided when asked whether they favored a U.S. role in NATO 
airstrikes against Serb military installations if the Serbs and 
ethnic Albanians fail to reach a peace agreement to end their 
yearlong conflict.

	Kurd Rebel Allowed To See Lawyers  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Lawyers defending Kurdish rebel chief  
Abdullah Ocalan have been granted permission to visit him for the 
first time since his capture last week, his attorneys said 
Wednesday. Turkish commandos seized Ocalan Feb. 16 in Kenya. He has 
been under interrogation since then, and his legal team has been 
worried about his treatment. Ocalan's rebel army has waged a bloody 
15-year struggle for autonomy in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated 
southeast. The conflict has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a live demonstration of the promise of a  
superfast Internet, a physician in Washington collaborated 
Wednesday night over a special high-speed network with surgeons 
working on a patient at a hospital in Ohio. The remote 
``operation'' took place over the $500 million Abilene Network, a 
new data pipeline that links more than three dozen research 
universities nationwide. It works at speeds 45,000 times faster 
than the best telephone modems that people now use to surf the Web.

	Study: Wait 18 Mos. for Pregnancy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spacing your kids 2 1/2 years apart may be ideal  
for producing a healthy, full-term baby, according to a study that 
found a sound medical basis for what many women are doing already. 
A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 
that while having babies too close together can be bad for the 
infants' health, having them too far apart may be even worse. Both 
situations raise the risk that the new baby will be premature or 
small, which can cause long-term health problems, even death.

	U.N. Mission To Be Shut in Angola  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council this week is  
preparing to shut down a U.N. mission in Angola, convinced that the 
military observers have no job to do because the 1994 peace accord 
they were overseeing have collapsed. On Wednesday, the United 
States, Russia and Portugal, the three nations overseeing the peace 
accord, circulated a draft resolution that would phase out U.N. 
Observers in Angola by March 20. The council was expected to adopt 
the resolution Friday.

<P>
	EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Paul Kariya scored the game winner and  
added an assist as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the Edmonton 
Oilers 2-1 Wednesday night. Kariya broke a 1-1 tie with 5:04 left 
in the third period when he took a drop pass from Steve Rucchin 
just inside the Edmonton blue line and fired a slap shot over 
goalie Steve Passmore's glove. Passmore was making his NHL debut 
after being called up earlier this week from the Hamilton Bulldogs 
of the AHL.

<HEADLINE>  Cubs' Wood Hospitalized for Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was hospitalized for  
precautionary testing Wednesday after the NL Rookie of the Year 
missed his third straight day of spring training workouts because 
of a lingering illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for putting him in is to get some blood cultures  
and see if we can pin down exactly what the cause is and just be 
careful and stay ahead of it,'' Cubs team physician Dr. John 
Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 21, struck out 20 batters in just his fifth major league  
start last year. He was bothered by a sore elbow at the end of last 
season, and began his offseason workout program earlier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, he developed an upper respiratory ailment. Then  
last week, Wood was hospitalized briefly with gastrointestinal 
problems that included diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. 
According to Marquardt, Wood lost 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we put him in was to get him rehydrated, which he  
did. He responded well,'' Marquardt said. ``And then over the 
weekend, he started with a cough. He started on medication Monday 
and he has persisted to have chills and fever in the early 
mornings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, having trouble keeping his energy level up, has been  
feeling better since beginning the medication. But Marquardt said 
the team wanted to do ``some more investigating to see if we can 
find if there is anything else going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 13-6 last year, participated in Sunday's first day of  
drills for pitchers and catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt good Sunday morning and then he started to get dizzy  
as the day went on. His temperature was about 101 and he 
struggled,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said missing time early in the spring  
isn't crucial. The full squad is scheduled for its first workout 
Friday, although Sammy Sosa won't participate until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love spring training, but we don't need six weeks,''  
Riggleman said. ``In this case, you are glad you got extra time. 
Kerry can catch up on his conditioning once he gets his strength 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood could remain in Mesa Lutheran Hospital for two days until  
test results are available, Marquardt said.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Goalie Potvin Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Islanders goaltender Felix  
Potvin was injured in practice on Wednesday and could be lost to 
the team for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said that Potvin suffered a groin injury and  
will be out for four to six weeks. The regular season ends on April 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders acquired Potvin in a trade with Toronto on Jan. 9,  
sending defenseman Bryan Berard to the Maple Leafs. The teams also 
swapped sixth-round picks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ended a season of grief in Toronto for Potvin, who left  
the team on Dec. 2 after he had been relegated to the No. 2 goalie 
position after the acquisition of Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin was Toronto's No. 1 goalie for five seasons, twice  
helping the Maple Leafs to the Western Conference finals, but was 
bumped to a backup role when Joseph signed a four-year, $24-million 
contract in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin started only five of the Maple Leafs' first 25 games,  
posting a 3-2 record with a goals-against average of 3.81. With the 
Islanders, Potvin has shared goaltending duties with Tommy Salo.

<HEADLINE> Hill, Twain Are Early Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lauryn Hill's solo debut album ``The  
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' and the hit single ``Doo Wop (That 
Thing)'' won the hip-hop star three Grammys awards Wednesday night. 
The ``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart Will Go On'' won three, including 
song of the year, and Madonna also won three. 
</P>
<P>
	Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Brian Setzer Orchestra were  
double winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, whose 10 nominations led a parade of women up for awards,  
won best rhythm and blues album, best R&AMP;B song and the R&AMP;B vocal 
performance Grammy for ``Doo Wop.'' She had three remaining chances 
during the CBS-TV broadcast from the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	She lost a major category in the pre-telecast when non-classical  
producer of the year went to Rob Cavallo, who worked with the Goo 
Goo Dolls, Green Day and Alanis Morissette. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, 23, and her acclaimed album -- mixing rap and R&AMP;B, and  
touching on family and political issues -- had a chance to win the 
most Grammys ever by a female artist in one night. Carole King won 
four in 1971 for ``Tapestry.'' Hill has two past Grammys from her 
stint with the Fugees. 
</P>
<P>
	No hip-hop artist has won album of the year, a category  
dominated this year by women. Other contenders: Sheryl Crow's ``The 
Globe Sessions,'' Madonna's ``Ray of Light,'' Twain for ``Come on 
Over,'' and ``Version 2.0'' by alternative rocker Garbage, led by 
singer Shirley Manson. (No hip-hop artist has ever won song or 
record of the year, either.) 
</P>
<P>
	Crow, a five-time Grammy winner in recent years, and country-pop  
crossover sensation Twain received six nominations each. Madonna 
had five bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also dominated the record of the year category. Madonna's  
``Ray of Light'' and Twain's ``You're Still the One'' were up 
against Brandy &AMP; Monica (``The Boy Is Mine''), Celine Dion (``My 
Heart Will Go On'') and the lone male entry, ``Iris,'' by the Goo 
Goo Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're Still the One'' won best country song for Twain and  
husband Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and female country vocal 
performance for Twain. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Heart Will Go On'' brought the female pop vocal trophy to  
Dion and honors to writers James Horner and Will Jennings as best 
song written for a motion picture or television. The writers also 
won for song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Madonna got the first musical Grammy of her career -- best dance  
recording for ``Ray of Light.'' The song also won short form music 
video. Her only previous Grammy was for video in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brian Setzer Orchestra, riding the swing revival, captured  
two pop honors, performance by a duo or group and instrumental 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The male R&AMP;B vocal Grammy went to Wonder for ``St. Louis  
Blues.'' The tune also earned him and two colleagues the award for 
instrumental arrangement with vocals. The two Grammys brought 
Wonder's career total to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	That ties him with Pierre Boulez, who also won two Wednesday  
night -- orchestral performance and opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Sir Georg Solti, Quincy Jones and Vladimir Horowitz have  
won more. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandy &AMP; Monica won the R&AMP;B duo or group performance trophy for  
``The Boy Is Mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In rap categories, Jay-Z's ``Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life'' won  
best album. The rapper had said he would skip the show because he 
doesn't like the way the Grammys treat rap. In other awards, the 
Beastie Boys won duo or group performance for ``Intergalactic'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 12th Grammy victory of the 1990s, Eric Clapton won male  
pop vocal for ``My Father's Eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Bacharach had his first win since 1986, giving him Grammys  
in three different decades. He and Elvis Costello won for pop 
collaboration with vocals on ``I Still Have That Other Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Cash, Mel Torme, Smokey Robinson and the late Sam Cooke  
and Otis Redding each received lifetime achievement awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at the 41st annual 
Grammy Awards. Rosie O'Donnell served as master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The songwriting teams of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe,  
Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller 
were honored with trustees' awards for outstanding contributions by 
nonperformers.

<HEADLINE> Broaddrick Details Alleged Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At times tearful, Juanita Broaddrick appeared  
on national television Wednesday describing an alleged sexual 
assault by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little bit uneasy, but I felt a real friendship toward  
this man and I really didn't feel any danger'' in letting him come 
up to her Little Rock, Ark., hotel room during a nursing 
administrators' conference in 1978, she told NBC's ``Dateline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, taped Jan. 20 but held by the network until  
Wednesday night, Mrs. Broaddrick cried briefly as she detailed the 
alleged assault and she said of Clinton, ``my hatred for him is 
overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said he forced himself on her when she ``pushed him away and  
told him `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who was attorney general of Arkansas in 1978, refused  
comment earlier Wednesday on Mrs. Broaddrick's allegations, saying 
he stood by the statement of his attorney, David Kendall, who 
called the accusations ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick told NBC nobody tried to intimidate her to  
remain silent and no one paid her to keep quiet or to speak out. 
She said she had filed an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case denying she'd had any unwelcome advances from 
Clinton because she was unwilling to tell her story at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Word that NBC's Lisa Myers had interviewed Mrs. Broaddrick last  
month had buzzed through the Internet and media gossip circles. 
Clinton opponents accused NBC of sitting on the interview in order 
to protect the president. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC denied that, saying it needed time to complete reporting on  
a complicated story. While the network tried to check out Mrs. 
Broaddrick's account, The Wall Street Journal did its own interview 
with Mrs. Broaddrick and other media organizations followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't hold it inside any longer,'' Mrs. Broaddrick  
said in trying to explain why she is finally coming forward with 
her account. She said she didn't want her granddaughters and nieces 
asking her, ``Why didn't you tell what this man did to you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she was unable to recall when Clinton  
assaulted her, so NBC tracked down the fact that a nursing 
conference had been held at the hotel where she was staying on 
April 25, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also tried to check Clinton's whereabouts that day --  
receiving no help from the White House on that question. After an 
exhaustive search, the network said it found no evidence that 
Clinton had any public event the morning of the alleged assault and 
ample evidence from various public records that he was in Little 
Rock later that day.

<HEADLINE> Schilling's Agent Makes Prediction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Curt Schilling threw 10 minutes of  
batting practice on Wednesday and treated it like it was Game 7 of 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Schilling's agent predicted that if the reigning NL  
strikeout leader is going to pitch in October for real, it's going 
to have to be with the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intense interest from contenders such as Cleveland and  
Baltimore, agent Jeff Borris said he doesn't expect the Phillies to 
trade the 32-year-old right-hander this spring -- or even this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My take is that there are a lot of teams interested in Curt  
Schilling, but (general manager) Ed Wade won't trade him,'' Borris 
said. ``I wish Ed would change his stance on that, but he won't. So 
I don't think Curt's going anywhere in the near or distant 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even at the July 31 trade deadline, by which time the  
Atlanta Braves may already be planning another division 
championship celebration? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even think it will happen then,'' Borris said. ``This  
is all in Ed Wade's hands. Maybe one day, Ed will wake up and 
decide, `I'm going to trade Curt Schilling today.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, the fifth pitcher with 300 strikeouts in consecutive  
seasons, goes for Nolan Ryan's major league record of three 
straight this year. When he arrived for spring training last week, 
Schilling said he's ``holding out hope'' that Wade will change his 
mind and trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here and contend on this club,'' Schilling said.  
``If that's not going to happen in the immediate future and they 
move me to a club that is contending, then I would see if we can 
work something out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling was cheered loudly as he arrived for the Phillies'  
first full-squad workout on Wednesday. And let's just say that 
Schilling took his 10-minute session of throwing batting practice 
very seriously -- glaring ominously at batters and cursing every 
time the ball didn't go exactly where he'd planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``His concentration and his preparation are unbelievable,''  
Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``For those 10 minutes, you 
could have been standing behind the plate making faces, and he 
wouldn't have noticed. He's very impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't change the fact that what Schilling wants more than  
strikeouts or complete games is a chance to get to the World Series 
-- something the Indians, Orioles and any number of other possible 
suitors can offer faster than the Phillies can. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt's problem is he loves Philadelphia,'' Borris said. ``His  
home is in Philadelphia, his family is in Philadelphia. He had a 
taste of the World Series in 1993, but they didn't win it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd love to recapture that magic of playing in the World  
Series with the Phillies. But that doesn't seem like it's going to 
happen, with the direction the organization is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, 32, was 15-14 with a 3.25 ERA last season for the  
Phillies, who were 75-87 and finished 31 games behind first-place 
Atlanta. He has two years left on a three-year contract that pays 
him $15.9 million with an option for 2001 at $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	What if Wade doesn't change his mind?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll ever accept it,'' Borris said. ``Curt's a  
competitor. He wants to win at everything he does.''

<HEADLINE> '60 Minutes' Plans ALS Follow-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After hearing from angry viewers, CBS's ``60  
Minutes'' will present an alternative to Dr. Jack Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	This Sunday, the newsmagazine will do a follow-up story about  
patients living with Lou Gehrig's disease after many of them 
complained about being demoralized when the network showed 
Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to an ALS sufferer. 
</P>
<P>
	The program sparked widespread debate about euthanasia last  
November when it aired a tape of Kevorkian administering drugs to 
Thomas Youk, a Michigan man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also was criticized for airing videotape of a person dying  
on prime-time television, particularly since it came during a 
``sweeps'' period when ratings are used to set advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely unnoticed at the time was the ``furious'' reaction of  
other people with the disease, said Dr. Stan Appel, director of a 
treatment center for ALS patients at Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
	``It angered a lot of our patients that the focus was so  
misplaced,'' Appel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Hewitt, executive producer for ``60 Minutes,'' said he and  
Mike Wallace decided to do the follow-up story after it was 
suggested to them by a caller on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's story, titled ``Choosing Life,'' will feature a handful  
of people who are living with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers criticized ``60 Minutes'' because it ``never showed us  
people who made a choice other than Kevorkian,'' Hewitt said, ``and 
I thought that was a legitimate thing to show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second story is not an indication that ``60 Minutes'' was  
having second thoughts about the Kevorkian segment, he said, nor 
does it indicate that its producers are particularly susceptible to 
public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Lewis, host of an annual Muscular Dystrophy Association  
telethon, was among the people who wrote to Hewitt complaining 
about the Kevorkian segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said it ``amplified the fear'' of people who have the  
disease or who will get a diagnosis of it in the future.

<HEADLINE>  BoSox Offerman Takes It in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Don't expect Jose Offerman to do what Mo  
Vaughn did for the Boston Red Sox. And don't expect the $26 million 
man to apologize for a contract criticized as too rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Free agency cost the team Vaughn, who hit 40 homers last season,  
and brought them Offerman, who has 22 since he arrived in the 
majors in 1990 with Los Angeles. While the Red Sox wouldn't give 
Vaughn the $80 million contract Anaheim did, they rewarded Offerman 
with a four-year deal averaging $6.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a .278 career hitter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what people say,'' Offerman said Wednesday. ``I  
believe they paid me for a reason and thank God it happened with 
them because there was another team that was interested in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland appeared to be Boston's main competition for Offerman,  
although he said Baltimore and Seattle also were interested. 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism of the contract ``really doesn't bother me,'' Red  
Sox general manager Dan Duquette said. ``We're paying him about 
what we pay (third baseman) John Valentin. That, to me, is like the 
going rate for qualified established major-league infielders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract, though, and his connection with Vaughn could make  
Fenway Park fans impatient for Offerman to produce. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fair to compare myself with him,'' Offerman said.  
``We are two different players, and the things he can do are hard 
for me to do. My job is to be on base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did that well the past three years with Kansas City, hitting  
.303, .297 and a career-high .315. He led the majors with 13 
triples last season and was fifth in the American League with a 
.403 on-base percentage and 45 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to Kansas City after the 1995 season in a trade from Los  
Angeles. During his stay with the Dodgers, he led the majors in 
errors in three times, causing strained relations with manager 
Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
	His defense and hitting both improved in Kansas City, where he  
was the everyday second baseman the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference was that I was a lot more comfortable there,''  
Offerman said. ``It was hard for me to play (in Los Angeles). There 
was a lot of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second base is his favorite position, although he could see time  
as at first and at designated hitter with Boston. He took grounders 
at second with the other starting infielders Wednesday, although 
his main competitor for the starting job, Jeff Frye, has a strained 
rib area that limited his activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young in LA,'' said Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez,  
a fellow Dominican and Offerman's teammate on the Dodgers in 1993. 
``It was a rough field. It's not only Jose who had some problems in 
the past in Dodger Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez may have eased Offerman's transition to Fenway Park;  
more Dominican fans showed up when Martinez pitched. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there will be the focus on Vaughn's departure and  
Offerman's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to try to do the things he does because my job is  
a lot different than his,'' Offerman said. ``He's got a lot more 
power than me. My job is to be on base for the rest of the guys. 
The money is no reason for me to change.''

<HEADLINE> Match Play Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- As if playing Tiger Woods wasn't tough  
enough, Nick Faldo had to deal with two distractions on the 14th 
hole in the opening round of the Andersen Consulting Match Play 
Championship at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
	First, someone's cell phone went off on the downswing of his tee  
shot, and he jerked it dead left into some trees, with the ball 
sailing only about 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, the 64th seed in the $5 million tournament, glared at the  
offender. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was right behind the tee boxes,'' said Woods, the top seed.  
``It was a shame that that happened. People just need to turn their 
phones off, or not even bring them. They are not even allowed on 
the golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Faldo backed away from a putt on 14 when a TV cameraman  
moved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy took up his tripod, started walking off, and Nick had  
a crucial putt to make,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods pushed his tee shot well right on 14 and also shot a bogey  
as the players halved the hole. Woods won the match 4 and 3, and 
was scheduled to play Bob Tway today. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CASH &AMP; CARRY:* Shed no tears for the first-round losers. They  
each get $25,000. Those who lose their second-round matches today 
get $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE HARDWARE:* The trophy created for the Match Play  
Championship has been named The Walter Hagen Cup. The flamboyant 
Hagen (1892-1969) is widely recognized as one of the most 
successful match play golfers in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen was credited by many for modernizing the game. He was the  
first professional to make a living playing golf rather than 
teaching, the first to cash in on endorsements and was noted for 
his colorful wardrobe while everyone else wore drab colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said he ``never wanted to be a millionaire, just live like  
one.'' The winner of Sunday's 36-hole championship match will win 
$1 million, plus a replica of the Hagen Cup, which was made by 
Wedgwood, a sister company of Waterford crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen's 11 major titles included five PGA Championships (1921,  
1924-27), which were then match play competitions. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DORAL DOINGS:* The Doral Open used to be considered the  
unofficial start of the PGA Tour, the first tournament of the 
Florida swing when international players began arriving to begin 
preparations for the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	But now that the $5 million Match Play Championship is on the  
schedule, the top players in the world are leaving Doral high and 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods is playing his fifth consecutive tournament this  
week, and he's not about to make it six in a row, so he'll skip 
Doral. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto for David Duval, who planned on playing Doral and then  
taking the rest of the March off until The Players Championship, 
also decided to skip next week. Ernie Els isn't coming, and neither 
is Mark O'Meara. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in Fred Couples, Phil Mickelson, Payne Stewart and Tom  
Watson -- all of them plan to take the week off, and most will head 
to the Honda Classic a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament director Scott Montgomery was holding out hope that  
some of these big names would change their mind if they were 
eliminated early in match play. 
</P>
<P>
	``This match play format is so different, so new,'' Montgomery  
said. ``I want to withhold comment until we see what happens this 
week. These players aren't used to being cut on Wednesday. 
Three-fourths of the field will be eliminated by Thursday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Price offered one other reason why Doral could take a  
beating -- those who make it to the weekend at La Costa would be too 
worn out after playing six matches in five days, including a 
36-hole final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard to pick your clubs up and play next  
week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WATSON'S CADDY:* Tom Watson has signed to represent Cadillac on  
the Senior Tour, which he'll join after he turns 50 on Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who won eight majors, said he'll drive an Escalade, a  
sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a little too fancy for me,'' he said ``I look  
forward to getting one and getting it muddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson lost to Bob Tway on Wednesday, 6 and 4.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall, 30-Yr Yields Rise / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bond yields shot up to a  
six-month high Wednesday as the market declined sharply for a 
second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were disappointed with a Treasury auction of two-year  
notes and continued to fret about Federal Reserve policy as the 
central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, wrapped up two days of 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 3/32  
points, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.51 percent from 5.43 percent 
late Tuesday and 5.35 percent Monday. It was the highest yield for 
30-year bonds since Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the decline in the bond market came late in the  
afternoon following a Treasury auction of $15 billion in two-year 
notes, which drew only lukewarm interest from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is a perception in the market that the next  
policy move by the Fed, which cut a key short-term interest rate 
three times last year, will be to raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's two days of testimony before congressional  
committees was interpreted as signaling that if an economic 
slowdown doesn't occur, the central bank is prepared to increase 
interest rates to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates would hurt bond prices by making the  
yields on bonds already in circulation less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were off as much as 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities were off 3/8 
point to 17/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 5.3 
points to 1,287.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills held at 4.65 percent as the  
discount was unchanged from Tuesday at 4.54 percent. Six-month 
yields rose to 4.68 percent, as the discount rose 0.04 percentage 
point to 4.52 percent. One-year yields rose to 4.80 percent as the 
discount rose by 0.04 percentage point from late Monday to 4.59 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 23/32 from 125 1/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.17 percent from 5.15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Alomars Reunited With Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- The Indians were back together on  
Wednesday, and so were the Alomars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't feel like anything special yet, because it's  
still spring training,'' Sandy said as Cleveland held its first 
full-squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Roberto, left the Baltimore Orioles as a free agent  
and signed a $32 million, four-year contract with the Indians. The 
addition of the Gold Glove second baseman gives Cleveland an 
All-Star at every position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will feel more special when the regular season begins,''  
Sandy said. ``But this is really a thrill for both of us, because 
we've always dreamed about being on the same team in the major 
leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of designated hitter, there won't be any  
competition for jobs in camp. The DH spot will be contested by Wil 
Cordero, signed a few weeks before camp, and Richie Sexson, who hit 
.310 in the second half of last season while filling in for injured 
first baseman Jim Thome. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, who spent last season with the White Sox, is getting  
another chance at a fresh start with Cleveland. Two years ago, 
while with Boston, he was convicted of attacking his wife and 
remains on probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians signed him at the urging of the Alomar brothers.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a chance for me to show what kind of person I  
am,'' Cordero said. ``And for me to come to the organization like 
the Cleveland Indians is a dream come true. I want the people in 
the Cleveland organization to know that I won't disappoint them or 
the fans. I don't think anybody is perfect, and I am willing to get 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said the loser of the DH duel will still  
make the team as a bench player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing we've got to be alert for is complacency,'' Hargrove  
said. ``We need to be aware of it, and we'll take steps to combat 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were criticized last year for playing uninspired  
baseball in the second half. They went 39-38 after the All-Star 
break, but still easily clinched another AL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning up the intensity level is one of the club's goals for  
this season. When the players arrived at camp, they found T-shirts 
in their lockers that said: ``100+: Go Hard or Go Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 doesn't stand for 100 percent, but 100 wins.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us to set the tone from Day 1,'' Hargrove  
said. ``And I think we did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Hargrove greeted 56 players, who began the day by  
completing the dreaded ``Warrior Run,'' an 850-yard sprint arranged 
by strength and conditioning coach Fernando Montes. Pitchers 
Charles Nagy, Richard Negrette, and shortstop Omar Vizquel led the 
pack, finishing in a three-way tie for first 2 minutes, 46 seconds. 
``This thing has taken on monstrous proportions,'' Hargrove said of 
the run, which Kevin Mitchell couldn't finish a couple of years 
ago. ``It's like the Great Wall of China.'' ... Thome did not take 
part in the run, and held a limited workout because of a sore back. 
``It locked up on me a couple of days ago,'' Thome said. ``I don't 
think it's anything serious. I had something like this in spring 
training a couple of years ago.''

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Revamps Takeover Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Olivetti SpA early Thursday morning filed a  
revamped initial takeover offer for Telecom Italia which leaves 
unchanged the basic financial details first announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, after many hours of consultations with Italian  
stock-market regulator Consob, said it would offer more than $58 
billion in cash, bonds and shares for Telecom's shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's board of directors met throughout the night in Milan  
to discuss Consob's earlier ruling that the company's initial bid 
to take over Telecom Italia required modifications to be legally 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the regulatory agency Consob gave Telecom, the  
world's sixth-largest phone company, breathing space to start 
mounting a defense against the hostile bid by a rival one-fifth its 
size. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti also said Thursday that the tender offer for the  
telecom company's shares will begin on an unspecified day in April 
and that a detailed calendar for the offer will be agreed upon with 
the stock-market regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a date for a tender offer had been a key omission in  
Olivetti's initial announcement last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob's final approval of this offer is expected anytime within  
the next 15 days. With this filing, however, Telecom can't alter 
its capital or share structure, in accordance with Italian law, 
unless Consob rules against Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has long been dominated by national companies accustomed  
to little if any competition within their respective borders. Since 
the deregulation of Europe's telecommunications industry last year, 
established companies have begun to face a growing challenge from 
entrepreneurial firms like Olivetti, a former maker of typewriters 
and computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board of directors was to meet Thursday to try to  
forge a strategy for fending off the Olivetti bid. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Telecom's options is to merge with Telecom Italia Mobile,  
a cellular phone company in which it already holds a 60-percent 
stake. Such a merger appeared initially as a way for Telecom to 
make Olivetti's takeover effort much more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a surprise move late Wednesday, Consob announced that  
Olivetti's bid would not have to include an offer for any of the 40 
percent of shares in the cellular phone subsidiary that are not 
owned by Telecom Italia. This additional stake in Italia Mobile has 
a market value of about $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Consob cautioned that it would reconsider its ruling at the time  
of Olivetti's revised bid. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Telecom's chief executive Franco Bernabe gave no  
details of a possible merger when he met with union officials 
earlier Wednesday. He emphasized, however, that he expected the 
Italian government to remain neutral in Telecom's struggle with 
Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, a former government monopoly, was privatized in 1997.  
The Italian Treasury retains 3.4 percent of Telecom shares and has 
veto power over all major decisions through the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that veto power, Italy's Premier Massimo D'Alema has  
said his government will not choose sides in the takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Treasury said Wednesday that it has started the process  
necessary for selling its stake in Telecom.

<HEADLINE> Defense: Marine Pilot Not Trained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The pilot of a Marine jet that hit an  
Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people, was neither qualified nor 
adequately trained for the fatal low-level mission, a defense 
witness testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Milton Miller, who helped the Air Force establish its low-level  
training standards, was the second defense witness to testify today 
after prosecutors rested their case against Capt. Richard Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the EA-6B Prowler that severed the cable on Feb. 3,  
1998, was ``not proficient, especially Captain Ashby,'' Miller 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not have this kind of training and that led to what  
happened in the mishap valley,'' he said, echoing a prosecution 
witness' statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Air Force pilot and pilot instructor also testified  
that his research while drafting the low-level flying standards 
showed pilots ``are not adept at telling their altitude and 
distance. We are not radar with our eyes. We are not laser beams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested after presenting exhibits, including  
cameras and two navigation bags, to jurors. They had questioned 55 
witnesses during 11 days of testimony, which ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness for the defense was 1st Lt. William  
Shouviller, a Marine topographical map expert who had testified for 
the government. He said the vertical scale on a topographical model 
of the valley where the accident occurred was exaggerated about 2.5 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	So the judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, recessed court so the  
model could be fixed to reflect the proper scale. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was  
flying recklessly low and fast a year ago when his EA-6B Prowler 
severed a ski gondola cable and dropped 20 passengers to their 
deaths near Cavalese, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's attorneys say he was the victim of a malfunctioning  
radar altimeter, a map that didn't have the gondola marked on it 
and an optical illusion that made him think the plane was higher 
than it was. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, among other  
charges, and could be sentenced to more than 200 years in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two government witnesses testified Tuesday that Ashby  
wasn't qualified to fly the low-level training route because he 
hadn't flown a similar one for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this particular crew that had lapsed in their  
qualification, it's a little too much to ask too soon,'' said Lt. 
Col. James Brubaker, a Prowler navigation expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Brubaker also said the flight wasn't conducted properly because  
the crew didn't time themselves along the route and were flying too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Navigator Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., is to  
be tried next month on the same involuntary manslaughter charges. 
Charges were dismissed against the two other men aboard, Capt. 
William Raney, 27, of Englewood, Colo., and Capt. Chandler 
Seagraves, 29, of Nineveh, Ind.

<HEADLINE> Labor Unions Target Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sued vigorously and taxed heavily, the tobacco  
industry has come under attack by yet another opponent: labor 
unions trying to recover billions of dollars in medical costs for 
sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of more than a dozen federal lawsuits went to trial  
this week in Akron, Ohio, with 114 Ohio union health funds 
demanding $2 billion and contending Big Tobacco used images like 
Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man specifically to sell cigarettes to 
blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming two weeks after a $51.5 million verdict against Philip  
Morris in California and several months after $246 billion in 
settlements with the 50 states, it raises the question: How much 
can cigarette makers take before the gouges leave permanent damage? 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody suggests the industry is ready to crumble. While  
cigarette company stocks are down, the two biggest players, Philip 
Morris and RJR Nabisco, are involved in many more businesses than 
just tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't call it Big Tobacco for nothing. It's not on its  
knees yet,'' said Carl Bogus, a product-liability expert at Roger 
Williams University. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the trust funds in the class-action suit, led by  
Iron Workers Local Union No. 17 Insurance Fund, join a litigant 
list that is spreading beyond smokers to health plans seeking 
damages for smoking's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio lawsuit, filed in May 1997, claims documents show  
tobacco companies targeted vulnerable blue-collar workers through 
popular advertising images. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry was aware that people with lower incomes  
and less education ... are more susceptible to the advertising,'' 
Mike Withey, an attorney from Seattle representing the plaintiffs, 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing illegal about advertising, the companies contend.  
However, one defendant, the Liggett Group Inc., an industry 
maverick, settled and plans to cooperate with the unions' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs suing cigarette manufacturers have run the gamut:  
flight attendants; the nations of Guatemala, Panama and Bolivia; a 
pediatrician with emphysema who is a lead plaintiff in a $200 
billion class-action suit filed on behalf of Florida smokers. Now 
President Clinton has threatened to sue tobacco companies to 
recover smoking-related Medicare expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is under siege,'' Paul Patton, governor of the  
tobacco-growing state of Kentucky, said last month. ``There's a 
limit to what this product can bear, and we're coming close to that 
limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union plans like Ohio's, and any suits on Medicare's behalf,  
form a new ring of plaintiffs that some call ``secondhand 
entities'' -- organizations or governments that claim financial 
damage, as opposed to individual smokers claiming cigarettes made 
them sick. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, the union cases have been largely unsuccessful.  
Nine have been thrown out, with some judges saying the unions had 
no legal standing unless they filed separate lawsuits on behalf of 
every smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	``These claims are too remote. They've been a resounding  
failure,'' said Steven Rissman, assistant general counsel for 
Philip Morris. ``Akron is certainly an aberration. We're not 
concerned about floodgates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, a victory in Ohio ``would clearly break new  
ground,'' said Richard Daynard, chairman of the anti-cigarette 
Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Because last year's settlement with the states immunized  
companies from individual states' lawsuits, he said, many believed 
the industry ``would be basically home free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now apparent that they're far from it,'' Daynard said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they settle this, they're in very bad shape,'' because  
``presumably you have other health-care providers in the wings. If 
they lose, they're in even worse shape because they've proven to 
people there's no reason these suits can't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits alleging financial damage are more about economics than  
justice, says Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton University health 
economist. He calls the union suits ``a profitable roulette game'' 
that won't last. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, the judicial system is probably going to put a  
stop to it. Because they'll say they're killing an industry,'' 
Reinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The litigation has helped push some tobacco stocks down sharply.  
Philip Morris sold for $40.87 1/2 as of midday Wednesday, down 19 
percent from its 52-week high; Loew's Inc., owner of Lorillard, 
sold for $79.56 1/4, down more than 26 percent. Others have dropped 
less drastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, a tobacco analyst at Solomon Smith Barney,  
acknowledges the high-profile cases -- and the sensitive internal 
industry documents they've dislodged -- can scare investors. But 
he's hardly staying away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big settlements encourage the plaintiff bar to seek further  
ways of profiting from the tobacco pot,'' Feldman said. ``But at 
the end of the day, they face an industry that's well-funded and 
substantially has the law on its side.''

<HEADLINE> Seniors May Lack Good Nutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The generation that raised its kids on the four  
basic food groups may be lacking some of the basics of good 
nutrition: vitamins, minerals and water. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of nutritionists at Tufts University is recommending  
that healthy people 70 years and older drink more water, eat foods 
that are more rich in nutrients and increase the amount of fiber in 
their diets. 
</P>
<P>
	To make their point, the nutritionists have proposed for seniors  
a modified version of the food pyramid, which replaced the basic 
four -- the milk group, meat group, bread-cereals group and 
vegetable-fruit group. 
</P>
<P>
	The new recommendations, to be published in the March issue of  
The Journal of Nutrition, are aimed at helping seniors live 
healthier lives while slowing the onset of medical problems 
associated with aging, including heart disease, osteoporosis and 
hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	``This pyramid is especially designed to give them a little more  
guidance on how to optimize their diet,'' said Alice Lichtenstein, 
a professor of nutrition at Tufts who worked on the study. ``It's 
not suggesting that radical changes be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new food pyramid modifies the original 1992 Food Guide  
Pyramid, which is based on guidelines of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The new pyramid includes roughly the same minimum number of  
daily servings as the original: six or more servings of breads and 
grains, two or more servings of fruit, three or more of vegetables, 
two or more servings of meat, three servings of dairy products and 
a small amount of fats and sweets. 
</P>
<P>
	Because older people need fewer calories and generally eat less,  
the researchers recommend a higher concentration of nutrients with 
each serving. At the grocery store, that translates to choosing 
darker, more nutrient-rich vegetables and cereals fortified with 
vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors should also consider eating foods with more fiber to  
keep their intestines healthy. For example, someone could eat an 
apple instead of just having a glass of apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
	The modified pyramid also stresses the need for water -- the  
equivalent of eight 8-ounce glasses a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors are at greater risk for dehydration than younger people  
because their bodies are less effective at letting them know when 
they need water, Lichtenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, the new pyramid is topped with a flag suggesting that  
some might need supplements of calcium and vitamins D and B-12. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, many seniors do not get enough calcium,  
in part because they drink less milk. Limited exposure to the sun 
can cut back on vitamin D, and many older people do not properly 
absorb vitamin B-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortified cereals and orange juice with extra calcium, as well  
as pills, could help compensate for deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Before changing their diets, seniors should take time to  
evaluate their current eating habits. Lichtenstein said they might 
only need a minor change in habit, such as eating wheat bread 
instead of white or eating more green vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should really take a look at their diet and see whether  
over a few days they're getting an adequate number of servings in 
each category,'' she said. ``Then I personally would suggest that 
before they go down the vitamin aisle that they talk to their 
health care provider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nutritionists based their recommendations on studies  
gathered within the past 20 years along with recent recommended 
dietary allowances produced by the Food and Nutrition Board of the 
National Academy of Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Over-40 Boxers Division Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus still draws a big gallery, and  
Jimmy Connors yet has his admirers. Now some former fighters think 
there might be a market for an over-40 boxing division. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapel Hill attorney Rick Snider officially unveiled ``Legends  
of Boxing'' at a news conference on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jack Nicklaus plays on the senior tour, he may be past  
the days when he could win a Masters or a U.S. or a British Open. 
But still, they come in thousands to see the master,'' Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has skills that the public is delighted to see, and  
we feel the same way about the boxers,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, 
there hasn't been a way to present these people to the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are in the works for a parade of champions to be held in  
Raleigh in May, followed during the same month by a night of boxing 
at Reynolds Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The division has been sanctioned by the International Boxing  
Council. It is being billed as a level for ``mature fighters who 
have held, or fought for, a sanctioned world championship title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great things about Legends is the guys who will be  
fighting are already legends and well-known to the public,'' Snider 
said. ``I think they will make great bouts. I think the public will 
be delighted to see these guys come back and fight again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides promoting boxing, Snider sees the Legends boxers as  
mentors who will guide young fighters through their careers in the 
ring as well as outside of it. On the Legends' mission statement is 
a call for older fighters to encourage the up-and-coming to develop 
their characters as well as their skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a character component so that we're not only fighting  
championship fighters, but fighters of good character that the 
younger fighters could emulate and admire,'' Snider said, noting 
that he hopes to have Legends fighters in all weight categories. 
</P>
<P>
	James ``Bonecrusher'' Smith said the concept was his idea. The  
former World Boxing Association champion pitched the plan to the 
IBC during a meeting in Pittsburgh last December. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the idea from the hoopla surrounding the proposed Larry  
Holmes-George Foreman fight, which has run into one snag after 
another and apparently won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	`They liked the idea, and we've been working it and working  
it,'' Smith said. ``I'm just happy to see that we're at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snider said the organizers have taken into account the need for  
safety measures for fighters who might put their health in peril by 
trying to recapture past glory. He said rounds might be shorter, 
the rings might be smaller and heavier gloves would be used to 
prevent serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those things might be crossing Smith's mind. At 45, Smith  
is going to open the Legends series against Don Steele, who didn't 
appear to be of age for the Legends division. How old is he? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Smith said. ``Everybody's younger.''

<HEADLINE> NC State Closes Out Old Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- This was just the way N.C. State wanted to  
close Reynolds Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Harrington broke out of a five-game slump with 22 points  
and North Carolina State kept its NCAA hopes alive with a 71-63 win 
over Florida State Wednesday night in the final regular-season 
men's game played at the 50-year-old arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Hale scored 20 points to lead Florida State (12-15, 5-10  
Atlantic Coast Conference), which lost for the eighth time in nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack (17-11, 6-9) led by 12 at halftime and pushed the  
lead to 18 in the opening six minutes of the second half. But 
Florida State employed a swarming full-court pressure to climb back 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles held N.C. State without a field goal for four  
minutes and Hale hit a jumper from just inside the 3-point line to 
cut the Wolfpack's lead to 52-45 with 9:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Wells sank a 12-foot jumper 20 seconds later but Justin Mott  
hit two free throws and Terrell Baker scored twice to draw Florida 
State within four at 55-51. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack pushed the lead to eight over the next three  
minutes, sending the raucous capacity crowd into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Baker calmly made two free throws with 2:25 remaining to cut  
N.C. State's lead to six. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Inge, playing in his second game back from a one-game  
suspension, missed an uncontested two-handed dunk that would've 
given the Pack an eight-point lead with less than two minutes to 
play. But Ron Anderson scored on a short jumper with 1:34 left to 
put the Pack up 65-57. 
</P>
<P>
	Damous Anderson scored inside with a minute left and Delvon  
Arrington sank two free throws with 49.4 seconds left to trim the 
deficit to four. 
</P>
<P>
	But Florida State got no closer as Wells, Harrington and Inge  
went 6 of 10 from the free-throw line in the final minute to keep 
the Seminoles at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles outrebounded N.C. State 34-22 in a 71-59 win on  
Jan. 23. But the Wolfpack, inspired by the thunderous crowd, 
dominated the glass in the first half Wednesday, posting a 32-14 
edge on the boards by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State led for most of the first half but Oliver Simmons  
split two free throws with 11:15 left to trim the lead to 17-14. 
But a short jumper by Anthony Grundy a minute later started a 13-4 
Wolfpack spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrington had hit a combined 9-of-39 shots (23 percent) in N.C.  
State's last five games. But he scored eight points during the run, 
capping it with a 3-pointer from the right wing with 3:52 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale sank a 3-pointer to draw Florida State within nine but Ron  
Kelley had two baskets in the final 1:26 to restore the Wolfpack's 
double-digit lead by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack finished with a 588-173 record at Reynolds,  
including a 189-134 mark against ACC foes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Gov. Jim Hunt presented the game's ball to  
former N.C. State player Vic Bubas, who scored the first basket in 
Reynolds Coliseum 50 years ago. The arena's lights were then dimmed 
except for a lone spotlight and former Wolfpack All-Americans David 
Thompson and Tom Burleson; Pam Valvano, the wife of former N.C. 
State coach Jim Valvano, athletic director Les Robinson, current 
Wolfpack coach Herb Sendek and former N.C. State coach Norm Sloan 
passed a ball among them to loud cheers. Sloan banked in a lay-up 
amid a barrage of flashing cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolfpack will move into a $158 million arena about four  
miles from Reynolds Coliseum next season. The Wolfpack men's team 
will share the still unfinished arena with the NHL's Carolina 
Hurricanes next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The N.C State women's basketball team will continue to play its  
home games at Reynolds.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Consolidates TV Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NASCAR, the only sport to see its television  
ratings increase each year this decade, will consolidate its 
broadcast rights to help cash in on its increasing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR announced on Wednesday that it will no longer allow race  
tracks to negotiate separate TV deals, returning to the setup it 
had until 1978 -- when it was in charge of the sport's television 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much interest back in 1978 in auto racing and  
NASCAR made a decision to loan the rights to the tracks,'' said 
Bray Cary, NASCAR's vice president of broadcasting. ``But the sport 
has exploded in popularity in the past five years. ... As a result, 
we made a decision that this was the best way to market the sport 
for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change will begin in the 2000 race season for its NASCAR  
Winston Cup and Busch Series events, but many of the tracks' 
contracts do not expire until 2002. NASCAR could sign a deal with 
the television networks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The tracks currently generate about $100 million in rights fees  
for the 34 races from CBS, ABC, NBC, ESPN, TBS and The Nashville 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
	A new deal, which also could include other networks such as Fox  
Sports, could bring in as much as four times that amount. That is a 
long way from 1985, when NASCAR received just $3 million for the TV 
rights to 28 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision by NASCAR was made after considerable research,''  
said Mike Helton, senior vice president and chief operating officer 
for NASCAR. ``Today's decision will continue to propel the growth 
of the sport well into the next century and we believe it will 
significantly benefit the entire industry, and particularly our 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR has enjoyed a dramatic rise in popularity this decade.  
Attendance has nearly doubled since 1990 and increased for 18 
consecutive years. NASCAR races generate higher TV ratings than 
regular season events in every sport other than NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	This month's Daytona 500 was the most-watched in its history and  
posted a 9.5 rating, up 10 percent from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton said that he has no plans to change NASCAR's current TV  
rights fee distribution formula. Tracks receive 65 percent, 
competitors 25 percent and the sanctioning body gets 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Ground Workers OK Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- New contracts have been approved for about  
18,000 Northwest Airlines ground workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Machinists said Tuesday that  
the contracts were ratified by about 69 percent of the 13,742 
members who voted Feb. 16. The contracts will be signed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements cover three groups of employees -- about 10,000  
ticket agents, reservationists and clerks; about 8,000 baggage 
handlers and other ramp equipment operators; and about 40 security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement includes a 14 percent wage increase over four  
years, a 3.5 percent lump-sum retroactive payment, a 50 percent 
increase in pensions and additional job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest still has open contracts with two other large employee  
groups -- 10,000 flight attendants and 10,000 mechanics and 
cleaners. Negotiations with mechanics won't resume until a union 
representation election is settled.

<HEADLINE> Broaddrick Details Alleged Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At times tearful, Juanita Broaddrick appeared  
on national television Wednesday describing an alleged sexual 
assault by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little bit uneasy, but I felt a real friendship toward  
this man and I really didn't feel any danger'' in letting him come 
up to her Little Rock, Ark., hotel room during a nursing 
administrators' conference in 1978, she told NBC's ``Dateline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, taped Jan. 20 but held by the network until  
Wednesday night, Mrs. Broaddrick cried briefly as she detailed the 
alleged assault and she said of Clinton, ``my hatred for him is 
overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said he forced himself on her when she ``pushed him away and  
told him `no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who was attorney general of Arkansas in 1978, refused  
comment earlier Wednesday on Mrs. Broaddrick's allegations, saying 
he stood by the statement of his attorney, David Kendall, who 
called the accusations ``absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick told NBC nobody tried to intimidate her to  
remain silent and no one paid her to keep quiet or to speak out. 
She said she had filed an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment case denying she'd had any unwelcome advances from 
Clinton because she was unwilling to tell her story at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Word that NBC's Lisa Myers had interviewed Mrs. Broaddrick last  
month had buzzed through the Internet and media gossip circles. 
Clinton opponents accused NBC of sitting on the interview in order 
to protect the president. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC denied that, saying it needed time to complete reporting on  
a complicated story. While the network tried to check out Mrs. 
Broaddrick's account, The Wall Street Journal did its own interview 
with Mrs. Broaddrick and other media organizations followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't hold it inside any longer,'' Mrs. Broaddrick  
said in trying to explain why she is finally coming forward with 
her account. She said she didn't want her granddaughters and nieces 
asking her, ``Why didn't you tell what this man did to you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Broaddrick said she was unable to recall when Clinton  
assaulted her, so NBC tracked down the fact that a nursing 
conference had been held at the hotel where she was staying on 
April 25, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also tried to check Clinton's whereabouts that day --  
receiving no help from the White House on that question. After an 
exhaustive search, the network said it found no evidence that 
Clinton had any public event the morning of the alleged assault and 
ample evidence from various public records that he was in Little 
Rock later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lewinsky, meanwhile, told ABC's Barbara Walters she  
wanted to apologize for the nation for the yearlong political 
ordeal triggered by her affair with Clinton, The Washington Post 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters interviewed the former White House intern last Saturday,  
and the Post reported on some highlights of the interview in 
Thursday's editions, without direct quotes, attributing its

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defense Fund Gets $2.3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Bill Clinton was being impeached,  
supporters contributed $2.3 million to help him pay his legal 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how much Clinton's legal defense fund took in between  
mid-August, after Clinton's first public admission of an improper 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and mid-February, when the 
Senate acquitted the president of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	More money is expected. The fund recently sent out letters that  
noted: ``The effort to impeach President Clinton is only the latest 
in a series of legal actions that have left the First Family with a 
staggering personal debt. ... If you are disturbed by the way 
politics is conducted today, then what better response than to 
offer the first family your own gesture of support?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the fund raised $4.5 million during its first year,  
from 50,000 contributions, trustees reported Wednesday. The money 
helped whittle the Clintons' outstanding legal bills from $9 
million to $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10,000 donor, Atlanta businessman J.B. Fuqua, said wealthy  
individuals who prospered under the Clinton administration have an 
obligation to help the president financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew when he ran for president the first time that he  
played around with women,'' Fuqua said. ``I don't approve of it, 
but nevertheless that's a fact of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton received 56 contributions of $5,000 or more during the  
last six months, including $10,000 apiece from Lew Wasserman, 
former chairman of Universal Studios; singer Tony Bennett; and Don 
Henley, a member of the Eagles musical group. Archer Daniels 
Midland executive Dwayne Andreas gave $5,000, as did author Stephen 
King and actor Robert DeNiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the average contribution was $90, trustees said, and 95  
percent of the donors gave $100 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen an overwhelmingly positive response to our  
efforts to reduce this enormous financial burden, from average 
Americans and larger donors alike,'' the fund's executive director, 
Anthony Essaye, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last six months, the fund has sent out hundreds of  
thousands of letters to prospective donors, cultivating its mailing 
list from a variety of sources including Democratic Party 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Essaye said, the fund will ask earlier contributors  
to give again. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund so far has paid $3 million of Clinton's legal expenses  
from the now-dismissed Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the 
impeachment trial and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
continuing investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $5.2 million remains to be paid, as well as any new  
legal expenses the president may incur, Essaye said. He said he 
expects their total legal bills will reach $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Only six people -- all small donors -- have asked for refunds,  
Essaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fund is operating under fewer restrictions than an  
earlier legal defense fund, which was shut down in 1997. Unlike the 
first fund, the new venture actively seeks contributions and 
accepts donations of up to $10,000 a year, rather than the old 
$1,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fund already has raised more money in six months than  
the initial fund did in 3 1/2 years. In that time, it raised $1.3 
million and paid $800,000 of Clinton's legal bills.

<HEADLINE> Arizona Executes German Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A German citizen who chose the gas  
chamber over lethal injection in a bid to avoid execution was put 
to death by injection Wednesday night after being given a 
last-minute choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower  
court and cleared the way for the execution of Karl LaGrand. The 
federal appeals court had ruled earlier in the day that the use of 
cyanide gas was cruel and unusual punishment, just as LaGrand had 
calculated 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand, 35, was executed for fatally stabbing a bank manager  
during a botched robbery in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	At the last-minute, LaGrand was given the chance to switch to  
lethal injection even though he had chosen death by gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He apologized to the family of his victim and to a woman injured  
during the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	LaGrand's brother, Walter, 37, is set to die in the gas chamber  
next week for the same crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers' request for death by cyanide, a method far more  
painful than injection, was a calculated move designed to keep them 
from becoming the first German citizens to be executed in the 
United States since World War II, when several prisoners of war 
were hanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the LaGrands, who have been on death row since  
1984, gambled -- successfully -- that an appeals court would buy 
their argument that gas is cruel and unusual punishment. A 
three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
unanimously in LaGrand's favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court lifted the stay late Wednesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Arizona last executed a prisoner with gas in 1992. The death was  
regarded as so gruesome that voters approved the use of lethal 
injection. Killers who were convicted before the law passed were 
given a choice of injection or gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers came to the United States as boys in 1967 after  
their mother married an American serviceman. Their case has drawn 
widespread attention in Germany, which does not have the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a state clemency board rejected impassioned pleas  
from a German delegation that included Germany's ambassador to the 
United States and a member of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	German officials complained that they did not learn of the  
brothers' case until 1992, eight years after they were condemned to 
die. International law requires nations to notify consulates when 
foreign citizens have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona officials said the brothers were afforded all the legal  
rights of U.S. citizens.

<HEADLINE> 15-Lb. Teen's Mom Won't Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- A woman whose 15-year-old daughter had  
cerebral palsy and died weighing just over 15 pounds will not stand 
trial for child neglect, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Richard Werner ruled that Karen Kuffer, 50, is mentally  
incompetent for trial on the charge of felony child neglect in the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Taylor, Kuffer's attorney, had requested a mental competency  
exam of his client in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said it was unlikely they would try to have Kuffer  
committed to a mental hospital for child neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay Kuffer died Nov. 25 after being taken to the emergency room  
by her mother. The girl died in the emergency room weighing just 15 
pounds and one ounce and was 3 1/2 feet tall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy indicated she died from starvation and dehydration.  
</P>
<P>
	Kay had cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy, and her  
mother has said that she cared for her daughter the best she knew 
how.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Execs Woo Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- In a sign that relations between  
Beijing and Hollywood are on the mend, Chinese officials wooed 
American filmmakers on Wednesday with the prospect of doing 
business with the image-conscious government. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit suggests Chinese officials have set aside the ire  
prompted by films such as Walt Disney Co.'s 1996 ``Kundun.'' The 
movie about the life of Tibet's Dalai Lama was seen as critical of 
Chinese rule over Tibet and never officially screened in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is normal now,'' Zheng Quan Gang, president of the  
China Film Co-Production Corp., said of relations with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	But basic rules still apply. Movies are out not only if they  
display too much sex or violence but if they are deemed insulting 
to China's government and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need to make that kind of film,'' said Zheng, whose  
government agency oversees foreign film production in China. ``The 
Chinese people always say, 'Look forward, not backward.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng spoke to about 50 American film executives in a  
presentation sponsored by the American Film Market, where foreign 
distributors gather each year to review and bid overseas rights to 
English language films. 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng also visited the Burbank headquarters of Disney Studios,  
whose animated feature ``Mulan'' opened in Chinese theaters on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on a Chinese tale, ``Mulan'' tells the story of a girl who  
disguises herself as a man to replace her father in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	China Film is willing to help finance foreign productions that  
pass muster, either directly or through a new fund the agency plans 
to create with Strategic Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based 
investment bank. The China Film Fund has an initial fund-raising 
target of $50 million, said Eric N. Solberg, Strategic Capital's 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	The advantages of co-production are significant, said Zheng.  
Joint productions with China Film are exempt from a government 
quota that allows only about 20 foreign films into the country each 
year. Foreign partners also get a bigger share of the box office 
take -- 35 percent compared to half that for distributors of movies 
filmed outside of China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese market is growing but still is relatively small  
considering the country's population of 1.2 billion. The annual box 
office take is about $250 million, according to estimates by China 
Film officials. That compares to 1998 revenues of $6.95 billion at 
U.S. and Canadian theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	China has about 9,000 movie screens in theaters, plus about  
50,000 mobile screens that travel from village to village. New 
multiplex theaters are being built to boost movie distribution, 
Zheng said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's eagerness to do business is driven in part by economics.  
The government is pushing film studios to become financially 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every studio in China is desperate for co-production,'' said  
Peter Dekom, a financial consultant and former entertainment 
attorney who moderated the presentation by Zheng and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a script past China's censors can be tough, but it is  
worth the effort, said independent producer Peter Shiao, whose 
romantic comedy ``Restless'' was filmed in Beijing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Shiao, the obstacles included convincing Chinese officials  
to allow him to cast a Taiwanese actress in the role of a mainland 
Chinese woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament to the censors' pragmatism that this went  
through. We were audacious enough to ask for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans sometimes create problems for themselves that have  
nothing to do with politics, said director Anna Chi, who hoped to 
talk with Chinese officials about distributing her movie 
``Blindness,'' a drama focusing on a Chinese-American family. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chi, who has filmed documentaries and television specials in  
China, said Americans often expect Chinese film crews to be 
submissive and work long hours, including unscheduled overtime 
without extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a certain way American producers perceive  
Chinese, that they always bow and are always respectful,'' she 
said. ``But on the other hand, Chinese people aren't saints, 
either. They see this opportunity and they become very 
shortsighted. They become money grabbers and do all kinds of things 
to trick you.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Drug Kingpin Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An alleged drug kingpin held after the  
seizure of a half-ton of cocaine was inadvertently freed from jail 
and probably fled the country, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvador Gomez, 28, who allegedly dealt with financial matters  
for a drug trafficking family, and five others were arrested Feb. 
12 and were each ordered held on $20 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gomez was released from County Jail on Feb. 18, a day after  
his video arraignment court appearance, Deputy Steve Sciacca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez was identified for release by the Police Department, and  
he was freed by the Sheriff's Department based on information 
provided by the LAPD, Sciacca said. The sheriff operates the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	LAPD Sgt. Willie Guerero, who was handling the case, didn't  
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a flaw in the system or a mistake was made. He  
wasn't supposed to get out,'' said Special Agent Andy Alonso, a 
state Department of Justice investigator.

<HEADLINE> Bringing the Desert Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- A Northern gardener visiting the  
Southwestern desert for the first time gets wowed by the native 
flora. Right away I wanted some to grow some back home, if only in 
a window greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Which ones would make it outdoors? Certainly not the date palm  
trees that flourish here and make a newcomer feel like he's in 
North Africa. Date farms market the largest dates I'd ever eaten. 
And at a roadside eatery I sampled something new and exotic to me -- 
a date milkshake, rich and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor could I hope to raise the oranges and grapefruit that people  
pick off trees in their own yards. 
</P>
<P>
	I took my question to horticulturist Glenn Huntington, who  
manages the nursery at The Living Desert, a wildlife and botanical 
park in Palm Desert near Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some opuntia (prickly pear) cactuses are potentially  
quite cold tolerant, but in general the coldest it gets in this 
part of Southern California is 10 degrees F. That puts many desert 
plants out of range of my neck of the woods, 50 miles north of New 
York City, where the mercury occasionally dips below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from temperature, anyone experimenting with desert plants  
outdoors should also make sure the soil is fast-draining, 
Huntington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Our talk quickly turned to what you can do indoors. I was  
interested in plants that would bring a touch of the desert to my 
south-facing window greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington said obviously I would need things that don't spread  
out too much. He suggested small potted cacti and euphorbias, both 
of which will produce flowers indoors, although not as profusely as 
they would outside in their natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
	He said any cactus will flower, while euphorbias are grown more  
for their shapes. Their flowering is usually so tiny that you can 
miss it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you can get some stunningly interesting forms,'' he said.  
``Even with the cactus, the flower is not necessarily the 
attraction, but often the shape and texture of it. Sometimes 
they're hairy, sometimes not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I ordered a couple of cacti and a couple of euphorbias to be  
shipped to me from the nursery (The Living Desert, 47-900 Portola 
Avenue, Palm Desert, Calif. 920260, telephone 619-346-5694). They 
come potted, in the right soil. 
</P>
<P>
	I may need to repot them eventually, if the root of the plant  
outgrows the width of the pot. Huntington said I could make my own 
cactus mix with one-third each of potting soil, sand and perlite. 
He said the potting soil should be the inexpensive kind without 
peat moss. 
</P>
<P>
	To be successful with these plants, you have to have enough  
light, Huntington said. He suggested testing it with shadows -- by 
putting your hand about a foot between the light source and the 
surface on which the plant rests. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can clearly see the outline of your fingers on the  
surface then there would be sufficient light,'' he said. He figured 
you would need that kind of light for about eight hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it doesn't have to be the sun beating down on the spot,''  
he added. ``It can be diffused lighting, as long as there is enough 
to cast the shadow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I asked him whether the humidity caused by other plants I was  
watering would harm the desert plants. He said it would actually be 
beneficial, provided the soil in their pots stayed sufficiently 
dry. 
</P>
<P>
	The interest of outlanders in the desert flora is something  
Huntington would like to see duplicated and multiplied in the 
people who live here. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern visitors to the area come in early winter, when the  
temperatures are like May and June back home, are struck by the 
unexpected sight of green lawns and pansies and petunias exhibited 
by many home gardens. They obviously need a lot of watering in an 
area celebrated for its dryness. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntington said much of the purpose of this botanical garden  
``is to try to get people in the desert to start thinking of 
conserving the desert by using desert flora at their houses. So 
we'll look like we're actually in the desert where we really are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``wherever someone lives I think they should use  
plants indigenous to the area rather than to try to transform it 
into something entirely artificial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to see the desert prevail in the desert.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turner Readies Southeast TV Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Turner Broadcasting System today announced plans  
for a new regional TV network meant for southeastern viewers, 
featuring shows about Southern lifestyles, country music and pro 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Turner South channel will draw upon the Turner movie and TV  
series library, along with original Southern-flavored shows and 
games of the company's pro sports franchises -- the Atlanta Braves 
in baseball, the Hawks in basketball and the Thrashers hockey 
franchise that debuts next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new programs planned are a weekly show of country  
music from Nashville's Bluebird Cafe, a weekly series developed 
with Southern Living magazine, ``The College Show'' using tapes 
submitted from regional campus stations, and ``WCW Classics'' with 
pro wrestling favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Burke, president of TBS Superstation, will head the new  
network, which will be launched this fall. TBS is a division of 
Time Warner Inc., where Ted Turner now serves as vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said targeting Turner Broadcasting's home region, where  
many people retain a strong regional identity, will hopefully prove 
popular and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it makes a lot of sense,'' Burke said at a news  
conference today. ``The Turner brand is incredibly strong in this 
region, and it's a very natural region for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner South will offer movies in a show called ``Kudzu  
Theater-Movies that Grow on You,'' a play on the ever-spreading 
regional vine. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said that not only do Southern-themed shows such as ``Andy  
Griffith'' play particularly well in the region, some movies such 
as ``Dumb and Dumber,'' a slapstick comedy without a regional link, 
have gotten unusually high ratings locally. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will step up talks with cable operators to secure  
space and expect its long-standing regional relationships to help 
those efforts. Burke said the network could potentially reach 6 
million homes in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, North 
Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said Turner Broadcasting has regional TV rights to its  
sports franchises and doesn't expect any conflicts with existing 
network deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The new network joins the wide-ranging lineup of 18 TV networks  
for Turner Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	The company began with Atlanta-based TBS, which Ted Turner  
developed into the first ``superstation'' in 1976 by using 
satellite to reach homes around the nation, and followed with CNN, 
TNT and other news, sports and entertainment networks. Its newest 
entertainment network is Turner Classic Movies, launched five years 
ago.

<HEADLINE> NBA Picks Nine for 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim  
Hardaway, Steve Smith, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston and Vin Baker 
have been chosen as the first nine members of the 2000 U.S. 
Olympics team, The Associated Press learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those nine plus three non-NBA players yet to be selected will  
represent the United States in the Americas Zone qualifying 
tournament June 14-25 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States must finish first or second in that tournament  
to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more NBA players will be chosen after the 1999-2000  
season, with Shaquille O'Neal believed to be an almost certain 
choice for one of the spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Sports and the New York Post reported Wednesday that  
O'Neal -- not Hardaway -- would play on the qualifying team, but 
several NBA sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
report was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich will coach the U.S. squad  
in both the qualifying tournament and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	If the U.S. qualifies, it will use NBA players for the third  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Dream Team won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics  
at Barcelona, and an American team comprised entirely of 
professionals won the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of NBA players was selected to represent the United  
States in last summer's World Championships at Athens, but those 
players were replaced when they would not commit to playing in the 
event of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine players were chosen last week during a meeting of USA  
Basketball.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Arrested in Murder in Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METHUEN, Mass. (AP) -- A respected plastic surgeon was accused of  
shooting his estranged wife's boyfriend to death during a visit to 
the wife's hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Kartell, a 25-year veteran of Holy Family Hospital,  
went to see his wife, Suzan Kamm, in the hospital Tuesday. Police 
said he encountered 56-year-old Janos Vajda, who was believed to be 
the wife's new boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	An argument between the two men followed, and Kartell allegedly  
shot Vajda in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Kartell, 59, was treated in the Holy Family emergency room for  
minor injuries. Kartell, who has a history of heart problems, was 
later admitted to the cardiac care unit, police said. District 
Attorney Kevin Burke said Kartell would be arraigned today in his 
hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kamm, a psychologist, remained under a doctor's care at the  
hospital. Her condition would not be released, said hospital 
president William Lane, a longtime friend of Kartell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see it coming,'' said Lane, who added that Kartell  
was so well-liked by his peers that they twice elected him 
president of the hospital's medical staff.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pins Hopes on Ice Skaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The girl is willowy and blond. A long braid bobs  
on the back of her blue bodysuit as she floats across the ice, 
executing graceful double toe-loops, blinding spins and sly little 
dance steps. 
</P>
<P>
	She is warming up for the Winter Olympics -- the games of, say,  
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Her name is Svetlana and she is 8 years old.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia -- sad, bedraggled Russia -- is counting on her and  
thousands more like her to maintain its dominance in at least one 
realm: figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia makes few things these days that can compete on the world  
market. Vodka, caviar, Kalashnikov rifles, nuclear power plants, 
jet fighters, booster rockets -- the list gets thin after that. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russians still know how to make gold medal figure skaters  
better than anyone else in the world. While everything else has 
been falling apart, Russian skaters have just kept getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	At last year's Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, Russians took the  
gold in the men's, pairs and ice dance competitions, failing to win 
a medal only in the U.S.-dominated women's event. 
</P>
<P>
	At the World Figure Skating Championships in Minneapolis, the  
Russians did it again, winning the gold in all but the women's 
event, and taking the silver and bronze in that. 
</P>
<P>
	In Prague this year at the European Championships, the Russians  
took first place in every event, and all three top spots in the 
men's and women's individual competitions. And they did it with 
some of their best cooling their skates at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everyone from Russia had been allowed to compete, we would  
have taken the top five or six places in a row,'' said Raphael 
Arutunian, a coach whose best skater, Alexander Abt, skipped the 
competition because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians' spectacular performance in Prague came as a  
welcome tonic to a country that has become accustomed to nothing 
but bad news. The economy may be in shambles, the president ill and 
the army weak, but Russians can still skate circles around most of 
the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, not everything is lost,'' journalist Boris Minayev  
wrote in the Ogonyok magazine. ``We still have this world of these 
sliding gods. It's real, it's ours, and in this world we're 
unbeatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The secret of Russia's success can be seen in rinks around the  
country, in places such as the Spartak Ice Palace, where young 
Svetlana skates in a class of two dozen 8-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	These classes are the legacy of the vaunted Soviet sports  
machine, which created a brilliant and sometimes brutal system for 
culling and training the nation's best athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	In other sports, the system has retrenched or collapsed. In  
skating, thanks in large measure to the efforts of Valentin Piseev, 
president of the Russian Figure Skating Federation, it is mostly 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	Children as young as 3 or 4 can attend daily classes; by the  
time they reach school age, they might spend half their day at the 
rink, five days a week. The best move up to better coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Free in Soviet times, the training at Spartak runs about $4.50 a  
month, still affordable for most Russian families. 
</P>
<P>
	The system remains large and well-honed, and the Russians have  
hung onto many of the best Soviet coaches. It is a daunting thought 
to Jimmy Disbrow, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association, 
whose skaters will face the Russians at the 2002 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians certainly have a number of good skaters in place  
right now,'' he said. ``That will be the challenge for everybody 
else in 2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians have good reason to be confident.  
</P>
<P>
	The current men's national champion, Yevgeny Plushchenko, is  
only 16. The women's national champion, 26-year-old Maria 
Butyrskaya, has stiff competition from 17-year-old Julia Soldatova 
and 16-year-old Viktoria Volchkova. And there are plenty of other 
strong young skaters in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Piseev worries about the future.  
</P>
<P>
	While youth skating programs remain strong in Moscow and St.  
Petersburg, there are signs of trouble elsewhere. Piseev estimates 
that 20 percent of the nation's ice rinks have closed because of 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he says Russia has a very small number of enclosed ice  
rinks, and most rinks are rudimentary by international standards, 
lacking up-to-date gyms and other training equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many top athletes and coaches have chosen to train in the West,  
mainly in the United States. If that continues, some warn, it could 
be the end of Russian skating dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The renowned coach Tatiana Tarasova now works in New Jersey.  
Tamara Moskvina, who coaches world pairs champions Yelena 
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, works in the United States and 
also coaches an American pair. Other top Russian coaches work 
exclusively with foreign skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Arutunian, too, is considering a move to the United States. If  
he goes, his skaters go with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know,'' said Abt, 22, who is considered a potential  
Olympic medalist, ``in the United States we'd have good ice rinks, 
good conditions, good everything. And so we're probably going, 
because in the United States we'd have more possibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marina Druzik, who coaches at the Spartak rink, worries about  
the talent drain. For now, though, she believes the future is 
bright for skaters such as Svetlana. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the girl had been gliding about the rink on one skate,  
her other leg stretched out horizontally behind her. Bringing 
day-glo pink mittens to her mouth, she blew kisses to her adoring -- 
and still quite imaginary -- fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sveta!'' Druzik yelled across the crowded rink. ``I don't  
recognize you today! Your jumps are awful!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caught short, Svetlana lost a bit of attitude, took a deep  
breath and went back to practice. Her fans could wait.

<HEADLINE> Woman Accused in Husband's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- A mother of five was arrested on  
suspicion of shooting her abusive husband to death, then 
dismembering the body and setting the limbs and head on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gladis Barreras Soto, 37, was arrested at the Ventura home she  
shared with her husband, Pedro Barragan, 35, and their children 
ages 6 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barreras Soto set the body parts on fire alongside the  
Ventura River Monday evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was the lone suspect, police Lt. Brad Talbot said. She  
was booked for investigation of murder and held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives obtained a warrant to search the home Tuesday  
afternoon. The man's torso was found in the couple's garage, along 
with a table saw believed to have been used to dismember the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot refused to speculate on a motive, but the Los Angeles  
Times quoted a source as saying that infidelity was a source of 
conflict in the couple's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband also had a history of abuse. He was sentenced to  
three years probation after pleading no contest to misdemeanor 
domestic abuse after an arrest in 1996. The following year, he was 
conviced of violating probation and spent a month in jail for 
shoving his wife and yelling at her.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member To Fight Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The African Olympic official at the heart of the  
Salt Lake City bribery scandal is trying to mobilize African 
support in a desperate bid to fight expulsion from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean-Claude Ganga, the IOC member accused of receiving more  
than $200,000 in cash and inducements from Salt Lake, has little 
backing for his cause, African Olympic officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, president of the Association of National Olympic  
Committees of Africa, has called an emergency meeting of the 
organization's executive committee for next Tuesday in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga of the Republic of Congo wants ANOCA's support before he  
argues against his expulsion at the March 17-18 general assembly of 
the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But two senior African Olympic officials, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said several ANOCA delegates are refusing to attend 
the Gabon meeting out of disdain for Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain whether Ganga can gather enough delegates  
necessary for a quorum, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	African officials said Ganga, who led the African boycott of the  
1976 Montreal Olympics, is portraying his case as part of a wider 
campaign against Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 24 IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake scandal, 12  
are Africans. Three of the six facing expulsion are Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ganga's contention that Africa is being unfairly singled out  
for punishment is not shared by other Africans. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a question of individual members being indicted,''  
said Sam Ramsamy, an IOC member who heads the South African 
national Olympic committee. ``Sadly a number of them come from 
Africa. But I and a number of my colleagues don't see it as an 
African issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was in Cameroon, headquarters of ANOCA. Attempts to reach  
him for comment were not immediately successful. A spokesman said 
he was in meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was one of six members ousted by the IOC executive board  
last month for alleged ethical misconduct during Salt Lake's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the six has since resigned, joining three others who quit  
previously. But Ganga has denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight 
to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of Ganga and others who refuse to resign will be put to  
the March assembly, where a two-thirds vote is required to ratify 
their expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has said he was counting on ``at least 40'' members of the  
IOC to back him at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	African delegates contacted Wednesday said Ganga had nowhere  
near that level of support, and a non-African said several members 
would consider resigning if Ganga managed to regain his IOC seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was among 14 members cited for possible violations by the  
IOC panel investigating the Salt Lake scandal. Ganga was also 
implicated in the subsequent report by the independent Salt Lake 
ethics board, which cited an additional 10 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report said the bid committee and organizing  
committee spent more than $250,000 on Ganga and his family, 
including cash payments, medical care and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many witnesses .... described Mr. Ganga as the IOC member who  
took most advantage'' of Salt Lake's generosity, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to African IOC and Olympic delegates, Ganga said he  
would continue to fight his case ``despite the heavy pressure 
brought to bear on me to make me resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga suggested he is the victim of a campaign to ``stonewall  
and crush me by all means available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do have a clear conscience in this regrettable affair,'' he  
said. ``Behind the pretext of the most severe penalty that stands 
to be meted out against me because of a few trips, gifts and some 
medical treatment looms the ironclad determination to sacrifice me 
in order to safeguard certain vested interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the letter, dated Feb. 16, was obtained by The  
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also included copies of his letters to IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch and to the IOC inquiry panel, which recommended 
his expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	In those documents, Ganga asserts he did nothing wrong in  
accepting $70,000 from Salt Lake bid chief Tom Welch, money he says 
was intended to help African sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Salt Lake ethics report, some of the money was  
deposited in a joint bank account Ganga shared with Welch in Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was agreed that due to the poor banking services in the  
Congo, it would be advisable to deposit all cash donations in my 
bank account on the understanding that I redistributed same to the 
recipient countries through their respective NOCs,'' Ganga wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga contends the funds were distributed to the national  
Olympic committees of the Central African Republic ($19,700), the 
Republic of Congo ($35,714) and Niger ($17,860). 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also defends his acceptance of free medical treatment for  
himself and his mother and ``some gifts of relative value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Tom Welch never sought to buy my vote,'' Ganga said. ``I  
never had the feeling I traded by vote.''

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Impressive in Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Former Atlanta Braves closer Mark  
Wohlers, trying to rebound from a dismal season, had the most 
impressive performance of his comeback Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks goooood,'' Ozzie Guillen said after swinging and  
missing a split-finger fastball from Wohlers during batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones stood with the bat on his shoulder, frozen by a  
Wohlers fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was some cheese right there,'' Jones said. ``Way to go,  
Wo!'' 
</P>
<P>
	While throwing several pitches in the dirt and admitting he  
wasn't working at full speed, Wohlers was pleased by his 
performance. He used all of his pitches -- also throwing the slider 
-- and generally was around the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm on the right path,'' said Wohlers, who inexplicably  
lost the ability to throw strikes last season, finishing with a 
10.18 ERA for the Braves and a 20.43 ERA during a stint in 
Triple-A. ``I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to be cautious. I realize there's going to be bumps  
along the way. But each time out there, I'm getting better and 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his first appearance of spring training last week,  
Wohlers nearly threw a pitch over the batting cage, continuously 
skipped the ball in the dirt and hit a batter twice. But he looked 
much sharper on Monday, and followed up with an even better 
performance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left the mound, the crowd of several hundred at Walt  
Disney's Wide World of Sports Stadium gave him a lengthy ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was nice,'' he said. ``The support has been great. It's  
putting a little more fire in my engine.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* The Braves announced five more signings Wednesday, agreeing  
to one-year contracts with pitchers Kerry Ligtenberg, Bruce Chen, 
Odalis Perez, Damian Moss, along with outfielder George Lombard. 
... There are still three unsigned players on the 40-man roster: 
pitcher Kevin Millwood, outfielder Andruw Jones and first baseman 
Randall Simon.

<HEADLINE> Church Tried for Electing Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) -- The First Presbyterian Church of Stamford  
goes on trial under religious law Friday for electing an openly gay 
man to the congregation's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is being watched by gay rights groups and church  
members as the first test of a recent amendment to the Presbyterian 
Church constitution that bars practicing homosexuals from being 
ordained or serving on governing boards, known as sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination, which has 3 million members in the United  
States, regards gay sex as a sin. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court rules against First Presbyterian, Wayne Osborne's  
election will be declared void and a new contest will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne, 38, an ordained elder, served on the session several  
years ago, before he publicly disclosed his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Presbyterian elders are ordained for life, and because Osborne  
hadn't disclosed his homosexuality at the time he was ordained, his 
status as an elder is not at issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Elders and deacons help with church governance, serving  
communion and performing other activities. When elders are elected 
to the session, they can represent the church at presbytery 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne was elected in May, but his installation was put on hold  
after two members of the congregation, James McCallum and Mairi 
Hair, filed a complaint. They said Osborne's lifestyle violated 
church doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
	Osborne would not discuss the case.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Mary Marple Thies, co-pastor at First Presbyterian,  
said that in electing Osborne, the congregation did not intend to 
challenge church doctrine. She described Osborne as ``a valued and 
beloved member of the congregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the church is behind him,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	An ecclesiastical court composed of six members of the Southern  
New England Presbytery will hear the case at Quinnipiac College Law 
School.

<HEADLINE> Government Warns of Faulty Wiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of foreign-made extension cords,  
power strips and surge protectors may contain faulty wiring or 
loose connections that pose serious dangers to consumers, the 
government says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission will issue a warning to  
consumers Wednesday about the faulty items, which can cause fires, 
shocks or electrocutions. According to the agency -- which has 
recalled 2 million defective cords, power strips and surge 
protectors since 1994 -- many of these products are made in China 
and sold at discount stores or small retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Computers, VCRs, and other home appliances have fueled use of  
cords, power strips and surge protectors, Commission Chairman Ann 
Brown said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many meet current safety standards, but the poorly constructed  
models recalled in recent years are a hidden fire and electrocution 
hazard,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last five years, the commission has announced 25 recalls  
of such devices, most of which were sold at discount stores or 
small retailers for between $1 to $7. Many have no identifying 
marks or model numbers. In some cases, they have counterfeit 
Underwriters Laboratories labels -- the certification mark that a 
product has passed industry safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the commission began investigating cords, power strips  
and surge protectors sold in discount, mass merchandise and dollar 
stores as well as hardware chains nationwide. After collecting 
samples from more than 80 locations, investigators found 72 percent 
of the samples failed to meet current safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also worked with U.S. Customs to monitor  
extension cords, power strips and surge protectors shipped into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical cords and plugs were involved in about 7,100 fires in  
1996, resulting in 120 deaths. In 1997, more than 12,000 people 
were treated in emergency hospital rooms for electrical burns and 
shocks and about 2,500 people were treated for injuries associated 
with extension cords. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is urging everyone to check their cords, power  
strips and surge protectors and offers these tips: 
</P>
<P>
	--Look for a certification label from an independent testing lab  
such as Underwriters Laboratories or Electrical Testing 
Laboratories on the package and on the product itself. For 
extension cords, look for a permanently attached certification 
label on the cord near the plug. For power strips and surge 
protectors, inspect the underside of the casing and make certain it 
is marked with the manufacturer's name and the testing lab. 
</P>
<P>
	--Use electrical cords, power strips, and surge protectors that  
have polarized plugs with one blade slightly wider than the other 
or grounded three-pronged plugs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Use special, heavy duty extension cords for high wattage  
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't overload cords with too many appliances; replace cracked  
or worn cords. If a cord feels hot to the touch, throw it away.

<HEADLINE> ESPN, Fox Fight Over America's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ESPN would pull out of the America's Cup before  
showing a Fox Sports Net logo during its broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Young America, a syndicate of the New York Yacht Club, signed a  
sponsorship deal with Fox last month and plans to have Fox Sports 
Net ads on its sails and hulls for the 1999-2000 America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But ESPN, which owns the U.S. broadcast rights, won't televise  
the event as long as the ads of one its primary competitors are on 
Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the option to pull out and we've indicated that if  
they can't deliver the event that we're buying, then we'll pull 
out,'' said Dick Glover, ESPN's executive vice president of 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	If ESPN does withdraw from airing the event, as it threatened to  
do recently, it would likely affect fund-raising for the syndicates 
who count on American TV exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Another network, including Fox Sports Net, could pick up the  
event but would have trouble putting together a production team at 
this late date. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover said ESPN already has agreements in place with the two  
major organization bodies of the America's Cup -- the America's Cup 
2000 and the America's Cup Challenge Association. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN's contract, which is expected to be signed this week,  
stipulates that the product is clear of competing network logos. 
</P>
<P>
	The America's Cup 2000 is the event organizer in New Zealand and  
the America's Cup Challenge Association represents the 
competition's 15 teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But final approval hinges on an unanimous decision by the 15  
challenge teams -- including Young America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a straight-up deal with Fox after ESPN went public with  
its deal late last year,'' said John Marshall, president of Young 
America. ``We have binding contracts and we're just waiting for 
ESPN to agree to the final deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the agreement is signed, the syndicates will have 30 days  
to agree to the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel there's plenty of room for give and take so that ESPN  
will do the broadcast,'' Marshall said. ``But no one can make 
binding contracts between us and Fox disappear. ESPN wants some 
concessions, but we don't know how that will go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox officials refused to comment on the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Execs Woo Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- In a sign that relations between  
Beijing and Hollywood are on the mend, Chinese officials wooed 
American filmmakers on Wednesday with the prospect of doing 
business with the image-conscious government. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit suggests Chinese officials have set aside the ire  
prompted by films such as Walt Disney Co.'s 1996 ``Kundun.'' The 
movie about the life of Tibet's Dalai Lama was seen as critical of 
Chinese rule over Tibet and never officially screened in China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is normal now,'' Zheng Quan Gang, president of the  
China Film Co-Production Corp., said of relations with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	But basic rules still apply. Movies are out not only if they  
display too much sex or violence but if they are deemed insulting 
to China's government and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need to make that kind of film,'' said Zheng, whose  
government agency oversees foreign film production in China. ``The 
Chinese people always say, 'Look forward, not backward.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng spoke to about 50 American film executives in a  
presentation sponsored by the American Film Market, where foreign 
distributors gather each year to review and bid overseas rights to 
English language films. 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng also visited the Burbank headquarters of Disney Studios,  
whose animated feature ``Mulan'' opened in Chinese theaters on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on a Chinese tale, ``Mulan'' tells the story of a girl who  
disguises herself as a man to replace her father in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	China Film is willing to help finance foreign productions that  
pass muster, either directly or through a new fund the agency plans 
to create with Strategic Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based 
investment bank. The China Film Fund has an initial fund-raising 
target of $50 million, said Eric N. Solberg, Strategic Capital's 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
	The advantages of co-production are significant, said Zheng.  
Joint productions with China Film are exempt from a government 
quota that allows only about 20 foreign films into the country each 
year. Foreign partners also get a bigger share of the box office 
take -- 35 percent compared to half that for distributors of movies 
filmed outside of China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese market is growing but still is relatively small  
considering the country's population of 1.2 billion. The annual box 
office take is about $250 million, according to estimates by China 
Film officials. That compares to 1998 revenues of $6.95 billion at 
U.S. and Canadian theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	China has about 9,000 movie screens in theaters, plus about  
50,000 mobile screens that travel from village to village. New 
multiplex theaters are being built to boost movie distribution, 
Zheng said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's eagerness to do business is driven in part by economics.  
The government is pushing film studios to become financially 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every studio in China is desperate for co-production,'' said  
Peter Dekom, a financial consultant and former entertainment 
attorney who moderated the presentation by Zheng and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a script past China's censors can be tough, but it is  
worth the effort, said independent producer Peter Shiao, whose 
romantic comedy ``Restless'' was filmed in Beijing last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For Shiao, the obstacles included convincing Chinese officials  
to allow him to cast a Taiwanese actress in the role of a mainland 
Chinese woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament to the censors' pragmatism that this went  
through. We were audacious enough to ask for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans sometimes create problems for themselves that have  
nothing to do with politics, said director Anna Chi, who hoped to 
talk with Chinese officials about distributing her movie 
``Blindness,'' a drama focusing on a Chinese-American family. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chi, who has filmed documentaries and television specials in  
China, said Americans often expect Chinese film crews to be 
submissive and work long hours, including unscheduled overtime 
without extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a certain way American producers perceive  
Chinese, that they always bow and are always respectful,'' she 
said. ``But on the other hand, Chinese people aren't saints, 
either. They see this opportunity and they become very 
shortsighted. They become money grabbers and do all kinds of things 
to trick you.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Sabotage Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Microsoft engineer rejected as ``completely  
unfounded'' a courtroom claim by Apple Computer that Microsoft 
tried to sabotage Apple's multimedia software. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Engstrom also argued forcefully that proposals to cooperate  
with Apple on Internet video and audio software stemmed from 
Microsoft's desire to help frustrated customers, not from a desire 
to eliminate competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, the government began questioning Joachim  
Kempin, the senior Microsoft executive responsible for the 
company's business deals with the nation's computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kempin, who refuses all press interviews and isn't widely known  
even within Microsoft, has argued that the company allows computer 
makers to install whatever rival software they choose and to make 
it easily accessible for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kempin also was expected to defend Microsoft's restrictions  
against removing or hiding any part of its Windows operating 
system, such as its Internet browser software. The government 
contends those restrictions illegally hurt Netscape, Microsoft's 
primary Internet software rival. 
</P>
<P>
	In connection with Engstrom's testimony, the government alleges  
that Microsoft encouraged Apple to adopt its own proprietary 
technologies, which would have required Apple's Quicktime customers 
also to use Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department David Boies said Quicktime's ability to run  
across different operating systems posed a threat to Microsoft, 
which depends financially on consumer demand for Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just another example of Microsoft going to a platform  
company and saying, 'If you'll stop doing this, we'll help you in 
some other area,''' Boies said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft's Engstrom said his company's offer to cooperate  
with Apple on multimedia technology during that industry's 
adolescence several years ago stemmed from customer frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	During that period, rival formats for digital audio and video  
often required consumers to download specific viewer software, such 
as Apple's Quicktime or Microsoft's own Windows Media Player. 
</P>
<P>
	That requirement, which occasionally still occurs, is the  
equivalent of having to buy and configure different television sets 
to watch incompatible broadcast programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Engstrom said he told Apple executives: ``I'm tired of the  
results of our squabbling ... being passed on to our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted under questioning by Justice Department lawyer Phil  
Malone that Microsoft told Apple that if it didn't cooperate, then 
Microsoft would write its own software tools for others to produce 
multimedia content on the Internet, an industry that Apple 
considered lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have no choice,'' he said. ``It was not work I looked  
forward to doing.'' But Engstrom insisted: ``We never said we would 
not compete with Apple if they used our runtime (technology).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple executive Avadis Tevanian testified previously that  
Microsoft designed parts of Windows to bypass Quicktime and created 
misleading error messages. 
</P>
<P>
	But Engstrom said Microsoft blamed the problem on Apple's own  
faulty software, an explanation verified by some independent 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing to me that Dr. Tevanian could come in here and  
make the claim that we sabotage Quicktime,'' Engstrom said. ``At 
Microsoft, our company would never do anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> Webber Returns to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a recent Washington Wizards game, two fans  
held up a banner that read: ``C.Webb fan 4 life. Payback 2/25.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payback is now at hand.  
</P>
<P>
	In easily the most anticipated game on the Washington schedule,  
the Wizards on Thursday will play host to the Sacramento Kings and 
former teammate Chris Webber, the mercurial talent who was traded 
against his wishes last year mostly because of his off-the-court 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to get a little more hyper,'' Webber said.  
``But hopefully I won't overdo it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webber spent four years in Washington playing alongside Michigan  
buddy Juwan Howard. They were supposed to bring a championship 
contender to the nation's capital. They didn't win even a single 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last year, Webber was arrested on marijuana charges in  
January -- a jury found him innocent in December -- and he and Howard 
were accused of sexual assault after a late party at Howard's house 
in April, although no charges were filed. Webber also skipped team 
functions, such as an autograph session for season ticket-holders 
and the filming of the team's video. 
</P>
<P>
	That was more than enough for Wizards management, who sent him  
into what is generally regarded as NBA exile. The small-market 
Kings have endured an NBA-record 15 consecutive losing seasons, and 
there was doubt whether Webber would report to his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he felt good about that trade,'' said Wizards  
guard Rod Strickland, offering a candidate for understatement of 
the year. ``He may have something inside of him that he wants to 
prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus setting the stage for an emotional evening. Webber has  
always been one to wear his heart on his sleeve, especially on the 
court. Try as he might to think one game at a time, he can't keep 
his mind on this one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough,'' Webber said after a recent game in Orlando.  
``You just try to occupy your mind with other things. Over the 
years, I've learned, and coaches teach you, don't look to the next 
game. That's what I'm trying to do. But it's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings played Wednesday night in Philadelphia and will leave  
Friday at noon for Dallas, so there won't be time for much of a 
reunion among old acquaintances. It'll be interesting to see how 
Howard and Webber interact -- their relationship grew somewhat 
frosty after they each offered conflicting and self-serving 
explanations as to what happened at the infamous April party. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard says that's old news.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good friend of mine,'' Howard said. ``And he's a  
teammate that we miss and I miss. Now he's on the other end, and 
he's looking to come in here and win. We want to disrupt that. We 
both are competitive individuals, we're going to do whatever it 
takes to help our team win. We'll see what the outcome will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard and Webber were teammates for six of the last seven  
years. They've faced each other only in high school camps and AAU 
tournaments in the Midwest and, of course, in lots and lots of 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	If early season form is any indication, Webber will come out on  
top. Howard has struggled lately, making just eight of 27 shots in 
his last two games. Webber, while making it clear he's not where he 
wants to be, has been sensational, averaging 22 points and 14 
rebounds through Tuesday's games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that I want to get to, enjoy, and get it over  
with as soon as possible,'' Webber said.

<HEADLINE> Robin Ventura Arrives at Mets Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Robin Ventura arrived at New York  
Mets camp Wednesday, intent on adjusting to his new team and a new 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who left the White Sox to sign a $32 million, four-year  
contract with the Mets in December, went through spring drills and 
took batting practice with his unfamiliar teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Ventura said. ``I spent most of today  
meeting the guys and learning their names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a five-time Gold Glove winner, is slated to be the  
Mets' everyday third baseman when the regular season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	His addition was part of a busy offseason for the Mets, who  
spent $163.9 million to keep Mike Piazza, Al Leiter and Dennis 
Cook, and sign Rickey Henderson and Ventura. General manager Steve 
Phillips also traded for Bobby Bonilla and Armando Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
	``They brought everybody in here for a particular reason,''  
Ventura said. ``Mine is to play third base and do what they need me 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who hit .263 with 21 homers and 91 RBIs last season,  
will be called upon to add punch to an offense that was 11th in the 
National League in runs scored last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have to learn new pitchers after spending his entire  
10-year career with the White Sox in the American League. Ventura 
has faced some NL pitchers who used to play in the AL or in 
interleague play, but he knows he will have an adjustment to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at first the pitchers will have the advantage,''  
Ventura said. ``But they still throw it, so I'm still going to try 
and hit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another player who reported Wednesday was outfielder Jason  
Tyner, who was the Mets' first-round draft choice out of Texas A&AMP;M 
in 1998. Tyner spent last season with the Class A team in Port St. 
Lucie and followed that with a session in the Mets' Instructional 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedy center fielder has added 12 pounds to his frame since  
playing college baseball last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine spent part of the day watching his  
pitching staff throw live batting practice against the position 
players who have already reported to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the first time, it looked like the pitchers were ahead  
of the hitters,'' Valentine said. ``I thought Al (Leiter), Rick 
Reed and Johnny (Franco) looked really sharp. I thought (Masato) 
Yoshii's control was very good.''

<HEADLINE> Combustible Rodman in Tinseltown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman is not the first player to get a coach fired.  
Maybe just the first to get it done without ever setting foot in 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Lakers handed Del Harris his  
walking papers. He won a lot of regular-season basketball games, 
yet always seemed to be hanging on by his fingernails. He was all 
of a dozen games into the season with a 6-6 record when he finally 
lost his grip. Around the same time, through the same revolving 
door, in walked Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidence?  
</P>
<P>
	No.  
</P>
<P>
	Just the beginning.  
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't matter which one of Harris' assistants -- Kurt Rambis  
or Larry Drew -- gets the head coaching job. To Rodman, he's just 
fresh meat. But wrecking a coach's psyche, or the Lakers' 
chemistry, or even the anatomy of whatever unfortunate winds up in 
the main ring of his nightly circus won't be the worst thing he 
does. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, after all, will be working in the NBA, not NASA. So  
there really is a limit on how much damage he can do unto others. 
The worrisome part is what he's going to do to himself, and by 
extension, a league that provides everything necessary for a 
fireworks show but the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	If Rodman's performance at a news conference in Beverly Hills,  
Calif., the other day was an act, then we know why Hollywood was no 
longer an option. And if it wasn't an act, well, then he needs more 
help than the Lakers are ever going to be able to provide. There is 
a sense of desperation about Rodman that wasn't there a few short 
years ago, a supporting cast that isn't there now. Any team that 
exploits him does so knowing the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, when Rodman moved from San Antonio to Chicago, his rap  
sheet held nothing worse than skipped practices, suspensions and 
stockinged-feet strikes. When the Bulls expressed an interest in 
signing him, he flew to Chicago and -- talk about odd couples -- 
actually stayed with general manager Jerry Krause. He had plenty of 
reasons to behave. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since Pistons coach Chuck Daly left him behind in Detroit  
in 1992, Rodman struggled with his work and his finances. Ron 
Rothstein, who followed Daly in Detroit, didn't have a clue how to 
motivate Rodman or enough talent on the Pistons to simply ignore 
him. Neither did his coaches in San Antonio, John Lucas and Bob 
Hill, who played the alternate ends of the good cop-bad cop game 
with the same result. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls, though, offered everything the Spurs could not.  
Rodman was leaving a young team for one packed with veterans. He 
was trading a soft, middle-of-the-pack Western Conference squad led 
by nice guy David Robinson for a nasty Eastern Conference side led 
by Michael Jordan, who still had something to prove. Rodman picked 
up an agent who was just as skilled as the client at wacky 
promotions, but better at keeping a checkbook. Most important, 
perhaps, Rodman was getting a coach, Phil Jackson, whose take on 
the game occasionally made Dennis' understanding of things seem 
downright technical. 
</P>
<P>
	And even with all that, Rodman eventually started throwing  
gaskets. He head-butted a referee, kicked a cameraman in the groin, 
and publicly insulted the entire Mormon population of Utah. Then he 
took off to wrestle with Hulk Hogan instead of practice during the 
playoffs. By last season's NBA Finals, Rodman's most important 
assignment appeared to be distracting Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, any semblance of order is gone. Rodman is 37, but more like  
47 in terms of wear and tear. Finding him turned out to be an 
exhausting enough task for the Lakers' management, and signing him 
wasn't much easier. Rodman fired agent Dwight Manley and apparently 
turned over the bookkeeping to his sister, Debra, then wept at how 
little he was getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
	From the look of things at the news conference, his off-again,  
on-again wife, Carmen Electra, has become not just his emotional 
support, but his promoter as well, a kind of Don King with better 
hair and a formfitting silver dress. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, there was Rodman's own explanation for why he was  
coming back. ``What got me over the hump was the fact I'm bored, 
I'm tired of not doing anything. I want to go back out and 
entertain the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On either side of that pronouncement, Rodman ripped into his  
teammates-to-be, revealed more about his marital bed than anyone 
cared to know and left few doubts that whatever restraints were 
intact last season won't automatically carry over into this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, Rodman practically has a license to misbehave in L.A.  
Most of the higher-ups on the club voted ``no'' about acquiring 
him. But the only two votes that counted belonged to the star, 
Shaquille O'Neal, and the owner, Jerry Buss. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dennis will treat them all equally -- which is to say with  
disdain. He will be asked to police the menace himself, an idea 
that looks worse by the day. Remember: this is a man who promised 
to walk off the court naked. With only so much ability left, even 
less to prove and no one in control, that day is almost certainly 
closer than any of us think. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Caskets Aren't So Plain Anymore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tony Thornton started planning his funeral two  
years ago, even picking out a plum-colored casket with silver 
handles. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Thornton went to a funeral home recently and saw a  
casket covered with a picture of cherubic angels, their eyes cast 
heavenward, he snapped it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I collect angels, and I just fell in love with that one,''  
said Thornton, a 43-year-old designer who has a terminal illness. 
``My house is filled with angels, and I feel safe with angels. I 
saw that (casket) and thought, `That's me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The casket that Thornton bought was made by a fledgling company  
that operates out of the back of a print shop in Dallas. WhiteLight 
has sold only a dozen caskets, but owners Patrick Fant and Dennis 
Sternitzky dream of shaking up the stodgy death industry by selling 
3,000 this year and 50,000 within three years -- about one-half of 1 
percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant, 52, is a former rock 'n' roll radio executive who believes  
he has devised an appealing concept for his fellow baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The baby boomers are planning funerals for their family  
members and, in some cases, each other. My generation craves choice 
and personal expression. That's what this is, taken all the way to 
the end -- your final statement,'' Fant said. ``If you're going to 
buy a casket anyway, why buy a blank? No one's life was a blank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has created 12 designs so far. Fant expects  
religious themes to sell best, such as the angels and another 
depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe. Other models are more whimsical, 
including a golf-course scene called ``Fairway to Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Hot Springs, Ark., James O'Donnell went to his final resting  
place recently in a WhiteLight coffin picturing the flag of the 
Republic of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was all Irish -- Duggans, Murphys and O'Donnells,'' said his  
widow, June. The service featured Irish music and white, green and 
orange floral arrangements to match the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quite special. It was a gala occasion,'' Mrs. O'Donnell  
said brightly. ``He went out in style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More designs are in the works -- Fant promised ``a spring  
collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The art caskets are part of a move in the industry to satisfy  
families' desire for more personalized funerals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want more said about the person than just the standard  
eulogy by some minister who didn't know him,'' said Beverly Henley, 
the owner of Forest Lawn Funeral Home in Dallas, where Thornton 
bought his angels casket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music is different, too,'' Ms. Henley said. ``You still  
find ``Amazing Grace,'' but we've had people ask for `Pink 
Cadillac' and Barbra Streisand's `Funny Girl.' I think the art 
caskets are part of that -- more personalization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerri Lyons, founder of the Natural Death Care Project in  
Sebastopol, Calif., said personalized caskets are gaining ground 
among people who plan their own funerals. She has seen families 
attach photos, poems, feathers and even glitter to plain pine 
coffins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baby boomers are looking for more meaningful ways to take care  
of their own,'' Ms. Lyons said. ``They're looking for something 
that's more personal and loving and dignified. They're looking to 
do it their way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The industry leader, Batesville Casket of Indiana, has started  
offering laser engraving of names, dates and verses on caskets, 
plus eagle and angel insets on the corners. The changes were made 
after a marketing survey that focused on people in their 40s and 
50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Some funeral directors, however, say they don't plan to offer  
art caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have agreements with two companies that provide caskets  
that meet the needs of our customers,'' said Terry Hemeyer, a 
spokesman for Houston-based Service Corporation International, 
which operates several funeral-home chains. ``Most people want the 
traditional casket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for art caskets was born a year ago while Fant and  
Sternitzky discussed a newspaper advertisement touting the business 
opportunity in becoming a casket distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to thinking, `Have you ever thought about how your own  
funeral service would look?''' Fant said. ``I'd want mine to look 
different; to say something about me. You don't get much of that at 
the corner funeral home. Funerals all pretty much look the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WhiteLight starts with a generic steel casket and laminates it  
with a color design or photograph -- the process takes two workers 
about 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant said his caskets will cost 40 percent to 50 percent more  
than a standard steel casket, but he sees it as a mass-market item, 
much cheaper than a hand-painted model. At the few homes that now 
stock the art casket, prices range from $1,600 in Dallas to $2,400 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	WhiteLight, a limited-liability company formed last year in  
Wisconsin, rolled out the caskets last fall at a National Funeral 
Directors Association show. Fant said more directors liked the 
coffins than didn't, and the company is taking its exhibit next 
month to World Death Expo '99 in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Fant, however, declined to talk about what his own casket might  
look like. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many ideas to decide, and hopefully I've got a  
little more time to think about that. If something happened 
tomorrow, my wife would have to decide on one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Castilla Sprains Ankle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- It was the kind of tweak that can ruin a  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Castilla, who has played in 247 straight regular-season  
games, gave the Colorado Rockies a scare Wednesday when he sprained 
his right ankle during the team's first full-squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, a two-time all-star third baseman, rolled on the ankle  
after making a throw to third base during a bunt-defense drill. He 
limped off the field and was able to take batting practice after 
getting the ankle taped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I slipped a little bit,'' Castilla said. ``I don't think it's  
serious. I heard a little bit of a pop, but I stood up and there 
wasn't too much pain. ... I got a little bit scared, but I hope 
it's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies manager Jim Leyland allowed Castilla to skip the team's  
post-practice running, instead sending him to the clubhouse for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to worry about Vinny trying to get out of  
anything,'' Leyland said. ``He plays every day and he plays hard. 
... He's like an old shoe -- real dependable and real comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, 31, can't seem to get enough baseball. He has missed  
just three games in the past three seasons and toured Japan with a 
group of major league all-stars last winter. To top it off, he made 
his annual Mexican League appearance in his home country. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the demanding schedule, there has been no sign of  
burnout. Castilla is one of only six players in major league 
history to hit .300 or better with at least 40 homers in three 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After putting up eerily identical numbers -- .304 with 40 homers  
and 113 RBIs -- in 1996 and 1997, Castilla hit .319 and set career 
highs with 46 homers and 144 RBIs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm healthy, I think you can expect from Vinny Castilla  
what he's done the last three or four years,'' Castilla said.

<HEADLINE> Don't Overlook Tax Deductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Taking every allowable income-tax deduction is  
important for any taxpayer, but it's especially important for 
people living on fixed income. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Khalilian, a tax expert and an academic associate at the  
College for Financial Planning, suggests several deductions that 
retirees often overlook. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you've already filed your 1998 tax return, review it  
to see if you've overlooked any of these deductions,'' Khalilian 
says. ``If you find some, it may be worthwhile for you to file an 
amended return. And even if these deductions aren't available this 
year, keep them in mind for 1999. Advance tax planning can save 
significant tax dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Medical deductions. Most retirees know they can deduct  
eligible medical expenses that exceed the 7 1/2 percent adjusted gross 
income (AGI) threshold. That is, if you have total medical expenses 
of $6,500, and 7 1/2 percent of your AGI is $5,500, then you can 
deduct the $1,000 difference on Schedule A of your tax return 
(assuming you itemize). 
</P>
<P>
	However, it's easy to overlook exactly what medical expenses  
might be deductible, Khalilian notes. For example, be sure to 
include the premiums you pay for Medicare, your Medicare HMO or for 
a supplemental Medicare policy. 
</P>
<P>
	You also can now include at least a portion of your long-term  
care insurance premiums. How much depends on your age at the end of 
the tax year (not at the time you pay the premium). For those age 
51 to 60, the limit is $770. For those 61 to 70, it's $2,050, and 
those over 70 can include up to $2,570 in premiums as a medical 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Another commonly overlooked deduction, Khalilian says, is  
transportation expenses. You can deduct 10 cents for each mile you 
travel (or out-of-pocket gas expenses) to the doctor's office, 
hospital or other medical facilities, as well as the cost of tolls, 
parking or public transportation. Generally, half of the cost of 
meals and up to $50 a night for lodging can be deducted if they are 
related to your medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	You can deduct the cost of improvements made to your home for  
medical purposes, such as handrails, ramps and the widening of 
doorways or hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, you can deduct only that portion of the expense that  
doesn't add to the value of your home,'' Khalilian says. ``For 
example, a doctor might recommend that you put in central air 
conditioning because of a respiratory condition. If the air 
conditioning costs $3,000 and it adds $2,000 to the value of your 
home, you can deduct only the remaining $1,000 as a medical 
expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond paying for your own medical needs, you may be paying for  
the medical care of a parent or a relative. As long as you are 
providing more than half of their support (not just medical), you 
can deduct their medical expenses on your return. 
</P>
<P>
	What if you're sharing their support with siblings, for example?  
Khalilian says as long as each of you contributes at least 10 
percent of the total support, and as long as you and your siblings 
contribute over 50 percent of your parents' support, then one of 
the siblings can claim the medical deduction for the year. 
Khalilian suggests that siblings sharing these expenses may want to 
rotate making the claim each year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Investment deductions. You may be able to deduct certain  
investment expenses, such as fees paid to an investment adviser, 
interest paid on money borrowed to buy an investment such as stock, 
computer software related to investing, safe deposit box rental 
fees, fees for maintaining investment accounts such as IRA trustee 
fees if billed and paid for separately, and the cost of 
subscriptions to investment publications. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Khalilian notes, you can deduct these fees only if they  
exceed 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Charitable deductions. People often forget to deduct mileage  
or transportation costs they incur related to charitable giving. 
For example, you may donate many hours a week to a charity. You 
can't deduct your time, but you can deduct the mileage (14 cents a 
mile) or transportation costs you incur going to and from the 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tax planning. You may not be able to take all of these and  
other deductions on your 1998 tax return, but with some advance tax 
planning, you may be able to increase your deductions and reduce 
your 1999 tax bill, Khalilian advises. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, you may try ``bunching'' elective medical expenses  
into a single year, so that total expenses will exceed the 7 1/2 
percent threshold. The sale of certain investments, if it makes 
sense from an investment standpoint, may be timed to minimize the 
tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalilian also cautions that many deductions that are effective  
when calculating regular income tax are added back in when 
calculating the alternative minimum tax (AMT). 
</P>
<P>
	This tax was designed to make sure that higher-income taxpayers  
didn't escape taxes entirely through extensive deductions, but 
Khalilian says the tax is now hitting many more middle-income 
taxpayers as well. Consequently, Khalilian cautions that, to take 
advantage of tax strategies, you need to plan all year round, not 
just fill out your return each April.

<HEADLINE> Bode May Quit PBS' Political Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The political intrigue backstage at PBS's  
``Washington Week in Review'' makes what's talked about on the air 
seem tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderator Ken Bode of the political roundtable says he's ready  
to quit because his boss wants ``more attitude'' on the show. 
Management, meanwhile, claims Bode is misrepresenting them and is 
angry he's taken their battle public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington Week in Review,'' shown Friday nights on most PBS  
stations, has aired for 32 years. The show's panelists are working 
reporters who stress analysis over the opinionated commentary found 
on many other political talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode said he sought to promote an ``oasis of civilization'' on  
PBS that stood out from shows with argumentative panelists. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can find that 24 hours a day in about 16 locations on the  
dial,'' said Bode, who is also dean of the Medill School of 
Journalism at Northwestern University. ``You don't need another 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bode's contract expires this month and he said he was  
negotiating for another year when he learned that WETA-TV in 
Washington, which produces the show, had offered his job to NBC 
News correspondent Gwen Ifill. She turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has agreed to stay for another four months and then  
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Percy Rockefeller, president of WETA-TV, said changes  
that are being discussed will be ``imperceptible to virtually every 
viewer.'' She said WETA-TV was talking about changing the amount of 
time some panelists were on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way were we going to change the format (or) change the  
integrity of the journalism,'' Rockefeller said. While Ifill was 
approached about being moderator, she was not offered the job, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Elizabeth Piersol, executive producer of ``Washington  
Week in Review,'' was fired Tuesday when ``it became clear she 
wouldn't be a constructive part of the team,'' said WETA-TV 
spokeswoman Mary Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Piersol did not immediately return a telephone call for comment  
Wednesday. The Washington Post said that in a meeting, WETA-TV 
executive vice president Dalton Delan had claimed he had never said 
the show needed more attitude, edge and opinion, and that Piersol 
had contradicted him. Delan also didn't return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Delan ``had to fire Elizabeth Piersol to cover his tracks, and  
that is an unforgivable thing to do,'' Bode said. ``It just shows 
that in television, as in other businesses, the cover up is worse 
than the lie. That is just a miserable act of self-preservation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One member of WETA-TV's board, Roger Wilkins, has resigned in  
protest over the flap. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode said he planned to discuss what's going on with the show on  
the air, an idea Rockefeller wasn't aware of. She said she didn't 
know whether Bode would stay for the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were mystified and dismayed that he chose to share his  
feelings about this transition to the public, to the press,'' 
Rockefeller said. ``We had hoped for a more graceful end to his 
five-year tenure.''

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Solomon Northup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- For a black man living decades before  
the Civil War, Solomon Northup had a wonderful life. 
</P>
<P>
	Born a free man, Northup was a well-regarded resident of  
Saratoga Springs, a hard worker with a family and his own home, and 
a talented violinist who was popular at parties. 
</P>
<P>
	All that changed dramatically in March 1841 when he met two men  
who lured him to Washington, D.C., with the promise of a job and 
sold him into slavery for $650. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarkable story of Northup's experience as a slave working  
the sugar cane and cotton plantations of Louisiana's Red River 
Valley was recounted in his 1853 autobiography. ``Twelve Years a 
Slave.'' Although overshadowed by the best-selling ``Uncle Tom's 
Cabin,'' published the year before, Northup's book sold a 
respectable 30,000 copies and still has impact today. 
</P>
<P>
	```Uncle Tom's Cabin' was fiction. Solomon Northup was real,''  
said Khayree Miles, a Union College sophomore who was part of a 
research team that created a Northup exhibit. Miles changed his 
major from engineering to African Studies during his research, 
after finding an original bill of sale for Northup. 
</P>
<P>
	Northup's story carried a special horror because he was  
transformed from a literate, property-owning, voting citizen of New 
York state into a shackled slave renamed Platt who was whipped when 
he did not bring in enough cotton at the end of the day. He was 
nearly hanged for daring to defend himself from a brutal beating by 
a cruel master. He was 32 at the time of his kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Each step of the way, for every cruelty and indignity he faced,  
Northup was able to see the good in the people around him. When he 
was about to be hanged by an outraged slave owner, he was saved by 
the brave intervention of a white overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, he was rescued from slavery by Henry B. Northup, the  
son of the man who had given Solomon's father freedom from slavery 
a generation earlier and whose name the black and white families 
shared. It was Henry B. Northup, after receiving a letter secreted 
out of the South, who traveled to Albany, then to Washington, and 
into the remote bayou country of Louisiana to seek out and demand 
the release of the enslaved Solomon Northup. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Northup was big news in his day.  
</P>
<P>
	Salmon P. Chase, the future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme  
Court, argued his case against the kidnappers and The New York 
Times carried a dramatic front page story about him. There were 
trials in Washington and Ballston Spa, N.Y., but the kidnappers 
were never convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was reprinted by Louisiana State University Press in  
1968 and in 1984 became the subject of a movie directed by Gordon 
Parks and starring Avery Brooks (``American History X'' and TV's 
``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''). The entire 273-page book is online 
at the University of North Carolina Web site and, most recently, 
was the subject of an exhibition at Union College in upstate New 
York. A house that Northup lived in is now a museum in nearby Fort 
Edward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union College exhibit, which runs through March 14, includes  
shackles used on slaves, and a reproduction of the bill of sale for 
Northup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good for Solomon. He's living on. He's having his  
justice. He's still telling his piece,'' Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutality of slavery is told in a dispassionate style, yet  
some incidents are almost too painful to read. There's the story of 
Eliza, a mother separated from her children who never stopped 
mourning her loss and died a slow death. There is Northup's account 
of being forced to whip Patsy, a slave and friend. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a remarkable lack of bitterness in Northup's story.  
He was able to write kindly of the slave owners and whites who 
treated him with respect and he blamed the cruelties of others on 
what the institution of slavery had done to the men who claimed to 
own him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the book found its way into the hands of Rachel  
Seligman, director of the Mandeville Gallery at Union College, 
whose idea it was to create an ambitious exhibit commemorating 
Northup and his book. A research team, including professor Clifford 
Brown and four students, pored over local historical archives and 
abandoned cemeteries, and even traveled to Louisiana to collect 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were driving where Solomon walked miles without shoes,''  
said Miles, who retraced Northup's journey through Washington, 
D.C., to the bayou country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Union College researchers were following a path of discovery  
taken more than 60 years ago by Sue Eakin, who read Northup's book 
when she was a teen-ager growing up on a Louisiana plantation. The 
encounter with ``Twelve Years a Slave'' led her to a life of 
historical research, much of it devoted to Solomon Northup. 
</P>
<P>
	Eakin, a retired Louisiana State University history professor,  
is thrilled at the attention Northup is receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited. I've worked a lifetime to get some of this  
going. 
</P>
<P>
	``My love is historical research and bringing up a picture of  
the South that is realistic. I am 80 years old and there has not 
been a day gone by that I haven't done something with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has collected oral history, and thousands of pictures and  
documents related to Northup and Southern history. She is still 
working to restore the Epps Plantation house where Northup spent a 
decade as a slave, as well as historical markers identifying the 
highlights of Northup's life. 
</P>
<P>
	After his book came out, Northup traveled around the Northeast  
speaking against slavery. Among the Union troops who marched 
through the Louisiana plantations where he had been enslaved was 
2nd. Lt. William H. Root. he had read Northup's book and described 
in detail the scene of the freed slaves, writing that many 
remembered Northup and the day he was freed. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, though, Northup had apparently died. No researcher  
has been able to find out what happened to him.

<HEADLINE> Salmon Predicts Angels Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tim Salmon believes he may soon lose one of  
his longtime Angels teammates, either Garret Anderson or Jim 
Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
	They are rumored as trade possibilities for a starting pitcher,  
possibly Toronto's Pat Hentgen, to reduce the glut of Anaheim's 
outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to believe a trade is coming down some time,''  
Salmon said Wednesday. ``That's tough because we've grown up around 
each other our whole career. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to see anybody move on, which will probably happen,  
not because they can't play. There's not enough room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim manager Terry Collins has four outfielders for three  
positions -- Darin Erstad, Salmon, Anderson and Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Erstad or Anderson might be used as a designated hitter  
occasionally. Salmon does not want to fill that role again. 
</P>
<P>
	He reiterated that he is a right fielder first and foremost. He  
was the designated hitter last season, playing through the pain of 
a torn ligament in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pacing myself in spring training and getting my feet ready  
for the season,'' Salmon said. ``I'm healthy. I feel like I can 
play every day in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't plan on being in any part of a rotation in the  
outfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the plate, Salmon will hit behind slugger Mo Vaughn in the  
batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	``That spot was tremendous for Nomar Garciaparra the last couple  
of years,'' said Salmon, who batted .300 with 26 home runs and 88 
RBIs last year despite the foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my swing going, no matter what. If they are going to  
walk Mo and pitch to me, that's fine; I'll take the challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Daly Is Forgotten Tournament's Star  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- No wonder John Daly is fond of the Tucson  
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the 54-year-old tournament itself, Daly is an afterthought  
as the golfing world focuses its attention on the Andersen 
Consulting World Match Play Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucson is the only PGA Tour event this week, but that didn't  
keep the PGA from scheduling the $5 million match-play event the 
same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization compensated by contributing $750,000 to the  
Tucson purse. Coupled with the backing of Touchstone Energy, a new 
sponsor, the infusion helped tournament organizers offer a record 
$2.75 million purse with a winner's share of $495,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But that pales with the $1 million awaiting the winner at the La  
Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, Calif., where the top 64 players 
on the World Golf Ranking assembled. That group includes David 
Duval, who becomes only the second defending Tucson champion who 
failed to return the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was 1956 winner Ted Kroll, who won the World  
Championship of Golf later that year, and in 1957 skipped Tucson to 
honor contracts to play a series of exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just saddens me that a tournament that's been here this  
long would have La Costa taking it away,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, a former PGA and British Open champion whose problems with  
alcoholism never seemed to erode his popularity, is easily the 
biggest name in the Tucson field. 
</P>
<P>
	The perennial longest hitter on tour, he is outdriving Tiger  
Woods, who is No. 2 in the category, by 14 yards and the 
fourth-ranked Duval by nearly 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Woods and Duval are rated 1-2 the world and are the  
two biggest money-winners this season, Daly's best finish in four 
tournaments was a tie for 14th in Phoenix, and he didn't rank in 
the top 100 -- let alone the top 64 -- when the world-championship 
field was determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you, I'd be glad to win here,'' Daly said.  
``Personally, I'd rather be here. It rains there, and there's a lot 
of sunshine here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Tucson are former U.S. Open champion Corey Pavin and  
Fuzzy Zoeller, who has a Masters title among his 10 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of Duval, Jeff Sluman and Phil Mickelson, who  
account for the last four Tucson titles among them, the hottest 
young entrants are Ted Tryba and David Toms. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms tied Justin Leonard for second last year, and Tryba fired a  
61 last Saturday to lead after three rounds of the Nissan Open. He 
shot par 72 on Sunday to tie Woods and Davis Love III for second. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't disappointed not to be in Carlsbad.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're getting a little free cash and playing for a lot more  
money, but there's a lot of good players in this tournament and I'm 
sure we're going to have a great champion here,'' Tryba said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Davis Love and Tiger about it, and they hadn't  
played here anyway, so they weren't going to play here 
regardless,'' he went on. ``We're only missing 10 or 15 players 
that are actually in the world championship that would have been 
here, so it's not like they're missing 50 guys.''

<HEADLINE> Brazilians Show Resentment of IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- When the new Congress convened for  
its opening session this week, the first speech was a warning to 
the International Monetary Fund not to meddle in the nation's 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Days earlier, the governor of a Brazilian state joked to  
reporters that he wouldn't visit Brasilia, the capital, if it meant 
sitting in the chair recently occupied by Stanley Fischer, the 
IMF's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brazil negotiates with the Washington-based fund for help to  
fix its battered economy, a long-standing resentment of ``yankee'' 
influence is slowly reviving. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostility could make it harder for President Fernando  
Henrique Cardoso to make the budget cuts he promised to the IMF in 
return for a $41.5 billion loan package. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF is the scapegoat,'' said Luciano Dias, a political  
scientist with Goes e Consultores Associados in Brasilia. ``It 
crystalizes the popular discontent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent protest came from an unlikely source: Senate  
president Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a veteran power-broker and 
conservative ally of Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that the government must go to the IMF, but that  
doesn't mean the IMF can meddle in national problems, especially to 
create difficulties for the poorer classes,'' Magalhaes told the 
new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rio newspaper columnist wrote his column in English, quipping  
that the local press has the patriotic duty to publish news in 
English so the IMF knows what's going on ``before telling us what 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resentment stems partly from a common view that the IMF  
teams examining Brazil's economy are number crunchers who care 
little about the people. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cite the IMF's recipe for the economy: high interest  
rates to curb inflation and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. 
Analysts say the formula spells recession and higher unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund did little to improve its image during a review of the  
loan agreement this month. The IMF released a statement saying it 
supported new Central Bank President Arminio Fraga. But the clumsy 
Portuguese translation read that the fund ``put up with'' Fraga, 
and the press had a field day. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-IMF sentiment is nothing new. In 1959, Brazil broke off  
negotiations when the fund insisted the government adopt an 
austerity program. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, the government signed nine letters of intent with  
the fund but failed to meet the targets in any of them. Brazilians 
felt humiliated, and graffiti reading ``Fora FMI'' -- or ``Get Out 
IMF'' -- sprouted in cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, President Fernando Collor de Mello ordered the  
expulsion of an IMF technician who had the temerity to suggest 
Brazil needed to reduce its budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Cardoso, a former sociology professor and leftist senator,  
was an outspoken critic of the IMF. Now, he's on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The anti-IMF sentiment is really against the fiscal reform,''  
said Dias. ``Cardoso has a very difficult task ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Off 144.75 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks beat a hasty retreat in the final hour of  
trading Wednesday, giving back more than half of Monday's big 
gains, as interest rates rose to the highest level in six months in 
the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average slid 144.75 to close at  
9,399.67, surrendering more than two-thirds of Monday's 212-point 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow, which slipped 8.26 points on Tuesday, now sits about  
250 points, or 2.5 percent, below the record close of 9,643.32, set 
Jan. 8. Even so, the barometer of 30 major companies still holds a 
gain of 2.4 percent for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks actually rallied in the morning after a weak opening,  
briefly lifting the Dow over 9,600. The market began retreating by 
late morning however, then staged an outright retreat in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although (stock) market internals don't look so bad, the  
weakness in bonds is a problem,'' said Scott Bleier, chief 
investment strategist at Prime Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds fell sharply after the Treasury sold a total of $15  
billion in new, two-year notes at just over 5 percent, a six-month 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year bond fell $10.94 for every $1,000  
valuation. Its yield, which moves opposite the price, unnerved 
investors by moving back above the 5.50 percent level, finishing at 
5.51 percent. The yield, a key influence on borrowing costs for 
consumers and companies, hadn't finished above 5.50 percent since 
Aug. 20 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's rise in interest rates was particularly injurious to  
technology and financial stocks, which had been providing some 
leadership to the upside in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led lower by Hewlett-Packard, down 2 3/8 at 70 3/4, and  
American Express, down 3 15/16 at 107 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which briefly pushed into  
record territory earlier in the session, closed 17.77 lower at 
1,253.41. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was higher 
most of the day, but finally capitulated, too, ending 36.97 lower 
at 2,339.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtook advancers late in the day on the New  
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 946.80 million shares, on 
par with Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets weren't helped either by Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan's testimony before a Congressional committee. Making 
his second appearance in two days on Capitol Hill, Greenspan 
reiterated signals that the Fed is more likely to raise interest 
rates over the near term than to shorten them. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the Fed expects the U.S. economy to slow to a  
growth rate of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent this year, down 
from about 4 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he warned that the economy is ``stretched'' after eight  
years of expansion and suggested the Fed may need to raise interest 
rates to guard against inflation if the economy does not slow as 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock investors would not welcome higher interest rates, which  
would raise corporate borrowing costs and could eat into earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot, however, was transportation stocks, which rose  
after Merrill Lynch made Delta Air Lines its ``Focus 1'' stock of 
the week and raised its earnings estimate for the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's shares surged 3 1/16 to 61. The Dow Jones transportation  
index, of which Delta is a component, rose 27.89 points, or nearly 
1 percent, to 3,249.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market activity, the New York Stock Exchange composite  
index fell 6.45 to 591.57, and the American Stock Exchange 
composite index fell 5.13 to 695.79. The Russell 2000 index of 
smaller companies declined 3.75 to 395.26. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo dropped  
1 percent. In Europe, London's FTSE 100 index rose 2.5 percent, the 
DAX in Frankfurt added 1.5 percent, and the CAC index in Paris 
climbed 0.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> IOC's Coles in Bribe Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Phil Coles, an International Olympic  
Committee member from Australia, wrote a thank-you note to Salt 
Lake Olympic bid officials who put him up for two weeks at an 
expensive Deer Valley lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter is among proof the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
plans to produce in the face of Coles' repeated claims he did not 
stay at the Deer Valley lodge over the Christmas holiday in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC says its records show the bid committee paid the  
$9,426.70 tab for Coles at a plush 20-room lodge -- believed to be 
the Goldener Hirsch Inn -- at the ski resort 26 miles east of Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles came under scrutiny in a lengthy report Feb. 9 from an  
ethics committee for the Salt Lake committee that said he treated 
his official IOC visits ``like vacations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Salt Lake bid boosters paid for four U.S. visits  
by the families of Coles and another IOC member, Willi Kaltschmitt 
of Guatemala. On one of the visits, Coles was treated to a Super 
Bowl game in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has called the allegations unfounded or inaccurate. In  
particular, he has denied staying at the Deer Valley lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Salt Lake committee has receipts to prove it and a  
letter from Coles, who wrote that he ``had a great trip,'' SLOC 
spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also has another letter written by former bid  
executive Tom Welch, who wrote that he hoped Coles enjoyed his stay 
at Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said the committee was sending copies of all the supporting  
documents, including airline receipts, to Coles and the IOC. The 
material was inadvertently left out of an appendix of the 300-page 
ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't seen the evidence and we wanted to get it off to  
him,'' said Shaw, who declined to provide copies of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are not supposed to accept gifts worth more than  
$150, and Coles is under investigation by the IOC for possibly 
breaking that rule. Coles stepped down from the organizing 
committee of the 2000 Sydney Games a day after he was named in the 
Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics report said ``some IOC members treated their site  
visits more like vacations,'' and then discussed the case of the 
Coles and Kaltschmitt families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels  
and followed the same recreational itinerary. Two of these trips 
were only four months apart in 1995, including a Super Bowl trip 
that does not appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City. 
Mr. Welch served as their host at the Super Bowl; the expenses were 
paid as reimbursements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has strongly denounced those allegations and challenged  
Salt Lake officials to produce the documentation. He complained 
that the only thing missing from his media treatment was ``the 
guillotine in the city square.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his denials Tuesday for The Australian newspaper,  
saying that he and his family spent Christmas 1995 with fellow IOC 
member Jim Eason at Eason's condominium in Deer Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stayed there. We cooked our own meals and did everything  
ourselves, and my records show that,'' Coles said. ``These people 
have got it wrong again.''

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Undermining Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Human rights groups accused the United  
States Wednesday of trying to undermine the world's first permanent 
war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States voted against the treaty establishing the  
International Criminal Court last July, but it has the right to 
participate in preparatory meetings for the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	During the inaugural two-week session, which ends Friday, the  
United States submitted a list of proposed ``elements'' that would 
constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights accused the United States  
of trying to redefine these international crimes and insert 
elements which would restrict the court's reach. Human Rights Watch 
also warned that Washington is discussing a protocol to weaken the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is dangerous and harmful to reopen the definition of  
genocide 50 years after the Genocide Convention was adopted.'' 
Michael Posner, the Lawyers Committee's executive director said, 
urging countries to reject the U.S. proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States voted against the treaty because American  
officials felt it yielded too much prosecutorial power to the new 
court, leaving U.S. troops and citizens vulnerable to politically 
motivated prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Program coordinator Jelena Pejic said the committee believes the  
U.S. proposals are designed to achieve what Washington didn't 
achieve in the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you make the elements more restrictive and make it harder  
for the prosecutor to prove a case, then there's less of a 
likelihood that U.S. soldiers and others will be brought before the 
court. So its part of a systematic pattern to shield U.S. nationals 
from the International Criminal Court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Scheffer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues,  
called the committee's allegations ``absolutely false and extremely 
misleading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States was working closely with Switzerland,  
which also presented proposals on what elements constitute genocide 
and other crimes, ``to marry our two documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Kirsch, the preparatory commission chairman, called the  
U.S. proposal ``a very important paper'' and said negotiations 
``are taking place in a positive atmosphere and the United States 
is acting constructively.''

</P>
<P>
	MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. (AP) -- Spencer Martin Allen, a former TV  
news anchorman and editorialist in St. Louis, Mo., died Tuesday. He 
was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen began his career at radio stations in Texas and in  
Missouri. He moved to Chicago in 1941 to work at WGN radio. After a 
wartime stint as an Army public relations officer, he rejoined WGN 
and established one of the first local TV news operations. He 
worked there until 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked briefly in Columbus, Ohio, before going to St. Louis  
in 1958 and joining KMOX-TV (now KMOV), where he became news 
director and chief news anchor. In 1964, Allen went to rival KTVI, 
where he stayed for three years before returning to KMOX as 
editorial director. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a founding board member of the St. Louis Press Club, also  
was chairman of the National Broadcast Editorial Association and 
the Journalism Foundation of Metropolitan St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He left television in 1972 to teach at the University of  
Missouri School of Journalism branch in St. Louis. He retired to 
Florida in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include two sons and two grandchildren.

<P>
	PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) -- Bill Beers, an outdoorsman and wildlife  
conservationist who wrote a column for The Daily Courier for years, 
died Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Beers wrote outdoors columns for the Prescott Courier, later The  
Daily Courier, from about 1950 to 1975 and again from 1988 to 1998.

</P>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Biki, a Milan designer who opened a fashion  
atelier in 1936 and went on to create outfits for opera diva Maria 
Callas and others, died Tuesday of the flu and bronchitis. She was 
92. 
</P>
<P>
	Biki, born Elvira Leonardi, was known abroad, especially in  
Japan, where she opened a shop with the Japanese in 1969. Other 
well-known clients included Esther Williams, the American swimmer 
and film star, and French actress Jeanne Moreau. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was her work for Callas that gave Biki her biggest fame.  
She reportedly numbered the clothes and accessories so the soprano 
would know how to best put them together for an elegant look. 
</P>
<P>
	She also designed for many of the women who frequented the  
circle of Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Italian poet and soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she designed a children's collection that sold abroad.

</P>
<P>
	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Roger Boka, a leading African black  
empowerment advocate whose bank collapsed last year amid 
questionable practices, died Sunday at age 54. 
</P>
<P>
	He died aboard a private jet as it approached Harare's airport.  
His daughter, Rudo, said Boka was returning from the United States 
where he sought treatment. She would not specify the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Boka was wanted for questioning over the alleged illegal  
transfer abroad of $25 million from his collapsed United Merchant 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Boka's bank offered loans to blacks at favorable terms and  
accused multinational banks of discriminating against black 
entrepreneurs who lacked collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	Boka's bank collapsed after it allegedly sold faked bonds,  
purportedly to raise capital for a state-owned slaughter and meat 
processing firm.

</P>
<P>
	HUDSON FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- William Bronk, an award-winning poet  
who wrote a poem for former New York governor Mario Cuomo's first 
inauguration, died Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronk first gained national attention when he won the American  
Book Award for Poetry in 1982 for ``Life Supports,'' a compilation 
of poems he'd written over 32 years. He wrote about things he 
encountered in his daily life. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronk said in an interview that he first declined to write the  
poem ``Waterland,'' for Cuomo's inauguration. But after jotting 
down a few lines and giving the idea some thought, he changed his 
mind.

<P>
                          *Dennis Cassano    	
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Dennis Cassano, a longtime reporter for the  
Star Tribune, died Monday of cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a beat reporter, he covered everything from city government  
and the criminal justice system to issues of urban sprawl,'' said 
Joe Rigert, a reporter who worked with Cassano for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassano joined the Minneapolis Tribune, the Star Tribune's  
predecessor, in 1969. His most recent assignment was covering 
suburban news. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Nancy; two sons; a daughter; and a  
sister.

</P>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Virginia Foster Durr, a Southern  
belle-turned-New Deal liberal who helped Rosa Parks get out of 
jail, died Wednesday in her sleep. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Durr and her late husband, civil rights attorney Clifford  
Durr, bailed Mrs. Parks out of jail in 1955 after she was arrested 
for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on Montgomery's 
segregated city buses. The arrest prompted a bus boycott that 
propelled Martin Luther King Jr. to leadership and helped start the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	A close friend of Mrs. Parks, Mrs. Durr was viewed by many as  
the white matron of a movement Mrs. Parks inspired. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Durr began rebelling against Old South ways while in  
college at Wellesley. She helped fight racist poll taxes, supported 
New Deal programs and backed the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Durr never held public office, but made a losing bid for  
the Senate as a Progressive Party candidate in Virginia. She was an 
engaging and inspirational figure for movement veterans as well as 
powerful figures in Washington.

                         *Carlos Hathcock II    	
</P>
<P>
	VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- Retired Gunnery Sgt. Carlos Hathcock  
II, who killed 93 enemy soldiers as a Marine sniper in Vietnam and 
was awarded a Silver Star for saving seven Americans after a mine 
explosion, died Monday of multiple sclerosis. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 16, 1969, Hathcock was riding an amphibious assault  
vehicle when it ran over a Vietnamese mine and exploded. Hathcock 
was sprayed with flaming gasoline and severely injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Although writhing in pain from burns to his face, arms, legs and  
body and at great risk from exploding ammunition, Hathcock went 
back into the flames and dragged seven Marines from the vehicle. He 
was awarded the Silver Star, the military's third-highest 
decoration, in November 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The burns ended Hathcock's combat career, but he remained in the  
service until retiring in 1979. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Sir Anthony Nutting    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Anthony Nutting, who resigned from the  
government in 1956 because he felt he could not defend Britain's 
Suez Canal policy, died Tuesday at age 79. The cause of death was 
not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutting was a Foreign Office minister in Sir Anthony Eden's  
government when the Suez crisis broke in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal in  
July 1956. When negotiations for a diplomatic settlement failed, 
Eden's government secretly agreed with France and Israel on a plan 
to retake the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was for Israel to attack Egypt, which it did on Oct.  
29, 1956. Britain and France then moved to seize the canal on Nov. 
5 on the pretext of separating the combatants. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing opposition from the United States, Britain and France  
agreed to withdraw in favor of a U.N. peacekeeping force. The 
debacle shattered Eden's career, and he resigned in January 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Nutting resigned his ministerial post on Oct. 31, 1956, saying  
he was not prepared to lie to defend the policy, and quit the House 
of Commons later the same year. He told his side of the story in 
his book, ``No End of a Lesson,'' published in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He succeeded to the baronetcy when his father died in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Oust American 'Bud' Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's highest court has ruled  
against U.S.-brewed ``Bud'' beer in a battle over the Budweiser and 
Bud trade names, according to a report being published Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri-based Anheuser-Busch took its case to the Federal  
Tribunal in late 1997 after a trade tribunal ruled against its 
``Bud'' beer. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal said the U.S. beer should not be sold as ``Bud'' in  
Switzerland because of a risk of confusion with the name 
``Budweiser,'' claimed by state-owned Czech brewer Budejovicky 
Budvar. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Supreme Court has upheld that decision, the Zurich  
weekly Cash reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch chief executive and president Stephen J. Burrows  
said the ruling would not affect the company's pending trademark 
case against Budvar outside of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	The two brewers have been claiming rights to the Budweiser name  
since 1911. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech brewery exports to 37 countries, mainly in Europe. Its  
St. Louis-based rival is the world's biggest brewer and has sales 
in more than 70 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The German immigrants who founded Anheuser-Busch in 1876 used  
the Budweiser name for their beer because it was well-known in 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweis is the German name for the original brewery's hometown,  
Ceske Budejovice, now in the Czech Republic. The Czechs say 
``Budweiser'' describes the beer and the area, in the same way 
Burgundy and Champagne describe wines and wine-making regions in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch still holds unchallenged rights to the Budweiser  
name in most of the world, including North and South America and 
virtually all of Asia. Some European countries have ruled in its 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to market our brand under a new name using  
the same label format to protect our sales base in Switzerland, 
which is less than 1 percent of our European sales,'' Burrows said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unfortunate decision because Anheuser-Busch has  
been brewing Budweiser since 1876, long before Budvar was founded 
in 1895.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 ruling, the Swiss trade tribunal said its verdict  
was based on Anheuser-Busch's 1983 removal of the name 
``Budweiser'' from the Swiss register of brand names, following a 
Czech protest. No mention was made of ``Bud.''

<HEADLINE>  Suttons Give Opponents Double Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Amy Sutton is No. 11, the shooting  
guard with the tan religious bracelet. Jill Sutton is No. 12, the 
point guard who wears a blue one. 
</P>
<P>
	That's all the help you get trying to distinguish the identical  
twin sophomore starters for Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sutton sisters provide the Horned Frogs (15-9, 7-5 Western  
Athletic Conference) with a quality backcourt. Combined, they 
average 25.3 of the team's 76.6 points per game. Individually, Amy 
scores 14.4 points and Jill averages 11. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among at least 17 sets of twins playing Division I  
women's basketball. While Kelly and Coco Miller of No. 14 Georgia 
may be the best, it's hard to imagine any two who are closer than 
the Suttons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-olds live together, take the same classes and are  
best friends. They're both early risers and don't like to stay out 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	They're both good students who share the same major: education.  
Both aspire to become basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a joint checking account and share all their clothes.  
That's why they don't see a need to exchange birthday or Christmas 
gifts -- a plan that makes perfect sense to them but bewilders their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	They are so devoted to remaining mirror images that if one wants  
a new hairstyle, the other does the same to avoid the chance ``one 
of us will look bad,'' Amy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both are quick to smile, their personalities differ  
somewhat. They don't always like the same music or laugh at the 
same jokes. Amy, who is older by less than a minute, is more 
talkative. 
</P>
<P>
	But the similarities far outweigh the differences.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not real outgoing without each other, so I guess it's  
good that we've always had each other so we'll have at least one 
friend around,'' Jill says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	The farthest apart they've been is 1,000 miles for 17 hours --  
four months ago, Amy was on campus while Jill represented TCU at 
the WAC media day in Las Vegas. Jill was invited because she had 
the better freshman year. Amy, though, is doing better this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Both take losing hard, even to each other. Asked what they  
compete at, they quickly said: ``Everything.'' In unison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amy and Jill have always pushed each other,'' said their  
mother, Brenda Hankey. ``The thing I was always thankful for is 
that they were always so close, in their grades and in their 
abilities in basketball. They were never jealous of each other. 
They've always supported each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of uniform and without their bracelets -- emblazoned with  
``WWJD'' for ``What Would Jesus Do?'' -- it's practically impossible 
tell who's who. They're used to being asked, ``Which one are you?'' 
and almost always give the real answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone asks us if it bothers us,'' Amy says. ``But it  
doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once in high school they switched classes, only to be given away  
by their classmates' giggles. They haven't tried anything since, 
but they are plotting a prank on their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think they know how to tell us apart,'' Amy says. ``We'll  
have to do a little test to see just how well they know us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing coaches and referees need not fear. The Suttons promise  
they won't switch jerseys at the start of the WAC tournament or at 
halftime of a game when one is in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Their word will have to do because even their playing styles are  
similar. Amy is probably a slightly better rebounder, Jill the 
better passer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 5-foot-9 guards both dribble well with either hand and  
neither can be left alone from the outside. Jill set the school 
freshman record with 34 points last year; Amy set the school record 
with 39 points this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both wear knee pads because they play so aggressively. Amy also  
has worn a mouthpiece since getting a tooth knocked out at last 
year's WAC tournament; Jill started wearing one, too, but recently 
gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court together, a sixth sense seems at work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of feel like Amy knows that if she wants to cut to the  
basket, I'll throw it to her,'' Jill says. ``We're thinking on the 
same level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amy and Jill have always been basketball junkies. Growing up in  
Gunter, a town of about 840 roughly 25 miles south of the 
Texas-Oklahoma border, their activities centered around church, 
school and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since they've been big enough to even bounce a  
basketball, they have,'' says their stepfather, Don Hankey, a 
former coach in Durant, Okla. ``Where most girls push dolls, they 
pushed basketballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In second grade, it quickly became obvious they were special.  
They competed in boys' leagues and made all-star teams, then became 
four-year starters at their Class 2A high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunter went 132-9 with the Suttons in the lineup, reaching the  
state tournament in their sophomore, junior and senior seasons. 
They lost in the finals as juniors and fell in the semifinals the 
other two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were devastated when they lost that last one,'' says  
their mother. ``They started crying the instant we started to walk 
out the gym, knowing they wouldn't have another chance to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers were spent traveling on AAU teams, wowing college  
scouts. Recruiters were told in advance to offer two scholarships 
or none. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too important for them to be together, even if that  
meant playing Division II or going to a junior college,'' their 
mother says. ``But from the first day, from the way our phone was 
ringing, it was obvious that plenty of people were interested in 
taking them both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TCU beat about 25 schools, in part because it's a 1 1/2-hour drive  
from Gunter. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters know they'll be together two more years, but they  
also know that eventually they must go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds of being teammates on a pro team are quite long. They  
could be in different leagues, different countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Mom is real worried about that,'' Jill says.  
</P>
<P>
	Wherever they end up, the sisters don't expect to be far apart.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably always live near each other, in the same  
vicinity,'' Jill says. ``It's not like we're going to move across 
the country from each other. In the same state at least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother figures that even though they spend so much time  
playing basketball and so little time dating, a boyfriend will 
eventually break them up. 
</P>
<P>
	And for that guy, she has one piece of advice: ``Good luck to  
the men that do the separating.''

	But the 5-foot-9 guards both dribble well with either hand and  
neither can be left alone from the outside. Jill set the school 
freshman record with 34 points last year; Amy set the school record 
with 39 points this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both wear knee pads because they play so aggressively. Amy also  
has worn a mouthpiece since getting a tooth knocked out at last 
year's WAC tournament; Jill started wearing one, too, but recently 
gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court together, a sixth sense seems at work.  
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of feel like Amy knows that if she wants to cut to the  
basket, I'll throw it to her,'' Jill says. ``We're thinking on the 
same level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amy and Jill have always been basketball junkies. Growing up in  
Gunter, a town of about 840 roughly 25 miles south of the 
Texas-Oklahoma border, their activities centered around church, 
school and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since they've been big enough to even bounce a  
basketball, they have,'' says their stepfather, Don Hankey, a 
former coach in Durant, Okla. ``Where most girls push dolls, they 
pushed basketballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In second grade, it quickly became obvious they were special.  
They competed in boys' leagues and made all-star teams, then became 
four-year starters at their Class 2A high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunter went 132-9 with the Suttons in the lineup, reaching the  
state tournament in their sophomore, junior and senior seasons. 
They lost in the finals as juniors and fell in the semifinals the 
other two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were devastated when they lost that last one,'' says  
their mother. ``They started crying the instant we started to walk 
out the gym, knowing they wouldn't have another chance to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers were spent traveling on AAU teams, wowing college  
scouts. Recruiters were told in advance to offer two scholarships 
or none. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was too important for them to be together, even if that  
meant playing Division II or going to a junior college,'' their 
mother says. ``But from the first day, from the way our phone was 
ringing, it was obvious that plenty of people were interested in 
taking them both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TCU beat about 25 schools, in part because it's a 1 1/2-hour drive  
from Gunter. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters know they'll be together two more years, but they  
also know that eventually they must go their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds of being teammates on a pro team are quite long. They  
could be in different leagues, different countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Mom is real worried about that,'' Jill says.  
</P>
<P>
	Wherever they end up, the sisters don't expect to be far apart.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably always live near each other, in the same  
vicinity,'' Jill says. ``It's not like we're going to move across 
the country from each other. In the same state at least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother figures that even though they spend so much time  
playing basketball and so little time dating, a boyfriend will 
eventually break them up. 
</P>
<P>
	And for that guy, she has one piece of advice: ``Good luck to  
the men that do the separating.''

<HEADLINE> Broadcasters Plan To Sue DirecTV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Broadcasters want a court to immediately stop  
the nation's largest satellite TV company from beaming CBS and Fox 
programs to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV Inc. on Thursday plans to directly offer customers  
nationwide the option of buying a new package of broadcast network 
stations, including CBS and Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	By dumping its supplier, PrimeTime 24, and directly offering the  
network programs itself, DirecTV contends it is not affected by a 
federal court order that would cut customers off from CBS and Fox 
signals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But broadcasters disagree, calling DirecTV's plans ``a brazen  
attempt to ignore'' the court order issued last year by a federal 
judge in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	All four major broadcast networks -- CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC -- and  
their affiliates intend to seek a court order to block DirecTV from 
continuing to provide customers with CBS and Fox, the National 
Association of Broadcasters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcasters' suit, which was to be filed Wednesday, will  
ask the judge to act on their request by Thursday, said broadcast 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV's announcement Tuesday was the latest twist in a fight  
between satellite companies and broadcasters over how viewers who 
get their TV from satellite can watch networks' local affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law allows DirecTV and other satellite companies to  
provide ``distant'' network signals -- which come from other 
broadcast areas -- to customers only if those customers can't 
receive their local stations using rooftop antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	But satellite and broadcasting industries have been at odds for  
years over how to interpret an arcane legal test for determining 
when a satellite customer can't get a local signal. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV maintains it can offer the Fox and CBS affiliates  
because the federal court order with a Sunday deadline applies only 
to the company's former programming supplier, PrimeTime 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if DirecTV's plans prevail, several hundred thousand  
satellite customers nationwide are still supposed to be cut off 
from Fox and CBS programs on Sunday under the court order obtained 
by the networks last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Hewitt, president of the Satellite Broadcasting and  
Communications Association, believes many of these satellite 
customers to be cut off from the signals can't receive a decent 
picture from their local Fox or CBS stations on their antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and Billy Tauzin, R-La., intend to  
introduce legislation Thursday that would permit satellite 
customers cut off from CBS and Fox on Sunday to once again receive 
the signals but only for three months, said Tauzin's spokesman, Ken 
Johnson. During that period, Congress would try to pass legislation 
to resolve the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV, meanwhile, said it will determine whether customers  
buying its distant network programming can receive a local station 
on their antenna. If so, they'll be cut off from that network's 
distant signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Another order by the same court will cut off an additional 1.5  
million customers from CBS and Fox signals by April 30. Both 
injunctions are against PrimeTime 24 for allegedly violating 
copyright law and do not affect NBC, ABC or other networks' 
affiliates.

<HEADLINE> Soderstrom Looking for Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Steve Soderstrom has always had the  
fastball and the control to pitch in the big leagues. Now, the San 
Francisco Giants hope their former No. 1 draft pick has the 
experience and intensity to finally make the jump. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the past few seasons, Soderstrom has come to spring  
training as a candidate for a spot on the major league roster. Each 
time, he's ended up back in the minors and has taken the move in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Giants believe the Turlock native is ready to make the  
majors this year, either as a starter or a middle reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in great shape, which is a start,'' manager Dusty Baker  
said. ``And you can sometimes tell by looking in a guy's eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who has worked extensively with  
Soderstrom in the minors, said the easy-going right-hander seems to 
be developing the attitude necessary for a major league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He saw the change last season when some of Soderstrom's pitching  
peers at Triple-A Fresno were called up to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't focused, he wasn't in shape in the past, but each  
year he has matured,'' Perranoski said. ``Last year, we brought 
people up and not him. In the past he might have pouted, but he 
went forward even harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soderstrom, who graduated from Turlock High School in 1990 after  
posting an 11-2 mark his senior season, played three years at 
Fresno State before being drafted sixth overall in June 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not sign until the end of July and was sidelined for  
another month by elbow inflammation, and then went 0-6 in 10 starts 
in the Arizona Fall League. 
</P>
<P>
	Soderstrom pitched at Single-A San Jose in 1994 in a season  
shortened by arm surgery, and moved to Double-A Shreveport the 
following year. He began the first of three straight Triple-A 
seasons in 1996, a year in which he went 2-0 in a September call-up 
by the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was 1998, in which he went 11-4 for Fresno.  
</P>
<P>
	``I became a better pitcher in the last few years. Now I have an  
idea of how to get someone out. I'm out there with a purpose,'' he 
said. ``My first two years, I just threw fastballs. It took me a 
while to understand how to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants, who have not yet settled on their fourth and fifth  
starters, still have not decided whether to keep Soderstrom as a 
starter or move him to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last season, he resurrected himself. Now it's a matter of  
getting ready to compete for a starting spot here,'' general 
manager Brian Sabean said. ``This might be when we have to decide 
whether he's a starter or reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soderstrom has struck out 387 batters and walked 227 in 572  
innings in the minors. Now he has developed a split-finger fastball 
that could increase his effectiveness as a starter or reliever, and 
he just hopes his spot can be defined soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we determine his role, it's going to be a lot easier for  
him,'' Perranoski said. ``He's got four good pitches. It's a matter 
of him being able to execute those pitches in a ballgame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soderstrom knows this spring may be his best chance to make the  
Giants, and that he can't spend too much longer in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's time. I'm going to be 27 and I think it's time I  
make the jump now. You don't see too many 29-year-old rookies,'' he 
said. ``I need to stay focused, try to put pressure on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Soderstrom's apparently never going to lose his laid-back  
approach. When asked what he'd do if he failed to make the Giants 
and was sent back to Triple-A yet again, he shrugged his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be in the big leagues,'' he said. ``But I'm not  
the type of guy that gets frustrated about things. I'd just head 
back to Fresno and wait things out.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Lead Board of Trade Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices plummeted Wednesday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, with soybeans falling to levels not seen 
since the 1970s, on the worsening of an already dim outlook for 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures prices sank, as did orange juice.  
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans tumbled amid reports buyers of competing palm oil and  
Brazilian soybean oil had canceled deliveries, an indication that 
demand for U.S. products will not brighten for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	With prices continuing to sink across the globe, analysts said  
it is likely that people who ordered soybean products a few weeks 
ago at prices that were 20 percent higher than current levels would 
cancel those deals and wait for the market to bottom out. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices already had been pummeled amid government  
predictions that demand from the important Asian region will remain 
weak through yearend, a huge problem given that Argentina and 
Brazil are getting ready to harvest bumper competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more vexing to traders are forecasts that American farmers  
will plant record soybean acreage this spring, since that would 
still be a better alternative to planting low-priced corn, wheat 
and other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat sank as traders eyed extremely low prices offered by  
competing French exporters for an Egyptian purchase. That 
reinforced views that prices must go much lower to stimulate demand 
for exports and for use in animal feeds as an alternative to corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt is one of the United States' best customers for wheat, but  
it has continually bypassed American exporters in favor of cheaper 
European or Australian wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures retreated in sympathy with the plunging wheat and  
soybean prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 7 1/2 cents to $2.44 1/4 a bushel; March  
oats fell 6 1/4 cents to $2.08 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.00 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 16 1/2 cents to $4.57 1/2 a bushel, 
the lowest since late 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid  
expectations improving weather conditions would lead to more 
marketings during a period of lower demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of Nebraska and Iowa, the nation's largest hog-producing  
state, suffered from heavy snow earlier this week, sharply reducing 
the number of slaughter-ready pigs coming to market. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell 0.17 cent to 67.45 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell 0.40 cent to 73.57 cents a pound; April lean 
hogs fell 1.83 cents to 43.42 cents a pound; March pork bellies 
fell 1.95 cents to 50.85 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures retreated on the Board  
of Trade of the City of New York amid concern about weak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were concerned that with the peak winter consumption  
period winding down, there will be fewer takers of orange juice, in 
which there are ample inventories. While Florida, the nation's 
biggest grower, is expected to produce a smaller crop this year, 
the figure is down only 20 percent from a record crop a year 
earlier leaving ample supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	May orange juice fell 1.55 cents, or 1.8 percent, to 84.95 cents  
a pound.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stocks Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian share prices ended mixed on Wednesday, as  
markets failed to find clear direction from U.S. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's hints of a possible restrictive monetary 
policy in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, a weak futures market dragged down share prices, while  
the U.S. dollar edged up higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 145.20 points,  
or 1.00 percent, closing the day at 14,355.45. The average rose 
243.98, or 1.71 percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan spoke before the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, saying a  
``surprisingly robust'' U.S. economy should continue growing this 
year but at a much slower pace than in 1998. Greenspan was to 
deliver the second part of his speech late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo was for the most part neutral over Greenspan's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei slipped amid ``speculative movement in the futures  
market'' with heavy selling toward the end of the session, said 
Kiyoshi Kimura of Societe Generale Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar bought 121.36 yen in late  
afternoon trading, up 1.02 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also 
above its late New York level of 120.81 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's comments on Wednesday had  
decidedly more impact than Greenspan's. Obuchi said the government 
was ``paying close attention to currency moves and will respond at 
the right time in the right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such remarks often refer to intervention by Japan's central bank  
in currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kong Kong, shares rose for a second consecutive session amid  
strong buying of HSBC Holdings PLC, the banking group that is the 
biggest company listed in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip Hang Seng Index jumped 243.58 points, or 2.6  
percent, to 9,677.57. The index had gained 204.65 points, or 2.2 
percent, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	News on Monday that the bank plans a Wall Street listing and  
plans to buy back its own shares in the Hong Kong market helped 
fuel interest in the shares. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose on late buying in shares of major  
commercial banks. The SET index rose 2.46 points, or 0.73 percent, 
to close at 336.17.

shares. The JSX Composite Index rose 4.063 points, or 1 percent, to 
close at 401.998 points.

The Composite Index fell 9.66 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 
553.13 points.

	SYDNEY: Shares rose on gains in banking, finance and diversified

	Mrs. Clinton is referred to 36 times in a fraud indictment  
against her former law partner, Webster Hubbell, signifying that 
her name will be brought up repeatedly in her old friend's trial, 
scheduled to begin June 14. She could even be called as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady's name also could come up in next month's  
criminal contempt trial of former Whitewater partner Susan 
McDougal, who is accused of obstructing Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr's investigation. The indictment against Mrs. McDougal details 
a series of grand jury questions about Mrs. Clinton that Mrs. 
McDougal refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Political scientist Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia  
sees a series of obstacles in Mrs. Clinton's potential run for a 
New York Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will be target No. 1 not just for the New York press corps  
but for, as Mrs. Clinton calls it, `the vast right-wing 
conspiracy,''' Sabato said. ``The truth is that over the past six 
years she has been at least a peripheral figure in many of the 
Clinton administration scandals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubbell trial could present an especially serious political  
and legal problem for Mrs. Clinton. She could be called as a 
witness, either by Starr's prosecutors or Hubbell's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr alleges Hubbell concealed his and Mrs. Clinton's work  
during the 1980s on a failed Arkansas land deal known as Castle 
Grande that federal regulators say was riddled with ``insider 
dealing, fictitious sales and land flips.'' The Clintons' 
Whitewater partner, Jim McDougal, tried to sell off pieces of 
Castle Grande to prop up his collapsing savings and loan. The 
indictment against Mrs. McDougal contains questions about Mrs. 
Clinton and Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Hubbell case, ``it seems that one side or the other's got  
to call Mrs. Clinton as a witness because if she's inextricably 
bound up in these affairs, she's got information that one side or 
the other would want,'' said George Washington University law 
professor Mary Cheh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hubbell trial could inject an unpleasant issue into any  
Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute she runs, all that stuff is coming back,'' said  
Democratic political consultant Vic Kamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris suggests the  
first lady should postpone running for office until 2004, when 
``she will be able to confront doubters and accusers with a clean 
bill of health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For next year, said Morris, ``one can imagine a situation where  
Hubbell is convicted and questions linger about Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr would have to weigh the risks of calling Mrs. Clinton as a  
witness before a jury in the District of Columbia, where the ratio 
of Democrats to Republicans is more than 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell's lawyers might call her to the stand if Starr doesn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way to bring in a popular witness for the defense and a  
potential character witness, but once they put Hubbell's character 
into evidence, he does get opened up and he's got a lot of 
baggage,'' said St. John's University law professor John Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton testified by videotape before a grand jury  
investigating Castle Grande last year. In 1996, she appeared before 
Starr's grand jury in Washington to discuss the still-unexplained 
discovery of her billing records revealing her work on Castle 
Grande. The records had vanished after the 1992 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Confronted with the billing records, Mrs. Clinton said she was  
unable to recall her legal work in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	A part-owner of the Castle Grande development, Hubbell's  
father-in-law, Seth Ward, collected $300,000 from McDougal's S&AMP;L. 
The billing records identify 15 conversations between Mrs. Clinton 
and Ward, but both say they don't remember them. 
</P>
<P>
	The development ended up costing the S&AMP;L $3.8 million in unpaid  
principal and interest, according to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell, the No. 3 Justice Department official during Clinton's  
first term, pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail fraud in 1994 
and promised to fully cooperate with Starr. He served a year and a 
half in prison. Suspicious that Hubbell was withholding 
information, Starr began investigating him again in 1996, trying to 
determine whether Hubbell was being paid ``hush'' money to 
stonewall Starr's investigation of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Castle Grande case, Hubbell now also faces  
new tax evasion charges.

<HEADLINE> Lauryn Hill Seeks Record 10 Grammys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lauryn Hill won the Grammy for best rhythm  
and blues song for ``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' and Shania Twain and 
husband Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange were honored for writing the 
country song ``You're Still the One'' in pre-telecast awards 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill led a parade of women up for awards, with 10 nominations.  
She lost one category in the pre-telecast show when non-classical 
producer of the year went to Rob Cavallo, who worked with the Goo 
Dolls, Green Day and Alanis Morrisette. 
</P>
<P>
	Twain and Lange, who had 11 nominations between them, won best  
country song for ``You're Still the One,'' a slick, poplike 
relationship song. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Titanic'' ballad ``My Heart Will Go On'' earned honors for  
James Horner and Will Jennings. It was named best song written for 
a motion picture or television. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, 23, and her acclaimed album ``The Miseducation of Lauryn  
Hill'' had a chance to win the most Grammys ever by a female 
artist. Carole King won four in 1971 for ``Tapestry.'' Michael 
Jackson holds the overall record of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	No hip-hop artist has won album of the year, a category  
dominated this year by women. Other contenders: Sheryl Crow's ``The 
Globe Sessions,'' Madonna's ``Ray of Light,'' Twain for ``Come on 
Over,'' and ``Version 2.0'' by alternative rocker Garbage, led by 
singer Shirley Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Grammy voters shattered their penchant for mainstream  
best sellers by naming Bob Dylan's ``Time Out of Mind'' as best 
album. Some hoped that would pave the way for Hill's stylish social 
commentary to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Crow, a five-time Grammy winner in recent years, and country-pop  
crossover sensation Twain received six nominations each. Madonna's 
five nominations gave her a chance to win her first musical Grammy. 
She picked up a video award in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Women also dominated the record of the year category. Madonna's  
``Ray of Light'' and Twain's ``You're Still the One'' were up 
against Brandy &AMP; Monica (``The Boy Is Mine''), Celine Dion (``My 
Heart Will Go On'') and the lone male entry, ``Iris,'' by the Goo 
Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Cash, Mel Torme, Smokey Robinson and the late Sam Cooke  
and Otis Redding each received lifetime achievement awards from the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at the 41st annual 
Grammy Awards. Rosie O'Donnell served as master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The songwriting teams of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe,  
Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller 
were honored with trustees' awards for outstanding contributions by 
nonperformers.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Conducting Overall Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing, acknowledging that it is wasting billions  
of dollars on unprofitable businesses, is planning a top-to-bottom 
review of operations aimed at eliminating or fixing programs that 
are hurting the aerospace giant. 
</P>
<P>
	An initial study, executives said Wednesday, found that nine of  
the company's 40 distinct businesses are losing money or barely 
breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
	Those products and services account for $3.6 billion of the $13  
billion Boeing invests each year, according to the study by Marakon 
Consulting of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, about $1.3 billion ``is invested in programs that are  
really destroying our value,'' Chief Financial Officer Deborah 
Hopkins said in a briefing with financial analysts and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing executives ``will look at every single program'' within  
the company to make sure they are profitable, including the core 
businesses of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, missiles and 
space, said Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer,  
wouldn't specify what products might be in jeopardy, but said: 
``There are no sacred cows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Condit -- who felt compelled to refuse last year's bonus with the  
company slashing tens of thousands of jobs -- also said Boeing is 
looking to create new, moneymaking businesses, such as in aircraft 
services, maintenance and overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	While the review of operations will be ongoing, Boeing expects  
by the end of June to have a detailed financial picture and know 
``what the targets for the organization are to achieve outstanding 
shareholder value,'' Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither she nor Condit would say which programs are drags on the  
company or what product lines might be dropped or sold off. Hopkins 
said ``not more than three or four'' programs accounted for the 
$1.3 billion of spending that was deemed an outright waste by the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing already has canceled three of the four commercial jet  
models it inherited after buying McDonnell Douglas in 1997, and 
recently sold off its civil helicopter business. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for Boeing's 747 jumbo jets has decreased, due in great  
part to Asia's economic woes. Orders have been sparse so far for 
the 717, a 100-seat jet developed by McDonnell Douglas as the 
MD-95, and Boeing has acknowledged that its new-generation 737s, 
introduced last year, have yet to be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Boeing earned only $63 million from its commercial  
aircraft segment despite taking in $35.5 billion in revenues. While 
that operation will be examined and theoretically could be 
divested, ``I don't think the probability of that is worth 
measuring,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, hired last fall from General Motors, has been trying to  
restore credibility on Wall Street for Boeing after a year and a 
half of disppointing results. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's stock, which fell $1.75 a share to $35.62 1/2 in  
Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, has tumbled 
more than 40 percent since peaking above $60 in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Boeing earned just $1.1 billion or $1.15 a share, on  
revenue of $56.2 billion. That compared with a loss of $178 
million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $45.8 billion a year 
earlier. The 1997 loss was the first for Boeing in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak performance has stemmed from production line snarls,  
parts shortages, late aircraft deliveries, costly fixes on the new 
737s, and costs related to the acquisitions of McDonnell Douglas 
and Rockwell's defense and space businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boeing also has been whipsawed by the economic crisis in  
Asia and other key markets. It is now cutting tens of thousands of 
jobs because of sagging orders after cranking up assembly lines to 
record production rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Boeing's board ordered a salary freeze for top  
company executives and a dramatic cut in their 1997 bonuses.	   Boeing spokeswoman Sherry Nebel confirmed Wednesday that Condit 
and Stonecipher had told the board their 1998 bonuses did not seem 
appropriate, and the board agreed.

<HEADLINE>  Spotlight Is Back on Mark McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just in case Mark McGwire forgot what it was like, the  
spotlights are back on the home run king. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't even have to hit a home run. Just an announcement of  
his first news conference of the spring was enough to draw a mob 
today to the St. Louis Cardinals' training camp in Jupiter, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notoriety he's gained, people want a piece of him,''  
Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty said Tuesday. ``You'd be 
surprised at the unbelievable requests we get, from media and fans. 
They don't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire arrived in camp Monday, and his only misstep came when  
he missed a team party at a local restaurant to view his ``Mad 
About You'' episode. He apparently forgot about the back entrance 
the Cardinals had waiting for him and tried to go in the front 
door. When he saw TV cameras and fans waiting, McGwire turned 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals camp was buzzing Tuesday, and McGwire didn't have  
anything to do with it. Former Cardinals outfielder Ron Gant, still 
angry at Tony La Russa, accused the St. Louis manager of racism, 
saying he treated black players differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rickey Henderson didn't like him, Royce Clayton didn't like  
him,'' Gant said in Clearwater, Fla. ``He treated Ozzie Smith like 
dirt. Brian Jordan didn't like him. I don't know too many people 
who did like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if there was any significance that all the players he  
mentioned were black, Gant responded: ``Yeah, there is. If I'm not 
mistaken, I heard a month after the season they were trying to 
trade Ray (Lankford), too. You do the math.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa said he wanted to telephone Gant to confront him about  
the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's called unforgivable,'' La Russa said. ``That's lower  
than cheap. But I'm not going to sue him. I'll turn the page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, traded to Philadelphia during the offseason, said that  
``if he can't control you as a player, if you're not a `yes' 
player, he doesn't want you. If you have your own opinions, he 
doesn't want you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa wondered what else Gant accused him of.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did he say anything about me kicking animals or robbing old  
ladies?'' the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa also fired back about Gant's lack of production. Gant  
struck out 162 times in 1997 and slumped again last season, needing 
a strong September to end up at .240 with 26 homers and 67 RBIs. In 
382 games with the Cardinals during three seasons, he fanned 352 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was whiff, whiff, whiff,'' La Russa said. ``I really hope  
he goes to Philly and whiffs for them like he whiffed for us, and 
we'll see what excuse he makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of major trades (Roger Clemens) and  
season-ending illnesses (Andres Galarraga) and injuries (Moises 
Alou), it was a relatively quiet day around the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest ruckus was in Tampa, Fla., where Jose Canseco failed  
to show on the voluntary reporting date. The mandatory date isn't 
until March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's irritating a little bit because he's such a big cog  
of the wheel,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. ``Jose's going to 
show up when Jose's ready. And I guess that's what bothers me the 
most. If it was injury or visa problems or personal problems or 
irritation over a contract or a trade that just materialized, then 
that's one thing. But just to premeditatively not show up for a 
couple of days -- if that's the case -- is a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Melbourne, Fla., the Florida Marlins found out rookie third  
baseman Mike Lowell will undergo a short course of radiation for 
treatment of testicular cancer. Lowell, acquired during the 
offseason from the New York Yankees, is expected to join the team 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Pathology reports indicate that Lowell's chance of recovery is  
excellent, team physician Dr. Dan Kanell said. The cancer didn't 
spread beyond a testicle removed in outpatient surgery Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel optimistic and have a positive attitude,'' Lowell said.  
``Everything is pointing in the right direction. My faith, family 
and friends have been the key ingredients in this battle. We are a 
formidable army, and the cancer didn't have a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, the focus was on Boston shortstop Nomar  
Garciaparra, the undisputed team star following the departure of Mo 
Vaughn to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can take Mo's spot,'' Garciaparra said.  
``Everybody has the same personality they had. Nobody's going to 
change. There's no need to change and you come out here, you 
prepare yourself for the season and you take on the season like any 
other year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out in Mesa, Ariz., Vaughn blamed Red Sox management for his  
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell I was not wanted there in Boston,'' he said. ``The  
Angels came first after me, and they came with respect. You want an 
organization that wants you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla reported  
early. Henderson, 40, was known for showing up after the voluntary 
reporting date in his younger days, which infuriated the Oakland 
Athletics more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people during my years have always said Rickey  
comes to spring training late,'' Henderson said. ``But we were 
always scheduled a week in advance for the guys to come back from 
the East Coast, who had the bad weather, to give them a chance to 
get a head start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always in California and always came to camp in tip-top  
shape. The week wasn't going to do anything for me. The press was 
always going to blow it out. I was always there; they never had to 
find me.''

<HEADLINE> Torre Signs Extension Through 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The long expected two-year contract extension  
for New York Yankees manager Joe Torre has be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm happy it happened, but it happened a long time  
ago ... I just didn't get around to signing it,'' Torre said. ``We 
had agreed to it, probably, during the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with owner George Steinbrenner, worth about $2 million  
a year, covers 2000 and 2001. While leaning toward stepping down 
when the new deal expires, Torre has not ruled out a longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it going past what my contract is now -- but you  
never now. As long as it's fun,'' Torre said. ``That's my end of 
it. Now you have to ask George the same question.'

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise a Bit; Dow Up 11.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were moderately higher at mid-morning,  
after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reiterated his view 
that even though growth in the U.S. economy is likely to slow 
mildly in 1999, he remains worried that it could overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 11.19 at 9,555.61. The Dow peaked just over 9,600, up 55 points, 
before trimming its gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was up 5.64 at 1,276.82, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was up 8.69 at 2,385.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6 to 5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 212.1 million shares, 
well below Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, making his second appearance in two days on Capitol  
Hill, hewed close to the remarks he made Tuesday, when he gave the 
Senate Finance Committee signals that he was leaning toward raising 
interest rates eventually. Today the Fed chairman was speaking 
before the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the Fed expects the U.S. economy to slow to a  
growth rate of between 2.5 percent and 3 percent this year, down 
from about 4 percent in 1998. But, he added that the economy is 
``stretched'' after eight years of expansion and suggested the Fed 
may need to raise interest rates if the economy does not slow as 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks again led the market. IBM was up 3/4 at 43 7/8.  
America Online led the NYSE trading in volume and was up 1 15/16 at 
89 15/16.

<HEADLINE>  Cubs' Wood Hospitalized for Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was hospitalized for  
precautionary testing Wednesday after the NL Rookie of the Year 
missed his third straight day of spring training workouts because 
of a lingering illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason for putting him in is to get some blood cultures  
and see if we can pin down exactly what the cause is and just be 
careful and stay ahead of it,'' Cubs team physician Dr. John 
Marquardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 21, struck out 20 batters in just his fifth major league  
start last year. He was bothered by a sore elbow at the end of last 
season, and began his offseason workout program earlier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, he developed an upper respiratory ailment. Then  
last week, Wood was hospitalized briefly with gastrointestinal 
problems that included diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. 
According to Marquardt, Wood lost 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we put him in was to get him rehydrated, which he  
did. He responded well,'' Marquardt said. ``And then over the 
weekend, he started with a cough. He started on medication Monday 
and he has persisted to have chills and fever in the early 
mornings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, having trouble keeping his energy level up, has been  
feeling better since beginning the medication. But Marquardt said 
the team wanted to do ``some more investigating to see if we can 
find if there is anything else going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, 13-6 last year, participated in Sunday's first day of  
drills for pitchers and catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt good Sunday morning and then he started to get dizzy  
as the day went on. His temperature was about 101 and he 
struggled,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said missing time early in the spring  
isn't crucial. The full squad is scheduled for its first workout 
Friday, although Sammy Sosa won't participate until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love spring training, but we don't need six weeks,''  
Riggleman said. ``In this case, you are glad you got extra time. 
Kerry can catch up on his conditioning once he gets his strength 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood could remain in Mesa Lutheran Hospital for two days until  
test results are available, Marquardt said.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Chastises FAA on 737 Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Metrojet Boeing 737 started to make an  
uncommanded roll this week, but the investigation has been hampered 
because the Federal Aviation Administration delayed in ordering 
recommended equipment changes, the nation's top transportation 
safety investigator said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the plane have no upgraded flight data recorder,  
but its cockpit voice recorder was on a 30-minute continuous loop -- 
rather than the recommended two hours -- so sounds of the event were 
recorded over by the time the plane landed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not acceptable,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the  
National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended the two 
equipment changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet, flown by US Airways' new discount carrier, experienced  
``flight control anomalies'' Tuesday as it cruised at 33,000 feet 
during a flight from Orlando, Fla., to Hartford, Conn., the board 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane started to bank and the pilots saw the control wheel  
turn left and that the rudder pedals were offset. The rudder, which 
runs up the back of a plane's tail assembly, moves the nose left 
and right. 
</P>
<P>
	After switching to backup systems, the pilots were able to bring  
the plane back into level flight and make an emergency landing in 
Baltimore. None of the 117 people aboard was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred one month before the safety board holds a  
hearing to establish the cause of a 1994 crash in which another 
Boeing 737 suddenly rolled and then spiraled into a ravine in 
Aliquippa, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators suspect that the crash of USAir Flight 427, which  
was about to land in Pittsburgh after a flight from Chicago, was 
caused by an unexpected turn of the plane's rudder, as well as 
turbulence from another plane. All 132 aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	They may never know for sure, however, because the flight data  
recorder aboard Flight 427 recorded only 11 pieces of information. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the crash, the safety board called for the  
immediate installation of digital recorders that would log not just 
11 basic flight parameters, but also the position of primary flight 
control surfaces and the cockpit equipment that moves them. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, however, issued a rule in 1997 giving airlines four  
years to switch to devices recording anywhere from 17 to 88 
parameters. The Metrojet, an older Boeing 737-200 series aircraft, 
had not been upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has yet to require two-hour cockpit voice recorders.  
</P>
<P>
	While Hall said the Metrojet investigation ``is being hampered  
by the lack of basic aircraft data,'' the FAA defended its 
replacement timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the complexity of the fleet and the different parameter  
upgrades, we think the time we have given them is a reasonable 
amount of time to accomplish such a large undertaking,'' said FAA 
spokesman Les Dorr. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board sent a team to Baltimore to retrieve the flight  
data and cockpit voice recorders aboard the Metrojet plane. 
Investigators also interviewed the crew and removed the plane's yaw 
damper coupler, its rudder power control unit, two hydraulic fuel 
filters and samples of the plane's hydraulic fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	While the plane did not have the upgraded flight data and  
cockpit voice recorders recommended by the safety board, the 
passengers and flight crew may have benefited from two FAA-mandated 
safety changes made after the Aliquippa crash. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the plane had an updated rudder power control unit, a  
device that had been redesigned by the Boeing Co. after the USAir 
crash. Also, the pilots had received mandatory instruction about 
how to respond to unexpected movement of the aircraft's control 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said the Metrojet pilots credited the training  
with helping them regain control of their aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' Supervision Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats say a Republican-led  
investigation into the 1996 Teamsters election was abusive, wasted 
taxpayer money, implied guilt where none was proved and turned up 
nothing not known from other government investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism, the House Education and the Workforce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigations agreed by voice vote 
Wednesday to approve a report summing up the panel's 17-month probe 
of the election. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race, federal monitors overturned former Teamsters  
President Ron Carey's re-election over James P. Hoffa after 
investigators found that his campaign improperly benefited from 
donations the union made to third-party political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., said  
the report revealed abuse of power, financial mismanagement and a 
``profound lack of accountability by past Teamsters leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The influence of organized crime on the union has decreased over  
the past 10 years, but Hoekstra said the report raises questions 
about whether the 1989 court order that put the union under 
supervision of the federal government is working well enough in 
preventing corruption not related to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., the subcommittee's highest-ranking  
Democrat, said rather than raise questions about the effectiveness 
of current law, the investigation revealed that the system is 
working as it was intended to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``contains nothing new,'' Roemer said. ``This  
subcommittee spent over a million dollars to discover that it could 
not find any illegal activity that was not already being redressed. 
I question the use of this much money to conduct an entirely 
duplicative effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roemer also said the panel's Republican majority appeared to  
have turned its investigation ``into a partisan effort to attack 
political opponents and dredge up issues that could be used for 
partisan advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one finding, the report said a review of subpoenaed documents  
produced by the Teamsters showed that Charles Ruff, now White House 
counsel, conducted legitimate anti-corruption work for the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra had questioned the legitimacy of legal work Ruff and  
private investigator Jack Palladino did for the union from 1993 to 
1995, investigating possible corruption in union locals. The union 
has said Ruff hired Palladino to help him in tasks related to the 
union's Ethical Practices Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in New York have been looking into the union  
since 1997, but Hoekstra said he believed their investigation has 
been stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Since three Carey campaign consultants pleaded guilty in  
September 1997, federal prosecutors have ``managed to obtain only 
guilty pleas from two minor players, and the indictment of the 
(union's) former political director,'' Hoekstra said. ``Not one 
individual has gone to trial.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Ghanaian Leader Seek Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered his support  
Wednesday for black Americans seeking dual citizenship with Ghana 
and made his own overture at cross-cultural relations: a White 
House state dinner laced with the colors and flavors of the African 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner honoring Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings topped a  
day of talks between the two leaders in which Clinton said the 
Ghanaian parliament had ``a clever idea'' in extending dual 
citizenship to black American descendants of African slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ghana does this, it certainly won't hurt in trying to get  
more Americans interested in Ghana, going to Ghana and contributing 
to Ghana's future,'' said Clinton, who was the first American 
president ever to visit Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	``My continent is the mother not of all continents, but humanity  
today,'' Rawlings said at a news conference. ``There is no reason 
why I would deny my fellow black African the right to enjoy the 
same citizenship that I enjoy as an African.'' 

</P>
<P>
	A tribute to Rawlings Wednesday night provided another  
opportunity for the two leaders to emphasize the ties between their 
nations and the areas in which such alliances could grow. 
</P>
<P>
	That Ghana was the first stop on Clinton's tour of Africa was no  
accident, the president said in his toast. 
</P>
<P>
	It ``allowed us to highlight for all Americans the progress  
Africa has made and the promise of our future together,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings echoed the sentiments, but stressed that the future of  
this partnership would also hinge on such issues as trade and 
regional stability. 
</P>
<P>
	He shared his conviction ``that Ghana can be secure and  
prosperous only when Africa is secure and prosperous'' and called 
on the United States and the international community to act 
decisively in promoting stability in all African nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Conflicts in some African regions warrant the kind of  
international concern and involvement shown to problems in Kosovo, 
the Balkans and the Middle East, Rawlings said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Clinton said he would support ``whatever  
necessary force'' is required to ensure peace in the Congo region, 
which has been seized for months by civil war. He did not commit 
himself to the idea of offering soldiers, but said the United 
States would take part, if asked, in ``an internationally 
recognized'' peacekeeping effort. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who was in town meeting with  
congressional leaders on such issues as U.S. arrears to the United 
Nations, attended the dinner. Annan also used his Washington visit 
to discuss with leaders the need for more international 
peacekeeping in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very pleased with the discussions,'' Annan said Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Other guests celebrated the growing alliance between the two  
nations and their respective leaders. Poet Maya Angelou called the 
tribute ``fitting'' for ``two young men that have great hope for 
their countries. They both are courageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Taylor, editor-in-chief of Essence Magazine, said she  
considers Ghana a second home and owns property there. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she would consider taking up the offer of dual  
citizenship, she responded: ``Absolutely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the evening, White House chefs prepared an ice cream dessert  
flavored with mango and pineapple -- two of Ghana's favorite fruits 
-- and decorated with a traditional kente sash. 
</P>
<P>
	Worn by noblemen and kings in Ghana and used for ceremonies, the  
kente cloth is also one of the most famous products from the 
hometown of Rawlings' wife -- Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of her official state gift, Ms. Agyeman-Rawlings  
presented Mrs. Clinton with three framed pieces of the Ghanaian 
cloth. She also gave the first lady a necklace made of yellow 
stones, which Mrs. Clinton wore when the two women had coffee 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawlings offered Clinton a symbol of authority -- an Ashanti  
stool -- as his official gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Covered in deep green-colored damask tablecloths, the East Room  
dinner tables featured floral arrangements of cream and red roses, 
flowering quince branches, rose colored tulips and white lilacs. 
Gold candles in gold candlesticks surrounded the flowers so that 
the centerpiece gave off hints of gold, red and green -- the colors 
of the Ghanaian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Place settings featured Eisenhower gold base plates and gold  
flatware from the Vermeil Collection, with the FDR china reserved 
for dinner service. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 dinners guests were to feast on a dinner ``hinting  
at the first harbingers of spring,'' said executive chef Walter 
Scheib. Grilled yellow tail snapper, one of the main entrees, 
offers a sure sign that warmer weather is about to come, Scheib 
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hospital Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's proposed year  
2000 budget for veterans hospitals fails to keep pace with the 
costs of medicine and medical center payrolls and will force the 
hospitals to scale back services, system officials and veterans 
complained Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Administering this budget would be like trying to build a  
house of cards in an Oklahoma tornado,'' recently retired Veterans 
Health Administration official Tom Trujillo told the House 
Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on health. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have to have large reductions in force and close  
numerous facilities to live within this budget,'' he said. ``We 
have stretched ourselves way too thin and are ready to snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo was joined at the hearing by current regional directors  
of the system who agreed with his assessment but didn't describe 
the situation as colorfully. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans groups offered their own denunciations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfair that in the presence of the largest budget  
surplus in recent history, while other federal agencies will have 
double-digit increases, veterans are being asked to once again 
sacrifice,'' said the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paralyzed Veterans of America accused the Clinton  
administration of crafting a budget that kills the VA health system 
``through intentional budget strangulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also piled on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody on either side of the aisle likes this budget. This  
budget does stink,'' said Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa. ``I don't know how 
we can flat-line a budget from 1997 to 2002 and not expect the 
system to collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Under Secretary for Health Thomas Garthwaite said the  
administration was aware of ``significant financial challenges 
ahead,'' but that plans still were being formulated to prepare for 
the possibility that Congress might not add extra money to the 
administration's spending request. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans' organizations made public an internal Department  
of Veterans Affairs memo written by Under Secretary Kenneth Kizer, 
who heads the hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are in a serious and precarious situation and  
that if we do not institute these difficult changes in a timely 
manner, then we face the very real prospect of far more problematic 
decisions, e.g. mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of 
services or elimination of programs, and possible unnecessary 
facility closures,'' Kizer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, James Farsetta, director of the VA region  
that operates seven medical centers in New Jersey and southern New 
York, said he has already submitted a request to eliminate 400 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galey, who oversees services in Alaska, Washington,  
Oregon and Idaho, told the subcommittee he's considering staff 
reductions of anywhere from 300 to 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Miller, whose region encompasses Ohio and northern  
Kentucky, said the no-growth budget proposal has her bracing for a 
cut of 200 positions next year, most likely achieved by closing 
hospital wards and suspending plans for new outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your drug costs go up 15 percent a year and employee  
salaries go up 4 percent a year and our employees are 70 percent of 
our budget, at some point there are choices that have to be made,'' 
she said.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Finland 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. women's soccer team, featuring a  
lineup of primarily young players, defeated Finland 3-1 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six players made their international debuts and two Americans  
scored their first international goals as the United States built a 
3-0 lead before allowing a late goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jen Grubb opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a  
thundering free kick that hit the left goalpost and bounced in from 
25 yards. It was Grubb's second international goal in 12 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team scored again off a corner kick in the 17th minute.  
Michelle French sent a cross to Samantha Baggett, who met the ball 
with a glancing header that went in from 10 yards. The goal was 
Baggett's first in international play and came in just her second 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Keller, a sophomore midfielder from Clemson University,  
scored her first goal for the United States on her first touch as 
an international player. Keller entered the match in the 68th 
minute and scored just seconds later when the Americans caught 
Finland off-guard with a quickly taken free kick. French hit Jen 
Streiffer with a short pass, and she fed Keller in the box for a 
goal from six yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans outshot Finland 13-5 and U.S. goalkeeper Tracy  
Ducar was forced to make just one save. But she could do nothing 
about Finland's goal, which came on a breakaway in the 83rd minute 
by Notre Dame star Anne Makinen, who rolled her shot into the right 
corner from 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great performance by our young personalities,'' said  
U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg, who also serves as the head 
coach of the U.S. under-21 team. ``They played with the poise and 
winning mentality that the U.S. women are known for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams meet again Saturday in Tampa, where the United States  
will use its veterans.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charles Schwab became the latest Internet  
brokerage to frustrate online investors as a computer crash just 
minutes after Wednesday's opening bell left the industry's dominant 
player offline for most of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The online system went down at 9:37 a.m. EST due to software  
problems with a new mainframe computer that was added to help 
Schwab handle its booming Internet business, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was fixed by 11:08 a.m., but some customers  
continued to experience delays as technicians gradually restored 
the system. By early afternoon, the company said, service was back 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab, the dominant player in the burgeoning online trading  
industry, asked customers who couldn't place trades through its Web 
site to phone in their trades or visit a broker at one of the 
company's 293 branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company moved additional staffers to the phone lines and  
offered discounted trading fees to mollify angry investors. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, Schwab's stock fell $3.81 1/4 a share, or 5  
percent, to $$69 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Dan Hubbard said Schwab installed a third mainframe --  
a giant computer that runs smaller computer networks -- over the 
weekend as part of its plan to handle booming business. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based brokerage now handles about 153,000  
online trades per day, a market-leading 28 percent of all online 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to increase capacity to keep things running smoothly  
for our customers,'' Hubbard said. ``The technology apparently 
wasn't perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system failure follows a series of similar embarrassments at  
Schwab's main online rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	In early February, software problems at ETrade Group Inc.  
derailed online trading three separate times, prompting two 
class-action lawsuits against that brokerage. Ameritrade and Datek 
have also experienced service interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints about those problems have prompted increased  
attention from regulatory authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state's attorney general recently launched an  
investigation into online brokerages, and the National Association 
of Securities Dealers has laid out guidelines for online brokerages 
to disclose the potential for service problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of system capacity, Schwab already ranks at or near the  
top. Barring technical difficulties, the company's computers can 
handle 88,000 customers at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no end in sight to the surging demand for online  
trading, Schwab and its rivals will be forced to continually 
upgrade their systems, opening the door to more glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio Gomez, founder of Internet consulting firm Gomez Advisors,  
said online brokerages are experiencing severe growing pains as 
millions of investors discover the speed and relative ease of 
online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of 'if the system crashes,' it's a matter of  
'when it crashes,''' Gomez said. ``They are all still marketing 
aggressively, and they're not yet ready to handle all that 
volume.''

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Call Rev. Lyons Greedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The Rev. Henry Lyons stole money intended to  
rebuild burned black churches and spent it on himself, returning it 
only when his ``world went into flames,'' a prosecutor told jurors 
in closing arguments today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA, was  
given the money by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guess which account he put it in? His secret Baptist  
builders-fund account. And then he went on to spend it not on the 
burned churches, but for his own personal purposes,'' Assistant 
State Attorney Jim Hellickson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hellickson began his closing arguments Tuesday in Lyons'  
racketeering and grand theft trial. The defense was expected to 
give its closing argument later today. 
</P>
<P>
	The proceedings resumed this morning shortly after Lyons learned  
that his grandmother, 81-year-old Minnie Lyons -- who helped raise 
him -- died Tuesday night in Gainesville. The judge asked Lyons if 
he was all right to go on with the trial, and he nodded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons and co-defendant Bernice Edwards, a convicted embezzler  
and the convention's former public relations director, are charged 
with racketeering, accused of swindling more than $4 million from 
corporations seeking to market products to members of the powerful 
black church organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons alone is charged with grand theft, accused of stealing  
almost $250,000 from the ADL. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers have said he planned to distribute the money, and he  
repaid it when the ADL asked for its return. They maintain the 
other charges involve failed business deals that are not criminal 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hellickson said Lyons had to scramble, taking money from a  
variety of convention accounts and his own personal savings 
account, to repay the funds to the ADL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was fine. Nobody knew what happened to that money  
until July 6, 1997, when the defendant's world went into flames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons' finances came under investigation after his wife set  
several small fires that day inside a waterfront home owned by 
Lyons and Ms. Edwards. She told deputies she found the deed to the 
home in her husband's briefcase and believed he and Ms. Edwards 
were having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyons, later convicted of arson and sentenced to probation,  
has since said she does not believe Ms. Edwards was her husband's 
mistress and that she supports him. Ms. Edwards also denied on the 
stand that she had an affair with Lyons, but prosecutors described 
her as his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Hellickson described the pair as the ``Bonnie and  
Clyde'' of the denomination, stealing money and then spending it on 
fancy cars, vacations, jewelry and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of using a gun to go and rob their victims, they used  
a pen and they used their word,'' he told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hellickson said the two duped the companies by selling a  
membership mailing list that never existed and then used the money 
to buy the $700,000 waterfront home, a time share condominium, a 
huge diamond ring and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to think of a name for this case ... I think I would  
call it, `Their creed was greed,'' he said. ``They had their fancy 
cars. They had their fancy vacations to Lake Tahoe, to Hawaii a 
couple times. They had their jewelry. They had the real estate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons did not testify on his own behalf, a decision his lawyers  
said was made because he still faces a federal trial in April on 54 
counts including tax evasion, extortion and money laundering.

<HEADLINE> NBC Retains Lead in Sweeps Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- George Clooney wasn't the only big draw on  
television last week, though he was enough to give NBC a big 
ratings boost during the key ``sweeps'' period. 
</P>
<P>
	Clooney's last regular appearance on ``ER'' as Dr. Doug Ross was  
only one example of the ``sweeps'' shows that profited from a 
ballooning number of viewers last week, Nielsen Media Research said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewership last Thursday jumped 30 percent, thanks to ``ER'' and  
other programs, including the final chapter of Stephen King's ABC 
miniseries ``Storm of the Century'' and the Fox reality special 
``World's Most Shocking Medical Videos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sea of network erosion, if you put the right programs on  
people will tune in to the networks. Thursday was a clear example 
of that,'' said industry analyst Mark Berman of New York-based 
Seltel. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's top-rated ``ER'' had the biggest audience for an episode  
of any regular entertainment series this season, with viewership 15 
percent higher than normal for the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The third and final part of the King miniseries ranked 11th for  
the week; the Fox special was 30th. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC won the week of Feb. 15-21 with a 9.9 rating and 16 share,  
keeping the network ahead during the February sweeps, when ratings 
are used to set local advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS was second with a 9.5 rating and 15 share, followed by ABC  
with a 9.2 rating and 15 share. Fox earned a 6.8 rating and 11 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the emerging networks, WB had a 3.7 rating and 6 share,  
UPN had a 2.3 rating and 4 share and PAX TV had a 0.7 rating and 1 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of televisions in use that are tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	Other shows enjoying a sweeps dividend included a two-hour  
episode of ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' with its highest rating since 
October 1997. It was UPN's highest-rated program of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Homicide'' received its best rating since November 1997  
with the conclusion of a crossover episode with ``Law &AMP; Order'' 
that jabbed at a Kenneth Starr-like special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	In the news competition, NBC's ``Nightly News'' posted an 8.3  
rating and 17 share to edge out ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' which 
had an 8.2 rating, 16 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 7.9 
rating and 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Feb. 15-21, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 23.8; ``Friends,'' NBC, 19.0; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 18.8; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 15.9; ``Veronica's 
Closet,'' NBC, 15.6; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.9; ``CBS Sunday Movie, 
Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke,'' Part 1, CBS, 14.3; 
``Touched by an Angel,'' CBS, 14.0; ``ABC Monday Night Movie: Storm 
of the Century,'' Part 2, ABC, 12.2; ``Dateline NBC-Tuesday,'' NBC, 
12.2.

<TEXT>
<P>
	IT'S 2000. ALL THE BUGS ARE GONE. NOW WHAT?: Companies that help  
computer users deal with Year 2000 bugs are hot commodities right 
now, but if they haven't figured out yet what they'll do once all 
the problems are fixed, they could be in trouble, says Individual 
Investor magazine. These companies, specialists in information 
technology, will see their revenue decline sharply next year if 20 
percent or more of their business comes from Y2K contracts, the 
magazine says. The most vulnerable are entrepreneurial concerns 
founded primarily on one idea or product for fixing the bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SHOES THAT PINCH YOUR WALLET TOO: Parents grimace when they see  
the prices for basketball shoes, but the average price for these 
shoes edged downward during 1998, according to the National 
Sporting Goods Association. The trade group found basketball shoes 
averaged $55.48 a pair last year, down 0.2 percent from 1997's 
$55.57. But baseball and softball shoe prices were up a sharp 9 
percent, rising to an average $43.03 a pair from $39.49. Golfers 
wore the most expensive sports shoes, paying an average $56.30 a 
pair -- but that was 6.3 percent less than the previous year's 
$60.11. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NICKEL-AND-DIMING AND DOLLARING, TOO: If you've ever thought  
about adding up what you spend on groceries, gasoline, utilities, 
insurance, health care and other day-to-day items and seeing just 
how bad the damage is over the course of a year, how does $26,379 
sound? American Express surveyed more than 800 consumers and came 
up with that projection for a typical household budget in 1999. The 
survey also found that Americans are seeing big increases in costs 
for insurance, fast-food, subscriptions and high-tech services such 
as cell phones and pagers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TIPPING: If you tip a lot, it may not be  
because you're getting great service. You may just be neurotic. 
Cornell University professor Michael Lynn, quoted in Travel Holiday 
magazine, says his research shows the primary motivation for 
tipping in the United States is social approval. ``You feel you 
have to do what is expected,'' Lynn says. ``And you want the server 
to like you.'' Lynn says he's found that servers in restaurants 
earn bigger tips when they introduce themselves, smile, crouch down 
by the table and draw little smiling faces on the check.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hospital Plan Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans' hospitals may have to reduce staff  
and services next year unless Congress comes up with more money 
than the president has proposed, say administrators and interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``When your drug costs go up 15 percent a year and employee  
salaries go up 4 percent a year and our employees are 70 percent of 
our budget, at some point there are choices that have to be made,'' 
said Laura Miller, who oversees hospitals in Ohio and northern 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Administering this budget would be like trying to build a  
house of cards in an Oklahoma tornado,'' added recently retired 
Veterans Health Administration official Tom Trujillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Trujillo, Miller and other administrators appeared before the  
House Veterans' Affairs subcommittee on health Wednesday to answer 
lawmakers' questions about a spending request that all present 
deemed was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the no-growth budget proposal has her bracing for a  
cut of 200 positions next year, most likely achieved by closing 
hospital wards and suspending plans for new outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Other administrators said they either expected to reduce staff  
in 2000 or had requests pending to start reducing staff this year. 
</P>
<P>
	James Farsetta, director of the VA region that operates seven  
medical centers in New Jersey and southern New York, said he has 
already submitted a request to eliminate 400 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	William Galey, who oversees services in Alaska, Washington,  
Oregon and Idaho, told the subcommittee he's considering staff 
reductions of anywhere from 300 to 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans groups offered their own denunciations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfair that in the presence of the largest budget  
surplus in recent history, while other federal agencies will have 
double-digit increases, veterans are being asked to once again 
sacrifice,'' said the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paralyzed Veterans of America accused the Clinton  
administration of crafting a budget that kills the VA health system 
``through intentional budget strangulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody on either side of the aisle likes this budget,'' said  
Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa. ``I don't know how we can flat-line a budget 
from 1997 to 2002 and not expect the system to collapse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Under Secretary for Health Thomas Garthwaite said the  
administration was aware of ``significant financial challenges 
ahead'' but that plans still were being made to prepare for the 
possibility that Congress might not add money to the 
administration's spending request. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans' organizations made public an internal Department  
of Veterans Affairs memo written by Under Secretary Kenneth Kizer, 
who heads the hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are in a serious and precarious situation and  
that if we do not institute these difficult changes in a timely 
manner, then we face the very real prospect of far more problematic 
decisions, e.g. mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of 
services or elimination of programs, and possible unnecessary 
facility closures,'' Kizer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans' groups did not say how they obtained the memo, but  
Garthwaite did not dispute its authenticity. He said he believed it 
was intended to outline the importance of moving quickly because 
``it will cost more later if we don't take the administrative 
actions early.''

<HEADLINE>  Lakers Fire Coach Del Harris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, mired at .500  
12 games through the abbreviated NBA season, fired coach Del Harris 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball operations,  
said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry Drew -- will 
handle the coaching duties for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which has lost three straight, made the announcement  
as it was adding Dennis Rodman to what on paper is one of the more 
talented teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	West said longtime assistant Bill Bertka would handle the head  
coaching duties Thursday night against the winless Los Angeles 
Clippers before a decision is made on Drew or Rambis, both former 
Laker players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Particularly for me, the thing that makes it so awkward is  
that Del has been a friend for many years,'' West said. ``The 
direction of a team is very important. We do feel like we have the 
talent here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel the last two games we've played have not been  
acceptable. We just felt like there was a deterioration. I talked 
to (owner) Jerry Buss this morning and we just felt like the time 
was right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers lost three games in three days in three different  
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The were beaten 92-89 Sunday at Seattle; 117-113 in overtime at  
Denver on Monday night,and 93-83 at Vancouver on Tuesday night. 
Denver's win was only its second in 10 games this season and the 
Grizzlies had never beaten Los Angeles in 12 previous games between 
the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The three losses left L.A. with a disappointing 6-6 record.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of a team that reached the Western Conference finals before  
being swept by the Utah Jazz last spring is back, but the Lakers 
have been on-again, off-again since the start of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris, 61, was in his fifth season as Lakers head coach and has  
been under criticism from many directions. However, as recently as 
Tuesday night Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal said the team's problems 
weren't the coach's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris has 556 career wins to rank among the top 20 coaches of  
all time. He previously coached the Houston Rockets and Milwaukee 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he had spoken with former Chicago coach Phil  
Jackson or anyone else as a long-term successor, West replied, ``We 
have not talked to anyone. This happened so quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two days before the firing, former Lakers point guard Nick  
Van Exel, traded to Denver following last season, called Harris a 
``cancer on the Lakers.'' Harris and Van Exel had a stormy 
relationship over the last four seasons.

<HEADLINE> Cal. Man Convicted in Sex Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who evaded authorities for years  
was convicted today of 11 counts of first-degree murder in a series 
of sex slavery killings dating back to 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury also found special circumstances of multiple murder  
that make Charles Ng eligible for the death penalty, to be 
determined in a separate penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng looked down at the defendants' table as the verdicts were  
read and showed no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Court clerk Terri Walsh read out the verdict for each count,  
intoning: ``We, the jury, in the above entitled case find the 
defendant, Charles Chitat Ng, guilty of first-degree murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One count, No. 4, was dropped by the judge earlier today after  
jurors pronounced themselves deadlocked on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Oct. 26.  
</P>
<P>
	Ng, a 38-year-old from Hong Kong, was accused of helping  
fugitive survivalist Leonard Lake kill seven men, three women and 
two baby boys in 1984 and 1985. The killings were allegedly part of 
a kidnapping and sex slavery plot hatched by Lake and carried out 
with Ng's help. 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims were videotaped and the tapes were played in court.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can cry and stuff like the rest of them,'' Ng tells a  
terrified victim, 19-year-old Brenda O'Connor, on one tape. ``It 
won't do you no good. We're pretty cold-hearted.'' She, her 
boyfriend and their 1-year-old son were among the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake, who lived in Calaveras County about 150 miles east of San  
Francisco, committed suicide in June 1985 after police questioned 
him. Ng fled to Canada and fought extradition for six years, 
extending the case into one of California's longest and costliest 
homicide prosecutions.

<HEADLINE> Confusion Rules at Tibet Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patti Smith had a simple question at a Tibet  
benefit: Trey what? 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, R.E.M., Sean Lennon, Shawn Colvin, Philip Glass and the  
shaggy-haired Trey Anastasio, lead guitarist for Phish, performed 
Monday night at Carnegie Hall to mark the Tibetan New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of Phish showed up in audible force for Anastasio's solo  
appearance. When Glass invited him on stage for a guitar and piano 
duet, the venerable hall was filled with screaming fans chanting 
``Trey!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also got the ``Trey!'' treatment and joked: ``Trey what? A  
tray of cold cuts?'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were still cries of ``Trey!'' when Tibetan performance  
artists Chaksam-Pa took the stage. ``Trey needs a break,'' one 
member said. The group then performed a traditional Tibetan song 
about respecting elders.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Up; Dow Gains 38.38 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened moderately higher today as traders  
cautiously awaited a second day of testimony by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 38.38 at 9,582.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.22 at 1,278.40, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 15.48 at 2,391.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 4 to 3  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 85.01 
million shares, well below Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.24 at 601.26 and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.19 at 703.11.

	Greenspan, making his second appearance in two days on Capitol  
Hill, was expected to stay close to the remarks he made Tuesday, 
when he gave the Senate Finance Committee signals that he was 
leaning toward raising interest rates eventually. Today the Fed 
chairman was speaking before the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks again led the market. Intel was up 1 3/8 to 135 5/8,

<HEADLINE> CIA Sees Y2K Problems Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian missiles, Chinese power systems and  
Mideast shipping could all face breakdowns because many foreign 
countries are failing to face up to the seriousness of the Year 
2000 computer problem, the CIA told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Gen. John Gordon, CIA deputy director, told a Senate  
Armed Services Committee hearing that Russia appears particularly 
vulnerable, raising concerns about the safety of its missiles, 
nuclear plants and gas pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not see a problem in terms of Russian or Chinese  
missiles automatically being launched'' because of Y2K-related 
problems. But computer glitches could cause local accidents if 
temperature or humidity monitors malfunction, or Russian missile 
early warning systems might put out incorrect information about 
foreign missile launches, Gordon said. He said the Pentagon has 
been consulting with the Russians on how to avoid that danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a special Senate committee on the Y2K problem was  
finishing a draft of a report finding that the United States, while 
well ahead of most of the rest of the world in fixing computers, is 
likely to experience some disruptions in health care, electric 
power and food distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sectors of the economy, many of which provide goods and  
services that are vital to our health and well being, are at 
risk,'' Sens. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., wrote their Senate colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Because older computers use only two digits to read dates, they  
will misread the year 2000 as 1900, resulting in possible erroneous 
data and shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Gordon and the Senate report emphasized that it is  
difficult to assess what will happen on Jan. 1. Within the United 
States, many companies have been reluctant to reveal their status 
out of fear of litigation, while many foreign nations are just 
beginning to deal with the ``millennium bug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are some who ``paint a picture of the collapse of society  
where roving bands of marauders travel the countryside looting 
supplies,'' Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said at the Senate hearing. 
Inhofe said he didn't think that likely, although ``I am sure that 
we will experience some disruptions in our daily lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said a major concern was a midwinter power outage that  
could have ``major humanitarian consequences'' for such countries 
as Russia and Ukraine. He noted that Russia's Gazprom Natural Gas 
Pipeline network supplies more than one-third of Europe's natural 
gas and is run by Soviet-era mainframe computers highly likely to 
contain Y2K imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
	China, he said, is belatedly addressing the problem, but with  
limited time remaining ``will probably experience failures in key 
sectors such as telecommunications, electric power and banking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said oil supplies are also worrisome because world ports  
and ocean shipping are among the sectors that have done the least 
to prepare for the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the draft report's findings were that 90 percent of  
doctors and 50 percent of smaller businesses have not addressed the 
problem. Half of electric power companies had fixed their computers 
by the end of 1998, but ``failure of some parts of the electric 
industry's system is likely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a prolonged, nationwide blackout was not expected, and  
95 percent of telephone systems are supposed to be Y2K-compliant in 
time. Planes, it said, ``will not fall out of the sky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing to suggest this country will experience  
nationwide social or economic collapse, but ``those who suggest 
that it will be nothing more than a 'bump in the road' are simply 
misinformed,'' the draft report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It estimated that Americans will withdraw an average of $500  
from banks, and urged consumers to keep bank statements and take 
extra care with investment decisions. It also said that 
``stockpiling a small amount of extra food and water in the event 
of temporary shortages may also be advisable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre stressed  
that ``our nuclear command and control system has been thoroughly 
tested and has performed superbly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has been criticized as among the worst government  
agencies in confronting the crisis. But Hamre said 93 percent of 
systems will be fixed by March 31, the deadline President Clinton 
set, and 100 percent by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Defense is like a large ship headed toward  
an iceberg,'' he said. ``We have successfully changed course to 
avoid the tip but we must continue our efforts to ensure we miss 
the submerged portion.''
