   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- Several tornados toppled trees and utility poles and
damaged numerous structures in northwest Louisiana Sunday, -- critically
injuring a woman whose house collapsed, authorities said. Five injuries -- four
of them minor -- were reported in a residential neighborhood south of the city
where one funnel cloud reportedly hit, Caddo Parish Sheriff's spokesman Edward
Vailes said. A woman pulled from ruble at her collapsed home had to be revived
en route to Willis Knighton South Hospital, where she was in critical condition,
Vailes said. The storm knocked out power throughout the city, forcing law

   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Jordan's new king on Sunday paid his first state visit
to Israel, underplaying the pomp and ceremony in a pointed reference to the
precarious state of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. King Abdullah II eschewed a
high-profile reception for the visit, which had been scheduled for February but
was delayed due to escalated fighting between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas. At
his insistence, he met Prime Minister Ehud Barak for a scant four hours in
Eilat, a southern Red Sea resort remote from Israel's bustling center.

Columbine Sparks SWAT Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Despite lawsuits claiming that faster SWAT team
action could have saved lives at Columbine High School, experts say the
specially trained officers won't change their slow, methodical approach. What
will change is the training for beat patrolmen, who are being taught to act
faster to control dangerous situations until the SWAT teams arrive. In the past,
law enforcement leaders have been reluctant to send ordinary patrolmen into
tense situations because they have been accused of being trigger happy, said
Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The average price of gasoline in the U.S. dropped
nearly 4 cents a gallon at the pumps in the past two weeks, the Lundberg Survey
reported Sunday. Lower crude oil prices and increased production were behind the
decline, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. Gas prices nationwide, including all
grades and taxes, averaged $1.532 per gallon, which was down 3.89 cents from the
$1.5709 average on April 7. That was down 2.5 cents from the year's high of

<HEADLINE> Attorney general asks for more milk price-gouging authority  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York state's attorney general wants to
redefine what milk price gouging is and get more authority to
prosecute violators.
</P>
<P>
   Fluctuations downward in the wholesale milk prices over the past
18 months -- sometimes without a corresponding plunge in retail
prices -- have shown the weaknesses in the 1991 state law designed
to prohibit the predatory pricing of milk, Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dairy farmer in New York state has been suffering,''
Spitzer said. ''To the extent there is a premium being paid by
consumers, some of that has to go back to the farmer. The farmer is
generating the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the attorney general can only
prosecute milk price gougers when he is asked to intervene by the
state Department of Agriculture and Markets.
</P>
<P>
   The department surveys retailers around the state each month and
when milk is being sold at ''unconscionably excessive'' prices --
generally defined as 200 percent of the wholesale price paid to
farmers -- the department steps in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We say (to retailers), 'Either justify your price or lower
it,''' said Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the state Department of
Agriculture and Markets. ''They will either throw an invoice back
at us demonstrating that they are paying a higher price to their
wholesalers or they will lower their price on the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the department has effectively handled cases of
apparent overcharges through surveying and intervention. No cases
have been referred to the attorney general's office for prosecution
since 1995, when George Pataki became governor, Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been necessary for us to refer a case to the
attorney general,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer was hesitant about criticizing the department directly
for its anti-price gouging efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Would I like to see more aggressive enforcement at all
levels?'' he asked. ''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's proposed legislation changing the price-gouging
enforcement system calls for the state agriculture department to
investigate possible price-gouging if retailers are charging 150
percent of the wholesale price instead of 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by dairy economists at Cornell University
justifies the 150 percent threshold, the attorney general's office
said. Those experts placed a reasonable pricetag of $1.93 on a
gallon of 2 percent milk -- $1.31 for farmers' wholesale price, 34
cents for plant and packaging costs, 22 cents for delivery,
marketing and administrative costs and 6 percent for the cost of
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the $1.93 a gallon price is about 150 percent of
the $1.31 per gallon farmers received for their milk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 150 percent markup should ensure sufficient return to
everyone up and down the production chain leading from the
farmer,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's proposed bill would also change the
criteria for determining factors in acceptable markups. Spitzer
said the relatively short shelf-life of milk creates unique
expenses for retailers which should be taken into account when
determining whether price gouging is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer first got involved in the milk-pricing debate in May
1999. While wholesale prices received by farmers had dropped 30
percent the previous month, his office had found virtually no
corresponding drop in the store price of milk charged by retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, however, said retail milk prices have generally reflected
fluctuations in the wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a gallon of whole milk as noted in
agriculture department surveys climbed to a 1999 high of $3.02 in
November, when farmers began to experience a 30 percent drop in the
wholesale price of milk. The average retail price dropped to $2.58
a gallon in December, Gregg said, and has been between that price
and $2.48 a gallon in the months since.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties for price-gouging would not change under Spitzer's
proposal. They call for restitution of overcharges to customers,
imposition of a penalty equal to the amount of the overcharges and,
for farmers, fines up to $5,000 for the largest milk producers.

College students rejecting invitations to national honor society   
Eds: New for PMS
AP Membership Enterprise, 
By JUDY PATRICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- To state University at Albany junior Mike
Mule, Phi Beta Kappa sounds like another fraternity on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have cultural ones, African ones, academic ones,'' said
Mule, standing outside the Student Center. ''I really couldn't tell
you what Phi Beta Kappa does.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfamiliarity has become a problem for the national honor
society famous for its gold key and illustrious members. Across the
nation, especially at large universities, substantial numbers of
students are passing on the society's invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Phi Beta Kappa isn't accustomed to rejection. Founded at
Virginia's College of William and Mary in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa is
widely viewed as the nation's most prestigious undergraduate honors
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came as a real shock,'' Douglas Foard, executive secretary
of the Phi Beta Kappa Society's national headquarters, said of the
low acceptance rates. How low? Last May, 38 percent of students at
Washington State University accepted their chapter's invitation to
join. At the University at Utah, 41 percent accepted. Skidmore
College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Union College in nearby
Schenectady say their acceptance rates are at or near 100 percent.
Not so at the University at Albany, where acceptance is about 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Foard said students at large public universities are more likely
to decline membership than those at small, private schools -- like
Skidmore and Union. If allowed to continue, those declines could
eventually take some of the shine off the Phi Beta Kappa key.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our currency has always been very good at graduate schools,''
Foard said. ''But in time, if a prospective employer doesn't
recognize what Phi Beta Kappa is, the decline would have eroded our
value.''
</P>
<P>
   On a resume, Phi Beta Kappa is a well-noted distinction,
particularly if earned at an Ivy League school, according to Steven
Helmholz, a principal with executive search firm Korn-Ferry
International in New York City. Again, he noted, the value of the
distinction is linked to the college at which it was earned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something employers look for as a 'must-have,''' he
said. ''It's a good 'want-to-have' but no one is not taking
candidates for lack of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Phi Beta Kappa, low acceptance rates have prompted effort at
the national level, where a full-time staffer was hired to monitor
chapter performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've found are students who have never heard of us
before, especially students at large, publicly-funded colleges,
many of whom are first-generation college students,'' Foard said.
''That set off alarms for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Phi Beta Kappa is working with its high school and two-year
college counterparts -- the National Honor Society and Phi Theta
Kappa -- to increase its visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''National Honor Society elects 250,000 high school students
each year, and we want them all to know what Phi Beta Kappa is
before they walk out the high school door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ragi Patel, a senior at the University at Albany elected to the
society last fall, is one of the exceptions. She was well aware of
what Phi Beta Kappa was long before her invitation to join arrived.
And now that she is in, she's mailing copies of her initiation
certificate to law schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of students don't understand what it is,'' Patel said.
''They see the Greek letters and assume it's a fraternity. But it's
a very prestigious organization.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the problems of Phi Beta Kappa -- Greek for
''philosophy the guide life'' -- reflect changing attitudes toward
the liberal arts and sciences and the expanded role of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, 75 percent of a student's undergraduate credits
must involve liberal arts and science courses; students with more
professional-oriented majors -- such as engineering or teaching --
are not eligible. Students are elected by the college's faculty and
staff chapter members based on transcripts. The cost to students
varies, but includes a one-time $25 fee to the national
organization. Aid, however, is available.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has demonstrated very much the revolutionary times we're
living through,'' Foard said. ''It's made us realize we have to
work very hard to make our case to the next generation. You can't
rest on your laurels.''

Internet, Asia Propel PC Sales

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The personal computer industry rode the Internet boom
and Asia's nascent economic comeback to double-digit sales growth to start the
year, according to two industry reports released Monday. While their preliminary
figures differed slightly, both Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp.
concluded that PC shipments increased by healthy margins during the first three
months of 2000. The research groups estimated that PC manufacturers shipped 30
million machines in the period ending March 31. San Jose, Calif.-based
Dataquest, a unit of Gartner Group, said worldwide sales grew 15 percent from
the comparable 1999 period while Framingham, Mass.-based IDC pegged the

<HEADLINE> Iran Court Closes Reformist Papers  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A dozen pro-democracy newspapers and
magazines were missing from newsstands Monday following a ban by
Iranian hard-liners who have openly challenged presidential reforms
widely backed by the liberal press.
</P>
<P>
   Eight major daily newspapers and four weekly or biweekly
magazines were among the publications closed down by order of the
hard-line judiciary in Tehran late Sunday, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   A judiciary statement quoted by IRNA said the publications were
closed for ''printing material against the lofty Islamic principles
and commands.''
</P>
<P>
   The closures intensified a media crackdown that has included the
imprisonment of two leading reformist journalists over the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
   The latest developments came three days after Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the hard-line supreme leader whose powers supersede those
of the elected president, said there were 10 to 15 reformist papers
undermining Islamic and revolutionary principles, insulting
constitutional bodies and creating tension and discord in society.
His comments were widely seen as a warning to all reformist
newspapers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Only four reformist newspapers -- Akhbar-e-Eqtesad,
Sobh-e-Emrooz, Mosharekat and Bayan -- were in print Monday. It was
not clear why they were not included in the ban.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police seized Latif Safari, director of the banned
Neshat daily, and took him to Tehran's Evin prison, his son,
Amir-Hossein, told The Associated Press. Safari, whose arrest comes
a day after authorities detained the nation's top investigative
reporter, is the third journalist to be imprisoned this month.
</P>
<P>
   Safari was sentenced in September to 27 months in jail for
insulting Islam, police and lawmakers, and provoking riots with
articles about an attack on a Tehran University dormitory by police
and hard-line vigilantes, his son said. The raid last July, in
which one student was killed, ignited riots in several large
cities, the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   An arrest warrant against Safari was issued last Wednesday after
his appeal was denied, said his son, who is a journalist at the
liberal Asr-e-Azadegan daily.
</P>
<P>
   Before Safari's sentencing last year, the hard-line judiciary
had closed down Neshat, the nation's top reformist newspaper, on
charges that included insulting Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Safari's arrest comes amid efforts by hard-line opponents of
President Mohammad Khatami to limit press freedoms and crack down
on a liberal media that has widely backed presidential reforms.
Nearly every leading reformist journalist has been summoned for
questioning by the judiciary, which is controlled by the
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Akbar Ganji, the nation's top investigative
journalist, was summoned to court and arrested on the spot for
violations of the press law.
</P>
<P>
   Ganji, whose articles in several reformist newspapers had
suggested a shadowy group of hard-line officials were behind the
murders of five dissidents in the fall of 1998, is something of a
national hero. His books about the killings are best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the judiciary upheld the conviction of
Mahmoud Shams, editor in chief of Asr-e-Azadegan, giving him a
2{-year jail term on charges of ''insulting religious sanctities.''
Shams has been a leading voice for press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Saeed Hajjarian, another leading journalist, was shot
in the face and gravely wounded. Reformist newspapers and officials
have blamed the attack on hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against the liberal media could intensify if the
strongly conservative Guardian Council approves legislation passed
Tuesday by hard-liners who dominate the outgoing Parliament to give
the judiciary more teeth in curbing outspoken newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami hit back at his opponents Saturday, saying the
hard-liners were pushing the country toward ruin and despotism by
claiming that reforms threatened both Islam and Iran's
revolutionary ideology.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Mulls a Speakers' Corner  </HEADLINE>
By DEAN VISSER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- If Singapore sets up its proposed Speakers'
Corner, don't look for the wild and radical oratory found at its
historic London namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a grudge here would have to register before
haranguing from the designated spot. The city-state's government
also would maintain its power to detain without trial anyone deemed
a threat to public order.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rules, though, the proposed Speakers' Corner is a
sign that Singapore is wrestling with its image as an authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   The ground rules and location of the free-speech zone have yet
to be worked out. The government is expected to announce more
detailed plans when Parliament meets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Singapore scoff at the Speakers' Corner idea as cosmetic
democracy. Others see it as a step toward political openness. Still
others wonder what anyone in this safe, comfortable and prosperous
country would have to complain about -- aside from restraints on the
freedom to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Singaporeans, in letters to the editor, have been suggesting a
free-speech venue for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong first said Singapore was not ready.
But last month he promised some sort of free-speech zone, although
he stressed it ''is not going to be as free as London's Speakers'
Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be rules but, of course, at a minimum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said Speakers' Corner orators will be bound
by existing strict security and libel laws.
</P>
<P>
   That has left some Singaporeans skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''People get all sorts of false ideas about liberalization in
Singapore. I'm sorry -- it's a mirage,'' said Joshua Jeyaretnam, one
of only three opposition lawmakers in the 93-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping speakers bound by existing limits would make the
free-speech venue a ''contradiction in terms,'' Jeyaretnam, 74,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jeyaretnam, like other opposition politicians, has lost a number
of expensive defamation suits to Singapore's leaders after making
critical remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits set a chilling example, Jeyaretnam said. But he and
many others agree that Singapore's Internal Security Act is most
responsible for what they call an overwhelming ''climate of fear''
on the balmy tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   That law allows detention without trial of anyone considered a
threat to Singapore's security or public order.
</P>
<P>
   A former university lecturer, Chia Thye Poh, was detained under
the act for 23 years. Security detentions are seldom heard of these
days, but many people still seem terrified that making the wrong
complaint could get them locked up.
</P>
<P>
   James Gomez, Singaporean author of the book ''Self-Censorship:
Singapore's Shame,'' said the city-state's people could get away
with speaking up more, but prefer to err on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   He said the security act ''has damaged the psyche of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Speakers' Corner could be a small step toward giving people a
bigger voice in society, said Simon Tay, who holds one of nine
special nonpartisan seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a micro-step, a baby step, but nevertheless a step,'' he
said. ''Change comes from whittling away at things.''
</P>
<P>
   Singapore is clearly Southeast Asia's most developed, stable and
prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeyaretnam, Gomez and others say Singaporeans have plenty to
complain about: sky-high cost of living, a harshly competitive
education system and heavy government involvement in labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The government aggressively pushes the Internet as a key to
prosperity and it urges Singaporeans to become cosmopolitan global
citizens. But it also insists they cling to core ''Asian values'' --
including respect for authority.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and
Malaysia, street protests are nonexistent in Singapore. There are
no strikes. Recent nationwide wage cuts were accepted without a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   Films, TV shows and pop music are censored. Media endure stern
public warnings if they get too critical of authorities. A number
of books and magazines are banned, and home satellite TV antennae
are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Singaporeans grumble quietly about the restrictions. But
others agree with the government that its tight control has kept
society stable and that leaders' proven efficiency and lack of
corruption leave little need for change.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy with my government,'' said Yee Kai Lin, 24, an
engineer at a factory. ''I think there's no need to challenge
them.''

<HEADLINE> China Wages Silent War on Health  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- For two years, the young disciple worked in the
wilderness of China's far north, winning converts. Then, last year,
police descended on the center he set up to spread his master's
health and healing practices, rifling through its books and
instructional tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, his school and more than 3,000 businesses and
teaching and treatment centers belonging to the Zhong Gong group
had been closed, its millions of followers dispersed, practitioners
said.
</P>
<P>
   The movement ''collapsed, died in complete silence,'' said Bai,
the disciple, who did not want his full name used for fear of
official reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes of China's highly publicized war on the Falun
Gong spiritual movement, the government is also waging a
devastating campaign against Zhong Gong and other health and
meditation groups. Like Falun Gong, the communist leadership views
them as a threat to its monopoly on power.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong exploded into Chinese leaders' consciousness last
April 25 when 10,000 followers protested outside Communist Party
headquarters in Beijing to seek legal protection from official
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The group's organizational flair, multimillion-member following
and adherents' devotion to founder Li Hongzhi sharpened official
suspicions of all groups derived from traditional Chinese ''qi
gong'' (pronounced chee-gong) -- meditation and breathing exercises
to promote health.
</P>
<P>
   China's entirely state-run media and the government have
trumpeted the crackdown on Falun Gong. Thousands of practitioners
have been detained since it was outlawed in July in the campaign
against what the government says is an evil cult.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities refuse to talk about the clampdown on other qi
gong organizations, and state media have all but ignored it. So far
the campaign has affected at least five groups, practitioners,
government sources and human rights organizations say.
</P>
<P>
   China's Foreign Ministry, police, Cabinet and Religious Affairs
Bureau refused to answer questions about the wider crackdown. With
the U.S. Congress set to vote in May on trade with China, officials
may be trying to avoid adding to the international criticism
generated by the assault on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International, the purported founder of
Cibei Gong was arrested Sept. 8 and at least five leaders of Guo
Gong were detained in November. A Bodhi Gong training center in
Beidaihe, a seaside resort where Chinese leaders meet annually, was
shut down last year, an official there said. Xiang Gong followers
are reportedly being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong, founded in 1987, was the largest of the groups. It
attracted millions of followers.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the group said
authorities have detained nearly 600 followers, including 25
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those, Cheng Yaqin, has been held for six months in a
detention center in Baoding, a city 95 miles south of Beijing, her
daughter said. The daughter was detained with Cheng, held for three
weeks and released. Authorities have refused to say why Cheng is
being held, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong's founder, Zhang Hongbao, is thought to be in hiding.
His first company, a three-story clinic and teaching center in
Beijing, stands empty, its gates padlocked, its sky-blue exterior
weathered.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was closed around the time of the government's Oct. 1
celebration of 50 years of Communist Party rule, hundreds of people
from all over China visited the center each day for classes and
treatment, practitioners said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong Gong ran clinics, training retreats and businesses
throughout China that sold tapes, books, qi gong uniforms, health
products and sundries like Tibetan incense and mineral water,
according to reports sent by Zhong Gong adherents to a Hong
Kong-based rights group, the Information Center for Human Rights
and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Zhong Gong had 38 million followers, including many
local government officials, said Bai, the disciple who worked as a
security guard at group gatherings before moving north to Inner
Mongolia in 1997 to set up a center there.
</P>
<P>
   Like Falun Gong followers, Zhong Gong members refer to their
founder as ''master'' and themselves as ''disciples.'' They said
they use Zhong Gong to open energy channels in their bodies,
promoting health and vitality. They also said Zhang's teachings
promote moral living.
</P>
<P>
   Bai said that with Zhong Gong exercises, he can get by on two
hours sleep a night.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Liping, a Zhong Gong teacher who moved around China
teaching and healing people, said it helped her overcome a history
of illness and her husband's death in a car crash. ''Our master
gave me a second life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crackdown, practitioners met in parks at dawn to
perform breathing and meditation exercises. Bai said the more
people who practice together, the greater the energy they create,
like putting electric batteries in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do miss it,'' he said. ''You can't eradicate qi gong from
people's hearts.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Viewed From Other Side  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- The final, frenzied days of the Vietnam
War were rich with dramatic images. Panicked Vietnamese scaled the
walls of the U.S. Embassy. An American helicopter lifted off with
evacuees still trying to climb aboard.
</P>
<P>
   But these powerful images from April 1975 -- and almost all of
the conflict's best-remembered pictures -- were taken by foreign and
South Vietnamese photographers with access to only one side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Largely unseen to this day are equally striking images by North
Vietnamese photographers, whose dangerous work enlivened otherwise
drab communist newspapers but rarely reached the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after the war's end, a trio of leading North
Vietnamese war photographers opened their musty archives to The
Associated Press and recounted tales of working under fire in
steamy jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Their photos, pulled from dog-eared scrapbooks and frayed
folders, offer a dramatically different perspective on many aspects
of the war, including the final day -- April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The enduring pictures by Western photographers that day in
U.S.-backed South Vietnam were filled with unmitigated fear of the
imminent communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But Dinh Quang Thanh, who followed a North Vietnamese tank to
the front steps of the Presidential Palace, captured a very
different mood -- throngs of South Vietnamese civilians cheering,
waving and offering food to North Vietnamese troops entering
Saigon, now renamed Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd been listening to South Vietnamese radio saying there
would be a blood bath if the communists took over,'' said Thanh,
now 64 and retired. ''We knew this was propaganda, and I wanted to
document the truth with my camera.''
</P>
<P>
   One photo shows four soldiers dashing inside the palace to hoist
their flag in triumph. South Vietnamese troops and government
ministers, who put up no resistance, wear a hangdog look of
resignation, but there's no sense of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The North Vietnamese photographers shared the same miserable
jungle conditions as the soldiers, and saw themselves as
full-fledged members of the guerrilla army rather than independent
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I considered myself a soldier, and the camera was my weapon,''
Thanh said.
</P>
<P>
   Their state-controlled newspapers never published images that
might have undermined the war effort. Still, the photographers
insist their work was an accurate portrait of the tremendous
hardships the northern soldiers and civilians endured during a war
that claimed 3 million Vietnamese lives nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Trong Thanh spent five years working along the Ho Chi Minh
Trail, the legendary network of mostly dirt paths that snaked
through mountains and jungles, allowing communist guerrillas to
ferry weapons and troops to the south.
</P>
<P>
   When he headed out in 1968, Thanh carried three bulky cameras,
400 rolls of film and processing chemicals. He stored his negatives
in a pouch that he wore like a belt -- even when he slept.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans sometimes bombed 24 hours a day. You never knew
when you would have to run away. Many photographers lost their film
and cameras this way,'' said Trong Thanh, 58. When he needed to
move fast, he tossed out food or clothing -- but never his
irreplaceable photo gear.
</P>
<P>
   Mai Nam, who shot life in the underground tunnel network that
was so instrumental to the North's victory, was hampered when the
batteries for his flash died. His solution: extract gunpowder from
bullets for small fires. The eerie glow illuminated concerts by
female singers and water buffalo that shared the cramped
netherworld.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our cameras were old and not very good. The film came from
Russia after it was past its expiration date. It was extremely hard
to keep our equipment dry in the wet climate,'' said Nam, 69.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous picture shows a flaming American F-105 plane
crashing toward the ground like an arrowhead and the pilot, who
ejected seconds earlier, floating down to imminent capture.	   The North
Vietnamese cameramen neither expected nor received
fame or fortune, and with few exceptions, the outside world has not
seen their work. That is beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Requiem,'' a highly acclaimed book featuring the work of
photographers on both sides who died in the conflict was published
in 1997 by two wartime cameramen, Tim Page, a free-lancer, and
Horst Faas, now an Associated Press senior photo editor.
</P>
<P>
   Trong Thanh has had perhaps the best individual success so far,
publishing two books of his war photos, one in the United States
and the other in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his favorite -- and the only war picture to adorn his
studio -- was never published during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white image shows a kneeling North Vietnamese
soldier sharing his canteen with a dazed South Vietnamese fighter
wounded in a 1971 battle.
</P>
<P>
   Trong Thanh's North Vietnamese editors wouldn't touch the
picture, believing it could ''weaken the fighting spirit'' by
humanizing the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally debuted at a 1991 exhibit in the United States,
young people accepted it as genuine, but many older Americans
rejected it as a setup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way I could have fabricated this photo,'' he said.
''But that's what some people want to believe.''

<HEADLINE> Dominos Fall Other Way in Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The rueful joke, back in 1975, was that
if Vietnamese troops invaded Thailand, the only thing to stop them
from knifing on through Malaysia to Singapore was Bangkok's
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, troops could skirt the thriving Thai capital on freeway
overpasses. But Vietnam is now peaceable and, in any case, so
impoverished it would have trouble scraping up cash for the
tollbooths.
</P>
<P>
   The domino theory, a multifaceted scenario of communist
contagion that brought America into the Vietnam War, has slipped
into history. Cambodia fell, and so did Laos. Elsewhere, though,
Southeast Asia boomed with free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Even in distant hindsight, those who lived through the era of
teetering dominos are divided over how serious the threat was.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Americans had not fought in Vietnam, Thailand would be
communist today,'' pronounced Maj. Gen. Bunchon Chawansin, former
head of military intelligence against guerrillas in southern
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ''No way,'' countered Thongchai Suwanvihok, who as Comrade
Chaung was Bunchon's enemy in a bloody jungle war. ''We would never
have won. The Thai society and culture would not support
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two men, now like-minded fishing buddies who were
interviewed together, agree on an overriding lesson of the Vietnam
War: dominos and nations have little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Thongchai, site manager for a private power company, says Thai
communist leaders rejected Vietnam's offer of 50,000 men, with
heavy armor, to seize eastern Thailand between the Cambodian border
and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   ''We opposed American imperialism, but we did not want to give
up our country to anyone else, either,'' he said. ''Rural farmers
only supported us because they wanted a better life, and we
promised that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunchon said the government realized that in 1980. ''Instead of
trying to kill every communist we could, like in Vietnam, we tried
reconciliation,'' he said. ''We developed rural areas. They stopped
fighting. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the
Philippines pooled resources to create the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. If the thrust was economic, defense issues were
close behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, Singapore Trade Minister George Yeo once
remarked, ASEAN's members came together as ''frightened, huddled
sheep.'' Before long, the metaphor shifted to economic tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam ended up joining ASEAN in 1995, followed by Laos and
Cambodia, but its role in a region dominated by business is a pale
shadow of the military and political power it once had.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I could use the word minuscule,'' Ian Buchanan, a
Southeast Asian specialist with Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton in Singapore,
replied when asked to assess Vietnam's impact on regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has enormous potential. At 76 million, its population is
second only to Indonesia in a country of rich earth and varied
beauty. Despite lingering suspicion of outsiders, tourism is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, however, neighbors that once feared its shadow
now tower above it. Vietnam's annual gross domestic product ranges
above $300 a person. Thailand's is 10 times higher. Singapore's is
100 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vietnam needs a next step of bold reform, but they don't seem
to have the political courage to do it,'' said Daljit Singh, of the
Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, as its Soviet ally liberalized with perestroika,
Vietnam's ''doi moi'' -- renovation -- policies opened up the
economy. Until 1995, its gross domestic product grew more than 8
percent a year. Foreigners flocked in to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said the early promise evaporated because of red tape,
corruption and discord within the government over how much freedom
to allow in the tightly controlled state economy. Asia's 1997
economic crisis added a crippling blow.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first ASEAN partners thought they would benefit from the
ability to organize, focus and work hard that Vietnam showed in the
war,'' Singh said. ''These days, we've forgotten all about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese officials say they are moving with care, having seen
from the region's 1997 crisis that unbridled capitalism could knock
them over like a domino from the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to prepare ourselves adequately before we expose
ourselves to (capital) flows,'' said Le Linh Lan of Vietnam's
Institute for International Relations. ''Opening up our economy in
a rush to catch up may be counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   With neither convertible currency nor a stock market, Vietnam
suffered most as others began to recover, she said, ''and the
impact was quite severe and enduring.''
</P>
<P>
   However Vietnam develops, analysts agree, that fearful domino
theory seems today like a curious footnote of overestimation.
</P>
<P>
   In an ''eyes only'' document dated July 15, 1975, declassified
only this year, the U.S. National Security Council advised
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that Vietnam was a much greater
threat than its neighbors realized.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most nations in Asia apparently believe that revolutionary
warfare of the Vietnamese model, like a car accident, is something
that happens to other people,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, it added, sought more U.S.
protection after the war in what the memo called ''the reverse
domino effect, as countries that felt safe now begin to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of 25 years, the former Thai enemies can
joke about the threat without that touch of rue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems very funny now,'' Gen. Bunchon said. ''We laugh about
where we each were when the other was shooting, about trying to
trick each other. I learned that if you treat everyone fairly,
guerrillas cannot win.''
</P>
<P>
   Thongchai expressed relief he opposed Vietnam's proposal that
its soldiers come to help the Communist Party of Thailand. ''I am
very happy that we did not make that big mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Private university's graduate students voting on unionizing  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In her climb up the academic ladder, Laura
Tanenbaum teaches freshman writing at New York University while
working on her doctorate. It pays $11,500 for a nine-month stint, a
pittance in high-priced New York, the 25-year-old complains.
</P>
<P>
   What graduate teaching and research assistants need is the right
to bargain collectively for better pay and benefits, Tanenbaum and
some of her colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a move NYU officials warn could shatter academic
freedom but students insist means survival, 1,400 graduate teaching
and research assistants at the university will vote whether to form
a union represented by the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   A ''yes'' vote could make NYU the first private American
university subject to collective bargaining with graduate
assistants. About two dozen public universities already are.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for is recognition from the university that
we're adults who provide a service,'' Tanenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   NYU officials argue that teaching and research duties come with
students' financial aid packages, so they're not workers entitled
to a union.
</P>
<P>
   They also say private universities lack the protection state
laws give their public counterparts, such as curbing strikes and
barring interference with course content.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be impossible, or virtually impossible, to separate
the educational issues from employment issues,'' said Robert Berne,
NYU vice president for academic development.
</P>
<P>
   Union organizers deny this.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not looking for and we do not believe we could legally
obtain any say in curriculum,'' said Patrick McCreery, 33, an NYU
doctoral candidate in American Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board will supervise balloting set
for Tuesday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NYU appealed to the NLRB to stop the election, or at
least hold results while the board hears the case.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Friday that the election would take place.
Unless it rules on the appeal by Thursday, the votes will be
impounded until the case is decided. Any outcome could be
challenged in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The university's case was dealt a setback this month when the
NLRB regional director ruled graduate teaching assistants are
employees entitled to organize. Excluded were scientific
researchers paid by outside funds.
</P>
<P>
   What comes of the vote at NYU could affect the 100 or so private
institutions among the nation's 220 schools with doctoral programs.
Graduate assistants, primarily teachers and researchers, nationwide
number some 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a test case, and we're entering into unchartered
waters,'' said Catharine Stimpson, dean of NYU's Graduate School of
Arts and Science.
</P>
<P>
   Pitting graduate students against their school could upset
collegial tradition and threaten academic freedom, said Jon Fuller
of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities.
</P>
<P>
   ''These institutions are run by collective governance,'' Fuller
said. ''By the same rationale ... the management of General Motors
couldn't form a union. They run the place.''
</P>
<P>
   NYU teaching and research assistants get tuition assistance,
stipends and other financial help, and the financial packages are
good and improving, school officials says.
</P>
<P>
   Packages vary, but in the arts and science school, assistants'
tuition and fees are free, they get money for child care, and this
fall the department's minimum stipend rises to $13,000 plus $400
for health care.
</P>
<P>
   The number of state universities with graduate assistants unions
has grown this past decade to a couple dozen at a time of growing
financial pressure on schools and students.
</P>
<P>
   The waning influence of the labor movement has turned unions'
eyes to college campuses. In the mid-1990s, unions began offering
summer internships.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of the labor movement's attempt to reach a broader
audience,'' said Elissa McBride at the AFL-CIO in Washington.
''We're looking for allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The union experience at schools is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the University of California's eight campuses
formed unions, contracts remain unsettled. Last week some students
went on strike for a day.
</P>
<P>
   It may not even bring better pay but contracts keep duties clear
and promote equality, said Paul Prew, president of the Graduate
Teaching Fellows Federation at the University of Oregon in Eugene.
''It tends to reduce the amount of favoritism that tends to be
played out in graduate school,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Inner City Children Learning Chess  </HEADLINE>
By ROBIN McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unleashing what appears to be a deadly attack on
his opponent's king, 9-year-old Eliot Majors slides his queen
diagonally across the chessboard -- then inexplicably halts one
square short.
</P>
<P>
   Check. Not checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   Several watching youngsters groan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nooo!'' cries one, falling to the ground in dramatic
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''You sure you want to do that?'' asks Maurice Ashley, casually
tucking his glasses into a jacket pocket as he takes a seat beside
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur Ashe did for tennis, as Tiger Woods is doing for golf,
34-year-old Ashley -- the world's first and only black grandmaster
of chess -- is helping bring an elite game played predominantly by
whites to minority kids.
</P>
<P>
   From New York to Los Angeles, covers of Chess Life magazine
featuring Ashley are taped to the walls of inner-city recreation
halls where youngsters gather to play the intricate centuries-old
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have people calling from all over wanting him to come to
their schools,'' says Barbara DeMaro, executive assistant of the
United States Chess Federation. ''Kids look up to him. There's a
feeling, if he can do it, we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the Harlem Chess Center at the Police Athletic
League community center in central Harlem seven months ago, Ashley
thought kids would embrace the game, but he is surprised by the
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, some 80 children who might have headed for
basketball hoops after school instead pack a tiny room lined with
white-and-green checkered boards. Using moves that reflect medieval
war strategy, they learn how to maneuver pawns, castles, bishops,
knights and queens in a battle to capture the opposing kings.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the most depressing things about growing up in the
inner city -- and I did -- is that there's handball, basketball,
football, all kinds of sports things, but very little in the way
that is intellectually stimulating,'' says Ashley, who was barely a
teen when he and his family moved from Jamaica to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley learned the rules of chess at age 9. He started getting
serious at 14, latching onto teens and young men who spent hours
playing fast and furiously in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from City College with an English degree, he
started coaching and led a Harlem middle-school team -- the Dark
Knights of Mott Hall -- to three national championships in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he was ascending the international chess rankings and
last March was awarded the game's highest title -- grandmaster. Only
500 others hold the rank around the world, including Garry Kasparov
and Bobby Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   September found him at the gala opening of the Harlem Chess
Center, which like the Dark Knights is funded by the nonprofit
Harlem Educational Activities Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, streets were blocked off and rows of chess boards
lined sidewalks. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis played and spoke with
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had so many kids sign up that first day,'' Ashley says.
''We were worried we weren't going to be able to take them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of elementary, middle and high school students in
Harlem and the South Bronx have already learned the game thanks to
another nonprofit program -- Chess-In-Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that young chess players raise their reading scores
and concentrate better. The game teaches strategy and consequences
and instills confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, every eighth-grader in the Mott Hall chess program
was accepted at either Stuyvesant High School or the Bronx High
School of Science, two of the top high schools in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some rough kids in that class, and I honestly believe
chess made the difference,'' says Jerald Times, the Dark Knights'
current director.
</P>
<P>
   At all the chess programs around the city, teachers place
special emphasis on the girls, who tend to quit around the sixth
grade. Until then, they do just as well, often better, than the
boys.
</P>
<P>
   At the chess center, Esme Rogers' eyes sparkle as she beats New
York University volunteers, even after giving them a three-minute
handicap in speed chess.
</P>
<P>
   Watching two instructors wrestle with a complex chess problem,
the 9-year-old cannot stay away; her fingers literally twitch with
desire to move the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to figure out the problem by the time her father comes
for her, she writes down the pieces' places so she can keep trying
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like this one,'' she says. ''It makes you think.''

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian Case No Victory  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro says he's trying not to be triumphant
about the return of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not call it a day of victory. I insist on this,'' Castro
told reporters Sunday after voting in local elections. ''We are not
the people who have tried to take advantage of the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader said he was aware that the return of Elian to
his father, who wants to take the boy back to Cuba, would be called
a victory for the communist state by his foes in the United States
and that ''could cause worry'' for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But his own happiness was obvious. And his close colleagues were
less restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great joy at this victory,'' said Castro's brother
Raul, vice president and head of Cuba's armed forces. He added it
was a victory ''shared'' by U.S. officials who removed the child
Saturday from the house of Miami relatives trying to keep Elian in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leaders have mobilized a nearly constant campaign for
Elian's return, gathering hundreds of thousands of people at mass
rallies and airing special television programs most nights.
</P>
<P>
   Both Castro and his foes have accused one another of exploiting
the child, but Castro has promised that there will be no
celebrations if Elian returns. He said Saturday he would not even
greet Elian at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban president insisted he was trying to restrain any major
celebrations and even dampen publicity about the case, although
Sunday's only national newspaper, Juventud Rebelde, dedicated most
of its front page to a photo of a smiling Elian with his Cuban
family and the headline: ''All Cuba in an Embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in honor of Elian's reunion with his father, Castro
called ''a truce'' with the United States for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader said Sunday that it would not have ''seemed
elegant'' to attack the U.S. government that day ''because they had
done something just'' and because Attorney General Janet Reno
already was being criticized by anti-Castro forces in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were going to complain,'' he said, it would be that Reno
''did too much'' in pursuing negotiations in trying to avert the
need for the raid. ''Really, at that extreme point she wanted a
negotiated and peaceful settlement at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Castro brothers spoke to reporters while voting in
municipal elections. Officials reported than more than 95 percent
of the nearly 8 million eligible voters turned out to elect 14,686
city council members.
</P>
<P>
   Voting for two or more candidates for each seat was secret.
Candidates were chosen at neighborhood meetings and no party
affiliation was listed on ballots, though most were members of
Cuba's sole party, the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Voting is not mandatory, and officials insist that there are no
punishments for those who do not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns were limited to a one-page biography of each candidate
posted at polling places.
</P>
<P>
   In an implicit praise of his own country's system, the Cuban
president said that in the United States, ''democracy consists
simply of who has more money for publicity, for the campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Vote For City Councils  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- With a reported turnout of more than 95 percent,
Cubans elected city councils across the island on Sunday in voting
that officials argue is more democratic than that in most other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 8 million Cubans aged 16 and over were registered, and
the vast majority voted well before midday, choosing between two or
more candidates in each district. At stake were 14,686 seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three local elections since 1992, more than 97
percent of eligible voters came to the polls. Justice Minister
Roberto Diaz Sotolongo told Cuban television Sunday night that the
turnout this year was ''greater than 95 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting in the Vedado area of Havana, President Fidel
Castro charged that in the United States, ''democracy consists
simply of who has more money for publicity, for the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns are virtually banned in Cuba. ''No candidate has a
program or makes promises,'' said Justice Minister Roberto Diaz
Sotolongo, head of the National Electoral Commission. Ballots make
no reference to party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The only information about each candidate is posted at the doors
of polling places: a single-page biography listing their job
history and activities in organizations such as the Communist Party
or labor groups.
</P>
<P>
   There are no parties listed on the ballot and nonmembers of the
Communist Party can run, though most of the 31,000 candidates seem
to be party members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Communist Party is the party that directs the Cuban
people, that directs our society,'' Diaz Sotolongo said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are chosen in neighborhood meetings open to all.
</P>
<P>
   Dissent rarely rears its head in the process: Cubans are more
likely to express private complaints or emigrate, though officials
argue that much of that emigration is for economic reasons. People
from about 15 percent of the island's households have applied for
visas to emigrate to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Sotolongo said that under electoral rules, government
opponents could become candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why doesn't that happen? Because the counterrevolution does
not have a majority in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting is secret and anyone, including foreign visitors, can
watch votes being counted.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that Cubans are afraid to nominate opposition
figures or not vote for fear it might count against them in a
country where the overwhelming majority of jobs are in state
organizations. Even private companies hire from lists vetted by the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Sotolongo insisted that ''there is no discriminatory
treatment of any kind for not voting ... There is no mechanism of
punishment either.''
</P>
<P>
   While advocating abstention can be considered a crime, none of
numerous Cubans interviewed about the elections have said they know
anyone who suffered for not voting, although few knew of any who
had abstained. A few admitted concern about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no pressure to vote; it's not obligatory,'' said Jose
Antonio Lescaille, 29, who said he was ''proud of my country.'' But
he said the party's neighborhood committees might take note of not
voting ''as something else you've done.''
</P>
<P>
   But another voter, Julia Garcia, 50, said ''there is no kind of
repression'' of those who do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni drug comes to America, prompts crackdown on Arab immigrants  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a tiny Brooklyn cafe with faded tourist
posters of Yemen in the window, the mood at a table of Arab men
darkens when the topic turns to khat.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my country, khat is easy,'' says Abdul Rahman. ''Everybody,
the president, they have it. ... I don't understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman, a 26-year-old Yemeni, was working at the cafe on the
Islamic holiday Eid al-Adha when the U.S. war on drugs arrived.
Narcotics cops calmly walked in, secured the door and busted three
men in the basement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raids at the Blue Province Restaurant and two other Yemeni
businesses last month had nothing to do with cocaine, designer
drugs or even marijuana. Instead, the suspects allegedly were
selling khat, a leafy stimulant that -- to those who chew it like
tobacco -- is no more sinister than a double espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and other Arab immigrants in Brooklyn claim that before
last month, few knew that khat (pronounced cot) is illegal in their
new country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community has been consuming khat for a long time -- this
is not a secret,'' said Ali Sharaf, a member of a Yemen-American
student group. ''I'm surprised that now it's a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, back home in the Arabian peninsula Yemenis chew khat
openly, often daily, and police couldn't care less. It's the same
in Djibouti and Somalia on the Horn of Africa. But U.S. authorities
got interested when khat appeared more and more in Arab communities
around the country, usually smuggled in -- but in one case grown in
bulk in what amounted to a plantation.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the arrests for dealing in khat were the first
in recent memory, and perhaps ever. Police spokesman Sgt. Andrew
McInnis said that New York officials saw khat as an evil like other
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a serious problem,'' he said. ''We responded to
complaints about the negative impact on the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege the immigrant suspects broke laws banning
possession of cathonine -- the key ingredient in freshly cut khat
leaves, which look like basil. The federal government lists
cathonine as a ''Schedule I'' controlled substance, the same
category as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Cathonine diminishes within three days of harvest. What remains
is a substance called cathine, which is less potent but still
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Khat chewers say it gives them energy and a feeling of euphoria.
But the Drug Enforcement Administration warns that khat is
psychologically addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Compulsive use, the DEA says, ''may result in manic behavior
with grandiose delusions or in a paranoid type of illness,
sometimes accompanied by hallucinations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yemen, khat is to the people what vodka is to Russians --
deeply rooted in society, but viewed by some as a source of social
ills.
</P>
<P>
   Khat is believed to have been traded as a commodity even before
coffee. It originated centuries ago in Ethiopia, then spread
through east Africa and parts of the Middle East. Muslim legend has
it that leaves from the evergreen shrub fueled all-night prayer
vigils.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most Yemenis, including government officials, are
unrepentant users. Even visitors are encouraged to try it.
</P>
<P>
   But worried that too many government workers were wasting away
their afternoons -- and their income -- chewing khat, President Ali
Abdullah Saleh has tried to set an example by announcing he would
only chew on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that in Djibouti, 98 percent of the
men use khat -- flown in from Ethiopia -- to numb the pain of
poverty. Somalian warlords dole it out to soldiers as part of daily
rations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, news reports and statistics suggest
that the market for khat is limited and nonviolent. Unlike other
drugs, authorities know little about the supply sources and routes.
U.S. Customs confiscated 49,000 pounds of khat in fiscal 1999; by
comparison, marijuana seizures totaled 1.2 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement appears to be random. Most of the khat seizures were
made at Kennedy and Newark airports -- based on the plant's pungent
smell. Agents who caught a whiff during random inspections last
year found a total of 30,500 pounds stashed in luggage, mainly in
amounts so small the couriers weren't prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Border Patrol agents stopping two Somalis at a
checkpoint last year in Southern California found a small amount of
khat rolled up in banana leaves and newspaper. A state trooper made
a similar find after stopping an Arab motorist on the New Jersey
Turnpike, as did Denver airport authorities searching cargo from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Minn., authorities hit six Somalis last year
with drug charges for carrying khat. And in San Jose, Calif., a
Yemeni man was arrested in 1998 for growing 1,000 plants in what
was described as the first khat plantation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But with other narcotic cases tying up cops and courts, khat
cases are an exception. Khat, concedes New York DEA spokesman Stan
Skowronski, ''is probably not one of our priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Police launched the Brooklyn investigation about six months ago
after receiving information that street dealers were peddling khat
around Arab storefronts. The going price was $40 for a day's
supply.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, an undercover narcotics officer bought khat at a
Yemeni restaurant. The next day, the Islamic holiday, officers
found customers lined up for refrigerated khat being cut up and
sold at the Blue Province Restaurant and nearby Yemen Cafe,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time officers wrapped up the investigation with a raid on
another Arab restaurant a week later, they had seized about 240
pounds of khat and arrested eight suspects, some carrying more than
$2,000 in their pockets. The suspects face maximum sentences of 2
1/3 to 7 years in prison if convicted of felony drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for one suspect, James Palumbo, said his client was
shocked to find himself the target of a drug bust. The community,
he added, doesn't need to see anyone go to jail to be scared
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are law-abiding people,'' he said. ''The cops have made
their point.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Yemenite, who admitted buying khat at the Blue Province
only an hour before the police raid, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're around (khat), you've got to have it,'' the man,
who gave his name as Jamil, said with a sheepish smile. ''But it's
bad for us. We need to stop it.''

<HEADLINE> High Court Studying Blanket Primary  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voting in some states' primary elections is
similar to dining from a fixed menu, but three states offer voters
a smorgasbord of primary candidates regardless of party
affiliation. Will the Supreme Court let them continue doing so?
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments today over California's ''blanket
primary,'' the court must decide whether letting voters cast their
ballot for any candidate violates the rights of political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected by late June, will determine the
future of blanket primaries in Louisiana and Washington state as
well as California. Various open-primary systems used in about half
the states could be affected as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The history of election law illustrates how states have
changed their primary election processes over time. If the court
were to strike down California's blanket primary law, the states
would lose much of their autonomy and control over their election
processes,'' said David Hudson Jr., a Nashville, Tenn., lawyer who
has studied the case.
</P>
<P>
   State primary laws fall into four major categories. At one end
of the spectrum is the closed primary, in which only registered
party members can participate in choosing a party's nominee. At the
other end are blanket primaries, which, for example, allow voters
to cast a ballot for a Republican candidate for governor, a
Democrat for senator and a Libertarian for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In between are open primaries, in which voters are allowed to
choose the primary in which they wish to participate on election
day. In a fourth variation, some states permit newly registered and
independent voters to participate in the primary of their choice.
Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, Oklahoma and Rhode Island have modified their closed
primary systems in that way, the justices were told in written
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot
initiative favoring a blanket primary. Backers said the system
would encourage nomination of more moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Democratic and Republican parties challenged the new
system, along with the Libertarian Party and the Peace and Freedom
Party. They argued that letting non-party members help choose their
nominees violated their First Amendment freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
against the political parties and upheld the California blanket
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the friend-of-the-court advice the justices received in
the case were pro-blanket primary arguments by Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who sought the Republican presidential nomination this
year. Joined by law professors and others, McCain called
California's system ''a constitutionally valid state regulation of
elections which protects the constitutional interests of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend-of-the-court brief, submitted by the New
York-based Brennan Center for Justice, supported non-member
participation in the two major parties' primaries, but not in those
conducted by minor parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of their past and future control of nearly all elected
bodies in California, the preferential treatment and benefits state
and federal law accords them and the general bias in favor of the
two established parties ... the Democrats and Republicans cannot
use the First Amendment to shield themselves from a voter-initiated
measure seeking to expand participation in the selection of their
candidates,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same logic does not hold, however,'' it said, ''for minor
party primaries. Minor parties in our democratic system do not deal
in power; they deal in ideology and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is California Democratic Party vs. Jones, 99-401.

<HEADLINE> Congress Lays Egg; US Rolls With It  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the days when presidents freely strolled
the public sidewalks, a determined small boy walked up to
Rutherford B. Hayes and said: ''Hey! Hey! Are you going to let us
roll eggs in your yard?''
</P>
<P>
   The yard in question that spring day in 1878 was the South Lawn
of the White House. The eggs were dyed Easter eggs. The egg rollers
were Washington children. And the question was serious. Egg rollers
had been evicted from their traditional grounds. President Hayes'
''yard'' could provide a haven.
</P>
<P>
   By the hundreds and even thousands, the city's youngest 19th
century citizens had gathered at the Capitol each Easter Monday to
roll brightly colored eggs down the terraces of the hill on which
it stood.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they rolled themselves as well. The apparent object in
either case was to determine, with as much precision as possible,
how far eggs -- and boys and girls -- could roll and tumble.
</P>
<P>
   When the rolling was done the youngsters walked into the big
marble Capitol and ate their lunch, which included many of the
recently rolled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Girls and boys, black and white, big and little, darted in an
out of every nook and cranny, romping with noisy glee, and cracked
Easter eggs and munched their lunches in the rotunda, littering the
floor with debris in utter disregard of the assembled wisdom and
majesty in either wing of the building,'' a Washington newspaper
reported on April 2, 1872.
</P>
<P>
   By 1876, officials in charge of the Capitol and its grounds had
cooled to egg rollers, tromped grass and invaded turf.
</P>
<P>
   So a senator introduced solemn legislation ''to protect the
public property, turf and grass of the Capitol grounds from
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone curious about the origin of the bureaucratic
tradition of protecting one's turf, this might be a good place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the bill, ignoring objections that tromping and
rolling didn't hurt grass or turf. President Grant signed it into
law.
</P>
<P>
   Because of rain there was no confrontation on Easter Monday
1877.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Easter season approached in 1878, newspaper
advertisements growled a warning: ''NO EGG ROLLING ON THE CAPITOL
GROUNDS'' and advised:
</P>
<P>
   ''This law was passed to prevent the practice which had grown up
in previous years of children rolling Easter eggs on the Capitol
Grounds and terraces'' and to prevent them ''from being used as
playgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   On Easter Monday, the Capitol Police turned back egg rollers.
</P>
<P>
   But a small boy had already appealed to higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   President Hayes heard him out and made inquiries. And when a
band of boys carrying baskets of eggs approached the White House
gates the guards stood aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Driven out of the Capitol grounds, the children advanced on
the White House grounds today and rolled eggs down the terraces
back of the mansion and played among the shrubbery to their heart's
content,'' The Washington Evening Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, another small boy accosted the same president
with the same question: ''Are you going to let us roll eggs in your
yard this year?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no objection.
</P>
<P>
   By 1880, crowds of children carried their eggs onto the White
House grounds without seeking presidential permission first.
</P>
<P>
   It is said in Washington that if a president does a thing for
two years running, other presidents will continue to do it year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   Examples include the annual presidential lighting of the
National Christmas Tree and the annual pardon issued in the Rose
Garden to a single Thanksgiving turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs have rolled at the White House on every Easter Monday
since 1878, with the exception of the years of the two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   The egg roll, which requires an adult for each child, now
features bands and organized games and story-telling and floppy
eared, six-foot tall Easter rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden eggs branded with the image of the White House and
signatures of the president and first lady are often handed out as
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The lore of the White House Easter egg roll is told with much
detail and accumulated lore in the current issue of ''Prologue,''
published by the National Archives in an article written by C. L.
Arbelbide, a historian specializing in events and holidays
involving the White House and the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 122 years, the Easter Egg Roll has established a
certain bond between presidents and the emerging generation.
</P>
<P>
   ''While presidents and egg rollers may be separated by time,
they are forever united by this event,'' said Arbelbide, who
explored the link in her 1997 book, ''The White House Easter Egg
Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE -- Lawrence L. Knutson has reported on the White
House, Congress and Washington's history -- including an occasional
egg roll -- for more than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Seeking Normalcy  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez sought to create a haven
of normalcy and, finally, a return to family life for his
6-year-old son Elian as a political and custody whirlwind raged
around them.
</P>
<P>
   Miami relatives demanded to see the boy, Republicans threatened
congressional hearings on his seizure, furious Cuban-Americans
protested and Elian's immediate family still faced lengthy court
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But on Easter Sunday, the Cuban father tried to create an aura
of hometown family life at their temporary quarters at Andrews Air
Force Base in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a meal of black beans and rice, walked on the
grounds of the base with Elian's stepmother and half brother, even
got a visit from the base's Easter Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to re-establish a more normal routine, a less
tumultuous atmosphere,'' Gregory Craig, lawyer for Elian's father,
told The Associated Press on Sunday. ''The relatives have got to
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami relatives pleaded Sunday to see the boy they virtually
adopted after his rescue from an inner tube in the Atlantic last
Thanksgiving. His mother drowned when the boat carrying them from
Cuba sank off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not leave until I see this boy,'' a tearful Marisleysis
Gonzalez, a 21-year-old cousin from Miami who acted as Elian's
surrogate mother, told a Washington news conference. ''I know he's
not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The little boy with the ready smile became a political, almost
religious, icon for the Cuban-American community over the last five
months. And when federal agents snatched him in the pre-dawn hours
Saturday, Miami's Little Havana erupted into near riots that
finally calmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig questioned the tactics of the Miami relatives, saying he
had thought they would ''establish a channel of communication''
with the father rather than hold news conferences and make public
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unfortunately been something of a disruptive
cloud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his immediate family are considering
where to move while they await resolution of their appeal now
pending before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. But
Craig said they have not made a final decision. He said they will
stay in this country through the appeals, bound both by the
father's word and numerous legal restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will remain here until the appeals process is exhausted
and the stay or injunction is lifted,'' Craig said. ''That's why we
want to bring some familiarity and normality -- both for the boy and
for Juan Miguel.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig is still exploring the possibility of bringing some of
Elian's classmates and their parents to this country to wait with
the boy and his family. Craig said the request is still before the
State Department, which he said has been a bit more receptive to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As the father was trying to calm the family atmosphere around
Elian, the political climate on Capitol Hill heated up Sunday, with
many lawmakers questioning the federal raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a frightening event, that American citizens now can
expect that the executive branch on their own can decide on whether
to raid a home,'' said House Republican whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
Republicans talked of congressional hearings on the raid and
inviting Attorney General Janet Reno this week to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's second-ranking official said the only
regret was that authorities waited as long as they did.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were forced into the action we took by the intransigence of
that family'' in Miami, said Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
''We probably should have taken a decisive action sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   In a national CNN-Gallup poll taken after the seizure, nearly
six in 10 respondents supported the government's actions to reunite
Elian with his father. They were split on whether the government
used too much force.	   Miami fell quiet for the Easter celebration, but was
still a
city under tight police control with smaller scale demonstrations.
Sergio Perez, a Miami neighbor of the family who had cared for
Elian, said simply:
</P>
<P>
   ''We will celebrate in tears.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Case May Help Cuban Relations  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The weekend custody transfer of Elian Gonzalez
to his father provided one of those rare upticks in U.S.-Cuban
relations, but President Fidel Castro says an accommodation is not
in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   And he won't get any argument from his south Florida
adversaries, who seem as determined as ever to block any
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   One dark cloud on the short-term horizon are the bitter feelings
growing out of an assault carried out on anti-Castro protesters in
front of the Cuban diplomatic mission here on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators say they were attacked by 15 men who emerged
from inside the mission. Cuba has thus far ignored State Department
demands for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials see the issue as a serious one.
And Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., among others on Capitol Hill, is insisting on a firm
response. The issue could produce verbal fireworks this week.
</P>
<P>
   But over the longer term, some analysts, including American
University's Philip Brenner, believe the dramatic events on
Saturday in Miami may have created a new dynamic in
Washington-Havana relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a watershed because it will undermine the power of the
Cuban-American community,'' said Brenner, alluding to the forcible
transfer of custody of Elian to his father from his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that many exiles in Miami passionately resisted,
and Brenner believes this group's seemingly pervasive influence on
Cuba policy may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said it will be easier for lawmakers to support Cuba
legislation they might have opposed in past years, including a
pending measure to ease curbs on the sale of food and medicine to
the island. Many other observers share Brenner's view, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela and a director of
the Center for a Free Cuba, an anti-Castro group, agreed the
legislation may pass but said it won't make much difference because
Castro lacks the money for large-scale U.S. imports anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, as presently crafted, bars use of U.S. credits
to finance exports to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reich also said that those who envision improved U.S.-Cuban ties
fail to take into account the impact of the Elian issue on Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has unified the Cuban-American community like nothing I
have seen in 20 years,'' said Reich, himself a Cuban-American.
</P>
<P>
   He said the community will have more numbers and greater resolve
than before in its campaign to keep Castro isolated. Washington
politicians who don't heed their message will pay a price, Reich
added.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Saturday night not far from the Bay of Pigs, Castro
made clear that the transfer of Elian to the custody of his father,
while welcome, was only a transient victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a truce,'' he said praising the U.S. effort.
''Tomorrow, the battle continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, seeing the issue from the other side, agreed. ''The
fundamentals have not changed,'' he said. The barriers to more
normal ties will remain ''until there is a fundamental change in
Cuba,'' he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Govt Accused of Abuse Against Elian  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crying in anguish, the cousin who acted as a
surrogate mother to Elian Gonzalez for five months said President
Clinton lacks the moral authority to denounce violence in schools
because he allowed federal agents with guns to seize the
6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Miami relatives and their supporters who followed
Elian to Washington have been trying to keep the boy in America.
They were turned back twice in attempts to enter Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland, where Elian was staying with his father,
stepmother and their infant son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why stand up on TV and say we need to make better about the
crimes that are being done in school when you're the first one to
give an order to break inside a house and (grab) a kid with a gun
in his face?'' cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez, 21, shouted at a news
conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not only the criminals and people outside with guns. Now
it's the government, too,'' she said, practically spitting out the
words.
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaming down her face and a pink and blue bag of
Easter goodies, Gonzalez pleaded to see the boy.
</P>
<P>
   She accused Attorney General Janet Reno and Clinton of causing
the young shipwreck survivor irreparable psychological harm. She
held a copy of an Associated Press photo showing an agent taking
the boy from a fisherman who rescued him from the sea. Gonzalez
pointed to the agent's gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Janet Reno said he had a little baggie of toys (on the plane
to Washington). Was this (gun) the first toy you gave him?'' she
asked. ''There was no need for this. There was no need for my
family to have guns (used) against them. There was no need for
Elian's fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who was helping the Miami relatives of
the boy in Washington, accused the Clinton administration of
surrendering the boy to his Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to
appease communist dictator Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no hesitation on the part of this administration to
sacrifice innocent lives to achieve their own agenda, and the
agenda this time was diplomatic relations with Fidel Castro, so
Elian was expendable,'' Smith said during the news conference on
Capitol Hill. ''I'm ashamed of my government.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who had tears in his eyes as he held a bright pink
Easter egg intended for Elian, called for congressional hearings
and an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no longer about Castro,'' Smith said. ''It is now
about President Clinton and Janet Reno's abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, Smith and the Gonzalez family,
including great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, were turned away from the
air base.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez said she wanted to give Elian a bag with
Easter gifts, including a bunny toy, candies, the pink Easter egg
that ''we were supposed to find today in my backyard,'' and other
items that ''any other kid would get for Easter,''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me see this boy,'' she demanded. ''I know this boy needs
to see me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But she left the gates of the base without seeing him, and there
was no evidence the guards accepted any gifts for the child. She
said she and her family would remain in Washington until they see
him.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, they visited the Basilica of the National
Shrine of the Immaculate Conception at Catholic University, where
they lit a candle. A family spokesman described the visit as a
''moment of reflection, a moment of prayer for Elian.''

<HEADLINE> Theories Rise Over Elian Photos  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For conspiracy theorists, the evidence is in
the haircut, or maybe in a missing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Since federal agents seized 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the
home of his Miami relatives early Saturday to be with his father,
some critics insist the boy couldn't be as happy as he appears in
photos released by his father's attorney. They see surefire signs
of government manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy developed when attorneys for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez offered pictures of his smiling family Saturday, only
hours after government officials brought the young Cuban castaway
to Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the lawyers made available new pictures again showing
that Elian and his father were enjoying life together.
</P>
<P>
   They showed Elian arm in arm with his father, having a lunch of
black beans and rice, playing soccer, sitting in his father's lap
and with his father, stepmother and half-brother on a bench.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were taken at Andrews on Sunday, said attorney Greg
Craig, who hand-carried the undeveloped roll of film to The
Associated Press bureau in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sweets, assistant bureau chief for photos, said the film
was developed in the AP's photo lab.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are from a disposable camera. I examined the negatives.
They are authentic,'' Sweets said.
</P>
<P>
   A Craig associate delivered the first pictures of Elian with his
family on Saturday after having them developed at a drug store.
Sweets said he examined the negatives from those photos and
negatives and also believed they were authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have closely scrutinized the Saturday photos, including
one taken by Gonzalez of his two sons, comparing them with one of
Elian captured during the raid just hours earlier by a free-lance
photographer for the AP.
</P>
<P>
   In the AP photograph, Elian is being held by a fisherman who had
helped rescue him from the Atlantic as a federal agent holds a
submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
   In the Saturday pictures with his father, critics say Elian's
hair is longer than in the AP photo and that he appears to no
longer have a missing tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, the 21-year-old cousin who says Elian
thinks of her as a surrogate mother, declared Sunday at a
Washington news conference, ''That is not Elian. Look how short the
hair looks when he was taken out of the house and look how long the
hair is in the picture that they show today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said on
ABC's ''This Week'' that he had taken no position on the
allegations of doctored photos. But he said Elian ''seems to have a
good bit more hair. And unless they were developing some hair
product with the boy on the flight up to the north, then our
community is very, very suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said he saw signs that the
government was ''brainwashing'' the child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a little Band-Aid (in the Maryland pictures),''
Diaz-Balart said Saturday evening on CNN's ''Evans, Novak, Hunt and
Shields.'' ''I think the drugging has already begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet
the Press,'' ''I have no knowledge that he was given any kind of
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of
Churches, a friend of Juan Miguel Gonzalez who was present when
father and son were reunited, criticized those alleging a
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had his arms around his father,'' she said on ABC. ''There
was real affection there that cannot be manufactured.''

<HEADLINE> Easter Bunny Visits Elian  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the day his terrified face was on the front
pages of newspapers around the world inches from a gun barrel,
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez squirmed joyfully on his father's lap.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old Cuban castaway was playful in the arms of his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in their family quarters at Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., on Easter Sunday, said attorney Greg Craig. At
one point, he said, Elian gave a playful kiss to the base's
visiting Easter Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   There were few other visitors to the secluded house where the
family was staying, Craig told The Associated Press. He gave the
news agency a roll of unprocessed film to document Elian's first
day after heavily armed federal agents seized him from the Miami
home of relatives and flew him to Washington to be with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a very quiet day, a family day,'' Craig said. He sent
an assistant with homemade Easter baskets for Elian and his infant
half-brother, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   ''They went outside and took a walk,'' Craig said. In matching
tan jackets and blue jeans, father and son kicked a volleyball
around and huddled together on a park bench for a family photo with
Hianny and Gonzalez's second wife, Nersy, Elian's stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every photo image showed Elian, wearing a blue shirt with
space ships on it, smiling or laughing. The pictures were taken by
Craig's assistant and brought directly to the AP to be developed
and printed. Some had claimed that a happy photo of father and son
on Saturday had been manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Craig described the boy's Miami relatives, who were turned away
at the base gate with their own Easter offerings -- a toy bunny and
candy -- as ''a disruptive cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the family needed time along together ''before we start
rebuilding bridges with other parts of the family.''

figures differed slightly, both Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp.
concluded that PC shipments increased by healthy margins during the first three
months of 2000. The research groups estimated that PC manufacturers shipped 30
million machines in the period ending March 31. San Jose, Calif.-based
Dataquest, a unit of Gartner Group, said worldwide sales grew 15 percent from
the comparable 1999 period while Framingham, Mass.-based IDC pegged the
year-to-year increase at 20 percent.

Ben Grieve opened the 11th with a liner into the right-center gap that center
fielder Brady Anderson, who had just entered the game, misplayed into a triple.
The ball bounced in front of Anderson, who overran the ball and then fell trying
to retrieve it. After two intentional walks, pinch-hitter Saenz slammed a pitch
from Tim Worrell (2-2) over the center-field fence on one bounce.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament of Nuke Powers Sought  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia's ratification last week of two
anti-nuclear agreements has lifted some of the pessimism
surrounding a major conference to review nuclear disarmament
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But countries without nuclear arms are still expected to press
the five declared nuclear powers to commit to disarmament at the
four-week Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty conference that begins
today.
</P>
<P>
   Nations that disavowed nuclear weapons are frustrated that the
United States, Russia, Britain, France and China aren't doing
enough to carry out the treaty's goal of a world free of nuclear
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will be among the first
speakers today and is likely to defend Washington's record before
the 187 countries that have committed themselves to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some countries have the quite unrealistic notion that
disarmament is something that happens overnight,'' said State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin. ''The fact is that the United
States has led the way among the nuclear powers in trying to
reverse the nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which went into force in 1970, represented a bargain
between the nuclear haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a pledge from non-nuclear states not to acquire
nuclear weapons, the treaty committed nuclear-weapon states to
pursue disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the treaty's 25-year term was set to expire, the
United States led the successful campaign to extend it
indefinitely, promising ''systematic and progressive efforts''
toward disarmament and a global ban on nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   But there is widespread feeling that the efforts have not gone
far enough and that the spread of weapons has increased. India and
Pakistan have become nuclear states after conducting rival nuclear
tests in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 66-nation Conference on Disarmament, the main
disarmament forum, has deadlocked on a new disarmament agenda.
There has been no progress on a treaty to cut off production of
weapons-grade plutonium and uranium. Ten years after the end of the
Cold War, thousands of U.S. and Russian warheads remain on
''hair-trigger'' alert.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament negotiations on a host of issues were virtually
gridlocked until the Russian Duma ratified the long-delayed START
II treaty to cut nuclear arsenals last week. On Friday, the Duma
ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. Senate
refused to ratify last year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia hopes the two votes will generate support for its drive
to stop the United States from building a missile defense system --
an issue that is likely to feature prominently in the conference.
Critics say the U.S. system would trigger a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian action ''helps to relieve some of the gloom
surrounding some of this conference, and will help to answer some
of the criticism with regard to nuclear disarmament,'' said U.N.
Undersecretary-General for Disarmament Jayantha Dhanapala.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that criticism is expected to come from a group of
moderate countries called the New Agenda Coalition, which consists
of South Africa, Brazil, Ireland, Egypt, New Zealand, Mexico and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition members have demanded that nuclear-weapon states
''make an unequivocal undertaking'' to quickly eliminate their
arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 350 grassroots organizations and 42 lawmakers from
Britain, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the European
Parliament have made similar demands.

<HEADLINE> 21 Held Hostage on Malaysian Island  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken
more than 20 people, including Americans and Europeans, hostage on
a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The abductors surprised and captured the group on a beach on
Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to
escape the men, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi told The
Associated Press by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital,
Kuala Lumpur, confirmed that the two who escaped were Americans and
that they were still in Sabah. He said most of the hostages were
Europeans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the northeast
coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is
shared with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos. The
hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Police are currently trying to trace the boat, he said. He said
no demands had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for
Sabah, said the island was near two Malaysian naval bases on the
eastern coast of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has never happened here before, so I don't think there
are any Malaysians involved,'' in the hostage taking, Chong said.
</P>
<P>
   Chong said the area was considered one of the top 10 diving
spots in the world and that six resorts on the island cater mostly
to professional divers.
</P>
<P>
   He said access to the island was restricted to 80 divers at one
time, and 40 staff at the six resorts, to protect the coral reef
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia and Indonesia both claim sovereignty over the Celebes
Sea islands. The Southeast Asian neighbors have both filed claims
with the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over the islands dates back to 1969, when Indonesia
and Malaysia failed to reach agreement during technical discussions
about the overlapping continental shelf that borders the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no early indications that the assailants were
involved in the territorial dispute.

<HEADLINE> Sub Tale 'Tops Movie Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The submarine thriller ''U-571'' torpedoed
the military drama ''Rules of Engagement'' to take the weekend
box-office crown.
</P>
<P>
   The World War II yarn debuted with $20.3 million in ticket
sales, while ''Rules of Engagement'' slipped to third place with $8
million after two weeks as the top movie, according to studio
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in second place was ''Love and Basketball'' with $8.4
million. Co-produced by Spike Lee, the movie follows Omar Epps and
Sanaa Lathan as lifelong friends and rivals who carry their love
for basketball and each other into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Another new movie, ''Gossip,'' about a sexual rumor run amok on
a college campus, had a weak opening of $2.3 million, finishing at
No. 12. The movie had a soft per-theater average of $1,534 in 1,525
cinemas, compared with $7,859 in 2,583 theaters for ''U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   Final figures were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey and Harvey Keitel,
follows the crew of a rickety U.S. submarine dispatched to steal a
decoding device off a disabled German U-boat. When their sub is
sunk, the Americans must try to make it home in the enemy vessel.
</P>
<P>
   While submarine movies are fairly rare, recent ones have done
well. ''The Hunt for Red October'' topped the box office with $17.2
million in its opening weekend in 1990, and ''Crimson Tide'' also
was No. 1 with $18.6 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''U-571'' did strong business despite opening over Easter,
typically a weekend when many moviegoers stay home with their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a thrill ride, and audiences are really responding,''
said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal, which
released ''U-571.'' ''Easter weekend is a tough weekend for the
business, so we're really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film continues Hollywood's recent trend of opening big
action movies well before Memorial Day, traditionally the start of
the summer film season. Other pre-Memorial Day hits have included
''Twister'' in 1996, ''Deep Impact'' in 1998 and ''The Matrix'' and
''The Mummy'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   '''U-571' has all the earmarks of a summer film. It's an action
film, and it has this feel of being an event picture,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which tracks
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Universal dominated the weekend, with two other movies in the
top 10: ''Erin Brockovich'' and ''The Skulls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' last week became Julia Roberts'
third-straight $100 million hit, grossing $107.4 million in just
over five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In limited release, ''The Virgin Suicides'' opened strongly with
$238,000 in 18 theaters for a $13,222 average. Directed by Sofia
Coppola, the movie is a darkly comic drama about five doomed
sisters worshipped by the neighborhood boys.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola is the daughter of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and is
married to ''Being John Malkovich'' director Spike Jonze. ''The
Virgin Suicides'' expands to more theaters in May.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''U-571,'' $20.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Love and Basketball,'' $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Rules of Engagement, $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''28 Days,'' $7.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''Keeping the Faith,'' $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''The Road to El Dorado,'' $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Return to Me,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''The Skulls,'' $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Final Destination, $2.78 million.

<HEADLINE> Reno Faces Another Controversy  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Depicted as the devil, called a traitor and worse,
Attorney General Janet Reno has taken the brunt of the blame from
the Cuban-American community for her decision to use force to
return Elian Gonzalez to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters and community leaders in Reno's hometown were
offering up a bitter judgment against the nation's top law
enforcement official after long supporting the former prosecutor
who grew up here.
</P>
<P>
   She has become the No. 1 target for Cuban-Americans. Signs and
angry words targeting her have multiplied following Saturday's raid
to snatch Elian. Her actions -- President Clinton said the Elian
case was handled by her -- have been criticized by the governor and
Miami's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a sense that this was personal ... that this person
the community helped in her career would do something so
outrageous,'' said Dario Moreno, a political science professor at
Florida International University in Miami. ''The raid on this
family's house was symbolic of a raid on everybody's house.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the house was quiet on Easter Sunday, a day after
protesters poured into the streets of Little Havana after federal
agents grabbed the 6-year-old boy and took him to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 people were arrested and protesters started more
than 200 fires, mostly burning tires and trash Saturday. As they
marched, many carried signs with a picture of Reno with horns.
Another called her a traitor, while others likened her to a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   One sign read: ''Reno, you have betrayed our trust. Ten children
in Waco and Elian condemned today,'' a reference to the deadly 1993
raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Texas. Reno and the FBI
were criticized for their decisions to end a 51-day siege there.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a 1996 standoff between the FBI and the
anti-government Freemen in Montana ended without violence. FBI
Director Louis Freeh said at the time that FBI reforms after Waco
''put patience above the risk of bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno insisted on that level of patience in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   She recently said the government could have moved anytime since
January to return Elian to his father, but chose instead to let the
Miami relatives take the issue to court, where it remains.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has strong ties to Miami, growing up in a house on the edge
of the Everglades. She is the daughter of two journalists -- Jane,
who worked for years for the now-defunct Miami News, and Henry, who
spent four decades as a crime reporter for The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent attorney Aaron Podhurst met Reno 30 years ago, before
she was elected five times as state attorney for what was then Dade
County. As state attorney, Reno pioneered programs for juveniles,
non-violent criminals and first-offenders and pushed for minority
representation on her staff.
</P>
<P>
   Podhurst said he knows the Elian case has affected Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she is suffering greatly that the Miami community is
fractured,'' he said. ''I still admire her and I believe she loves
Miami as much as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Podhurst acted as a middleman for the failed last-minute
negotiations between Elian's relatives and the government. He was
one of four community leaders who volunteered to intervene Friday
night -- and were in the midst of negotiations when federal agents
broke in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't agree that we couldn't have worked out a peaceful
solution so that the boy didn't have to be taken by force,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship remains strong, he said, and they spoke
for two hours Saturday. He asked her to meet with the community.
''I asked her to consider to take part in the healing that needs to
take place now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno is no stranger to violence in Miami. As state attorney, she
charged five white Miami-Dade police officers with the manslaughter
of a black insurance executive after a motorcycle chase.
</P>
<P>
   When they were acquitted in 1980, black rioters chanting ''Reno,
Reno, Reno'' burned and looted. Eighteen people died and damage
reached $200 million. Reno prosecuted the rioters, then worked hard
to win back the black community's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, who is of Cuban descent, was sharply
critical of the raid. Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, said he was
''deeply disappointed'' in the Justice Department action.
</P>
<P>
   Winning back the confidence of the Cuban-American community will
be Reno's toughest task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't talk about forgiveness,'' said protester Emy Peterson.
''There are very deep wounds right now. This has been a betrayal by
Janet Reno.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Protects Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- When states sued tobacco companies en masse over
smokers' illnesses, Georgia joined in for a share of the cash
settlement. Now attacks on the industry are taking a toll at home,
and state lawmakers want to cushion the blow.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly voted this year to give protection from
potentially bankrupting lawsuits -- and up to $6 million in tax
breaks -- to Brown &AMP; Williamson, the Kentucky-based tobacco giant
that owns a large cigarette plant in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lawmakers prepared to reap the first
installment of an expected $4.8 billion from the national tobacco
settlement, which Georgia joined to recoup the cost of treating
sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking advocates say the state is sending conflicting
signals -- blaming tobacco companies for health problems and
demanding compensation, then passing out perks to keep them in
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little schizophrenic,'' said Roger Salazar, a spokesman
for the American Cancer Society. ''It goes to show you how deep the
pockets of Big Tobacco are and how much influence they have over
these legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders admit their positions won't always jibe when
dealing with tobacco, a legal product with harmful risks and
economic rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole tobacco controversy is a mixed message,'' said House
Majority Leader Larry Walker. ''For years the federal government
subsidized tobacco, they taxed tobacco and then they want to say
tobacco's killing people. ... It's a struggle between health and
economic prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he refrained from voting on both bills because Brown
&AMP; Williamson is a client of his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes has signed into law a $25 million cap on the
amount of bond money corporations must post while they appeal
massive punitive damage awards imposed by a jury. Virginia, North
Carolina and Kentucky passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies are anticipating a damage award of possibly
hundreds of billions of dollars in a Florida lawsuit filed on
behalf of 500,000 smokers. Florida law requires companies to post a
bond equal to the damage award while they appeal, which cigarette
makers say could force them into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the bond cap applies even if the judgment is
rendered in another state.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also approved up to $6 million in annual tax
credits for companies that manufacture cigarettes in Georgia for
export to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Reichert sponsored the bill to help Brown &AMP;
Williamson stay in business in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The company -- which makes Kools, Carltons and Lucky Strikes --
employs 2,900 at its Macon plant, the only major cigarette plant in
the state, with a payroll of $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its work force outnumbers Georgia's 1,480 tobacco farmers, whose
combined income last year was $105 million, said J. Michael Moore,
a tobacco specialist with the University of Georgia Extension
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has been hurt by slumping cigarette sales as tobacco
companies have raised prices to meet the demands of the national
settlement. Brown &AMP; Williamson had to shut it down for a week last
month, furloughing its 2,000 production workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They began to think, 'Good grief! What's going to happen to
us?''' said Reichert, who says the employees' union asked for his
help in passing a tax incentive to keep the plant open.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has yet to sign the bill. He said he's trying to weigh
moral and health concerns about cigarette exports against the
argument that ''these jobs are going to be somewhere, and should
they be here in Georgia?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson did not ask lawmakers for the tax break, said
Jim Teague, spokesman for the Macon plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the company did lobby lawmakers for the bond cap on punitive
damages. Though the measure would apply to any type of business,
Brown &AMP; Williamson asked for it as part of a larger bill dealing
with corporate lawsuits.	   House Judiciary Chairman Jim Martin said the cap
makes good
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a trial court or jury that really slams them hard
and there's an enormous verdict and they have trouble filing an
appeal bond, it requires a corporate defendant to reach a
settlement prematurely,'' Martin said. ''It's a way to control what
I call runaway juries.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson contributed $20,900 to Georgia campaigns in
1998, not enough to be considered a heavyweight political
contributor. The company gave $4,000 to Barnes. Individual
lawmakers received $150 to $750.

<HEADLINE> Historian Seeking Signs of Slaves  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- He was born a slave in Alabama, but Cornelius
Matthews died a free Texan.
</P>
<P>
   One of thousands of slaves to outlive the Civil War, Matthews
went on to marry in a legal ceremony, father three children and
register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   His story was fast disappearing until historian Eric Walthers
dredged it out of aging Harris County documents.
</P>
<P>
   With ink fading, mold spreading and memories dying, Walthers is
searching for slaves more than a century later.
</P>
<P>
   The quest is exacting, the task daunting, the clues sparse and
vague.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll bury me,'' the University of Houston professor said.
''I'll be working on this for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Walthers heads a coalition of academics, historians and students
determined to document each of the estimated 250,000 slaves held in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He tromps through the wet grass of a long-forgotten cemetery and
squats to copy the fading epitaphs into a spiral notebook. He pores
over 19th century wedding licenses and thumbs through yellowing
ship logs, absorbed with a historical force Walthers believes many
Texans would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rural South, the remains of slavery linger:
Crumbling barracks, historic museums and restored plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Texas, where slavery was generally short-lived; where
the living was rough and farms generally smaller; and where
Walthers believes people remain more apt to destroy and rebuild
than to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's almost no physical remnant of the slave past in this
area,'' he said. ''When we find something, we just go right over it
in true Texas fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many slave descendants, Houston elementary school teacher
Naomi Grundy knows a bit about her ancestors. An enterprising aunt
investigated -- and concluded that Grundy's great-great-grandmother
arrived in Lavaca County when a Virginia cattle rancher named West
moved to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're lucky,'' she says. ''Most (slave descendants) can
only go back to their grandparents. The rest gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Sold at auction, torn from their children, often illiterate,
slaves long have eluded documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Walthers' aim is fairly modest: A biography, just a sentence or
two long, will suffice, at least to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The sketches are pulled from thousands of dusty pages, records
locked up in remote courthouses and public libraries. The 1860
Census. Thick books labeled ''Marriages of Free Persons of Color.''
Works Progress Administration interview transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   The scraps of data are cross-referenced, sent to Walthers and
posted on the Internet. The job of mining records is immense -- 100
researchers throughout the state have volunteered to check local
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The era of slavery was considerably shorter in Texas than in the
rest of the South -- human property was illegal under Mexican law,
which governed the land until 1836.
</P>
<P>
   But during the 29-year gap between the Republic of Texas, then
statehood and abolition, the use of slaves multiplied faster in
Texas than any place else in the nation. Between 1850 and 1860, the
number of slaves exploded by 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got the numbers,'' Walthers said. ''Now I want faces and
names.''

<HEADLINE> Violence Crushes Zimbabwe Tourism  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Violent sheets of foam and water
collapse over Victoria Falls into a gorge 100 yards below, creating
an awe-inspiring swirl of mist and rain that attracts mobs of
tourists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But with political turmoil and an often violent fight over
white-owned farms roiling Zimbabwe, the crowds at the falls have
thinned, leaving the local economy gasping and tourism businesses
worried about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at cancellations daily,'' said Mike McNamara,
general manager of Dabula Safaris. ''I can't really blame people.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the holiday weekend, the town center was desolate, the
craft market was silent and McNamara's usually sold-out champagne
river cruises were attracting little interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be one of our busiest weekends,'' McNamara said.
''It isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's hotels, fully booked last Easter, were only 70
percent full this year, said Andy Conn, regional chairman of the
Zimbabwe Council for Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The coming months are likely to be much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Many reluctant visitors swallowed their fears and came this
weekend because it was too late to get a refund for their
accommodations. Visitors with reservations in May and later can
cancel with no such penalty, Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands already have.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going into a serious dive the next three months. It's
looking very, very bleak,'' Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   The falls themselves are at their peak of beauty. With the
Zambezi River gorged with water from recent floods, the
5,604-foot-wide falls dump millions of cubic feet of water a minute
into the giant crevice below.
</P>
<P>
   The crashing spray shoots back up the hundred yard ravine,
drenching delighted sightseers and turning the surrounding area
into a rain forest topped by a fluffy, white cloud.
</P>
<P>
   The falls have awed Westerners since explorer David Livingstone
stumbled upon them in 1855. But few British, American and European
tourists gathered at the falls this weekend. Many of those who did
come were from southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned, but this being a tourist area, we kind of
feel that it's geographically removed,'' said Andre Mail, 37, a
legal adviser from South Africa who was visiting the falls with his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   That distance has not spared Victoria Falls from the effects of
the two-month long occupation of white-owned farms by armed black
squatters. Violence in recent days has claimed four lives.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor crafts market is desolate. Some vendors sleep next
to their stalls, while others chat in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's Easter weekend, 1,000 tourists a day perused
the wooden elephants, bowls and masks laid out on tarps by the 400
people who work in the market.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, that number dropped to a few dozen, the vendors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look around, you just see hungry faces,'' said Eddie
Mpofu, 33.
</P>
<P>
   Before the recent crisis, Mpofu and his three partners made up
to $250 a day. Now on a good day they split $25.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's becoming critical now,'' Mpofu said. ''We can't pay our
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   If things don't improve, some hotels could shut down and others
might have to lay off workers, said Conn, who is also the general
manager of the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Either step would be painful. Zimbabwe already has more than 50
percent unemployment and is heavily dependent on tourism for hard
currency.

<P>
   Botswana and Zambia are also suffering because Victoria Falls
vacations often include side trips to those nearby countries, Conn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Conn worries about the long-term effects the crisis will
have on the tourism industry here, McNamara remains optimistic that
the damage is not yet irreparable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get some good news in the next week and the horror
stories on television stop, I think we might see an end to the
cancellations. If not, the tourism cash flow will just dry up,''
McNamara said.

<HEADLINE> American Vets Return to Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A prominent group of U.S. veterans was
returning to Vietnam on the 25th anniversary of end of the Vietnam
war -- and not just for the sake of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   After its scheduled return today, the delegation of top business
leaders and others plan to share expertise with a country trying to
integrate into a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are coming back to do the job they were originally sent
to do, which is to help the people of Vietnam,'' said Jan Scruggs,
president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation includes James Kimsey, founding chief executive
officer of America Online; Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska; Herbert
Allison, former president of Merrill Lynch in New York; and
Marshall Carter, chief executive officer of State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''While veterans delegations to Vietnam are reflective in
nature, these American corporate leaders will focus on
forward-looking initiatives that will encourage Vietnam's growth
and integration into a global economy,'' said Kimsey, an Army
captain from 1965-66 who was promoted to major during a second tour
in 1968-69.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is poised at an economic crossroads as it debates the
merits of moving toward a more market-oriented economy. Delegation
members promise to provide economic advice, educational resources
and other tools to the government and business leaders they meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are folks who wanted to come back and do something
positive and forward-looking for the country and people of
Vietnam,'' Scruggs said. ''Nobody wanted to do just a nostalgia
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong trip also will include speaking engagements at
local universities as well as the dedication of a computer lab to
the Hanoi University of Foreign Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veterans -- all members of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Corporate Council -- will visit former battlefields. They
also will visit Ho Chi Minh City, where Vietnam will mark the 25th
anniversary on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation is hosted by the Vietnam Union of Friendship
Organizations and supported by U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of these vets have become very successful men. They'll
tell you that their success in business is attributable to their
time in Vietnam when they learned to become leaders,'' Scruggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their message to the Vietnamese is that if they follow their
dreams, they can make things happen.''

Govt. May Seek Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department and 19 states are leaning toward
asking a federal judge to split Microsoft Corp. into two or three separate
companies, according to published reports. Citing people familiar with the
discussions, The Washington Post and USA Today said in Monday's editions that a
Justice Department plan being shared with states and industry executives
envisions Microsoft being forced to split off its Windows operating system from
the rest of the company. The rest of the company possibly then would be split in
two, with one company handling applications software and the other the company's
Internet business, including browser software.

political and custody whirlwind raged around them. Miami relatives demanded to
see the boy, Republicans threatened congressional hearings on his seizure,
furious Cuban-Americans protested and Elian's immediate family still faced
lengthy court appeals. But on Easter Sunday, the Cuban father tried to create an

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A dozen pro-democracy newspapers and magazines were

major daily newspapers and four weekly or biweekly magazines were among the
publications closed down by order of the hard-line judiciary in Tehran late
Sunday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. A judiciary
statement quoted by IRNA said the publications were closed for "printing

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Six masked assailants have taken more than 20
people, including foreign tourists, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern
Malaysia, police said Monday. The abductors surprised and captured the group on
a beach on Sipadan Island late Sunday, and two foreign tourists managed to
escape the men, police said. Sipadan, popular for diving, is an island off the
northeast coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared
with Indonesia. Police said the assailants were believed to be Filipinos. The
hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed higher today led by technology
shares, following a shuffle of shares on the benchmark index. The
U.S. dollar was unchanged against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 227.47 points, or 1.25
percent, to close at 18,480.15 points on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
On Friday, the average lost 706.64 points, or 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 105.68 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market today, unchanged from late Friday and below its
late New York level of 105.87 yen on Friday. The greenback ranged
between 105.55 yen and 106.02 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, share prices recovered after plunging
Friday as investors dumped industrial stocks that were removed
today from the Nikkei average. Thirty of the index's 225 shares
were replaced to better reflect changes in Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in high technology exporters finished higher. Sony rose
$3.78 to $120.17 after the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported that the
audio and video equipment maker may purchase a 10 percent stake in
Fuji TV.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitsu, Matsushita Electric
Industrial and Hitachi also rose.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Tokyo stock market was expected to recoup last
week's losses in upcoming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Japanese market is expected to stabilize this week. The
Nikkei index is likely to regain last week's losses,'' said
Shigeharu Shiraishi of SG Yamaichi Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 657.53 million shares were traded on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 1.12 billion shares
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 770 issues rose, with 481 issues falling and 130 closing
unchanged from Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
169.09 points to close at 10,844.05. The U.S. stock market was
closed Friday for the observance of Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 26.69 points, or 1.63 percent, to close at
1,660.81. The TOPIX closed up 9.18 points, or 0.56 percent, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar was unchanged from its late
Friday level in Tokyo as traders awaited U.S. gross domestic
product and employment data due out later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors refrained from trading amid uncertainty over
volatile U.S. stock prices and the possibility that the Bank of
Japan might sell yen in order to weaken the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo fears that a strong yen, which makes Japanese exports less
cost-competitive overseas, could hamper the nation's nascent
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.24 yen, up from
99.16 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
0.01 point to 1.7350 percent. Its price rose 0.09 point to 101.42.

Former New Yorker to return to serve out prison term
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A man who escaped from a New
York state prison work camp nearly 30 years ago has abandoned his
attempt to gain refugee status in Canada and will return to the
United States to serve out his time, his lawyer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Richardson, a lab technician at the University of British
Columbia's Triumf research facility, was ordered out of Canada last
year but he and his wife, who has breast cancer, had fought the
order.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing with the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board was
scheduled for Tuesday but Richardson asked that the hearing be
cancelled, his lawyer, Michael Bolton, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has decided that he wants to have some finality to his
plight so he intends to return voluntarily to Rochester,'' said
Bolton. ''Obviously we're hopeful that (U.S. authorities) will see
fit to house him in a reasonable place where he's not in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's legal troubles go back to 1971, when, as a student
at the Rochester Institute of Technology and anti-war protester
named Christopher Perlstein, he received a four-year sentence for
selling $20 worth of LSD to an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will cross the border and return to Rochester on June
28, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian immigration officials said Richardson will receive a
minister's permit that will allow him to move back to Canada
following his sentence, added Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Minister Elinor Caplan's office could not be
reached Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and his wife, Amalia, were vacationing and did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Richardson will stay in Vancouver, close to treatment for
her cancer, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson could be locked up as long as two years and four
months, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Relin, district attorney in Monroe County, N.Y., said in
an interview Sunday that Richardson will most likely serve his time
in a medium-security institution.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he will likely be eligible for parole after six or
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given his situation about his wife, I suspect that the parole
board would be sympathetic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson didn't have a criminal background when he was
arrested on the drug charge in 1971 but he was sent to Attica
Correctional Facility, a maximum-security institution near Buffalo,
and was transferred after a few months to a work camp near the
Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he was transferred from Attica, the prison was the
scene of the most deadly prison riot in the U.S. Thirty-two
prisoners and 11 corrections officers were killed in the riot.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has said he was terrified because the guards at the
camp threatened to send him back.
</P>
<P>
   He walked away from the camp and set up his new identity in
Canada, eventually landing the research job in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and Amalia have been married for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken man became a director of the SPCA, joined a
bluegrass music group and a vintage car club. 
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 someone tipped off U.S. authorities about Richardson's
past and his true identity. The information was passed on to the
RCMP.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was arrested at his work. In January 1999, he was
ordered out of Canada for entering with a criminal record and lying
about his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a New York judge refused to reduce or vacate
Richardson's prison sentence and urged him to ''take personal
responsibility'' for his crime and return to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's Canadian lawyers sought to persuade U.S.
authorities to allow Richardson to serve out his sentence in
Canada, where he can be near his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson is not a Canadian citizen so he could not serve
his time in a Canadian institution, Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said all the uncertainty and the legal wrangling has worn
the Richardsons down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were sort of sitting in limbo,'' he said. ''The Richardsons
have arrived at an assessment that it's not helping her health at
all for this to be prolonged. They're praying for some compassion
from the authorities in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton added that Richardson's sentence could still be reduced.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Consumer demand coupled with Asia's
economic rebound led to a double-digit growth in sales of personal
computers in the first three months of the year. Research groups
Dataquest Inc. and International Data Corp., in reports released
today, estimated that PC manufacturers shipped 30 million machines
in the period ending March 31. Dataquest, a unit of Gartner Group,
said worldwide sales grew 15 percent from the comparable 1999
period, while IDC calculated slightly higher percentage gains,
pegging the year-to-year increase at 20 percent. Of those totals,
Dataquest said 11.1 million PCs were sold in the United States, a
14.5 percent from last year. IDC recorded U.S. sales of 11.6
million PCs, a 17 percent improvement.

   U.S. Gas Prices Down Nearly 4 Cents
</P>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- The average price of gasoline in the
U.S. has dropped nearly 4 cents a gallon at the pumps in the past
two weeks, an industry analyst said. Lower crude oil prices and
increased production were behind the decline, analyst Trilby
Lundberg said yesterday. ''The retail price cut speeded up the past
two weeks. Lower crude oil prices are the main cause, however,
gasoline is also in greater supply,'' Lundberg said after examining
results of Friday's Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations. Gas
prices nationwide, including all grades and taxes, averaged $1.532
per gallon, which was down 3.89 cents from the $1.5709 average on
April 7. That was down 2.5 cents from the year's high of $1.5958 on
March 24.

   Japan's Trade Surplus Declines
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell nearly 15
percent in March as higher oil prices and a recovering economy
boosted imports, the government reported today. The politically
sensitive surplus with the United States, however, rose as exports
of Japanese fiber cable and automobiles surged and imports of
U.S.-made goods dropped. The merchandise trade surplus, the measure
of all goods exported minus those imported, shrank 14.8 percent to
1.11 trillion yen ($10.57 billion) in March, the Ministry of
Finance said. The surplus was unadjusted for seasonal factors.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Lauren Cambodia Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Nearly 1,000 workers at a Cambodian
garment factory producing Ralph Lauren designer clothing went on
strike Monday to protest the suspension of their shop steward.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred of the strikers marched on parliament, accusing
the Hong Kong-American-owned Leun Thai Garment of unfair treatment
of their labor representative, officials from the Free Trade Union
of the Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the union said that shop steward Eam Youlong
was being falsely accused of a traffic accident, an outstanding
police charge that was used in January as a pretext to suspend him
from work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite verbal admissions from police that the steward has a
clean record, they refuse to issue a signed statement to lift the
charge, the union claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Factory Vice President Austin Cheung disputed the union, saying
police visited the factory looking for the steward. He was then

<HEADLINE> State Power To Restrict ATMs Limited  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let Iowa
impose certain restrictions on automatic-teller machines operated
by nationally chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away state officials'
argument that a federal law allows Iowa to exercise such regulatory
power.
</P>
<P>
   A 1976 Iowa law set a number of restrictions on ATMs, requiring
banks that operate them to have an in-state office, tell state
officials the location of their machines and promise to comply with
Iowa law. ATMs not located at a bank are barred from displaying
advertising for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bank Act requires national bank branches to comply
with state requirements. But Congress amended the law in 1996 to
specify that an ATM is not a bank branch.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One, based in Salt Lake City, challenged the Iowa rules
after it was required in 1997 to shut down ATMs it had installed at
Sears stores in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled against the bank, saying the federal
banking law did not pre-empt the Iowa rules.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judge's
decision and said the Iowa laws were trumped by the federal law. By
enacting the 1996 amendment, the appeals court said, ''Congress has
made clear ... its intent that ATMs are not to be subject to state
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said another federal law, the Electronic Funds
Transfer Act, does not let states regulate national banks' ATMs
even though it says states can provide additional protection to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, the state's lawyers said the 8th
Circuit court's ruling means ''national banks that have deceptive,
misleading, unfair or vulnerable ATM operations would thus be able
to sidestep every state ATM regulation designed to protect
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank One's lawyers said the 1996 law made clear that national
banks' ATMs no longer are subject to state restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's challenge to other provisions of the Iowa law still
are pending before the district court.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Foster vs. Bank One, 99-1294.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A person driving a stolen milk
truck was killed early this morning after the vehicle struck three
utility poles and a tree, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened after police in neighboring Hasbrouck Heights
received a report of a stolen milk delivery truck about 1:10 a.m.
Officers there spotted the truck traveling south on Hackensack
Street and began following it.
</P>
<P>
   The truck then crossed into East Rutherford and stuck the
utility poles and the tree at Hackensack and Garden streets.
Several homes were damaged by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if police gave chase to the truck
before it crashed. The driver's name was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   PSE&AMP;G reported no customers lost power. The utility company said
work crews were standing by to repair power line damage caused by
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The poles were broken about 20 feet up, leaving the tops
dangling by wires, a PSE&AMP;G spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   East Rutherford police reported no other injuries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fluctuated in early trading today,
sending the Nasdaq composite tumbling more than 200 points, after
published reports said the Justice Department may ask a federal
judge to break Microsoft into two or three companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index fell 214.84 to 3,428.06. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 46.85 at 10,797.20, having recovered from a drop

<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 11.93 to 1,422.61.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 12 7/16 to 66{, was the biggest decliner in all
three indexes. News reports today said the Justice Department
envisions Microsoft, as part of the penalty in its antitrust case,
as being forced to split off its Windows operating system from the
rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft possibly then would be split in two,
with one company handling applications software and the other the
company's Internet business, including browser software.

Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks fell today. Cisco Systems fell 3[ to 62

<P>
   But blue-chip financial stocks attracted some buying interest,

<HEADLINE> Justices To Review Early Release  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether federal prison officials can refuse to consider early
release for some nonviolent felons who complete a drug-abuse
program.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear a South Dakota inmate's argument
that the Bureau of Prisons unlawfully refused to consider him for
early release because his drug crime involved possession of a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher A. Lopez was convicted in February 1997 of
possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute it. He was
sentenced to 72 months in prison, including a two-level enhancement
of his sentence because he possessed a firearm in connection with
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1994 federal law, the Bureau of Prisons allows
nonviolent inmates to have their sentences reduced by up to one
year by successfully competing a prison drug-abuse program. A 1997
bureau rule says inmates whose offense was a felony involving use
or possession of a firearm or explosive would not be eligible for
such early release.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez got on a waiting list for a drug-abuse program, but he was
told in December 1998 that he would not qualify for early release
because his crime involved possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   He sued, and a federal judge ruled that the bureau could not
categorically deny early release to a group of nonviolent inmates
without individually considering their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed last August and
upheld the bureau's action. The appeals court said the federal law
gives prison officials broad discretion to determine who is an
appropriate candidate for early release.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal granted review today, Lopez's lawyer said the law
lets the bureau deny early release in ''those special situations
where release may not be warranted,'' but does not allow the bureau
to rewrite the law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said the 8th Circuit court ruled
correctly, but they urged the justices to take the case and resolve
a split among federal appeals courts on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Lopez vs. Davis, 99-7504.

<HEADLINE> Report: NY Philharmonic Taps Muti  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Philharmonic has tapped Riccardo
Muti to succeed Kurt Masur as music director, but he hasn't said
whether he'll accept the job, The New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Muti, 58, currently music director of the La Scala opera house
in Milan, has been chosen to fill the position when the 72-year-old
Masur's contract expires in 2002, the Times said, citing
unidentified friends and colleagues of Muti. The job is among the
most important positions in the world of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Philharmonic is looking to Zarin Mehta to fill
the position of executive director vacated by Deborah Borda late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guenther, chairman of the orchestra's board, said no offers
have been made to either possible candidate. And both Muti and
Mehta were traveling and unavailable for comment, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-born Muti was music director of the Philadelphia
Orchestra from 1980 to 1992, and has been at La Scala since 1986. A
specialist in Italian music, he regularly conducts the world's top
orchestras, including successful recent appearances with the
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, 61, the younger brother of onetime Philharmonic music
director Zubin Mehta, has been executive director of the Ravinia
Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, since 1990. He
also has managed the Montreal Symphony.

<HEADLINE> DNA Can Link Americans to Africa Kin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A team of geneticists at Howard University
plans to offer a DNA test this summer that could link black
Americans with their roots in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticist Rick Kittles said today that he is still preparing
the database for the comparisons, but expected the program to get
under way in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   There has been wide interest in this means of tracing people
back to their homelands, he said, commenting that he has done DNA
tests on ''several hundred'' people in preparing for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Historical records are pretty consistent in showing the early
slaves came from west central Africa, he said, locations of the
current countries of Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Richard Newman of Harvard University's W.E.B. DuBois
Institute for African-American Research, said: ''It doesn't mean
anything to know that some of my people came from Africa, but if I
can pinpoint a culture, a religion and language, then it can
strengthen my sense of identity and relationship with Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Howard University group would use a blood test that matches
DNA sequences to samples taken from native African populations. The
test could cost up to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles, the 34-year-old geneticist at Howard who initiated the
study, said the slave trade erased family histories, and, before
the discovery of DNA, nobody imagined that the stories could be
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   ''To a lot of blacks, knowing a little bit of the story is
important,'' Kittles told The Boston Globe. ''This will definitely
contribute a lot to understanding the history of
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said Howard University will be able to do two versions
of the DNA test. The first looks at mitochondrial DNA, which is
handed down, unchanged, from mother to child. The other uses the
male, or Y chromosome, which is passed on from father to son.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers then can compare test subjects with a database of
more than 2,000 samples assembled from about 40 populations across
western Africa, where the trans-Atlantic slave trade originated.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles said his team is collecting additional DNA samples so
they can expand the database and identify more African populations.
The researchers also have collected a separate database with
American Indian, Asian and European DNA to cross-reference genes
that cannot be traced to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The geneticists said DNA tests in the study so far show that
about 30 percent of the black men tested descended from Europeans
on the fathers' side. The researchers said that was largely the
legacy of enslaved women who were raped.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell nearly 200
points today after published reports said the Justice Department
may ask a federal judge to break Microsoft into two or three
companies. Broader stock indicators were mostly lower, but
financial stocks pulled the Dow Jones industrials into positive
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite
index was down 197.41 at 3,446.47. The Dow was up 11.48 at
10,855.53, having recovered from a drop of 146 points it suffered
in the opening minutes of trading.

<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 11.97 at 1,422.57.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 13 1/16 to 65~, was the biggest decliner in all
three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the heaviest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
all of its 30 components equally.

Microsoft, as part of the penalty in its antitrust case, as being

Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing personal computer sales.

<HEADLINE> American Express Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express reported a 14 percent jump in
profits for the first quarter as the booming economy helped spur
demand for the company's charge cards, financial and travel
services.
</P>
<P>
   American Express earned $656 million, or $1.44 a share, beating
analysts' estimates by 2 cents a share, according to a survey by
First Call/Thomson Financial. In the first quarter last year, the
company earned $575 million, or $1.26 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues totaled $5.26 billion, up 16 percent from $4.52 billion
in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The company's travel services business reported strong profits
of $416 million, up 15 percent from $363 million in the first
quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   American Express' financial advisory unit pulled in profits of
$245 million, up 15 percent from $214 million a year ago. The
company attributed the gain to strong sales of mutual funds,
annuities and insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   Results were flat at the company's banking and travelers check
division.

<HEADLINE> Boeing CFO Resigns To Join Lucent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Deborah Hopkins, The Boeing Co.'s chief financial
officer, has left the aerospace giant after barely a year to take
the same post with Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, 45, will oversee all of Lucent's financial operations
and report directly to Richard McGinn, Lucent's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy the passion and velocity of a high-tech company,''
Hopkins said today. ''And Lucent is at the center of one of the
fastest-growing industries today. When I was offered the
opportunity to join Lucent and Rich McGinn's senior team, I
couldn't pass it up.''
</P>
<P>
   She replaces Donald K. Peterson, who has been named CEO of
Lucent's new Enterprise Networks Group, slated to be spun off later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman did not immediately return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins joined Boeing in December 1998. Her 1999 compensation
was about $1.25 million, according to Boeing's 2000 proxy
statement. That included a salary of about $473,000, bonus of about
$633,000, and other compensation of $144,000.
</P>
<P>
   Her Lucent offer was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was hired away from General Motors Corp. by Boeing
during difficult times for the aerospace manufacturer. Boeing in
1998 had reported its first annual loss in 50 years, and hiring
Hopkins was part of the company's successful effort to change
financial course.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies, headquartered in Murray Hill, N.J., designs
computer systems, software and communications networks, focusing on
optical and wireless networks, Internet infrastructure and other
areas.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down About 200; Dow Up 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell 200 points today
after published reports said the Justice Department may ask a
federal judge to break Microsoft into two or three companies.
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower, but financial stocks
pulled the Dow Jones industrials into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 199.93 at 3,444.49. The Dow was up 3.72 at 10,847.77, having
recovered from a drop of 146 points it suffered in the opening
minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 14.04 at 1,420.50.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 13 to 65 15/16, was the biggest decliner in all
three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the heaviest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
each of its 30 components equally.
</P>
<P>
   News reports today said the Justice Department envisions
Microsoft, as part of the penalty in its antitrust case, as being
forced to split off its Windows operating system from the rest of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft possibly then would be split in two,
with one company handling applications software and the other the
company's Internet business, including browser software.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government will its proposed remedies this week
to a federal judge in Washington who has already ruled that
Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks fell today. Cisco Systems fell 3 9/16 to
61 9/16 and Intel fell 2 3/8 to 113.
</P>
<P>
   But blue chip financial stocks attracted some buying interest,
lifting the Dow from its lows. American Express rose 4 13/16 to 147
13/16. This morning, the company reported earnings that surpassed
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued buying into the reviving drug sector.
Warner-Lambert rose 3 7/16 to 116 7/8. Merck rose 1 5/8 to 71 3/8
after reporting first-quarter profits of 63 cents per share,
beating Wall Street forecasts by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 386.21 million
shares, well behind 423.55 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.89 to
467.95.

<HEADLINE> Workers Fall From Peoria Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A construction platform on a bridge at least
50 feet above the Illinois River fell today, plunging five workers
into the water. Three were killed and a fourth was impaled by a
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   One man was pronounced dead at OSF St. Francis Medical Center
shortly after he was pulled from the river. Two other bodies were
found after a crane pulled a pile of platform wreckage from the
water, Peoria County Coroner Dan Heinz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They got the scaffolding out and that's when they found them''
in about five feet of water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Divers could not see because of the mud and silt in the water,
Assistant Peoria Fire Chief Roy Modglin said. ''What they were
doing, they were doing all by feel.''
</P>
<P>
   OSF St. Francis hospital spokesman Chris Lofgren said one worker
had been impaled by a pipe and was in surgery this morning and
another was being treated for head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A man who jumped into the river to try to help the fallen
workers was treated for hypothermia and released, Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' names were being withheld, pending notification of
family members.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident has not been determined, Heinz said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, which is nearly a mile long, is on the north side of
the central Illinois city of 110,000. The workers were part of a
construction crew replacing the bridge deck, said Michael Rippel,
an Illinois Department of Transportation engineer.

<HEADLINE> Handler Slap-Happy in 'Stooges'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If you wanted to poke Evan Handler in the eye,
you'd need to get your fingers past those cool eyeglasses with the
diamond-shaped frames.
</P>
<P>
   Bother!
</P>
<P>
   The Three Stooges, undisputed champions of the two-fingered eye
poke, never wore glasses. For them, nothing got in the way of
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they didn't really gouge each other's eyes out, as
Handler found when he portrayed Larry, the bushy-haired Stooge.
Your fingers, he learned, should actually make contact with the
victim's brow, thus sparing him discomfort and possible blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer will learn such wisdom after watching Handler in
''The Three Stooges,'' an ABC biopic airing Monday at 8 p.m.
Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   In this affectionate, bittersweet group portrait, you will also
learn of the Stooges' humble beginnings as low-paid vaudeville
performers.
</P>
<P>
   Then Larry Fine, Moe Howard (played by Paul Ben-Victor) and his
brother Shemp (John Kassir) got a call from Hollywood. When their
big movie deal fell through, Shemp left the act. Moe drafted
another brother (Michael Chiklis), who, after shaving his head,
became Curly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, the Stooges landed a regular gig at Columbia Pictures,
where, never given their due in money or respect, they literally
slapped together some 200 comedy classics that have helped define
silliness for the past two-thirds of a century (and probably always
will).
</P>
<P>
   As the Stooges would say: Enchanted! Enraptured! Embalmed!
</P>
<P>
   It's a story worth seeing, even for closet Stooges fans. You
know, the people who may not cop to enjoying the sight of grown men
playing Punch-and-Judy -- but who, if given half a chance, can't
resist mimicking Curly's ''woo-woo-woo!'' or Moe's ''Oh, a wise
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As a kid, I was somewhere between indifferent to and
frightened of the Stooges,'' Handler concedes over a recent lunch
at a Manhattan coffee shop. ''I just thought they were creepy and
weird.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in my late teens and early 20s, coming home after drinking
and smoking pot, I found them hysterical. Absolutely hysterical!''
(Oh, a wise guy.)
</P>
<P>
   Handler, now 39, was starring on the ABC sitcom ''It's Like, You
Know ...'' as trust-fund slacker Shrug when the ''Stooges'' offer
arrived early this year. Then he got word that ''It's Like'' had
been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing he knew, he was on a plane to Sydney, Australia.
There, Larry's porcupinish fuzz would be applied to Handler's shiny
pate (treatment for acute leukemia in his 20s left him bald).
Shooting began in late January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think the project was anything special,'' Handler
confides, ''and I thought it was a long way to travel. But it
turned out to be one of my favorite experiences, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   With a dash of angst he adds, ''I don't tend to have a great
experience easily.''
</P>
<P>
   For Handler, the key to the movie -- and the Stooges -- is the
fractious love that bonds brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Stooges are all about a big brother, Moe, and a little
brother, along with Larry, the outsider who was welcomed as a
surrogate brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''Little brothers stick by their big brother even though they
get smacked around 'cause they want his approval,'' Handler goes
on. ''Curly and Larry are always turning to Moe as if to say,
'Didn't I do good?' And they get smacked instead of praised.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides depicting the behind-the-scenes drama of these brothers,
Handler with his co-stars got to create from scratch the Stooges'
suitably threadbare vaudeville act.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the actors had to resurrect certain sketches from
the Stooges' actual films.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we strove to do an absolute breath-by-breath
re-creation, but they're pretty darn accurate,'' Handler says. ''We
were all determined to break each routine down slowly and learn it.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we all took plenty of accidental shots. I got several
fingers in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Handler has suffered worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, leukemia ambushed him. He was a rising young stage
and film actor. He was even up for a role in a big-budget comedy
starring Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman; his disease may have
spared him from the legendary bomb ''Ishtar.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, his four-year nightmare and miraculous recovery
inspired Handler's mordantly uplifting memoir, ''Time on Fire: My
Comedy of Terrors.'' It's a remarkable book that Handler plans to
turn into a film, and to direct it.
</P>
<P>
   Another Handler project will likely never see the light of day.
During spring 1994, he co-starred in the TV pilot for ''Frogman,''
a prospective new series for O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   ''O.J. just seemed to be a very, very famous guy who was
perfectly nice,'' Handler recalls. ''He was dating his ex-wife
again. He would talk openly about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Come June, of course, Simpson's ex-wife Nicole and her friend
Ron Goldman were found hacked to death outside her home.
''Frogman'' never aired. But the world was sucked into a real-life
O.J. drama.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the tragedy of the slayings, Handler says ''the most
striking thing to me was, I was never contacted by the L.A. police
department. I was there with (Simpson) for five weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Handler says that, at one point, they were filming in the
neighborhood of the downtown Los Angeles cutlery shop where Simpson
reportedly bought a 15-inch knife a few weeks before the murders he
was charged with committing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever contacted me,'' Handler says with a bemused smile.
''Except the tabloids.''
</P>

   FAT CHANCE: Many people have hectic schedules that force them to
balance multiple duties at once. But despite crazy schedules and
constant running around, some find they are gaining instead of
losing weight. Poor eating habits and lack of exercise contribute
to an increase in weight, but is there something else that society
might be overlooking? ''Dateline NBC'' correspondent Edie Magnus
reports on claims that stress contributes to weight gain, and looks
for answers in a new book called ''Fight Fat After 40.'' It airs on
''Dateline'' Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern.

<HEADLINE> Hershey Foods Reports Strong Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Hershey Foods Corp., nation's largest
candymaker, reported higher first-quarter profits Monday, driven
partly by strong sales leading up to the Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey had net earnings of $71.2 million compared to $224.7
million in the same period a year ago, when the company recorded a
$165 million gain from the sale of a pasta business.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding that gain, as well as a one-time profit in the most
recent quarter from a swap of company aircraft, first quarter
earnings were $66.7 million, or 48 cents per share, compared to
$50.5 million, or 35 cents per share, during the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results surpassed analysts' expectations of about 44 cents a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 9 percent to $993 million from $913 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth L. Wolfe, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company had a strong start despite higher costs associated with the
planned opening of a new distribution center. Hershey expects the
higher costs to continue until the center fully opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effect of higher sales volume, manufacturing efficiencies
and lower commodity costs more than offset the increased logistics
costs,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Hershey's chocolates, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,
Twizzlers and other candies has been looking to bounce back after
delays with a new automated ordering and distribution system
inflated operating costs and hampered delivery of Halloween and
Christmas candies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said the company appeared back on track with its customer
orders, with delivery time back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this is extremely gratifying, our experience through a
full annual shipping cycle, which includes our peak seasonal
shipping period of August through October, will be the final
determinate of our continued success,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Political Dollars Flow Into TV  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- This year's South Carolina presidential primary
was great news for George W. Bush. It wasn't too bad for Columbia,
S.C.'s WIS-TV, either.
</P>
<P>
   Showered with attention from candidates anxious to get their
message out for the suddenly crucial GOP contest, the NBC affiliate
earned $426,000 in political advertising revenue during the first
three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It more than doubled what John Cottingham, the station's general
manager, had budgeted and easily eclipsed the $234,399 the station
took in during the same period four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a lucrative year for WIS-TV and many
stations across the country. The Television Bureau of Advertising
predicts politicians will spend $600 million on TV ads during 2000,
up from $400 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Political ad spending in January was more than twice what it was
in 1996, the TVB said. True, this year saw two competitive races
for party nominations, instead of one four years ago, and primaries
were more compressed earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the increased spending is likely to continue. So is the
trend toward more ads being bought locally, instead of nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Before President Clinton's two campaigns, it wasn't unusual to
see about a quarter of political ad spending going to national
networks during a presidential election year. (Figures include
spending for all campaigns, including local races).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton strategically shifted more of his spending to less
expensive local ads in areas he considered key, said Harold
Simpson, the TVB's chief researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really does make sense,'' Simpson said. ''The philosophy of
that approach is, why buy the whole country when everything hinges
on a couple of states? Or a couple of parts of individual states?''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts at least $550 million of the $600 million in
anticipated spending this year will go to local stations. It will
be a windfall for stations in states that Al Gore and George Bush
consider battlegrounds, even more so if there are hot local races,
too.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers just add to Paul Taylor's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, executive director of the Alliance for Better Campaigns,
is trying to persuade broadcasters to adopt a presidential
commission's 1998 recommendation that they set aside five minutes
of free air time a night to political candidates in the month
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only about 2 percent of the nation's roughly 1,400 local
TV stations have agreed to do this, he said. None of the national
networks have. The Radio and Television News Directors Association,
lobbyists for local stations, actively opposes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am surprised at how poor the response has been,'' Taylor
said. ''It seems to me by their behavior the industry is indicating
that when they're asked about the public interest, they can't see
beyond their bottom-line interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cochran, president of the news directors group, said
it's unfair to link its position on free time with advertising
profits. The stations oppose the measure on First Amendment
grounds, believing they shouldn't let politicians decide what goes
on their air, even for five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the decisions about how best to use the air time to
communicate with the public are decisions best made by individual
broadcasters,'' Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives like Cottingham also believe that many viewers will
be turned off by a five-minute political interlude.
</P>
<P>
   Cottingham said his station takes pride in political reporting
during its eight daily newscasts. Candidates frequently express
their views on WIS-TV's Sunday morning public affairs show and,
close to the elections, station reporters conduct their own
five-minute interviews with candidates on news programs.
</P>
<P>
   While the station took in a great deal of ad revenue in the days
leading up to the South Carolina primary, its expenses for covering
the campaign also increased, he said. WIS-TV sponsored a GOP debate
that was telecast nationally on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money was welcome -- don't get him wrong -- but was
hardly a windfall in the context of a $20 million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, however, political ads are becoming an
increasingly important part of a local station's business. As a
percentage of advertising revenue, politics was third only to the
automotive and retail sectors in 1998, according to Bear, Stearns &AMP;
Co. Inc. -- and that wasn't even a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   There's evidence in some markets that with advertising time
scarce in the weeks leading up to an election, prices for
non-politicians who want to run commercials shoot up, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   No one's come out and publicly said they're worried that the
five minutes of free air time may lead politicians to direct some
advertising spending elsewhere, but Taylor said he's sure that's
what some are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It would be less worrisome if all stations took their
responsibility to cover political news as seriously as WIS-TV did.
Instead, Taylor said, at some stations the political desk can be
found in the advertising department, not the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're profiteering on democracy and they're not giving the
public the information that it needs,'' he said. ''It doesn't paint
a very attractive picture.''

<HEADLINE> Chess Grandmaster Visits Harlem  </HEADLINE>
By ROBIN McDOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Unleashing what appears to be a deadly attack on
his opponent's king, 9-year-old Eliot Majors slides his queen
diagonally across the chessboard -- then inexplicably halts one
square short.
</P>
<P>
   Check. Not checkmate.
</P>
<P>
   Several watching youngsters groan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nooo!'' cries one, falling to the ground in dramatic
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''You sure you want to do that?'' asks Maurice Ashley, casually
tucking his glasses into a jacket pocket as he takes a seat beside
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur Ashe did for tennis, as Tiger Woods is doing for golf,
34-year-old Ashley -- the world's first and only black grandmaster
of chess -- is helping bring an elite game played predominantly by
whites to minority kids.
</P>
<P>
   From New York to Los Angeles, covers of Chess Life magazine
featuring Ashley are taped to the walls of inner-city recreation
halls where youngsters gather to play the intricate centuries-old
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have people calling from all over wanting him to come to
their schools,'' says Barbara DeMaro, executive assistant of the
United States Chess Federation. ''Kids look up to him. There's a
feeling, if he can do it, we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he opened the Harlem Chess Center at the Police Athletic
League community center in central Harlem seven months ago, Ashley
thought kids would embrace the game, but he is surprised by the
level of interest.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, some 80 children who might have headed for
basketball hoops after school instead pack a tiny room lined with
white-and-green checkered boards. Using moves that reflect medieval
war strategy, they learn how to maneuver pawns, castles, bishops,
knights and queens in a battle to capture the opposing kings.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the most depressing things about growing up in the
inner city -- and I did -- is that there's handball, basketball,
football, all kinds of sports things, but very little in the way
that is intellectually stimulating,'' says Ashley, who was barely a
teen when he and his family moved from Jamaica to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley learned the rules of chess at age 9. He started getting
serious at 14, latching onto teens and young men who spent hours
playing fast and furiously in Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from City College with an English degree, he
started coaching and led a Harlem middle-school team -- the Dark
Knights of Mott Hall -- to three national championships in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he was ascending the international chess rankings and
last March was awarded the game's highest title -- grandmaster. Only
500 others hold the rank around the world, including Garry Kasparov
and Bobby Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   September found him at the gala opening of the Harlem Chess
Center, which like the Dark Knights is funded by the nonprofit
Harlem Educational Activities Fund.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, streets were blocked off and rows of chess boards
lined sidewalks. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis played and spoke with
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had so many kids sign up that first day,'' Ashley says.
''We were worried we weren't going to be able to take them all.''
</P>
<P>
   But they did and today the Harlem Chess Center is run by a few
chess enthusiasts who spend as much time calming down overeager
students as they do coaching them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't walk down the hall without having eight little kids
come up to me asking can they please play chess today,'' says Brian
Hawkins, 30, as he intervenes in an argument between two boys over
a dubious chess move.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of elementary, middle and high school students in
Harlem and the South Bronx have already learned the game thanks to
another nonprofit program -- Chess-In-Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that young chess players raise their reading scores
and concentrate better. The game teaches strategy and consequences
and instills confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, every eighth-grader in the Mott Hall chess program
was accepted at either Stuyvesant High School or the Bronx High
School of Science, two of the top high schools in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some rough kids in that class, and I honestly believe
chess made the difference,'' says Jerald Times, the Dark Knights'
current director.
</P>
<P>
   At all the chess programs around the city, teachers place
special emphasis on the girls, who tend to quit around the sixth
grade. Until then, they do just as well, often better, than the
boys.
</P>
<P>
   At the chess center, Esme Rogers' eyes sparkle as she beats New
York University volunteers, even after giving them a three-minute
handicap in speed chess.
</P>
<P>
   Watching two instructors wrestle with a complex chess problem,
the 9-year-old cannot stay away; her fingers literally twitch with
desire to move the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to figure out the problem by the time her father comes
for her, she writes down the pieces' places so she can keep trying
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like this one,'' she says. ''It makes you think.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Ban on Video Gambling Gets OK  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Monday let South Carolina
go ahead with its plan to shut down the $2.8 billion-a-year video
gambling industry in that state beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The justices made no comment as they turned down a video
gambling company's challenge of the way the ban was approved last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was filed by Joytime Distributors &AMP; Amusement Co., a
Greenville-based corporation that owns 164 video gambling machines
in several counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it was a substantial issue that at some time the
court needs to look at,'' Joytime lawyer Gaston Fairey said Monday.
''We're disappointed that the court chose not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina General Assembly last summer passed a law
intended to ban video gambling unless a majority of voters in a
November referendum approved continued payouts from the video
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Supreme Court struck down the referendum,
ruling that the General Assembly violated the state constitution by
delegating its decision-making power to the voters. But the state's
highest court upheld other parts of the law, effectively ending
video gambling as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In their appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Joytime said
the state court ''infringed fundamental First Amendment freedoms of
the South Carolina electorate by first enjoining the referendum on
video gaming and then itself deciding that such gaming should be
outlawed.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and the right to
petition the government.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Charlie Condon and his staff urged the
justices to reject Joytime's appeal. They noted that the First
Amendment argument never was raised when the case was before the
state Supreme Court, and they added that no First Amendment
violation occurred.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Julie Sommars, who never won a trial as
prosecutor Julie March on ''Matlock,'' has a real-life role
overseeing California's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sommars was appointed April 7 to a non-lawyer position on the
State Bar Board of Governors, which runs the bar's admission and
discipline programs and supervises programs in legal education,
ethics and aid to the poor.

<HEADLINE> Judge: No Firearm Flashes at Waco  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A preliminary review of infrared videotapes
made during the final hours of the Branch Davidian siege found no
firearm muzzle flashes from either federal agents or sect members,
a judge said at pretrial hearing today.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith described the court experts'
findings for attorneys for the plaintiffs and the government at the
beginning of a pretrial hearing to determine whether key evidence
gathered after the fiery raid was mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during
the April 19, 1993, fire that occurred several hours into an FBI
tear-gassing operation intended to end the sect's 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends their deaths, whether from fire or
gunshot wounds, came by their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs argue in their wrongful death lawsuit that
government gunfire cut off the Davidians' only avenue of escape
from the fire. They also contend the FBI's on-scene commanders did
little to prepare for the possibility of fire despite Attorney
General Janet Reno's order that they be ready for all emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the lawyers that the review of the infrared
videotape detected about 57 ''thermal events,'' defined as flashes
of light signifying heat. There ''were no muzzle blasts either from
Branch Davidians or government agents,'' Smith told attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the only person detected on the tape was a Branch
Davidian who was on a roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get good news. You get bad news .... This is not going to
result in a dismissal of the case,'' Michael Caddell, lead attorney
for the Branch Davidians, said about the preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also said there was ''a suspicious pattern'' in the
audio portion of the infrared videotape. Several portions of the
tape are missing audio, and on one section of the tape someone is
heard asking that the audio be turned off, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cautioned that he does not consider the report to be
incontrovertible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from a recent court-ordered simulation of
the siege showed that flashes caught on the original infrared
videotape were most likely sunlight reflecting off debris, not
government gunfire as plaintiffs claim. Experts expect to submit
their analysis of that simulation to the court by May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also was expected to review the plaintiffs' complaint that
the government withheld, destroyed or tampered with crucial
evidence in their wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys filed a motion in March that accuses
the government of:
</P>
<P>
   --Never returning a roll of film confiscated from the Texas
Rangers showing bodies and weapons found inside a concrete bunker.
''The absence of these photographs makes it very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine if any of these persons were shot outside
of that room and moved into it prior to or after the fire,'' the
motion said.
</P>
<P>
   --Representing as originals audio recordings made from listening
devices planted inside the compound during the siege. An analysis
the plaintiffs commissioned suggests the tapes are copies. The
tapes -- which the government has relied on for proof that the
Davidians spread fuel and started the fire -- also bear signs of
being recorded with multiple recorders, the plaintiffs' tape expert
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The government has called the allegations baseless and says the
accusations relied on incomplete, illogical or scientifically
invalid analyses.
</P>
<P>
   But in a response filed one week ago, the government
acknowledged it is missing 30 original negatives from the first of
at least seven rolls of film shot by an FBI photographer who
circled 1,000 feet above the complex in a surveillance aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The government, however, has prints of the missing negatives and
the original contact sheet of the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trial on the lawsuit is set to begin June 19.

<HEADLINE> New Heartburn Fix Targets the Cause  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aline Humphrey was losing a 10-year battle
with worsening heartburn: Medications didn't help, and she had
resorted to eating only easy-to-digest baby food.
</P>
<P>
   Then doctors snaked a tiny tube down her throat to fix the
faulty valve causing the problem. The California nurse celebrated
several months later with an eight-course French meal and a bottle
of Dom Perignon -- no more antacids, no more heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   Now other sufferers can try it, too: The Food and Drug
Administration has approved the first non-drug treatments for acid
reflux -- two different medical devices that send a tube down the
throat to fix the actual cause of chronic heartburn instead of just
suppressing painful stomach acid as medications do.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong, outpatient procedures could significantly change
the way heartburn is treated.
</P>
<P>
   One device is like a tiny sewing machine that puts a few
stitches in the faulty valve causing heartburn, creating little
pleated gathers to strengthen it. The other device, which Humphrey
tried, zaps the faulty valve with radiofrequency energy, beams of
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both rely on the fact that we think fixing the valve is a good
long-term option rather than staying on medications for the rest of
your life,'' explained Dr. Neil Stollman of San Francisco General
Hospital, who tested the radiofrequency device, Curon Medical
Inc.'s Stretta system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still practice medicine, and I know a lot of patients who
are going to benefit,'' said Dr. Brian E. Harvey, the FDA senior
medical officer who reviewed Stretta and competitor C.R. Bard Inc's
Endoscopic Suturing System. The FDA approved both earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 million Americans suffer chronic heartburn, called
''gastroesophageal reflux disease,'' or GERD. A valve where the
esophagus meets the stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter,
relaxes at the wrong times, allowing acidic stomach contents to
back up into the delicate esophagus -- a burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Spicy foods or overeating could give anyone occasional
heartburn. But GERD causes serious, repeated heartburn. The stomach
acid can actually corrode the esophagus, causing inflammation or
scarring that makes it hard to swallow. One recent study found
people with severe reflux are eight times more likely to develop
esophageal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Acid-blocking medicines -- such as Prilosec, the world's
best-selling drug -- are highly effective at relieving symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But some people don't like taking daily medicine. Others don't
have insurance to cover the drugs. Curon cites one estimate that
patients and insurers worldwide spend $14 billion a year on
anti-heartburn drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still other patients get no relief from drugs, or suffer side
effects. When acid blockers fail, patients have tried Propulsid, a
drug that pushes food through the stomach faster so there's less to
reflux -- but one drug the manufacturer is about to quit selling
because it also can cause lethal irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only non-drug alternative was surgery to tighten
the valve.
</P>
<P>
   The two new systems don't require cutting patients:
</P>
<P>
   --Curon's Stretta has electrodes on an endoscope threaded down
the throat. The electrodes burn spots on the muscle controlling the
faulty valve. A flexible scar-like tissue forms. Doctors aren't
sure if that tightens the valve, or if the heat zaps overactive
nerves that made the valve malfunction. Regardless, in a study of
47 patients followed for six months after the procedure, 70 percent
had quit taking all heartburn medicines.
</P>
<P>
   --Bard's suturing device, developed by a physician at the Royal
College of London, is like a miniature sewing machine on an
endoscope. Tiny stitches tighten the valve. In a study of 64
patients, 67 percent had either no heartburn or only occasional,
brief episodes six months later.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how long the effects will last -- patients may need
retreatment every few years, FDA's Harvey cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Both procedures can cause mild chest or stomach pain that day,
but studies found no serious side effects. However, physicians do
need training to perform the procedures, something both companies
are beginning. The procedures will cost $2,000 to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it turns out that this works as well as we think, it's
going to be very appealing to physicians and our patients,'' said
Emory University's Dr. Patrick Waring, who tested Bard's suturing
system. ''I think there's a lot of people ... who don't want to
have an operation, who don't want medicine on a daily basis but
still want relief from their heartburn.''

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreaks Sweep Somalia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Cholera outbreaks are sweeping through
famine-ridden villages in southwestern Somalia, killing nearly 400
people in the past two weeks, local authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Five children died from the infectious disease during the last
24-hours in Dinsor in the Bay region, while 30 have been killed
since Friday in the Gedo region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is already out of hand as the disease is
spreading dangerously within villages already devastated by
famine,'' the Bay region's governor, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh,
told reporters. He said more than 1,000 people registered in newly
set up quarantines.
</P>
<P>
   In Gedo, an average of five people are dying from a combination
of the disease and drought every day, local authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the disease, which is spread by contaminated
water, is being worsened by the same drought that has parched parts
of neighboring Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s World Food Program estimates 1.2 million Somalis are
threatened with severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a 50-truck convoy carrying more than 580 tons of
relief food became the first convoy since June to make the trek
from the capital Mogadishu to the town of Baidoa, en route to
drought-striken areas.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent fighting had made the road too dangerous to travel
since the Rahanwein Resistance Army retook Baidoa, 112 miles
northwest of Mogadishu, from the forces of south Mogadishu warlord
Hussein Aidid in June.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy carrying maize, sorghum, beans and porridge meal for
the U.N. World Food Program and CARE-International was accompanied
by 400 armed militiamen, said Abukar Abdi Shireh, a spokesman for
the transporters.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has had no central government since January 1991, when
faction leaders combined forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad
Barre, then turned to battle each other.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 219; Dow Down 14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell more than 200
points today after published reports said the Justice Department
may ask a federal judge to break Microsoft into two or three
companies. Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 219.51 at 3,424.37. The Dow was down 24.20 at 10,819.85,
but had spent most of the session in positive territory after
plunging 146 points in the opening minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broad-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 14.04 at
1,420.50.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 12 13/16 to 66 1/8, was the biggest decliner in
all three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the heaviest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
each of its 30 components equally.
</P>
<P>
   News reports today said the Justice Department envisions
Microsoft, as part of the penalty in its antitrust case, as being
forced to split off its Windows operating system from the rest of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft possibly then would be split in two,
with one company handling applications software and the other the
company's Internet business, including browser software.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government will its proposed remedies this week
to a federal judge in Washington who has already ruled that
Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks fell today. Cisco Systems fell 4 1/16 to
61 1/16 and Intel fell 1 7/16 to 113 15/16.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell more than 200
points today after published reports said the Justice Department
may ask a federal judge to break Microsoft into two or three
companies. Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 219.51 at 3,424.37. The Dow was down 24.20 at 10,819.85,
but had spent most of the session in positive territory after
plunging 146 points in the opening minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broad-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 14.04 at
1,420.50.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 12 13/16 to 66[, was the biggest decliner in all
three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the heaviest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
each of its 30 components equally.
</P>
<P>
   News reports today said the Justice Department envisions
Microsoft, as part of the penalty in its antitrust case, as being
forced to split off its Windows operating system from the rest of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft possibly then would be split in two,
with one company handling applications software and the other the
company's Internet business, including browser software.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government will its proposed remedies this week
to a federal judge in Washington who has already ruled that
Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing personal computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks fell today. Cisco Systems fell 4 1/16 to
61 1/16 and Intel fell 1 7/16 to 113 15/16.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq dropped more than 250 points Monday
as an already skittish market was unnerved by reports that the

<HEADLINE> Issues Turn Capitol Into Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gliding into the dining room of a House office
building looking much like she did in the 1970s TV series
''Charlie's Angels,'' actress Cheryl Ladd is surrounded by
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   It would normally be considered a familiar scene for the
actress.
</P>
<P>
   But these fans are different: They're members of Congress. And
Ladd isn't just signing autographs, she's calling for measures to
help end child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to lawmaking in a media-saturated culture, where
advocacy meets Hollywood meets Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   More and more celebrities these days are using the Capitol dome
or a congressional hearing room as a backdrop for touting their pet
issues -- a boon for advocacy groups that have learned star power
prompts instant attention from lawmakers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''To bring attention sometimes it takes celebrities, someone to
get those cameras there,'' Ladd said after a recent luncheon that
included Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Adds supermodel/actress Lauren Hutton, recently in town to
promote hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women, ''Many
places where we are, we probably wouldn't be on TV or get a lecture
hall if it wasn't that you had someone that everyone had heard the
name of before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what people know and feel comfortable with. It's almost
like a brand name,'' Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, lawmakers have heard from a host of
celebrities, including singer Michael Bolton on extending the 1994
Violence Against Women Act, singer James Taylor on music education
and Miss America, Heather French, on increasing federal funding to
help homeless veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on a celebrity's aura to draw attention to an issue
isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   ''Celebrity advocacy is as old as Gloria Swanson,'' said Robin
Bronk, executive director of The Creative Coalition, a social and
political advocacy group composed of entertainers. ''What you are
seeing now is it's expected of celebrities. Just as it's expected
to have a manager and a publicity, they also have an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, who became a star in the 1920s and appeared in Cecil B.
DeMille's movie ''Don't Change Your Husband,'' had been married six
times when she joined efforts in the 1960s to reduce taxes on
single people. She told the House Ways and Means Committee she had
been ''single most of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a tax structure that both Democrats and
Republicans are now clamoring to overturn by eliminating the
so-called ''marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities today enjoy that same power, a fact readily conceded
by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't listen to Congress. But they're going to listen
to Miss America,'' Rep. Julia Carson, D-Ind., said after French got
a standing ovation for her testimony before a House subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This comes out of the woodwork as a gift from God that we have
somebody this high level that can have access to so many public
events to bring this issue into everybody's mind and to create an
awareness,'' said Linda Boone, executive director of the National
Coalition for Homeless Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   After ''Today'' show host Katie Couric launched a campaign
earlier this year to increase colon cancer awareness, including an
appearance before Congress, scores of people headed to their
doctors for colon cancer checkups.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Couric is the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a
clearinghouse for philanthropic efforts founded in 1942 by movie
mogul Samuel Goldwyn with leaders such as Humphrey Bogart and Joan
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live in a society that is celebrity obsessed,'' said Bronk
of the Creative Coalition. ''What we try to do is say, 'Given that
celebrities are counted upon to be opinion leaders these days, how
can we best use our voice effectively?' It draws the media, and if
it draws the media, it draws the public.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Hillary Clinton raises more from New Yorkers  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, under fire from
Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani for being a carpetbagger, is getting
a higher percentage of her itemized donations this year from New
Yorkers than the mayor is, according to a published report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp said the analysis was fundamentally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany Times Union's analysis of campaign finance reports
filed by the first lady and the New York City mayor found that she
received 53 percent of her itemized donations of $200 or more from
New Yorkers during the first three months of this year. Thirty-one
percent of Giuliani's itemized donations came from New York
residents, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton raised more than $4.7 million during the first
three months of this year, including $2.14 million in itemized
contributions. Giuliani raised more than $7.5 million, including
$3.6 million in itemized contributions.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Senate candidates must itemize donations of $200 or more
on their campaign filings. The records provide such things as a
donor's address and employer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said the newspaper's
analysis provided an unfair portrayal of the fund-raising
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum noted that an independent analysis of last year's
fund raising by both candidates by the Washington-based Center for
Responsive Politics found that 56 percent of the first lady's
contributions came from outside New York state. The center found
that 44 percent of the mayor's donations came from non-New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the mayor's fund-raising effort had concentrated
early this year on direct-mail appeals that tend to focus on
non-New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's adviser also said the bulk of money raised for
Clinton through federal campaign committees aimed at collecting
''soft-money'' donations for the race has come from non-New
Yorkers. He said the newspaper's analysis appears to have failed to
take into account the $750,000 in hard-money donations transferred
into her campaign account by those committees already this year. If
that money had been included in the analysis, Teitelbaum said, it
would have reduced the percentage of her overall donations that
came from New Yorkers. Teitelbaum said most such money raised on
Giuliani's behalf has come from New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you calculate the $750,000 transferred to Mrs. Clinton's
campaign account, she has raised more money out of state than in
state, just like she did last year,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giuliani camp was attacking the newspaper's analysis,
the Clinton campaign was using it to hammer home its favorite theme
of recent weeks -- that she is spending more time on the campaign
trail talking about Senate issues than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reflects the fact that Hillary has been extensively
traveling all across the state, running a positive campaign telling
New Yorkers what she would do in the Senate,'' Clinton spokesman
Howard Wolfson said. ''Maybe if Rudy went upstate more he might get
more support up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the first lady had never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Following a fund-raising event in New York City on Monday night
with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the first lady
was off for a three-day campaign trip through the Southern Tier and
western New York. Giuliani aides said he might spend parts of
Friday and Saturday at campaign events in Saratoga Springs and in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two began raising money for the race last year,
Giuliani has collected $19.3 million while Clinton has raised $12.8
million in what experts believe will become the most expensive
Senate race in the nation's history.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Get Edwin Edwards Case  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- After hearing hours of instructions,
jurors in former Gov. Edwin Edwards' racketeering trial were handed
the task today of deciding the fate of the former four-term
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and his six co-defendants are accused of trying to rig
riverboat casino licenses and extort money from people who wanted
the licenses.
</P>
<P>
   It took a little more than three hours, not counting two breaks,
for U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola to read the 96 pages of
instructions to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors and most of the defendants followed along as he read.
Some jurors took notes and underlined phrases on their copies.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' wife, Candy, sometimes shook her head ''no'' while
Polozola read a summary of the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors will not be sequestered and will be allowed to set their
own break times, the judge said. Defendants and their families
showed little emotion when the jury left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son, Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four other
defendants are accused of taking part in a series of schemes to
manipulate the licensing of riverboat casinos before and after
Edwards' fourth and final term ended in January 1996. Their trial
started Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look him straight in the eye and tell him he's guilty,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Harper told jurors during closing
arguments last week.
</P>
<P>
   Big-money tales are nothing new in the 40-year public saga of
Louisiana's roguish ex-governor. But this time tales of money,
money everywhere, could land him in a federal prison beyond what he
calls his ''biblically allotted time.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses say the payoffs came in the form of vehicles,
appliances and cash. A former casino owner said he sometimes left
the cash in trash bins or ash bins behind restaurants or in a
trailer behind his office.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, faces more than 300
years in prison -- a term he joked he would never serve.
</P>
<P>
   Elected four times despite -- possibly because of -- his unabashed
love of high-stakes gambling and his reputation as a ladies' man,
Edwards by his own count has been the target of nearly two dozen
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, they had Edwards' own words to use against
him. With wiretaps and a hidden microphone and video camera, the
FBI secretly recorded 1,500 hours of conversations involving
Edwards and his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case also includes three witnesses who claimed
they paid extortion money to Edwards, and financial experts who say
Edwards outspent his reported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. told jurors
that Edwards threatened to cause problems for DeBartolo's riverboat
casino license application if Edwards was not paid $400,000.
DeBartolo said he handed Edwards the money -- $100 bills stacked in
a briefcase -- at the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards denied the claims with his typical aplomb when he took
the witness stand for four days.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was lying, Edwards had a simple answer: ''No,
and if I were, you've got to assume I wouldn't be telling you.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also used testimony from contractors and designers
who said that Edwards paid them in cash when he was building a new
home. In all, Edwards paid $733,567 in cash for his $1.4 million
house.
</P>
<P>
   The cash Edwards spent between 1986 and 1997 far exceeds the
cash he took home from his lucrative trips to casinos -- he once won
$220,000 in Atlantic City -- or what he pulled in at the high stakes
poker games at the Governor's mansion, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the evidence the five-person prosecution team
does have -- 1,500 hours of testimony and 66 witnesses -- defense
attorneys say there has not been a ''smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is the evidence that Edwin Edwards, Stephen Edwards,
Andrew Martin and Cecil Brown actually sat down and talked about
manipulating the licensing process?'' asked attorney Jim Cole, who
represents Stephen Edwards.

<HEADLINE> Miami Protesters Move to Courthouse  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Women who had held morning prayers each day outside
the home of Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives moved their protest
today to the federal courthouse complex, where they accused federal
agents of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 women dressed in black gathered peacefully, holding
the widely seen photos of the 6-year-old boy and a federal agent
with a gun. The original photo was taken by a photographer working
for The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''As mothers and children we are here to condemn the child abuse
perpetrated by federal authorities,'' said Sylvia Iriondo, who
organized the months of prayers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gonzalez family home in the city's Little Havana section,
one lone protester stood vigil as the day began.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, protesters honked horns and waved Cuban flags as
they cruised city streets. Others stood on streetcorners and police
made several arrests when demonstrators failed to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department Battalion Chief Skip Kruse said a fire that
broke out behind a supermarket near where protesters had gathered
was apparently set. There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American leaders threatened a general strike Tuesday,
calling on supporters to shut down the area. Several large
Cuban-owned businesses said they would close their doors, though
city officials said they did not expect widespread problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans are the largest ethnic group in Miami, with
800,000 in the county.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, chanting demonstrators had mingled with
camcorder-carrying spectators outside the Gonzalez house. Hundreds
gathered to sing and pray, leaving red roses, carnations and other
flowers woven into the chain-link fence surrounding the home. The
crowd dwindled to about 70 as night fell.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people gathered for an emotional Mass for Elian on
Sunday at Our Lady of Charity Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation cheered and wept as the Rev. Francisco Santana
spoke. Some waved Cuban flags and at one point, they sang the Cuban
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Caridad Gonzalez, Elian's great-aunt, was among a group of the
boy's relatives seated on the front row. When Santana beckoned her
to the front of the church, the congregation stood and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than ever, I feel proud to be Cuban,'' Santana said. ''We
are a noble community, we are a decent community.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vento, 45, stood outside the church during the service.
Vento said his father died in 1959, while fighting against Cuban
President Fidel Castro. Vento now believes Elian's saga marks the
end of the Castro's power.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is going to bring salvation to the Cubans from communism,''
Vento said. ''He is a chosen one. He will be the beginning and the
end for Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Vento also hopes the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, will
decide to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he defects,'' he said, ''Castro will be unmasked.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching television news reports that Elian had been
''snatched away,'' Garvin Harris used a plane ticket he won in a
raffle to board a flight from his home in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw that they were pointing guns and hitting people down,''
the 29-year-old restaurant owner said Sunday, standing at the
street where Elian had lived for five months. ''It's just an
overwhelming experience to see what's really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian are you OK?'' was scribbled in white on the back window
of a car allowed to pass through the street when police briefly
lifted barricades.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Little Havana were mostly calm Sunday, with
shards of glass, overturned benches and a few boarded-up storefront
windows marking the previous day's violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours after 6-year-old Elian was snatched away in a
pre-dawn raid by federal agents, the neighborhood rose up in
spontaneous protests. Demonstrators on Saturday started hundreds of
small fires, and riot police cracked down hard. More than 350 were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, traces of the anger remained. Two young women
carrying signs supporting Attorney General Janet Reno's order
clashed with protesters. ''Not here! Not here!'' the protesters
yelled, pulling one woman's hair as she was escorted away by
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   But with Elian gone, the tension of the past weeks was missing,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents circulated copies of the photograph of an
armed federal agent with his hand extended toward a crying Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Some versions replaced the faces of federal agents with those of
Reno, who gave the go-ahead for the raid, and Castro. A
poster-sized reproduction attached to the family's front door
included this label: ''Federal Child Abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Warrants Issued in L.A. Cop Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arrest warrants were issued for three police
officers Monday in the first criminal charges to arise from the Los
Angeles Police Department's corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sgts. Edward Ortiz and Brian Liddy and Officer Paul Harper were
expected to surrender at a police station, said Geoffrey Garfield,
a spokesman for the Police Protective League.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times, citing confidential sources, reported
that the three were being charged for allegedly framing a suspected
gang member on a weapons charge in April 1996. They must be charged
by Wednesday, when the statute of limitations expires.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 LAPD officers, including three sergeants, have been
relieved of duty in the wake of the corruption scandal. It began
last year when an officer convicted of stealing cocaine from an
evidence locker told investigators of cases in which officers with
the Rampart station near downtown framed, beat and shot innocent
people.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard Parks has criticized prosecutors for moving
too slowly to charge corrupt officers named in the investigation.
District Attorney Gil Garcetti has said he had to move slowly to
build stronger cases against the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, 43, Liddy, 38, and Harper, 33, will likely face charges
of perjury, falsifying an arrest report and conspiracy for
allegedly planting a gun on a man during a raid at a party thrown
by the 18th Street gang, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Allan Lobos, told investigators that ''Liddy told
him that he was going to jail for the gun and rubbed it up against
Lobos' fingers'' to mark them with fingerprints, court documents
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lobos pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a gun and
was sentenced to a year in jail and three years probation. His
conviction was among the 67 overturned since the investigation
began, but he remains in prison on a murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach the three officers by telephone Monday were
unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 263; Dow Off 35  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell more than 200
points today as investors anticipated a possible breakup of
Microsoft and a slowdown in personal computer sales that could
chill the entire technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 263.13 at 3,380.75, the lowest it's
been since the devastating selloff on April 14 that left the index
at 3,321.49.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 35.99 at 10,808.06,
having recovered from a 146-point plunge in the opening minutes of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broad-based Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 22.29 at
1,412.25.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 12 1/2 to 66 7/16, was the biggest decliner in
all three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the heaviest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
each of its 30 components equally.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said today the Justice Department and the 19 states that
successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are planning
to call for Microsoft to split off its Windows operating system
from the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft might then be split in two, with one
company handling applications software and the other the company's
Internet business, including browser software.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the government will suggest its proposed
remedies to a federal judge in Washington who has already ruled
that Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of slower computer sales weighed on the rest of the
technology group. Cisco Systems fell 4 13/16 to 60 5/16 and Intel
fell 2 1/8 to 113 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   But blue chip financial stocks attracted some buying interest,
lifting the Dow from its lows. American Express rose 4 3/4 to 147
3/4. This morning, the company reported earnings that surpassed
Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued buying into the reviving drug sector.
Warner-Lambert rose 3 3/4 to 117 3/16. Merck rose 1 3/8 to 71 1/8
after reporting first-quarter profits of 63 cents per share,
beating Wall Street forecasts by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that with technology stocks slipping, investors are
turning toward drug stocks as a less volatile growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Thomas McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of
America Securities, reduced his recommended weighting of stocks.
McManus shifted his portfolio from 80 percent stocks and 20 percent
bonds to 75 percent stocks and 25 percent bonds.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said he made the shift in anticipation of a rocky market
for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 683.47 million
shares, compared with 718.85 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, decliners led advancers by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 18.35 to
463.49.

<HEADLINE> White House Holds Easter Egg Roll  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton shook hands with an
adult-sized Easter bunny. Cameras and camcorders were rolling.
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton greeted tens of thousands of
children, scampering after eggs on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the president could command the attention of Colby
Veirs at the White House Monday for the 122nd Easter Egg roll. The
7-year-old from Bethesda, Md., was intent on wrapping a strand of
fake Easter basket grass around his forefinger -- so tightly that
his fingertip turned reddish-blue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, mom,'' he told Mary Claire Veirs, who glanced at his
finger and then hoisted his little brother, Hunter, up high enough
to see the president blow a whistle to officially begin the egg
roll.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they ready over there?'' Clinton asked, peering across the
lawn at the egg-rolling lanes. ''Wave your hand if you're ready.
All right. On you mark, get set ...''
</P>
<P>
   The White House egg roll, which attracted about 30,000 children
and members of their families, has been an American tradition since
the mid-19th century. The celebration took place on the Capitol
grounds until 1878 when it was moved to the White House by Lucy
Hayes, wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes. It's been held
annually, except during World War I and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Children, many in their Sunday finest, toted Easter Egg baskets.
Parents wore pink bunny ears. The White House dyed 7,200
hard-boiled eggs for the event. Another 2,500 eggs were cooked for
children to decorate.
</P>
<P>
   Reading was the theme of this year's egg roll, which was
cybercast on the Internet. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater
read ''The Little Engine That Could.'' Author J.K. Rowling read
from her Harry Potter children's book series.
</P>
<P>
   Across the lawn, children and parents mobbed Attorney General
Janet Reno, who spent long hours over the weekend directing the
reunification of Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, with his father.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether reading ''Voyage to the Bunny Planet'' was a
more joyful experience than mediating the Elian case, Reno
whispered: ''It is.'' But when pressed to comment further on the
case, Reno quietly replied, ''I'm just focusing on the kids right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, however, was on the minds of some of the parents crowded
around Reno as she autographed scores of Easter egg roll tickets
with a blue felt-tip pen. One woman, who approved of Reno's action
in the case, gave her a thumbs up. Laura Yates of Chesapeake, Va.,
told Reno: ''I admire your courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As Reno left, Lillian Wolf, a White House employee from Silver
Spring, Md., yelled: ''Good job, Janet. Don't let them fool you in
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Easter egg roll was not about the Elian case. It was
about Easter eggs and children.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Sauer of Herndon, Va., tried to coax her 3-year-old son,
Ian, to walk up to a lady wearing a giant egg suit. He got out of
his stroller and wandered away. The stroller tipped over.
Pastel-colored candies spilled into the manicured, green lawn. The
giant egg started to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Egg lady!'' she shouted to get her to wait.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly righted the stroller, retrieved Ian and snapped a
photo of her smiling son with the giant egg.

<HEADLINE> White House Blames Miami Relatives  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today blamed Elian Gonzalez's
Miami relatives for forcing the government into the armed seizure
of the boy, asserting that ''none of this had to happen'' if they
had respected the law and allowed him to be reunited with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also said it was proper for federal agents to
carry weapons when they stormed the house. ''There was information
that there might be guns in the house, out in the crowd,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., announced a ''preliminary inquiry'' by his committee staff
into Saturday's pre-dawn raid. The inquiry, which could wind up as
hearings, will look into whether the use of force ''was appropriate
or necessary,'' Hyde said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno will meet on Tuesday morning with
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to answer questions
about the raid, Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said. Lott also has
invited about a dozen other senators to the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton felt the raid was ''the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining,'' Lockhart said. ''All of this
could have been avoided. None of this had to happen. This happened
because the family did not respect the legal process here that
dictated the father should be reunited with the young boy.''
</P>
<P>
   En route to New York City with Clinton today, Lockhart ruled out
Clinton's meeting with Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
''That would be the last thing that would be in the boy's best
interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, Reno refused to second-guess the government's
actions. ''I have no regrets whatsoever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried my level best to make sure we avoided this situation
and if I bent over backward, so be it,'' she said on NBC's
''Today.'' ''I'm satisfied with the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin who looked after Elian while he
was in Miami, and the boy's two great-uncles left a Washington
hotel today ''to try to speak to whoever we have to speak to'' to
meet with Elian and his father. She said the Miami relatives pose
no risk to the father because ''we are in his territory now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed agents broke into the Miami home of the boy's relatives
early Saturday only after negotiations with the family there
produced mixed signals, Reno said. ''We were told we would have a
deal if we did certain things and we did it and it evaporated.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House accused Republicans -- in particular House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas -- of playing politics with the
case and making ''wildly inaccurate statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom DeLay went on television yesterday and said there was no
warrant in this case, that they didn't get a search warrant,''
Lockhart said. ''It's factually not true, and easily knowable, if
you're not trying to play politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government worked hard to make sure the young Cuban
refugee was reunited with his father in a peaceful and voluntary
way, Reno said. ''We tried and tried.'' In the end, ''We did what
we had to do and we now need to move forward and to give this
little boy and his father a chance to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend of Reno, Aaron Podhurst, was brought into the
negotiations with the Miami relatives Thursday and was on the phone
with the attorney general just before the raid was carried out. ''I
believe a deal was within minutes or an hour away,'' he told NBC.
''I was shocked, I was disappointed, I couldn't believe what I was
looking at on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Podhurst said he talked to Reno shortly afterward and told her
of his disappointment. ''She was as sad as I've ever seen her,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his father are staying at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington, where some of their Cuban relatives are
demanding a meeting. The custody battle that has made headlines
around the world is also getting renewed attention from members of
Congress while the family awaits the next court action on the case.
</P>
<P>
   But on Easter Sunday, the boy's father tried to create a
hometown aura at the Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   They shared a meal of black beans and rice, walked on the
grounds of the base with Elian's stepmother and half brother, even
got a visit from the base's Easter Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to re-establish a more normal routine, a less
tumultuous atmosphere,'' Gregory Craig, lawyer for Elian's father,
told The Associated Press on Sunday. ''The relatives have got to
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The little boy with the ready smile became a political, almost
religious, icon for the Cuban-American community over the last five
months. And when federal agents snatched him in the pre-dawn hours
Saturday, Miami's Little Havana erupted into near riots that
finally calmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his immediate family are considering
where to move while they await resolution of their appeal now
before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. But Craig said
they have not made a final decision. He said they will stay in this
country through the appeals, bound both by the father's word and
numerous legal restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Craig is still exploring the possibility of bringing some of
Elian's classmates and their parents to this country to wait with
the boy and his family. Craig said the request is still before the
State Department, which he said has been a bit more receptive to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a national CNN-Gallup poll taken after the seizure, nearly
six in 10 respondents supported the government's actions to reunite
Elian with his father. They were split on whether the government
used too much force.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton accused Giuliani of exploiting Elian case  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In her first comments since the federal raid
that reunited Elian Gonzalez with his father, Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Monday accused her Senate opponent of exploiting the
Cuban boy's situation.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has taken the Clinton
administration to task for sending armed officers before dawn
Saturday to seize the 6-year-old from his Miami relatives. The
Republican mayor compared the officers to ''storm troopers'' and
said he ''couldn't imagine that something like this could happen in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time that cried out for healing, the mayor chose to
exploit this situation by making divisive attacks on the United
States law enforcement officers,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   She did not say whether she approved or disapproved of the
tactics used, but she said she was ''relieved that Elian has been
reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary does not look at a 6-year-old boy as a political
opportunity,'' her campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said. ''It's a
shame that the mayor does.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had unsuccessfully tried to get Elian Gonzalez to join
him in Times Square on New Year's Eve to kick off the millennium
celebrations. He said Monday that the fact he was in politics
didn't mean he wasn't entitled to an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said the only links
between the boy and campaign cash were donations to the Clinton
campaign by the law firm representing Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor has made it clear to me he does not want the
campaign to politicize this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum also defended the mayor after a published analysis of
campaign finance reports showed the first lady received a greater
amount of itemized donations from New Yorkers during the first
three months of the year than Giuliani did.
</P>
<P>
   The Albany Times Union analysis found Clinton received 53
percent of her itemized donations of $200 or more during that
period from New Yorkers. Giuliani received 31 percent of those
donations from New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the analysis was fundamentally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's fund-raising effort early this year concentrated on
direct-mail appeals that tended to focus on non-New Yorkers, he
said. He also noted that an analysis of last year's fund raising by
the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics found 56
percent of Clinton's contributions came from outside New York,
while 44 percent of the mayor's donations did.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reflects the fact that Hillary has been extensively
traveling all across the state, running a positive campaign telling
New Yorkers what she would do in the Senate,'' Clinton spokesman
Wolfson said. ''Maybe if Rudy went upstate more he might get more
support up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the two began raising money for the race last year,
Giuliani has collected $19.3 million, while Clinton has raised
$12.8 million. Experts believe it will become the most expensive
Senate race in U.S. history.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Studies Open Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court appeared close to scuttling
''blanket primary'' systems in which three states let voters cast
their ballots for any candidate regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices were warned Monday that protecting political
parties' rights with a ban on such crossover voting will endanger
the open primaries in about half the states. Those states let
voters choose which party's primary they want to cast ballots in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The very essence of the party's right is to define its own
message and decide its own candidates,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said while criticizing California's blanket primaries that
are under attack from four political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia worried aloud about letting voters ''with
absolutely no commitment to a political party, not even for a day''
help nominate a party's general-election candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''What about the party that doesn't want to follow the crowd?''
he asked before warning of ''the tyranny of the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   George Waters, a lawyer representing the political parties,
argued that California's system is ''a wholesale assault'' on their
ability ''to choose a standard-bearer who best represents their
views.'' A blanket primary ''makes ideology irrelevant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Gede, California's lawyer, contended that a state's
primary election ''belongs to the voters,'' and not to the various
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision is expected by late June.
</P>
<P>
   Among the friend-of-the-court advice the justices received was a
pro-blanket primary brief from Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
relied heavily on Democrats and independents in his campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain got strong boosts from victories in New Hampshire and
Michigan, states with open primaries, but in California he finished
third behind Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   	   State primary laws fall into four major categories. At one end
of the spectrum is the closed primary, in which only registered
party members can participate in choosing a party's nominees. At
the other end are blanket primaries, which, for example, allow
voters to cast a ballot for a Republican candidate for governor, a
Democrat for Congress and a Libertarian for state attorney general.
California, Louisiana and Washington state have blanket primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In between are open primaries, in which voters are allowed to
choose on election day which party's primary they vote in. Such
voters get to select the nominees of one party only.
</P>
<P>
   And in a fourth variation, some states permit newly registered
and independent voters to participate in the primary of their
choice. States that have modified their closed primary systems in
that way include Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Rhode Island, the court was
told in written briefs.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by O'Connor whether invalidating California's blanket
primary would cast doubt on other states' open primaries, Waters
said a constitutional distinction could be made between the two
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Gede disagreed, saying striking down California's system
''would jeopardize open primaries all over the country.'' He warned
against ''the slippery slope of total party autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gede was peppered by questions and critical comments from
O'Connor and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, both of whom often cast
key votes in close cases.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also sounded
doubtful about California's system. Justice Clarence Thomas, who
did not speak during the hour-long argument session, most often
sides with them.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens
and Stephen G. Breyer seemed more sympathetic to California's
effort -- a 1996 ballot initiative overwhelmingly approved by the
state's voters -- to encourage nomination of more moderate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gede said the blanket primary has resulted in greater
participation among the states' 15 million registered voters, and
has allowed 1.5 million independent voters to participate in the
primary process.
</P>
<P>
   The system was challenged by the state's Democratic and
Republican parties, along with the Libertarian Party and the Peace
and Freedom Party. They lost in lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision could cloud Louisiana elections scheduled
for later this year. The state's open primary for local elections
will be Oct. 7. The congressional open primary will be Nov. 7,
along with the presidential election. Runoffs, where necessary in
congressional races, will be held Dec. 9.

<HEADLINE> $100M Given To African Universities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four U.S. foundations announced Monday that they
are giving more than $100 million to support higher education in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Partnership to Strengthen African Universities is a
collaboration of the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller, Ford
and MacArthur foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 million will be given out over the next five years. The
goal is to stimulate development in Africa by educating the next
generation of potential leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the challenges facing African countries are daunting,
Africans determined to address them are increasingly focused on the
crucial tasks of strengthening their universities,'' said Vartan
Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the grants, the universities must be in a
country undergoing systemic public policy reform, be focused on new
technologies and have creative institutional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Grants already have been made to some schools, including
Makerere University in Uganda, the University of Dar es Salaam in
Tanzania, and Mozambique's Eduardo Mondlane University.

<HEADLINE> Pope Goes on Vacation  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- After a stamina-taxing round of Holy Week
appearances, Pope John Paul II is giving himself a little vacation
away from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The pope departed by helicopter late Monday afternoon for the
papal summer retreat in the lakeside town of Castel Gandolfo, in
the Alban Hills southeast of Rome. The Vatican said John Paul will
stay there until Wednesday, when he is to return by helicopter to
Vatican City for his regularly scheduled audience with the public.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, it will be back to the hills for two more
days of rest before the frail and ailing pope returns to the
Vatican and his heavy workload.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday includes a packed schedule of private audiences, and on
Sunday, tens of thousands of Poles and other pilgrims are expected
at the Vatican to see the pope raise a Polish nun, Faustina
Kowalska, to sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who turns 80 in May, didn't linger long on Sunday
when he appeared at his studio window to bless a cheering crowd of
tens of thousands gathered below in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   His speech urged people, in the light of Easter, to ''look with
new eyes and hearts at every event of our existence.'' His voice
sounded tired. At one point he stumbled over a word and skipped an
entire paragraph of his brief text.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul loves to banter with crowds. But this time he seemed
impatient to leave the window. He kept his left hand gripped
tightly on the lectern. The hand and his head suffer from frequent
tremors, and his speech is often slurred -- all characteristics of
Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Difficulty in walking since hip surgery a few years ago
compounds the pope's physical problems, and public appearances
leading up to Easter Sunday sorely tested his stamina.
</P>
<P>
   On Good Friday night, he used a cane to walk slowly for a
half-mile during a procession, with frequent pauses for prayer. And
on Easter morning, the pope made a nearly two-hour appearance in
the square after only a few hours rest following a Saturday night
vigil service, also outdoors.

<HEADLINE> Kesey Gets On The Bus With Movie  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANT HILL, Ore. (AP) -- For Ken Kesey, digital technology has
made it possible to finish what LSD started back in the psychedelic
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a cluttered motel-room-turned-studio near his Oregon
farm, the author and an old friend, Ken Babbs, have just completed
the first installment of a movie from their 1964 LSD-fueled bus
trip across America -- the trip immortalized in Tom Wolfe's book
''Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesey, best known for his novel ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest,'' had always intended to come out of the bus trip with a
movie, ''Intrepid Traveler and his Merry Band of Pranksters Look
for a Kool Place.'' Despite recruiting a Hollywood film editor,
however, he could never get the audio in sync with the pictures.
Powered off the bus generator, the tape recorder had speeded up and
slowed down when the bus did.
</P>
<P>
   ''It finally just broke our back,'' said Kesey, now 64.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Babbs' son, Simon, and Kesey's son, Zane, transferred the film
and the audiotape to a digital editing rig. With modern software
and a turn of a knob, the sound and pictures came together. Like
Frankenstein's monster, ''Kool Place'' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people ask what my best work is, it's the bus,'' Kesey
said. ''Those books made it possible for the bus to become.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesey had used the profits from ''Cuckoo's Nest'' to buy the old
school bus and take his friends -- known as the Merry Pranksters --
to New York for the World's Fair and a party for his second novel,
''Sometimes a Great Notion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trip soon turned into more, for them and in the public
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Kesey, who had tasted LSD in government trials, wanted to share
it with the masses. A pitcher of LSD-laced orange juice was a
staple of the bus refrigerator. The Pranksters put on LSD parties
known as Acid Tests. (The drug was legal then; by 1968, half the
states had criminalized it.)
</P>
<P>
   The bus, nicknamed Furthur and painted in psychedelic colors,
became a counterculture icon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought you ought to be living your art, rather than
stepping back and describing it,'' Kesey said. The bus is ''a
metaphor that's instantly comprehensible. Every kid understands it.
It's like John Ford's 'Stagecoach' with John Wayne in the driver's
seat just like Cowboy Neal.''
</P>
<P>
   Episode one scopes in on Neal Cassady, the wheelman from Jack
Kerouac's ''On the Road,'' who piloted the bus while turning out a
stream of rhythmic rap-babble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's what keeps this from just being 'what I did on my summer
vacation,''' Kesey said. ''We are keepers of the flame of
Cassady.''
</P>
<P>
   The Proust-quoting Cassady, who had only a ninth-grade
education, was a bridge between the Beats and the hippies. He died
along a Mexican railroad track in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Kesey said his cinematic inspirations are Bergman and Fellini,
but ''Kool Place'' is more like home movies -- complete with Kesey
stepping in front of the projector to inject comments.
</P>
<P>
   The story would be unclear without Wolfe's book. But the images
create an intimacy that makes the characters seem forever young, at
a time when gas cost 28 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Episode one opens with an older Kesey and Babbs in lab coats,
finding a key to a vault.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared,'' Kesey says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't blame you,'' says Babbs.
</P>
<P>
   They open the vault and take out the films. The flick of a
switch starts the clickety whirr of a projector.
</P>
<P>
   In California oilfields, a highway patrolman pulls them over but
never suspects these college kids dressed like Tommy Hilfiger are
packing LSD and marijuana. In Arizona, the bus gets bogged down in
the sand by a river.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to take some LSD,'' Kesey says. ''Babbs could take
some. Cassady, you want to take some?''
</P>
<P>
   Cassady whispers, ''I would, yes, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman on her first acid trip swims in an algae-filled pool.
Dogs and horses run by. Cassady returns with a farmer who pulls
them to solid ground with a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Kesey visits pal Larry McMurtry, and the Pranksters
lose one of their number to a bad trip. In New Orleans, they jam
with a piano player in a bar and get thrown out of a blacks-only
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kesey is offering the film in video episodes -- there might be 10
-- in signed psychedelic boxes painted by him and Babbs on the motel
bathroom's floor and sold on his Web site, Intrepidtrips.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the people who planted the seeds,'' Kesey said recently.
''Whether it's artistically valid or not, we have to cultivate the
crop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You compost it long enough and stuff will grow out of it,''
said Babbs, a Vietnam helicopter pilot and longtime Prankster.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Gitlin, a New York University professor and author of ''The
Sixties,'' said the film won't add much to the historical record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kesey was a force, and the bus trip, thanks to Tom Wolfe, took
on mythic proportions,'' Gitlin said. As for the movie: ''I would
watch it if it was stuck in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron Kipnis, a professor of clinical psychology at Pacific
Graduate Institute who says the Pranksters turned him on at an Acid
Test, said he is eager to check in with them again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say whether it was the substance or the people, the
environment or the time, but it moved me from being a street punk
to being a spiritual seeker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of publishing words,'' he said, Kesey ''published a
way of being in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Over White House E-mail  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray has issued a
grand jury subpoena to the National Archives to determine whether
White House officials tried to obstruct investigations ranging from
Whitewater to Monica Lewinsky by not turning over e-mail, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The move injects Ray into the latest Clinton administration
controversy when his office is trying to wrap up a six-year
investigation and decide whether the president should be indicted
when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office issued the subpoena last Tuesday to the archives,
the government's official recordkeeper, which has advised the White
House on archiving its electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office also is conducting interviews
of witnesses in the e-mail controversy jointly with the Justice
Department's campaign fund-raising task force, government officials
told The Associated Press today.
</P>
<P>
   Both investigative agencies are trying to determine why the
White House failed to review thousands of e-mails to see if they
were responsive to subpoenas issued in various
Clinton-administration investigations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has blamed a computer glitch and says there was
no effort to hide the e-mail from investigators. It acknowledges,
however, that two top officials knew about the problem as early as
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The archives says it will comply with Ray's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Archives received a grand jury subpoena from the
independent counsel relating to recordkeeping practices in the
executive office of the president and intends to comply as
required,'' archives spokeswoman Susan Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the National
Archives advises White House employees about managing presidential
records but does not take full custody of such records until a
president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials outside the prosecutor's office who are
familiar with Ray's subpoena said it sought records that might shed
light on which administration officials knew about the missing
e-mail, when they knew it and whether any of them were relevant to
investigations under Ray's jurisdiction such as Whitewater, the
White House travel office firings and the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Neille Mallon Russell, a spokeswoman for Ray's office, declined
comment on the subpoena. Ray succeeded former Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr last year.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say it may take months to review the
problem and determine if e-mail can be retrieved for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to work hard to reconstruct and search the backup
tapes and produce any relevant information,'' White House spokesman
Jim Kennedy said today. ''But I don't have immediate comment on
that subpoena. We've been very clear about the fact that we are
cooperating fully with Congress and others who have an interest in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials for Vice President Al Gore, who is joining
Clinton in New York for a fund-raiser, referred inquiries to the
White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ray, the Justice Department task force on
fund-raising abuses and the House Government Reform Committee are
investigating the missing e-mail. The task force and Ray's office
are conducting some of the interviews jointly for efficiency's
sake, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the electronic messages were not stored properly, they
were not reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they
should be turned over to various investigators who requested or
subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Beth Nolan has told the House committee that
as early as 1998, when several of the investigations were still
active, both then-White House deputy chief of staff John Podesta
and then-White House Counsel Charles Ruff were informed about the
e-mail problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolan said there was a ''disconnect'' inside the White House
in which technical experts understood the magnitude of the problem
but presidential lawyers did not suspect it affected ongoing
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At least two White House contractors have told Congress they
were threatened not to divulge the e-mail problem.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive will return to U.S. to serve sentence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who fled a prison work camp and
lived in Canada for 30 years will return to the United States to
finish his sentence for selling $20 worth of LSD in college.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Richardson, who owns a $700,000 home and is on leave from
an engineering technician job at a University of British
Columbia-affiliated research center, was ordered out of Canada last
year. He and his wife, who has breast cancer, had fought the order
and Richardson was seeking refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing with the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board was
scheduled for Tuesday but Richardson asked that the hearing be
canceled, his lawyer, Michael Bolton, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has decided that he wants to have some finality to his
plight so he intends to return voluntarily to Rochester,'' Bolton
said. ''Obviously we're hopeful that (U.S. authorities) will see
fit to house him in a reasonable place where he's not in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 50, changed his name from Christopher Perlstein
after he escaped from a New York state work camp near the Canadian
border in 1971. He had been convicted of selling $20 worth of LSD
out of his dormitory room at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He was initially sent to Attica, a maximum-security prison
outside Buffalo, to serve his four-year sentence, but was
transferred to the work camp. Richardson, who has argued that his
sentence was too harsh, said he feared he would be sent back to
Attica, where 43 people were killed in a prison revolt weeks before
his escape.
</P>
<P>
   He fled having served three months of his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who had no criminal record before the 1971 arrest,
was turned in by someone who tipped off U.S. authorities in 1998
about his true identity. He will return to Rochester on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian immigration officials said Richardson will receive a
minister's permit that will allow him to move back to Canada
following his sentence. His wife will stay in Vancouver, close to
her cancer treatment, according to Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   While Richardson could be locked up for more than two years,
Monroe County District Attorney Howard Relin said he will probably
be eligible for parole after six or seven months.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Sets Up Defense Line  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Two columns of Sri Lankan soldiers
backed by air cover set up a new defense line Monday to protect
Jaffna city from Tamil Tiger rebels trying to recapture their
stronghold, military officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels opened the way last week for an advance on Jaffna,
which they have been trying to retake since November, by capturing
the strategic Elephant Pass, a highway that connects the Jaffna
peninsula to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Army chief Lt. Gen. Srilal Weerasooriya told a news conference
in the capital, Colombo, that soldiers withdrew from the Elephant
Pass only to ensure that they defend Jaffna better.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-opposition newspaper, The Island, called the
military retreat a ''national disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the military euphemisms that were used -- tactical
withdrawal, readjustment of lines -- one of the strongest military
bastions in the north, the gateway to Jaffna Peninsula from the
mainland, has been abandoned,'' the newspaper said in a front-page
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna was the rebels' base for most of the 17 years that they
have been fighting Sri Lankan forces to carve out Eelam, a homeland
for the nation's minority Tamils. The war has left 62,000 people
dead so far.
</P>
<P>
   The army took the city in December 1995, and in the past six
months fierce fighting has raged in the area. Some 40,000 soldiers
are in Jaffna, a city of half a million people. The military relies
on the single airport in Jaffna for its operations. Although Jaffna
can be accessed by the sea, the military could easily be targeted
by rebel artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Two columns of soldiers were massed 12 miles southeast of the
city to prevent the rebels from advancing further north -- and
possibly bringing the airport into rebel artillery range.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone links to Jaffna were cut off by the military last week
to prevent the rebels from contacting their fighters who may be
hiding in the city.
</P>
<P>
   No fighting was reported immediately in the area, but the rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, also massed their
cadres along the causeway.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized a large amount of arms and ammunition and
battle tanks from a base that soldiers abandoned while fleeing
during the weekend during the fall of the Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said soldiers took most of the weapons and
ammunition with them and that the few heavy weapons left behind
were made inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Voice of Tigers, the clandestine rebel radio, said the
guerrillas captured tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery
guns and 10 million rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to have captured military battle tanks
in the past, but the latest seizure could enhance their firepower,
which had been depleted in recent fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim they killed more than 1,000 soldiers in last
week's fighting, while the army said it had lost only 88 troops and
had killed at least 150 rebels. Independent confirmation of the
conflicting claims was not possible as reporters are not allowed
into the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which has been censoring all local news reports
on the war since November, criticized the Western news media on
Monday for publishing rebel claims on government casualties.
Western news organizations operating in Sri Lanka are not subject
to the prepublication censorship.

<HEADLINE> UPS Sues Canada Over Postal System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service is suing Canada, alleging
that the country's postal service has been allowed to use its mail
monopoly to expand into the courier business and compete unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, called a statement of claim under the North
American Free Trade Agreement, accuses the government of allowing
Canada Post Corp. to use the infrastructure built for letter
delivery for its courier products.
</P>
<P>
   It seeks an ''absolute bare minimum'' of $160 million in damages
starting in 1997, said Susan Webb, a spokeswoman for UPS Canada,
based in Mississauga, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss amount is ''a bit of a loose figure,'' Webb said of
damages UPS feels it has sustained from lost market share. UPS
filed the suit last week with the Justice Department in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint names Canada as the defendant because
Atlanta-based UPS claims the government violated NAFTA terms
concerning investments and monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   The claim also says Canada Post doesn't have to collect or pay
taxes on packages it imports to Canada, unlike other courier
companies that operate there.
</P>
<P>
   UPS also says that the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency pays
Canada Post several million dollars each year based on package
import volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Canada Post observed the Easter holiday Monday and a company
official in Montreal said she was not immediately able to find
someone to comment on the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government owns Canada Post, which was formed in
1982. Canada Post also owns 96 percent of Purolator Courier, the
largest express delivery service in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A three-person panel, expected to be formed later this year,
will decide the issue under terms outlined in NAFTA, Webb said. The
panel is not expected to issue its ruling until next year.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Gov't OK on Elian Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early evidence on public opinion indicates a
majority of Americans feel the government had done all it could to
settle the Elian Gonzalez situation without resorting to force.
</P>
<P>
   But opinion was about evenly split on the tactics of the raid on
the Miami home to return the 6-year-old Cuban boy to his father,
according to three polls taken soon after the Saturday morning raid
by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   A majority agreed in polls by CBS News, NBC News and CNN-Gallup
that the government had done all it could without using force to
return the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   More than half in the CBS poll, 56 percent, said federal
officials were only doing what was necessary to enforce the law,
while more than a third said too much force was used.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the marshals were doing what was necessary by a
2-1 margin, while Republicans were about evenly split on the
question of whether too much force was used.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight polls taken just after an event can measure the
public's initial reaction, but sometimes it can take days or weeks
for solid public opinion forms on complex questions like the
tactics used in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic tug of war over the boy's future has clearly
captured the public's interest, with eight in 10 in the CBS poll
taken Sunday of 577 adults saying they were following the case at
least somewhat closely.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS poll, as well as polls by NBC News and CNN-Gallup showed
strong support for the boy being with his father, with two-thirds
to three-fourths taking that position. A majority has taken that
view in polls in recent months. The error margin on the new polls
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Just over six of 10 in an NBC News poll of 680 people taken
Sunday said they thought congressional hearings were not needed to
examine the case of the Cuban boy, while three in 10 said they were
needed.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Settles Redlining Case  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Nationwide Insurance settled one of the
nation's largest housing discrimination cases by agreeing to pay a
fair-housing group $17.5 million and improve service to minority
and inner-city customers.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement between the Columbus, Ohio-based insurer and
Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Richmond was reached Wednesday,
one day before the Virginia Supreme Court was scheduled to rehear
the case against Nationwide. The terms of the settlement were
disclosed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is nice, no question about that, but HOME doesn't go
into these cases for that. We go into it for change, and that's
what we got and that's worth gold,'' said Constance Chamberlin,
HOME executive director.
</P>
<P>
   HOME accused Nationwide of denying coverage to applicants in
black neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a Richmond jury ordered Nationwide to pay HOME $100
million, the biggest verdict ever in a fair-housing case. In
January, the Virginia Supreme Court threw out the verdict on
grounds that HOME lacked standing to sue. But the high court agreed
in March to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide did not admit to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this agreement does is looks toward the future,'' said
Galen Barnes, who became the company's president and chief
operating officer a year ago, ''to reaching more urban markets and
adding more policyholders, particularly in the African-American,
Latino and other minority communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide has set up 19 urban offices across the country,
including one in Richmond, and plans 11 more to improve its
marketing to minorities.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 161; Dow Up 62  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq fell sharply Monday as an already
skittish market was unnerved by reports that the Justice Department
was leaning toward asking a federal judge to break up Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed down 161.24 at 3,482.64,
according to preliminary calculations, although it did recover from
a loss of more than 298 points late in the session. Its decline
came largely on a big drop in Microsoft's price.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.05 to 10,906.10, having
recovered from an early drop of 146 points.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock was down more than $12 at the $66 a share
level.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's antitrust battles, which resulted in a federal
judge's April 3 ruling against the company, have already sent the
market into a tailspin. Monday's report in The Washington Post and
USA Today said a Justice Department plan being shared with states
and industry executives envisions Microsoft being split into two or
three separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said nervousness about first-quarter earnings
reports also hurt stocks. Many big companies are announcing their
results this week.

<HEADLINE> Excitement That Cuban Boy May Return  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Elian Gonzalez's hometown, excitement
is building at the boy's possible return, but neighbors said Monday
his welcome will be subdued, if joyful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to treat him like any other child in this
country,'' said Reynaldo Sardinia, who lives around the corner from
the home where the 6-year-old grew up.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marcelo Salado school, where Elian's empty desk has been
turned into a sort of national shrine, director Maribel Reyes Casas
gathered the 900 students on Monday to tell them about the child's
reunion with his father, Juan Miguel, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She displayed a new photo of the child smiling with his father
in Washington, D.C., saying he seemed happier than when he was in
Miami with the great-uncle fighting to keep the child in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are not the eyes we have seen during these five
months,'' she said, speaking in the schoolyard decorated with a
painted portrait of the boy. ''I have always paid attention to the
eyes of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 blocks away, neighbors chatting on the sidewalk near
the Gonzalez home were still excited about Saturday's federal raid
on the Miami house and said they were eager for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. government took a big step forward that was very
beautiful,'' said Giralda Diaz Milian, 71, who lives a few houses
away from Elian's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Reno,'' added Milta Estevez, 65, one of a half dozen
neighbors who appeared on the streetcorner to talk excitedly about
the boy, referring to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the raid was broadcast Saturday morning, neighors
said they rushed into the street to tell their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''One comrade was so excited she went out in her underwear,''
said Diaz, grinning at her friend Lilia Rosa Ojeda, who covered her
head with an arm in mock embarassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so happy I ran from the bed,'' Ojeda said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Estevez said she was among several neighbors who ran to the
two-story concrete house of Elian's grandfather for one of Juan
Miguel's calls home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boy sent kisses to the whole neighborhood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy seemed happy, said Gustavo Fernandez, who was staying in
the house during the family's trips to Havana, 70 miles to the
west, and who spoke with the child and his father on Saturday.
''This is our Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro has urged Cubans to take a low-key
approach to the boy's return, saying he does not want to continue
the five-month media frenzy of his time in Miami or give ammunition
to those who claim he is exploiting the child.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say they will go along. ''There won't be
festivities,'' Diaz said. ''But we are going to welcome him.''
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed anger at claims by anti-Castro activists in
Miami that the boy should not return because children are allegedly
brainwashed and mistreated in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no misery in Miami?'' asked Estevez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel happy living here in Cuba,'' insisted Ojeda. ''Here!
Here! Here there is freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any fears that if my chiildren are in the
streets, they will be pushed into drug addiction,'' said Migdalini
Curbelo, a 28-year-old mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon, who has coordinated Cuba's
efforts for return of the shipwreck victim, said Saturday he has
offered Juan Miguel -- a cashier at a recreation park -- a job in
Havana as adviser to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors said they were sure the father and son would come
home to Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will return here with the family,'' Diaz insisted.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Won't Take No From NASA  </HEADLINE>
By MARCIA DUNN, AP Aerospace Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis' pilot, Scott
Horowitz, was in junior high school when he started nagging NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be an astronaut,'' he said in repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Once Horowitz was old enough, it took him seven tries, he
thinks. Actually, he's lost count. But he finally made it into the
astronaut corps, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just bugged them long enough, they gave up and hired me,''
he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz, an Air Force officer, isn't the only tenacious fellow
on Atlantis' upcoming service call on the international space
station. Of the six Americans scheduled to rocket away aboard
Atlantis, four -- the four military men -- applied several times
each.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was postponed today because of strong wind, and NASA
hoped to try again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat contenders are actually rather common in NASA's
137-member astronaut corps, says Duane Ross, manager of the
astronaut selection office.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,015 people who applied for the soon-to-be-announced
Class of 2000, more than half of the names ''had been in the hopper
a while,'' Ross says.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 will make the cut. Competition, consequently, is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   Ross encourages those who don't make it to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tell them, absolutely, persistence is a good thing --
provided it's tempered with a little judgment,'' Ross says. Every
so often, ''we have folks whom we hear from more often than we
probably need to. You might wonder about a person's judgment, how
they deal with situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis astronaut Jeffrey Williams, who will be making his
first space flight, says he didn't take rejection personally when
he first applied to be an astronaut. Or the second, third, fourth
and fifth time he applied. He got in on try No. 6, in 1996, after
10 long years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that if I continued to aspire to do this, the biggest
thing I had going against me is not applying. So I just kept
throwing in an application,'' says Williams, an Army officer.
</P>
<P>
   Adds James Voss, a recently retired Army colonel assigned to
Atlantis' mission: ''I was six times over nine years applying.
These Army guys are persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis' commander, Air Force Col. James Halsell Jr., applied
for every astronaut class from 1978 to 1990. That's when he finally
made it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Atlantis' three other crew members, one is a veteran
Russian cosmonaut. That leaves Air Force Col. Susan Helms and
civilian scientist Mary Ellen Weber.
</P>
<P>
   The two women got in on the first shot, a point not lost on
their crewmates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rub it in,'' Horowitz teased Weber when she acknowledged it
took her a single try. ''Some people are naturals. Some of us had
to work a little harder. That's kind of the way I do everything,
isn't it? Force method.''

<HEADLINE> Congressman Blames UN and Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saddam Hussein's government and the United
Nations share the blame for not getting enough humanitarian aid to
Iraqis suffering from malnutrition and disease, a congressman said
Monday after returning from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, spent last week examining hospitals,
schools, pharmacies and other facilities that serve Iraqi
civilians. Among his goals was to gauge the accuracy of reports
that thousands of Iraq's children are starving.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the reports estimating that more than 25 percent of
Iraq's children are underweight and a tenth are wasting away from
hunger and disease are correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the children between 1 and 6 are malnourished,'' Hall
told reporters at a news conference. ''I've seen malnourished
children in many lands and I know what I'm looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has spent more than 20 years on hunger-fighting projects in
such countries as Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and North Korea. He was
escorted in Iraq by representatives from the Red Cross, Red
Crescent and UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990. They can be lifted only if Iraq proves to the United Nations
that it has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction and
dismantled the capability to manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has placed spare parts and other possible
''dual-use'' items on hold out of fears Saddam Hussein could use
them to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said those items include chlorine for water purification
and spare parts for refrigerators and air conditioners. ''You have
to have those sorts of things, especially for the polio vaccine,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical workers fighting polio complained about the difficulty
of keeping vaccine cold during transit over long distances in the
desert and about the need for cleaner water in the wake of cholera
outbreaks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iraq has turned away humanitarian aid, including an
offer of help from Canada to the Iraqi branch of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Iraq needs to cooperate, too,'' Hall said.
''Oftentimes the government gets in the way ... there's lots of
blame to be spread around.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Iraq drop some of the roadblocks it has
erected to the speedy receipt of aid. He also said the United
Nations should adopt procedures that would enable approved items
such as food and medicine to move quicker by severing them from
anything in the same shipment found to be questionable or a ''dual
use'' item.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested an independent body begin a scientific study
of Iraq's high cancer rates. Such a study, Hall said, could create
some common ground with the Iraqis and ''yield health benefits for
American veterans of the Gulf War as well as Iraqi civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he found himself the target of anti-sanctions lobbying
and propaganda throughout his trip. At one hospital, he was taken
to a ward where two patients shared each bed while a relief worker
who veered down another corridor found empty beds.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to exaggerate already bleak conditions ''became
tiring, became frustrating,'' the congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts also weren't successful. Hall left Iraq convinced
the international community can do more for suffering Iraqis but
said sanctions should not be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United Nations Security Council said it would set
up a special working group to recommend ways of making sanctions
''smarter'' so necessary aid reaches needy citizens.

<HEADLINE> Serb Families Protest Over Prisons  </HEADLINE>
By CVJETKO UDOVICIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Relatives of 37 Serbs
jailed by NATO protested outside a prison Monday, demanding that
trials be held immediately for their family members.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisoned Serbs went on a hunger strike April 12,
protesting what they claim was ''unbalanced prisoner treatment'' at
the hands of Western officials. About 100 of their relatives
complained about the prisoners being held indefinitely with little
or no prospect of court action.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners reportedly began refusing food after hearing an
ethnic Albanian prisoner had been released earlier in April. The
man was implicated in a grenade-hurling incident that triggered a
fiery battle between Serbs and Albanians in March, leaving 16
French peacekeepers and 24 civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Three Serb doctors from Kosovo examined the hunger strikers
Monday and warned that some of the prisoners displayed symptoms of
extreme exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the hunger strikers were hospitalized Saturday in
connection with their fast, said Ivan Soyois, a spokesman for U.N
police. He confirmed Serb doctors had visited the prisoners Monday
but gave no further information on their condition.
</P>
<P>
   One prisoner was in critical condition, according to Serb Dr.
Stevan Baljosevic. Soyois confirmed the man was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Loy, another U.N. police spokesman, said Sunday that
prisoners were eating biscuits and drinking coffee, tea and juice
brought by their families.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is in Kosovska Mitrovica, one of Kosovo's most tense
cities. It is divided by the Ibar River into the predominantly Serb
north and the ethnic Albanian south.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, NATO peacekeepers destroyed weapons and ammunition
that had been confiscated or handed in to peacekeepers since NATO
forces arrived here in June. In the meltdown, some 13,000 rifles,
2,500 pistols, 500 anti-tank missiles, 30,000 explosive devices and
7.5 million rounds of ammunition will be turned into scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of tension over the weekend. Four bodies
were found in a well in western Kosovo Sunday and NATO-led
peacekeepers were investigating. On Saturday, a man was
hospitalized with a gunshot wound in the volatile Presevo Valley.
No further information was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials supervising Kosovo have repeatedly expressed
concerns about rising tensions in the Presevo Valley, the region
along Kosovo's boundary with Serbia proper that has a predominantly
ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The region lies just outside the territory involved in the
NATO-led peacekeeping mission, which came to Kosovo in June after
the 78-day NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. The campaign
was aimed at forcing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end
repression against ethnic Albanians in the province.

<HEADLINE> American Air Pilot Talks Break Down  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Talks aimed at extending American Airlines'
contract with its pilots have broken down over a plan to increase
the number of smaller regional jets.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown in talks represents a setback in the stated goal
of the airline and the union to improve relations after a bitter
conflict last year that culminated in a sickout by pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the airline and the Allied Pilots Association
agreed to a judge's recommendation to enter mediation on extending
the pilots' contract, which is due for renegotiation on Aug. 31,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed to extend an original March 31 deadline, but
talks broke off late last week, according to union spokesman Gregg
Overman.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents American's 10,000 pilots, objected
to plans by American's sister airline, American Eagle, to add new
70-seat regional jets next year. American Eagle pilots are
represented by a different union.
</P>
<P>
   Overman said the additional jets would violate a contract
provision that limits American Eagle to 67 regional jets that carry
45 to 70 passengers. An airline spokeswoman said American Eagle has
ordered 17 new jets next year, which would give it the maximum 67,
and eight in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone message to pilots, union president Rich LaVoy said
the union was steadfast in demanding that any jets with 51 or more
seats be flown by American pilots, not those from American Eagle.
He also said the union and airline couldn't agree on pay increases
and an airline proposal to cap its contributions to the retiree
medical plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Management decided that the difficulty of the issues and our
different perspective on those issues was not likely to lead to an
agreement,'' LaVoy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're disappointed we didn't reach agreement in the time frame
established, but we're encouraged with the progress in establishing
a better working relationship with the APA,'' said American
spokeswoman Karen Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the airline has offered to begin next year's talks
early. Customarily the two sides begin talking 60 days before the
end of a contract. The pilots went on strike briefly in 1997 before
the current contact was ratified.
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging over the union's head is a $45.5 million fine
imposed by a federal judge after the sickout in February 1999,
which the airline said cost it $225 million. Pilots were protesting
American's integration of pilots from a small regional carrier,
Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any connection between the fine -- which the union is
appealing -- and the contract talks, Overman said the union never
asked the airline to drop the fine in exchange for labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been a happy chapter between APA and the airline,''
Overman said. ''For that (fine) to go away would probably serve to
improve the relationship. But it's purely speculative as to whether
it would have been part of any deal.''

<HEADLINE> Babbitt May Back More Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt indicated
Monday he is on the verge of recommending President Clinton declare
new national monuments in Colorado and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of canyons dotted with American Indian ruins in
southwestern Colorado and the ecologically diverse Soda Mountain
near the Oregon-California line are ''ripe for consideration'' to
become the fifth and sixth monuments created by Clinton this year,
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The areas are unique and should be protected from mining and
overuse by off-road vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1906 Antiquities Act gives presidents broad power to create
monuments and decide what uses should be restricted. Clinton has
created two new monuments each in California and Arizona this year,
prohibiting mining and logging in sequoia groves, the Grand Canyon
watershed, an arid mountain valley and hundreds of small islands in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also may declare areas monuments. Republicans say
Clinton is circumventing the review process and ignoring the wishes
of local residents by unilaterally making the declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about the environment. It is about the constant
abuse of power by the Clinton-Gore administration,'' said Rep.
George Radanovich, R-Calif. and chairman of the House Western
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Kupillas, a county commissioner who lives near Soda
Mountain, questioned whether monument designation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could eliminate all of the multiple uses -- grazing, timber
harvest, recreational vehicles -- anything but hiking,'' she said.
''If this area is so valuable today, and we've had multiple use all
these years, why should we change it now?''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has discussed recommending the Colorado and Oregon
monuments before, and they are now ''at the top of the list'' as
the Clinton administration works to fill out its environmental
legacy, he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt would not say precisely when he would ask Clinton to
declare the new monuments.
</P>
<P>
   He discussed the monument recommendations in an interview in
Washington before leaving for his hometown of Flagstaff, Ariz., to
renew his criticism of the 1872 law governing mining on federal
land.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt plans to visit a pumice mine on the flanks of the San
Francisco Peaks to criticize the law, which allows companies to buy
mining land for as little as $2.50 an acre and does not require
them to pay royalties to the government. He called the mine, which
produces rock used in stonewashing blue jeans, ''a poster child for
the abuses'' of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases the mines are key to the local economy and Babbitt
acknowledged Congress is unlikely to change the law in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed an industry-backed reform proposal in 1995,
saying it had too many loopholes.

<HEADLINE> Continental Fights Size Restriction  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines on Monday sued United
Airlines and the Washington Dulles International Airport's council
of airline managers, citing interference from new baggage-size
restrictors.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based carrier alleges that the plastic templates on
X-ray conveyor belts installed April 15 are anticompetitive,
forcing its customers to use carry-on baggage that adheres to a
rival's standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have invested millions of dollars in bigger (overhead) bins
and closets, and we want our customers to be able to use them,''
Continental spokeswoman Sarah Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier accuses United and the Airline Management Council at
Dulles of conspiring to limit competition by requiring all fliers
to conform to Chicago-based United's smaller limits.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Sheridan, chairman of the council composed of airline
managers at Dulles, countered that the templates were approved last
year in a democratic vote that included Continental, which was
among six carriers to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   A key component is the availability of ''medallions,'' or tokens
provided at each airline's desk that allow its passengers with
larger-sized carry-ons to bypass the template.
</P>
<P>
   ''A system was set up so there would be no unfair restrictions
against any single airline,'' Sheridan said from his office at the
northern Virginia airport.
</P>
<P>
   The medallion system is unacceptable to Continental, Anthony
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inconsistent and unfair because it is not done
everywhere,'' said Anthony, who referred to the medallions as
''secret'' tokens. ''How will customers know when to use it and
when not to use it? Why should you have to do it anyway? It's
totally ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions violate state and federal antitrust laws and
should be lifted immediately, Anthony added.
</P>
<P>
   United spokeswoman Susan Leyva said the baggage templates have
been popular among customers because they streamline the boarding
process and afford more storage room on their planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Templates are not a competitive issue, they are a customer
service imperative,'' Leyva said. ''Since we first introduced them
two years ago, several others also implemented baggage templates.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the others was Delta Air Lines, which was sued by
Continental when it installed templates in San Diego in November
1998. That dispute was resolved with a confidential, out-of-court
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are now no sizers in San Diego that impact our
customers,'' Anthony said.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Gov't Justified in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early evidence on public opinion indicates a
majority of Americans feel the government had done all it could to
settle the Elian Gonzalez situation without resorting to force.
</P>
<P>
   But opinion was about evenly split on the tactics of the raid on
the Miami home to return the 6-year-old Cuban boy to his father,
according to three polls taken soon after the Saturday morning raid
by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   A majority agreed in polls by CBS News, NBC News and CNN-Gallup
that the government had done all it could without using force to
return the boy to his father.
</P>
<P>
   More than half in the CBS poll, 56 percent, said federal
officials were only doing what was necessary to enforce the law,
while more than a third said too much force was used.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the marshals were doing what was necessary by a
2-1 margin, while Republicans were about evenly split on the
question of whether too much force was used.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight polls taken just after an event can measure the
public's initial reaction, but sometimes it can take days or weeks
for solid public opinion forms on complex questions like the
tactics used in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic tug of war over the boy's future has clearly
captured the public's interest, with eight in 10 in the CBS poll
taken Sunday of 577 adults saying they were following the case at
least somewhat closely.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS poll, as well as polls by NBC News and CNN-Gallup showed
strong support for the boy being with his father, with two-thirds
to three-fourths taking that position. A majority has taken that
view in polls in recent months. The error margin on the new polls
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Just over six of 10 in an NBC News poll of 680 people taken
Sunday said they thought congressional hearings were not needed to
examine the case of the Cuban boy, while three in 10 said they were
needed.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Military, Rebels To Meet  </HEADLINE>
By RODRIQUE NGOWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) -- Burundi's military will hold its
first talks with rebels in May to try to work out a formula to
restructure the country's armed forces and end a 6-year civil war,
an official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are being brokered by former South African President
Nelson Mandela and the face-to-face meeting between the sides will
take place in Johannesburg, said Mandela's chief aide, Mark Bomani.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations will bring together senior Burundi military
officials and Hutu rebel leaders from the Forces for the Defense of
Democracy and the National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting will deal with issues of reducing the size of the
country's military and integrating the armed groups into the
national army,'' Bomani told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Tutsis make up between 60-65 percent of Burundi's
60,000-70,000 strong military, Bomani said, and restructuring the
armed forces has been one of the most contentious points in
securing peace.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsis also dominate the country's politics and economy although
they make up about 14 percent of the population, with the majority
being Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela will make a one-day visit to meet with Burundi military
chiefs on April 28 to reassure members of the military worried
about losing their jobs in the anticipated demobilization.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in
fighting between the army and rebels from the Hutu majority since
civil conflict broke out in Burundi in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela took over as mediator in December from late Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere and has been trying to speed up the talks,
which have dragged on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere never invited the rebels to take part in the talks, but
Mandela met with representatives of the two main rebel groups, who
have said they are willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Five committees made up of 19 parties to the talks have been
meeting in Arusha to come up with a draft accord.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower in Quiet Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar slipped against other currencies in
light trading Monday as European markets were closed for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 93.98 cents, up
from 93.87 cents late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 105.69
Japanese yen, down from 105.87 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar initially dipped in New York on a stock slide
triggered by reports that the government may seek to split up
Microsoft, but the currency gained back some ground in the
afternoon as the Nasdaq composite index recouped some of its steep
losses and the Dow industrials closed with a gain on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders expect the euro may get a boost this week if the
European Central Bank raises short-term interest rates at its
regular meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6714 Swiss francs, down from
1.6741, and 1.4765 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4754. The British
pound rose to $1.5783 from $1.5778.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0807 German
marks, down from 2.0837; 6.9783 French francs, down from 6.9883;
and 2,059.85 Italian lire, down from 2,062.82.

<HEADLINE> MGM, Showtime Extend Pact  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MGM has expanded a licensing deal with
Showtime to air new feature films plus movies from the studio's
library on the premium-cable service's channels, the companies said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer could gain up to $1.4 billion from the
eight-year deal, according to industry sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity. That would mean a steady revenue stream to
help the studio rebound after a decade of annual losses.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 270 first-run films released by MGM and its United
Artists banner through 2008 will have exclusive premium-cable runs
on channels owned or operated by Showtime, including the Movie
Channel and Sundance Channel. That extends MGM's current first-run
deal with Showtime, which ran through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Based on MGM's anticipated output of 12 to 20 films a year, that
likely means all of the studio's movies through 2008 will be part
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime and Paramount, both owned by Viacom, have a similar
deal for new feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very important strategic goal for our company to have
locked up for a long time two major studio suppliers for films,''
said Matthew Duda, Showtime executive vice president of programming
acquisition and planning.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also allows Showtime to license up to 1,200 movies from
MGM's library of 4,100 titles, which includes the ''Rocky'' and
''Pink Panther'' series, many Woody Allen movies and the James Bond
flicks.
</P>
<P>
   Those library titles would be licensed to Showtime
non-exclusively over six years, allowing MGM to air them on its own
planned cable or satellite network or other TV outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've constructed this very carefully so we wouldn't step on
our own feet in terms of the broader cable-satellite area,'' said
MGM spokesman Craig Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Also under the deal, MGM and Showtime plan to produce three
original TV series, premiering in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Showtime
also is renewing MGM's ''Stargate SG-1'' for a fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   The studio plans to launch a cable or satellite channel ''as
soon as possible,'' using its large library as a cornerstone, said
Jim Griffiths, president of worldwide television distribution for
MGM. A definite launch date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Showtime deal means additional cash flow for us but in no
way impedes or puts any hindrance on us for MGM-owned or operated
networks,'' Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who owns about 90 percent
of MGM stock, last year installed new management including longtime
lieutenant Alex Yeminidjian as studio chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, management has bought or negotiated MGM out of
unfavorable licensing deals for its movie catalog, giving the
studio flexibility to plan its own TV service.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years of steady losses, MGM ended last year with two
profitable quarters, and analysts reporting for First Call/Thomson
Financial expect the company to post a small profit when
first-quarter earnings are released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, MGM continued to lose money in 1999, and analysts
predict a small loss again this year but a profit in 2001.

<HEADLINE> President Raises Cash for Convert  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton helped raise campaign cash for
a recent convert to the Democratic Party on Monday, and said
Republicans hope they can manipulate a sleepy, inattentive public.
</P>
<P>
   In a variation on a theme he repeats often, Clinton said there
are stark differences between Democrats and Republicans in this
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I promise you, everything I have learned in my entire
public life tells me that these differences are real, that we mean
what we say and they mean what they say,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, they will attempt to paper over all this between now and
November, in the hope that basically a satisfied, somnambulant
electorate will give them the reins of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, who represents a suburban Long Island
district, quit the Republican party last summer and is now a top
target of Republican election strategists as he seeks re-election
as a Democrat this year.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a moderate, was elected as a member of the victorious
Republican ''Class of 1994'' that championed then-Speaker Newt
Gingrich's Contract With America. He voted with most Republicans to
impeach Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
   After an effusive introduction by Forbes, who called Clinton
''somebody I've grown to have great affection for,'' Clinton said
relatively little about Forbes in his own address to about 200
donors crammed into an elegant Fifth Avenue apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes switched parties because the GOP is out of step with his
convictions on a variety of issues, such as education, the
environment, and campaign finance reform, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why I think he did it,'' Clinton said. ''I don't think
it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who expected to raise about $500,000 from the luncheon,
parodied David Letterman with a Top 10 list of reasons for his
switch.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 on his list was a joke at the expense of the presumptive
presidential nominees of his new party, Vice President Al Gore. ''I
always wanted to hang around with the guy who invented the
Internet,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was a dig at Republican candidate George W. Bush. ''To me,
'GW' has always been a bridge,'' Forbes said. The George Washington
Bridge, one of the longest suspension bridges in the United States,
carries Interstate 95 across the Hudson River between New York and
New Jersey and is often referred to simply as ''The GW.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold a 222-211 majority in the House, with two
independents, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Virgil Goode
of Virginia. Sanders is closely aligned with the Democrats, Goode
with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Party switches are unusual in Congress, although there have been
several in the years since the Republicans won control of the House
in the 1994 elections. Five House Democrats switched to the GOP
over a period of several months in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his switch in July, Forbes said the Republican
party had become a ''captive of extremists.''

<HEADLINE> Blues Seek To Complete Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- One more victory and the St. Louis Blues can
salvage their reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1 in their best-of-seven first-round Western
Conference series against the San Jose Sharks, the NHL's regular
season champions have won two straight to force a game seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure was on them for Game 6 and now I think it
probably shifts to us,'' said Blues' right wing Scott Young, coming
off his first career playoff hat trick. ''Of course, they're not
supposed to give up a 3-1 lead, but now that we're home for Game 7,
this is what we played for all year.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis drew even against the No. 8 seed Sharks with a 6-2
victory on Sunday. Now the Blues are once again a confident team,
resembling their franchise-record 114-point regular-season form,
heading into the finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just feel like, hey, we did what we needed to do to battle
back,'' center Craig Conroy said. ''They had us in a pretty good
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 teams in NHL history have come back from 3-1 deficit.
That includes the Blues, wsho did it last year in the first round
against Phoenix when they finished off the Coyotes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They like their chances this season that much more at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes a big difference, once we get the Kiel (Center)
rocking,'' Conroy said. ''Just like in Game 5 it was a huge
motivational factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not feeling that great about yourself, being down 3-1,
but the fans are behind you. And Game 7 is going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks were as optimistic as possible after missing their
first two chances to eliminate the Blues, who appear to have
recovered from their first three-game losing streak of the season.
Win or lose, they've taken the Blues to the limit after finishing
27 points behind them in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a one-game series against the best team,'' Tony Granato
said. ''We get a one-game shot and we just have to throw everything
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Game 7,'' defenseman Jeff Norton added, ''always brings out
the best in everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues hope to rattle Sharks goalie Steve Shields early, just
as they did in Game 6 when they scored six goals on their first 13
shots. Shields also was shaky in Game 1, a 5-3 Blues victory, but
has been solid in between those games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've already gotten this game out of my system,'' said
Shields, who was pulled after two periods Sunday. ''I'm going to
have to play relaxed and enjoy the challenge, be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Blues rookie left wing Jochen Hecht had a goal and three assists
in Game 6 and was tied with Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr for the
playoff scoring lead at 10 points. Hecht, who has four goals and
six assists, had 13 goals and 34 points in 63 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a big difference,'' Hecht said. ''I hope it keeps going
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and the Sharks' Owen Nolan each had five goals to tie for
lead with Toronto's Steve Thomas, and the Blues' Pierre Turgeon was
tied for the assists lead with seven.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Turgeon's assists have come in the last two games. He
outfought Sharks defenseman Mike Rathje for the puck and then beat
him down the ice to set up the Blues' first goal in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to win in the playoffs, your best players have to
be your best players,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ''You
need everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Will Heat Stumble Vs. Pistons?  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- As Pat Riley shouted instructions during practice
Monday, he backed up several steps and tripped over Tim Hardaway
seated along the sideline. Hardaway caught Riley before he fell,
and both laughed.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the time of year when the Miami Heat usually start
to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the past two seasons, Miami began the playoffs by
splitting two games at home, then went on to lose the opening
best-of-five series. The Heat take a 1-0 lead into Tuesday's game
against the Detroit Pistons, and Riley said the potential pitfalls
should be obvious to his players.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can warn them so much, and then you just warn them to
death,'' Riley said. ''I hope our experience and maturity are
enough to let us know what can happen if you let down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, trying to win with All-Star forward Grant Hill
hobbled, would be delighted to salvage a split before returning to
Detroit for Game 3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to have won two games in Miami,'' guard Jerry
Stackhouse said. ''But our goal is to come down here and steal one
game. We still have an opportunity to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was limited to 13 points Saturday in Game 1, which Miami
won 95-85. He'll play again Tuesday despite a bone bruise in his
left foot that has the Heat wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to get caught up in looking at him hobbling
around,'' forward P.J. Brown. ''He's still Grant Hill, and he's
still a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainers have spent 10 hours a day working on Hill's foot. He
took only nine shots Saturday and struggled trying to defend Jamal
Mashburn, who scored a career playoff high 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I can try to concentrate on my defensive rebounding and
playing good defense,'' Hill said. ''Maybe instead of trying to
score 30 or 35 points a game, I need to keep my man from scoring 30
or 35.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who sat out Game 1 because of a sore left foot, has
yet to rejoin practice and will likely rest at least until the Heat
lose a game. That's one reason they want to win Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history is another motivator. In both 1998 and 1999, the
favored Heat lost in five games to the New York Knicks after
splitting the first two games in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive days off have Riley worried about his team's focus,
but center Alonzo Mourning doesn't expect a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been together long enough, and we've had a lot of
playoff experience as a team,'' he said. ''We've had our butts
kicked. We've been swept by Chicago. We've been pounded by New
York. So what Detroit is presenting is not foreign to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, who won their fourth consecutive Atlantic Division
title this year, figure their home-court advantage may be more
significant than in years past. Miami won a franchise-record 33
home games and went 23-5 at AmericanAirlines Arena, which opened
for basketball Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''History has shown that sometimes the home court doesn't help
you as much as it should,'' Brown said. ''But at AmericanAirlines
Arena we've played a lot better than we did at Miami Arena, so we
have confidence being at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The home team has won all five Miami-Detroit games this season.
The Pistons' 15-27 road record is the worst of any Eastern
Conference playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   So a victory Tuesday would be a breakthrough for Detroit -- and
disaster for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't get Game 2, it defuses what we did in Game 1 and
gives them hope of going home to close us out,'' Brown said.
''That's a situation we don't want to put ourselves in. So it's
almost like Game 1 never happened.''

<HEADLINE> Northrop Earnings Jump 66 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First-quarter earnings at Northrop Grumman
Corp. rose 66 percent, easily beating expectations, due to pension
income and improved results from its information technology and
airplane parts businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop earned $173 million, or $2.47 per share, up from $104
million or $1.50 per share, during the first quarter of 1999. Sales
were virtually unchanged from last year at $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expected
earnings of $1.80 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northrop rose $3.43}, or 5 percent, to $70.43} in
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop benefitted from increased sales of Boeing's F/A-18
fighter jets and C-17 military cargo planes, as well as higher
margins from Joint STARS, an airborne battlefield command system.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop is in talks to sell its commercial airplane parts
business, but has said it will keep the military side of the
business, which includes building portions of the F/A-18 and C-17.
Commercial contracts include the construction of fuselages and
other components used in Boeing's 747 passenger jet.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Logicon, Northrop's information technology business,
increased 7 percent to $378 million, while operating margins rose
63 percent to $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   The results also included a $67 million increase in pension
income to $150 million for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements in those sectors helped offset a decline in
revenues from B-2 bomber production, said Kent Kresa, Northrop
Grumman's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are continuing to strategically redefine Northrop Grumman
and are pursuing a plan that focuses on our high-growth business
areas of defense electronics, systems integration and information
technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Northrop reported a business backlog of $9.9 billion, compared
with $10.7 billion reported a year earlier. The decline was
attributed primarily to the winding down of the B-2 stealth bomber
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Kent Stanley, who coached Oklahoma City to
the NAIA women's basketball championships the last two seasons,
will not return because of a university investigation into reports
players have said they were verbally abused by the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley had been suspended with pay while the university
conducted its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family and I have been deeply hurt by the things that have
been said and by the way that the university has chose to handle
this,'' Stanley said from his home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My records of graduation for student-athletes and on-court
success speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma City sports information director Tony Sellars said the
decision to not renew the annual contract was a result of the
investigation. He would not comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley had been coach for five seasons and his contract expires
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The university appointed Janell Jones interim head coach. She
has been an assistant since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Church Decries Colombian Extortion  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Not even charity offerings collected at
Sunday Mass are immune from extortion by Colombia's largest rebel
band, which has stepped up pressure on priests to turn over cash,
the country's Roman Catholic leader said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've sought 50 million, 100 million pesos ($25,000 to
$50,000) from certain parishes,'' Archbishop Pedro Rubiano told The
Associated Press. ''The parishes have been very clear that it's a
matter of principle that they cannot hand over to the war monies
collected for social and evangelical projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubiano's accusation comes less than a week after the
state-owned telephone company, Telecom, publicly announced that it
is refusing to pay the same rebel group ''protection money'' to
prevent sabotage against its installations.
</P>
<P>
   This rare public defiance of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, reflects a new boldness toward the country's
main rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 35 years, two main rebel groups have been fighting
the Colombian state. About 30,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC and Colombia's No. 2 rebel army, the National
Liberation Army (ELN) have long extorted money from oil, mining and
other companies that operate in rural areas they dominate. Since
the mid-1990s, urban FARC cells have extended extortion operations
to major cities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the army's anti-kidnapping unit, the FARC nets
about $10 million a month from extortion. It filled its coffers
with about $84 million from ransom kidnappings last year.
Authorities have estimated FARC revenues from ''taxes'' on the drug
trade at several hundred million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses -- especially multinational corporations -- almost
never publicly denounce guerrilla extortion. They prefer to pay
quietly so they can continue operating in rebel-dominated zones.
</P>
<P>
   But now that 15-month-old peace talks with the FARC appear to be
gaining momentum, some sectors of society are exhibiting a new
willingness to stand up to the guerrillas, who control about half
Colombia's countryside.
</P>
<P>
   FARC leaders said last week that they are now willing to
consider a government cease-fire offer to advance slow-moving peace
talks launched in January 1999. But the rebels have so far refused
to commit to halting extortion and ransom kidnapping, an important
revenue source for them.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities blame FARC extortionists for a March 30 bombing in
one town in the central state, Cachipay, that killed three people
and wounded 20. Also as part of the extortion pressure, guerrillas
kidnapped five Telecom engineers in the country's south on March 17
and have threatened and attacked regional administrators, company
officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Alfredo Rangel, a former national security adviser, said
he thinks the increased FARC extortion stems from the guerrillas'
desire to offset a $1.7 billion aid package now before the U.S.
Congress. The money could become available to the Colombian
government later this year.

<HEADLINE> Marimow Named Baltimore Sun Editor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Bill Marimow, the managing editor of The
(Baltimore) Sun and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, was named
editor of the paper Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces John Carroll, who is taking over as editor of the
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who served nine years as editor of The Sun, brought
Marimow to the staff in 1993, said Carol Dreyfuss, a spokeswoman
for the newspaper. The two had worked together at The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Marimow's two Pulitzer Prizes came during his tenure at the
Inquirer. He shared the Pulitzer Prize in 1978 for stories on
police violence that he and a colleague wrote and Carroll edited.
In 1985, after serving as a Neiman Fellow at Harvard, Marimow won
the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting for stories on civil
rights violations by the Philadelphia police's K-9 unit.
</P>
<P>
   Marimow, 52, joined The Sun as metro editor in 1993 and rose to
managing editor two years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun and Los Angeles Times are both Times Mirror Co. papers.
Tribune Co. recently announced it is taking over Times Mirror and
Monday announced the appointment of Carroll as editor and John
Puerner, publisher of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel, as publisher of
the Los Angeles Times.

<HEADLINE> Scores At Nigerian Symbolic Burial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANE, Nigeria (AP) -- Thousands of people jammed this Niger Delta
village Monday for the symbolic burial of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the
prominent writer and activist whose 1995 execution helped turn
Nigeria's former military government into an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa ''laid down his life for his people,'' said the Rev.
Sunday Amadi, who presided over an interdenominational service
before the burial. ''He refused to compromise or be corrupted by
either the government or the oil companies and for this reason he
died.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 3,000 people, most of them Ogonis from Bane and
nearby villages, followed as a coffin -- without Saro-Wiwa's body --
was carried for about a mile from the church to the Saro-Wiwa
family grave site, where it was interred.
</P>
<P>
   Saro-Wiwa, the leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni
People, spearheaded a campaign asking oil giants to compensate
Ogonis for environmental damage done to their region.
</P>
<P>
   Movement members were accused of treason and involvement in a
string of killings, and Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists from
the minority Ogoni tribe were hanged on Nov. 10, 1995. Activists
say the nine were executed and secretly buried because of their
work against Nigeria's then-government. The bodies were never
found.
</P>
<P>
   The international reaction to the executions was swift and
strong. The Commonwealth -- the organization of Britain and its
former colonies -- promptly suspended Nigeria. More than a dozen
countries, including the United States, recalled their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   The former military government of Gen. Sani Abacha ended with
his sudden death in 1998, paving the way for democratic elections.
Olusegun Obasanjo was elected president in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, the
Delta remains desperately poor and is regularly rocked by violence
among feuding groups. Western oil companies, their workers and
their installations also are often targets.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saro-Wiwa's death, MOSOP has become bitterly split between
two rival factions. Earlier in April, the feud erupted into
violence in several Nigerian villages, leaving at least five people
dead and others injured, newspapers have reported. When police
moved in to restore order, they were attacked as well.
</P>
<P>
   MOSOP officials at Monday's service called on the government to
officially exonerate Saro-Wiwa and the others who were executed.

<HEADLINE> Probe OKs IRS on Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators were unable to
substantiate the allegations of IRS misconduct and abuse of
taxpayers that helped spur reforms at the agency, according to a
report made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by the congressional General Accounting Office are
the latest in a string of investigations that failed to find the
widespread evidence of problems in Internal Revenue Service
criminal investigations and enforcement as alleged in highly
publicized Senate Finance Committee hearings two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, we found no corroborating evidence that the
criminal investigations described at the hearing were retaliatory
against the specific taxpayer,'' the GAO report said. ''We could
not independently substantiate that IRS employees had vendettas
against these taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report also said it ''did not find any evidence'' to
support claims made by IRS employees at the Senate hearings that
their superiors ordered assessments against large taxpayers to be
''zeroed out'' in order to gain personal awards, improve their own
statistics or pursue careers outside the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation established that the allegations themselves
had been based on an incomplete awareness of the total
circumstances,'' the GAO report said. ''We found that each manager
had acted within his or her discretion ... their decisions were
approved by appropriate individuals and were documented in the
files.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was completed last May but was kept under wraps
because it contained confidential taxpayer information protected by
law. A version with some names and other data blacked out was
released by the IRS under the Freedom of Information Act to Tax
Notes, a journal that closely follows tax news for professionals. A
version was also released to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee hearings in April 1998 helped lead to the
passage later that year of an IRS reform law intended to curb
agency enforcement abuses and remake the agency into one that
treats taxpayers more like customers. While the IRS now draws
praise from Congress for its changes, the law also triggered a
sharp drop in enforcement actions such as audits and liens.
</P>
<P>
   Previous GAO audits have also found little evidence to back up
the claims made by witnesses at the hearings. A blue-ribbon panel
headed by former FBI and CIA director William Webster also
concluded last April that the IRS Criminal Investigation Division
was not guilty of ''systemic abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., nonetheless
believes the hearings contributed to a much-needed IRS reform law
that ''has added a lot of protections for taxpayers,'' said Roth
spokeswoman Ginny Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can protect taxpayer rights and collect the right amount
of taxes,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest probe, the GAO specifically found:
</P>
<P>
   --No evidence supporting testimony from IRS employees Ginger
Jarvis, Michael Ayala, Maureen O'Dwyer and Minh Thi Johnson that
senior managers mistreated taxpayers, forgave taxes for big
companies as favors or to improve their own status and allowed
former IRS agents who now work for private companies to influence
audits.
</P>
<P>
   Among the discounted claims were: An Atlanta manager ''covered
up'' a tax collection issue for his girlfriend and a Manhattan
manager improperly ordered a tax case closed despite an agent's
recommendation that the taxpayer pay a $42 million assessment.
</P>
<P>
   --Little corroboration for testimony from four business people
that the IRS used heavy-handed tactics in executing search
warrants, that some agents acted out of personal malice and that
some IRS actions were intended to intimidate people who represent
taxpayers before the agency.
</P>
<P>
   One of those business witnesses was John Colaprete, who operates
restaurants in Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Va. He is embroiled in a
$20 million civil lawsuit against the IRS over a raid at his
establishment, which is headed for a federal jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation did find that decisions to initiate the
investigations were reasonably based on information available to
the IRS at the time ... We found no evidence that IRS employees
acted improperly in obtaining and executing the search warrants,''
the GAO found.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says Giuliani exploiting Elian Gonzalez  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton accused Senate rival
Rudolph Giuliani on Monday of exploiting the Elian Gonzalez
situation, perhaps as a prelude to using it for fund-raising
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time that cried out for healing, the mayor chose to
exploit this situation by making divisive attacks on the United
States law enforcement officers,'' Clinton said in a statement.
''Calling U.S. law enforcement 'storm troopers' is extreme and
unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp denied any plans to use the case for fund
raising and the mayor said his complaints about the handling of the
situation ''comes from things that I really believe very, very
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first comment from the first lady since heavily armed
immigration officers forced their way into the Miami home of the
6-year-old's relatives on Saturday and took him away for a reunion
with his father at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While not saying whether she approved of the tactics used in the
raid, the first lady said ''Saturday's action was accomplished
rapidly and without injury, and I hope that the appropriate,
ongoing legal process will now conclude as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say that she was ''relieved that Elian has been reunited
with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time for all of us to take a deep breath and allow Elian
and his father to spend time together outside of the media and
political spotlight,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and again on Sunday, Giuliani took the Clinton
administration to task for sending in armed officers to take Elian
Gonzalez away from his Miami relatives. Comparing the officers to
''storm troopers,'' Giuliani said he ''couldn't imagine that
something like this could happen in America.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at a news conference in Brooklyn, Giuliani called the
raid ''unprecedented and unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm entitled to give that viewpoint and the mere fact that I'm
in politics doesn't mean that I shouldn't have a viewpoint,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had unsuccessfully tried to get Elian Gonzalez to join
him in Times Square on New Year's Eve to kick off the Millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement Monday, Clinton campaign spokesman
Howard Wolfson raised the specter of Giuliani using the situation
as a possible fund-raising device.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor has been politicizing this case from Day One. It's
time for him to stop,'' Wolfson said. ''Today, we are challenging
Rudy Giuliani not to mention Elian Gonzalez in any of his future
secret fund-raising letters.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary does not look at a 6-year-old boy as a political
opportunity,'' the Clinton aide added. ''It's a shame that the
mayor does.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the fund-raising possibilities, Giuliani campaign
manager Bruce Teitelbaum said ''the mayor has made it clear to me
he does not want the campaign to politicize this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only links between Elian Gonzalez and campaign cash are
the donations made by Gregory Craig and his partners at Williams &AMP;
Connolly who have contributed thousands of dollars to Mrs.
Clinton's campaign,'' Teitelbaum added.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a Washington lawyer who helped defend President Clinton
during the impeachment process, is representing Elian Gonzalez'
father. He has contributed at least $1,000 to Clinton's Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum called on Clinton to return money from Craig, saying
the lawyer's influence with the first lady creates the ''growing
appearance of a conflict'' on her part.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Craig's law firm have contributed at least
$8,000 to the first lady's campaign, Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Albany's Times Union newspaper reported Monday that a
larger share of Clinton's itemized campaign contributions so far
this year had come from New Yorkers than Giuliani had recorded.
Until this year, she had never lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's analysis said the first lady had received 53
percent of her donations from New Yorkers while 31 percent of the
New York City mayor's had come from in-state residents during the
first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the analysis was flawed because it not take into
account $750,000 transferred into her campaign account from another
federal committee. Virtually all of that money came from
out-of-state contributors, the mayor's adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two began raising money for the race last year,
Giuliani has collected $19.3 million while Clinton has raised $12.8
million in what experts believe will become the most expensive
Senate race in the nation's history.

   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Saudi security forces clashed with members
of a Muslim minority sect in southwest Saudi Arabia on the Yemeni
border, leaving 40 people dead, a Yemeni tribal chief said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The official Saudi Press Agency also reported the clashes in
Najran province Sunday night, but blamed it on the hunt for a
sorcerer and said only one person was killed and four wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Faqih, a London-based Saudi opposition leader, said the
Najran area has been tense for more than a week now because Ismaili
Muslims there have for the first time in many years publicly
celebrated Ashoura, the anniversary of the 7th century slaying of
Imam Hussein, one of the most revered Shiite imams.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Sunday clashes resulted from the closing of an
Ismaili mosque in Najran, a province dominated by members of the
Yam tribe. About a third of the 100,000-150,000 Yam tribesmen live
in neighboring Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a telephone interview with Qatar's al-Jazeera
television from Najran, a man identified as an Ismaili journalist
said the situation remained tense on Monday and that military
armored vehicles were deployed in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the clashes, the journalist, Saleh al-Yami,
said: ''We were only defending our religion, our creed and our
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yemeni chief from the Yam tribe said the clashes began after
Saudi security forces stormed mosques in Najran belonging to
Ismailis, an offshoot of the Shiite sect. The majority of Saudis
are Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
   The chief, who asked that his name not be used, said the troops
took away religious books and manuscripts and arrested three senior
Ismaili clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ismaili demonstrators headed to the residence of the
Najran governor, Prince Mishaal bin Saud, to demand the release of
the clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes broke out with the security forces, leaving at least 40
people dead, including policemen, and scores injured, the chief
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi Press Agency, however, said the unrest began when
security forces entered a house in Najran where a sorcerer lived.
</P>
<P>
   A person in the house shot at the security men, seriously
injuring one, it said, citing an official source. The sorcerer and
the person who shot at the policemen was arrested, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorcery is banned in Saudi Arabia, whose strict interpretation
of Islamic laws calls for executing soothsayers, murderers, rapists
and armed robbers.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of up to 60 people later headed to the governor's
residence and submitted a petition with demands not related to the
arrest of the sorcerer, according to the Agency.
</P>
<P>
   It said the demonstrators began shooting at the governor's
house, killing a policeman and injuring four others.

<HEADLINE> Subs Ready for Suns, Spurs  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Samaki Walker is trying to control his nerves
and prove he belongs in the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson has been there before, and wants to show he still
belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will start in place of Tim Duncan when the San Antonio
Spurs play the Phoenix Suns in Game 2 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns expect playoff-hardened Johnson to buy them time while
Jason Kidd recovers from a broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   At 23 and with all of one playoff game to his credit, Walker
knows this is his moment. He had 13 points and 16 rebounds in his
first playoff game Saturday, but it wasn't enough to keep the Suns
from winning the opener of the best-of-five series 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   ''You walk out there see the NBA logo, and you know this for
real,'' Walker said. ''You hear guys talk about it the whole
season. But until you experience it, it's something totally
different.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's overwhelming. You have to come out and calm yourself
down. Some games you come out and try to work yourself up to get
the energy. But in the playoffs, the energy is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs won home-court advantage despite Duncan missing the
final four regular-season games with a torn cartilage in his left
knee. But they couldn't overcome Phoenix's defense in Game 1 and
they missed Duncan inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's changed them a lot,'' Suns guard Penny Hardaway said.
''All the plays they're running for Samaki and Malik (Rose) are the
plays that Tim would get. They can't score like him. They are
hustle players and they play hard, but his (Duncan's) lack of
presence is very noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns miss Kidd, too. And they are trying to squeeze another
postseason out of Johnson, who's been in 97 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is making an improbable return to the Alamodome, where
his career seemingly ended two seasons ago in a playoff loss to the
Spurs. Johnson jumped at the chance to return when Kidd was injured
March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played 25 important, calming minutes for the Suns in
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''My last NBA game was here,'' Johnson said. ''We get put out of
the playoffs in the first round and I leave the arena on the bus
feeling like the end of my career. Like, the Alamo, they got me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two years later, I'm coming back to the same place to continue
my career right where I left off, basically against the same ball
club. It would be great to get out of this first round somehow, but
it's very pleasing to be returning to San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Scott Skiles intends to use Johnson cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been out for a long time, you can't just throw him out
there and expect him to play 35 minutes then he gets hurt and we
lose him the rest of the time,'' Skiles said. ''I try to be a
little smart about it, put him in and when I take him out, not put
him back the rest of the half. I don't want him coming in and out,
getting stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has asked for at least two minutes' notice when Skiles
plans to put him in a game. He then loosens up in the hallway
behind the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like whatever he could give us would be great, and
what he's given us has been great,'' Skiles said. ''He's a nice
calming influence. He's run the offense well, he knows how to play.
He's been in a lot of playoff games so he's not going to panic.
He's brought a lot of nice things to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending a month getting in shape and learning the offense
and defense, Johnson is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of club that it's easy to see where I fit in,
trying to buy some time for Jason Kidd to get healthy,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Walker isn't listening to talk that the Spurs can't beat the
Suns without Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't let your ego get caught up in it,'' Walker said.
There is no doubt Tim is arguably the best player in the NBA today.
You don't replace players like Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I use it for motivation. I realize it's time for me to step up
and show I can play.''

<HEADLINE> Bucks No Match for Pacers' Davis  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks might need to revise
their defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks started Darvin Ham against Indiana's Jalen Rose in
Game 1. That left Glenn Robinson on Dale Davis. Neither matchup
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to put a smaller guy on me and put a power
forward on Jalen, we're going to make them pay,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Rose made the Bucks pay in Indiana's 88-85 victory Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had only 12 points but dominated inside with 17 rebounds
and four blocked shots. Rose had 12 points in the first quarter and
finished with 26, one short of his playoff career high.
</P>
<P>
   The second game at Conseco Fieldhouse will be Thursday night
before the best-of-five Eastern Conference series moves to
Milwaukee for Game 3 Saturday and, if necessary, Game 4 next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a team that always plays good defense,'' Rose said.
''(Bucks coach) George Karl will give you different looks
defensively, a lot of things you wouldn't expect, like putting
Darvin on me. Fortunately we were ready. Dale was phenomenal. He
was the inside presence we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team shot well -- Robinson was 4-for-17, Indiana's Reggie
Miller was 5-for-18 -- yet the Pacers came up with timely baskets at
the end, including three straight 3-pointers by Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was guarded most of the game by Rose, missed his
first six shots and finished with 11 points. He wasn't discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we played a great game last night,'' he said Monday
after a light workout at the team's training center in St. Francis,
Wis. ''We held them to a low shooting percentage, and we made a lot
of defensive stops. I think they have to make an adjustment to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell was 6-for-17 from the field, but he, too, was
confident the Bucks can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is we played poorly and we still were in that
game,'' Cassell said. ''We missed a lot of shots, and if we make
them, we win. We lost, but we all feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl called the game ''one of our best defensive performances of
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to respect the shots that they made in the fourth
quarter,'' Karl said. ''I really think we'll build on last night's
game, because we know we're going to get some offense we didn't get
last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he wasn't worried about the Bucks' poor shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''What killed us was rebounding, and Mark Jackson had 11 assists
and our entire team had 11 assists. They just played a little
better than us, a little smarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks haven't won a playoff game since 1990. Last year, in
their first playoff appearance since 1991, they were swept by the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a more determined team this year,'' Karl said. ''Last
year, this team was just happy to make the playoffs. This year we
want to make a statement. In my opinion, the playoffs don't start
until someone wins on the other team's court.''
</P>
<P>
   That, if nothing else, should give the Bucks some hope. The
Pacers had only five losses at home during the regular season,
including 105-84 to Milwaukee a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we can beat this club,'' Cassell said. ''We're just
going to have to come out ready to go Thursday. If we can keep our
defensive intensity up, our offense will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee came back from a 13-point deficit in the first half,
and Tim Thomas, who missed a 3-pointer that would have tied the
score at the final buzzer, said the loss didn't shake the team's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we came in at halftime, Coach just told us to relax,''
Thomas said. ''We had a lot of confidence and that helped us. We'll
be back Thursday to try to steal one.''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres outfielder Kory DeHaan was
recalled from his 20-day rehabilitation assignment and activated
from the disabled list on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres optioned infielder-outfielder John Roskos to Class
AAA Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaan, selected from the Pittsburgh Pirates in the December
draft, began the season on the 15-day disabled list with a bruised
left knee. During his rehab assignment, he hit a combined .273 with
one home run, four RBIs and three stolen bases in 14 games for
Class A Rancho Cucamonga and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Roskos, whose contract was purchased on April 11, went 1-for-15

   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, who sets the NBA
standard for sartorial splendor, may be wearing some bandages above
his left eye at Tuesday's playoff game against the Detroit Pistons.

   Riley required stitches after hurting himself while swimming at

   Riley had five small bandage strips just above the left eyebrow

<HEADLINE> Siena Hires Syracuse Assistant Orr  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE HENDRICKS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- A tearful Louis Orr left Syracuse
University where he grew up as a basketball player and assistant
coach to take over the Siena Saints on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Orr, 42, signed a five-year contract and did not apologize for
his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an emotional guy and I am not afraid to show it,'' Orr
said.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Paul Hewitt, who took over at Georgia Tech after
turning the Siena program into a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference
power.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, 36, quickly turned around the program at Siena, where he
had a 66-27 record in three seasons at a school that had won only
22 games in the three previous years. The Saints reached the NCAA
tournament in 1999, their first appearance in 10 seasons. Siena
finished 24-9 this year, losing to Penn State in the second round
of the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Orr brings major college and NBA experience to the suburban
Albany school that competes with the likes of Marist, Niagara and
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-year career as an NBA forward playing for the
Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks, Orr began coaching.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant at Xavier and Providence before returning to
Syracuse four seasons ago to work with Jim Boeheim, who recruited
him as an 18-year-old high school senior out of Cincinnati. Orr was
an integral part of Boeheim's first recruiting class at Syracuse,
teaming with center Roosevelt Bouie, to help Boeheim get off to a
fast start as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Orr starred at Syracuse from 1976-80, finishing his career as
the 17th all-time scorer in school history with 1,487 points and
ninth all-time rebounder with 881. He was the 29th pick in the 1980
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Orr said it was difficult emotionally to leave Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a family man and Syracuse has been home for me. It has
been a family. Coach Boeheim has coached me since I was 18 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hardest thing is to leave your family. It is not easy
leaving your family,'' said Orr, despite his excitement about being
a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Orr said he would be bring a defensive orientation to the
fast-paced, three-point shooting offense that has characterized
recent Siena teams. He said he would add a 2-3 zone to the Siena
defense and work on a half-court game while building on the running
game that has been successful for the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Orr is the latest Boeheim assistant to become a college head
coach, following Rick Pitino, Tim Welsh, Wayne Morgan, Ralph
Willard and Tim O'Toole. Another Boeheim protege, Brendan Malone,
who coached the Toronto Raptors, is an assistant with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Former Syracuse assistant Scott Hicks is coach of the University
at Albany, which recently moved up to Division I.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Placed on Russian Educator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department announced sanctions Monday
against the head of a Russian engineering university for alleged
actions that could contribute to Iran's missile development
program.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken against Yuri Savelyev, the director of
Baltic State Technical University in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the sanctions
were levied after a Russian Ministry of Education probe concluded
that Savelyev was involved in the transfer of sensitive technology
to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It also revealed a number of violations of procedures for
enrolling foreign students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said administrative action was taken against Savelyev and
that specialized courses for Iranian students were canceled.
Training of Iranian specialists at the school also was canceled, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Russian action, Rubin said the United States
is imposing a ban on its government assistance to and procurement
from Savelyev. A ban on U.S. exports and imports involving Savelyev
also was imposed, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Russian government's action against Savelyev
demonstrates Russia's commitment to stopping the flow of sensitive
technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It also ''underscores the importance of continued U.S.-Russian
cooperation in combatting the threat posed by Iran's aggressive
pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery
systems,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 160; Dow Up 62  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply Monday
as investors feared a possible breakup of Microsoft and a slowdown
in personal computer sales that could chill the entire technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped 160.40 to close at 3,482.48, its lowest close
since the devastating selloff on April 14 that left the index at
3,321.49. During the session, the index fell as much as 298 points
before regaining ground in the final hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.05 to 10,906.10. The
Dow recovered from a 146-point plunge in the opening minutes of
trading, then swung between positive and negative territory for
much of the session as slumping technology issues and buoyant
financial stocks dueled for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 fell 4.68 to 1,429.96.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, down 12 5/16 to 66 5/8, was the biggest decliner in
all three indexes. The Nasdaq and the S&AMP;P 500 are weighted indexes,
with the largest companies exerting the greatest influence, so
Microsoft's woes hurt those indexes more than the Dow, which values
each of its 30 components equally.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Monday the Justice Department and the 19 states
that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are
planning to call for Microsoft to split off its Windows operating
system from the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of Microsoft might then be divided in two, with
one company handling applications software and the other the
company's Internet business, including browser software.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the government will suggest its proposed
remedies to a federal judge in Washington who has already ruled
that Microsoft engaged in illegal activity to preserve its
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of the unknown is hurting Microsoft,'' said Brian G.
Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo. ''Money managers don't want to be left holding the
bag if Microsoft stock has further to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares also came under pressure after investment
banks Goldman Sachs and SG Cowen cut their ratings on the stock.
Last week, Microsoft revealed in its earnings report that revenue
grew less than expected due to slowing PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's decline, Microsoft stock is now down 44 percent
from its all-time high of 119 15/16, set Dec. 30. During the
session, shares fell to a 52-week low of 65.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of slower computer sales weighed on the rest of the
technology group. Cisco Systems fell 1 11/16 to 63 7/16 and Dell
Computer fell 2 3/16 to 47 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   But blue chip financial stocks attracted some buying interest,
lifting the Dow from its lows. American Express rose 7 1/16 to 150
1/16 after reported earnings that surpassed Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued buying into the reviving drug sector.
Warner-Lambert rose 4 11/16 to 118 1/8, and Merck gained 2 3/16 to
71 15/16 after reporting first-quarter profits of 63 cents per
share, beating Wall Street forecasts by a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that with technology stocks slipping, investors are
turning toward drug stocks as a less volatile growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America
Securities, on Monday reduced his recommended weighting of stocks,
shifting from 80 percent stocks and 20 percent bonds to 75 percent
stocks and 25 percent bonds.
</P>
<P>
   With the shift, McManus reversed a move he made last week to
boost his stock holdings. He said last week's recommendation was an
effort to capitalize on bargain-hunting opportunities in the wake
of massive market weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, McManus argued, stocks will remain volatile
and, in many cases, overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we think it makes sense to lighten up in anticipation of
more weakness over the next several months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 12-to-5
margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.05 billion shares, compared with
1.07 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.30 to
468.54.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. Stock
exchanges throughout Europe were closed for the long Easter
weekend.

<HEADLINE> White House E-Mail Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Widening his investigation, Independent
Counsel Robert Ray is conducting interviews and has issued a
subpoena to find out whether administration officials tried to
obstruct investigators by not turning over e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The move immerses Ray deeper into the most recent Clinton
administration controversy at a time when the independent's office
is trying to finish its six-year investigation -- and decide whether
the president should be indicted when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office issued a subpoena last Tuesday to the National
Archives and Records Administration, the government's official
custodian of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Archives received a grand jury subpoena from the
independent counsel relating to recordkeeping practices in the
executive office of the president and intends to comply as
required,'' archives spokeswoman Susan Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the National
Archives advises White House employees about managing presidential
records, including electronic mail, but does not take full custody
of such records until a president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who succeeded former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
declined to comment on the subpoena, said spokeswoman Neille Mallon
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials told The Associated Press that the
independent counsel's office is conducting interviews of witnesses
in the e-mail controversy jointly with the Justice Department's
campaign fund-raising task force.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the task force interviewed President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, each for four hours, in its long-running
investigation into alleged fund-raising abuses in the Democrats'
1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office and the task force at Justice
are trying to determine why the White House failed to review
thousands of e-mails to see if they were responsive to subpoenas
issued in various Clinton-administration investigations, the
officials told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has blamed a computer glitch and says there was
no effort to hide the e-mail from investigators. It acknowledges,
however, that two top officials knew about the problem as early as
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials outside the prosecutor's office who are
familiar with Ray's subpoena said it sought records that might shed
light on which administration officials knew about the missing
e-mail, when they knew it and whether any of them were relevant to
investigations under Ray's jurisdiction such as Whitewater, the
White House travel office firings and the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say it could take months to review the
problem and determine if e-mail can be retrieved for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to work hard to reconstruct and search the backup
tapes and produce any relevant information,'' White House spokesman
Jim Kennedy said today. ''But I don't have immediate comment on
that subpoena. We've been very clear about the fact that we are
cooperating fully with Congress and others who have an interest in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials for Vice President Al Gore, who is joining
Clinton in New York for a fund-raiser, referred inquiries about the
subpoena to the White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee also is investigating the
missing e-mail. The task force and Ray's office are conducting some
of the interviews jointly for efficiency's sake, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the electronic messages were not stored properly, they
were not reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they
should be turned over to various investigators who requested or
subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Beth Nolan has told the House committee that
as early as 1998, when several of the investigations were still
active, both then-White House deputy chief of staff John Podesta
and then-White House Counsel Charles Ruff were informed about the
e-mail problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolan said there was a ''disconnect'' inside the White House
in which technical experts understood the magnitude of the problem
but presidential lawyers did not suspect it affected ongoing
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At least two White House contractors have told Congress they
were threatened not to divulge the e-mail problem.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Plans Mideast Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross will travel to
the Mideast next week to assist in negotiations between Israelis
and Palestinians, and a visit by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to the area is expected at a later date, the State
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin said Albright will make the trip
sometime in the next six to eight weeks. Starting this Sunday, two
sides will attempt to achieve a comprehensive resolution of issues
dividing them by September 13.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Ross will sit with the negotiators in Israel's
southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat and also will shuttle back
and forth between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our judgment, the next six to eight weeks could well be a
decisive phase in the pursuit of peace between the Palestinians and
the Israelis,'' Rubin said. ''And that phase, obviously, is now
including a more intensive American involvement with Ambassador
Ross' presence at the table and work with the leaders.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses Smoking Trial Delay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A judge refused a tobacco industry request Monday
to delay the punitive damages phase in a landmark smokers' case
that has already yielded $12.7 million in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Lead tobacco attorney Dan Webb asked for a two-week delay,
saying there was too much work to get done by May 15, when the
punitive damages phase is set to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Robert Kaye ruled in favor of the smokers'
attorneys and said it would start on time.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 sick smokers are seeking a
multibillion-dollar award to punish the industry for hiding the
deadly and addictive nature of cigarettes for decades.
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, a jury decided Big Tobacco had conspired to produce
a defective product and returned a $12.7 million compensatory
verdict for three smokers with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The award covers medical expenses, pain and suffering. Once a
jury decides compensatory damages, it can consider punitive
damages, which are meant to punish.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury that awarded the compensatory damages will hear
testimony on potential punitive damages in the class-action
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Davidian Penalty Not Proper  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 30-year prison sentences given to four
Branch Davidians who survived the 1993 Waco siege should be struck
down because a judge improperly applied a firearms law to enhance
the penalty, their lawyer told the Supreme Court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows for stiffer sentences for defendants who carry
certain types of weapons, including machine guns and bombs, during
a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians' lawyer, Stephen Halbrook of Fairfax, Va., argued
the sentences were inappropriate because no jury ever determined
the type of weapon carried by the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence that ties a machine gun to any of these
petitioners,'' Halbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James K. Robinson defended the law,
saying Congress intended to give judges leeway at sentencing to
provide more substantial punishment. Prosecutors only were required
to prove that the Davidians committed a violent crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five Davidians were convicted in 1994 of voluntary manslaughter
in the slayings of four federal agents during a botched Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raid on the sect's compound outside
Waco, Texas. The raid led to a 51-day standoff that ended when
flames swept through the sect's retreat. Davidian leader David
Koresh and some 80 followers died during the inferno, some from the
fire, others from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the five Davidians was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
The presiding judge tacked 30 years more onto the sentences of four
men -- Renos Avraam, Brad Branch, Jaime Castillo and Kevin
Whitecliff -- after finding they had carried firearms during
commission of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Davidian, Graeme Craddock, was sentenced to 10 years for
using a grenade and was handed a consecutive 10-year term for using
a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The jury never was asked to decide what type of firearm was
used. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith did not determine whether
the defendants had used machine guns during the Feb. 28, 1993, gun
battle but said the weapons had been available to them.
</P>
<P>
   The firearms law allows a judge to add a five-year sentence for
carrying a weapon during commission of a violent or
drug-trafficking crime; 10 years if the weapon is a semi-automatic
firearm; and 30 years if it is a machine gun or destructive device.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's ruling was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. But the justices appeared concerned Monday by the
sentence-enhancing aspect of the firearms law and the authority
granted to judges to substantially inflate sentences without a jury
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all obviously struggling with the way to approach this
case,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Halbrook said later that the government only pursued the
firearms violation option after failing to secure convictions
against the Davidians on the far more serious counts of murder and
conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case where the prosecution decided since they could
not give stiff sentences for murder, then they would think up a new
theory and say, 'Well, these people were carrying machine guns,
let's give them a 30-year sentence,''' Halbrook told reporters.
''This was an afterthought to stick it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The five Davidians should serve no more than 15 years, Halbrook
argued: 10 years on their original convictions and five years
apiece for carrying a weapon during commission of a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's forewoman, who traveled to Washington to observe the
case, said they were troubled when the judge tacked on the firearms
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were absolutely shocked at the severity of the judge's
augmentation of what we thought was going to be a slap on the wrist
of the defendants,'' said Sarah Bain of San Antonio, Texas. ''We
didn't know anything about the five years to 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Castillo vs. U.S., 99-658.

<HEADLINE> Library of Congress' B'Day Marked  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 30 celebrities -- including TV's Big
Bird and Gen. Colin Powell -- were feted Monday as ''Living
Legends'' as they helped celebrate the 200th birthday of the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Jaroslav Pelikan from Yale University was chosen to
speak on behalf of the group. They received medals, along with
another 54 celebrities who were not present.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first thought,'' Pelikan told the group to explain why he
was picked as spokesman, ''is that I seem to be the only one among
those present whose last name puts him into the same class with Big
Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning serious, he compared the library with the ancient
one in Alexandria, Egypt, which had carved over its entrance the
words ''Hospital of the Soul.'' Pelikan, a historian of religion,
was introduced by Librarian James H. Billington as the author of 30
books and translator of the works of Martin Luther.
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston Celtics basketball star Larry Bird, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, 91-year-old practicing heart surgeon Dr.
Michael DeBakey and comedian Bob Hope also were honored.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bird -- Carroll Spinney -- joined the others on a stage set up
on the Capitol grounds across the street from the library. He wore
his regular eight-foot fuzzy yellow costume, adorned for the
occasion with a red and blue striped necktie.
</P>
<P>
   As the first speaker from the group on stage, he said he was
glad to be in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''D and C are two of my favorite letters,'' he added
instructively. ''Gee, I've never been to a birthday party for a
library before.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward as well as back, the Library also opened a new
Web site for children and a reconstruction of President Thomas
Jefferson's own book collection. Acquired after British forces
burned the original library in 1814, Jefferson's 6,487 books became
the core of what is now the world's biggest one.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the Library of Congress had 9,429,184 books and
nearly 110 million other items, in 460 languages.
</P>
<P>
   The Post Office marked the occasion by issuing a new 33-cent
stamp which shows the bright inside of the dome over the library's
main reading room. The U.S. Mint issued the first commemorative
coins of the century: a silver dollar that will sell for $28 to
$32, and its first gold-and-platinum $10 piece that will cost $395
to $425, complete with a satin-lined presentation case.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Says Syria Talks Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Israeli peace negotiator contradicted
a hopeful assessment by Jordan's King Abdullah on Monday, saying it
was unlikely that Israeli-Syrian peace talks would resume in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Oded Eran, Israel's chief negotiator with the Palestinians, told
Israel radio Monday that the king may be interpreting the same
signs from Syria differently than the United States and Israel.
Asked whether Abdullah's comments indicated there was something new
in efforts to resume the talks, Eran said: ''No, definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first visit to Israel on Sunday, the young monarch said
he had recently seen encouraging signals from both the Israelis and
the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until the doors are firmly shut, I think it would be a tragedy
if we give up,'' Abdullah said in an interview with Israel TV.
''There is room to maneuver still and we shouldn't lose that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah has played an active behind-the-scenes role in trying
to bring Israel and Syria together.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Lebanon, Syria's foreign minister called on Israel to
choose between accepting a peace settlement based on U.N.
resolutions or maintaining tension in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon and Syria are clearly proposing the achievement of
peace and stability in the region through the implementation of
U.N. resolutions ... and the principle of land-for-peace,'' Farouk
al-Sharaa told reporters Monday after talks with Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa's talks with Lahoud and Hoss are believed to have
centered on Israel's decision to withdraw its troops from southern
Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   Israel last week formally notified the United Nations that it
plans to withdraw its troops with or without a peace agreement with
Lebanon or its mentor and main power broker, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lebanon and Syria want an Israeli withdrawal to be part of
an overall peace agreement that would also stipulate the return of
the Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in 1967.
Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli radio stations reported Monday that security officials
have information that Lebanese guerrillas and their Iranian backers
are planning massive terror attacks inside Israel and overseas once
the withdrawal takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The security officials, who were unnamed in the reports on
Israel radio and Army radio, said they had information that the
Hezbollah would target airports and Israeli diplomatic missions
abroad. The radio also said that ''large buildings'' were on the
target list.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports said that Iran was trying to recruit radical
Palestinian groups to its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah made it clear in his first trip to Israel since his
coronation in March 1999 that warmer relations between Israel and
Jordan depend on progress in the faltering talks with the
Palestinians and a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say Israel is not offering them enough of the
West Bank, and Syria wants a prior commitment that Israel will
return the disputed Golan Heights. Barak says he first wants to see
the security arrangements the Syrians have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was due to visit Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
the West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Louisville Sophomores Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Louisville sophomores Quentin Bailey and
Caleb Gervin have been suspended from the men's basketball team for
the 2000-01 season for a violation of team rules, the school
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are addressing the matter internally, including their
future status with the team, and will have no further comment on
the issue,'' Louisville coach Denny Crum said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a walk-on swingman from Louisville's Iroquois High
School, proved to be the team's spark off the bench this past
season, averaging 6.1 points and scoring five or more points on 19
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put myself in a situation that has affected my life, and now
I have to pay for it,'' Bailey said in a statement. ''I made a
mistake that won't happen again. I'll use the year to concentrate
on my academic studies and do all in my power to be reinstated to
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin, a nephew of Basketball Hall of Famer George Gervin, is a
sophomore from Palm Springs, Calif. He averaged 2.6 points in 20
games as a reserve guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all make mistakes in our lives,'' Caleb Gervin said. ''I
made one by using marijuana, and it will not happen again. I made a
bad decision and now have to suffer the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the school did not specify what rules the two
may have broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already were faced with replacing five seniors
from last year's team, including the entire front line. They have
signed three players for next season, including Ellis Myles, a
6-foot-8, 240-pound forward from Compton, Calif.; Luke Whitehead, a
6-7 forward from Oak Hill Academy; and Simeon Naydenov, a 6-7
forward from the Berkshire School in Miami, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Sump Pump Battery Charger Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Wisconsin company is recalling 29,000
chargers for sump pump batteries after finding the chargers can
catch fire, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sta-Rite Industries received seven reports of battery chargers
overheating or catching fire, four of which caught fire in homes
and damaged the immediate area around the charger, the commission
said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Delavan Wis.-based company has recalled chargers from the
Flotec back-up sump pump system, model number FP2000DCC-02 or
2P667B, and the Sears back-up sump pump system, model number
390.306062. Brand names and model numbers can be found on the pump
model plate. The part number on the charger is PS17-77 and can be
found below the meter on the charger. The recall involves just the
charger, not the sump pump.
</P>
<P>
   Large and small home centers, auto parts and plumbing supply
stores, including Sears, W.W. Grainger, Advanced Auto Parts, Home
Quarters, Home Depot and Hechinger sold the sump pump systems
nationwide for about $200 from December 1994 through September
1997. The stores also sold the battery chargers as a replacement
part for the systems for about $130.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should stop using the sump pumps with the recalled
battery charger immediately and call 1-800-845-6541 anytime for a
replacement charger, the safety commission said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal authorities are finalizing a plan to
remove, by force if necessary, dozens of Puerto Rican protesters at
a U.S. Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques, government
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The removal operation could begin as early as next week, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the protesters stands in the way of fully
implementing an agreement reached Jan. 31 by President Clinton and
Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello to permit the Navy to resume
limited training exercises on Vieques in exchange for a popular
referendum to decide whether to eventually close the range.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the deal was announced, Rossello publicly pledged to
''support federal efforts to assure that trespassing or other
intrusions on the range cease entirely.'' Since the Jan. 31
agreement, however, no action has been taken against the protesters
and the Navy has been unable to resume exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The removal plan, which has not received the final go-ahead,
would involve federal marshals as well as FBI agents. Marines would
be aboard ships off the coast to provide perimeter security, the
officials said. Puerto Rican police would support the operation by
performing crowd control and other duties.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, chief spokesman for Defense Secretary William
Cohen, referred questions to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing we can say about if and when'' the FBI plans
to try to remove the protesters, FBI spokesman Bill Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether any of the protesters possess or have
access to weapons, but some have vowed to resist any effort to
force them off the federal property, which has been used as a
bombing range for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's nonvoting delegate to
Congress, said in an interview Monday that he supported a move to
clear the bombing range of protesters, although he was not aware of
a specific plan. But he said he was aware of credible information
that some protesters on Vieques may be armed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the protesters will fulfill their promises that
... they have no intention whatsoever of creating a violent
confrontation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a violent confrontation on Vieques is especially
sensitive in light of the show of force used by federal agents last
Saturday in removing 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of his
Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters numbering from a few dozen to several dozen have
camped on various parts of Vieques since April 19, 1999 when errant
bombs from a Marine Corps jet killed a civilian Puerto Rican guard.
That incident caused the Navy to suspend training, and months of
negotiations ensued between Puerto Rico, the Navy and the White
House over when and under what condition the Navy would resume
bombing practice.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters occupy several camps on the range. Their numbers can
reach into the dozens depending on weather conditions. Last
Wednesday they marked the first anniversary of the accidental
killing of civilian security guard David Sanes Rodriguez. Mourners
laid flowers on his grave and demanded the Navy's eviction.
Elsewhere in Puerto Rico, protesters held vigils and church
services.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little indication from interviews with protesters
then that they fear being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Aponte, a university professor who said he joins the
protesters on holidays, said last week, ''I will believe in the
arrests when the helicopter lands and the federal marshals come
out.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Judge Throws Out Simpson Suit  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A lawsuit seeking telephone records that O.J.
Simpson says would exonerate him in the killings of his ex-wife and
her friend was dismissed Monday by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think your lawsuit here borders on being frivolous,'' U.S.
District Judge Dean Pregerson told Simpson's lawyer, Doug McCann.
McCann said he would continue pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson claims the records will show that his ex-wife, Nicole
Brown Simpson, spoke to her mother at 11 p.m. on June 12, 1994, the
night Ms. Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed in front of her
condo.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in Simpson's criminal trial placed the call at 9:37
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson was acquitted of murder charges but found liable for the
deaths in a civil trial. Attorneys for both sides in that trial
maintained Ms. Simpson was stabbed to death shortly after 10:30
p.m., giving her ex-husband time to return home, change clothes and
catch a limousine to the airport at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   McCann argued that records showing that Ms. Simpson took a call
at 11 p.m. would prove Simpson's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simpson's mother, Juditha Brown, has said she called her
daughter when she returned home after a family dinner at Mezzaluna
Restaurant in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A General Telephone and Electric Co. lawyer has said a court
order would be needed for release of the records without the
consent of Ms. Simpson's parents, who have refused.

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- With Juan Miguel Gonzalez now miles away
from the Bethesda, Md., home he occupied for over two weeks, local
officials took time Monday to thank residents for their patience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you for being such good neighbors and for making it
easier for our police officers to do their job,'' read a letter
signed by Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan and Chief
of Police Charles A. Moose.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had been staying at the home of a Cuban diplomat since
arriving in the United States on April 6. Local residents were
faced with throngs of media and road closures as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, he has been at Andrews Air Force Base, where he
was reunited with son Elian.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto Nuclear Waste Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is poised to veto
legislation that would have allowed storage of thousands of tons of
highly radioactive nuclear waste in the Nevada desert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised weeks ago to veto the bill, and the White House
said he would carry it out Tuesday. The legislation passed the
House on a 253-167 vote in March, and the Senate 64-34 a month
earlier; At least two-thirds of those voting are required for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires that shipments of used nuclear fuel, building
up at reactors in 31 states, begin to be shipped to Nevada in 2007,
once the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves a license for a
permanent waste site in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has opposed the legislation partly because the
bill raises questions about the authority of the Environmental
Protection Agency to independently determine radiation exposure
standards for a future Yucca Mountain underground repository.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC is expected to decide as early as 2006 on whether the
Yucca Mountain underground nuclear waste repository 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas should be licensed. Now under scientific
review, the site is proposed for opening in 2010. State officials
have pledged to fight it.

<HEADLINE> 4 Dead in Maluku Religious Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Four people have died in a riot
involving Muslim and Christian gangs in Indonesia's troubled Maluku
province, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties are the first recorded this month in the
province, where sectarian violence has claimed 2,000 lives over the
past 15 months. The violence had abated since it peaked at the
start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Local police spokesman Lt. Col. Iwa Budiman said four men were
killed Sunday night in rioting in Masohi, a town on Seram island
1,600 miles east of Jakarta. Maluku was formerly known as the Spice
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen others, including a police officer, suffered bullet and
stab wounds, Budiman said. Two houses and a bus were set on fire.
The rioting subsided after nightfall and security forces were
searching for the instigators, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri is scheduled to visit the
province this week to try to defuse inter-communal tensions.
</P>
<P>
   On Batam island, security forces fired warning shots at hundreds
of protesters who attacked a police station and a hotel during an
anti-tax demonstration on Monday. There were no reports of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the mob was protesting a plan by the Indonesian
government to impose a 10 percent value-added sales tax on luxury
goods sold on the industrialized island, just south of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Batam's residents complain the tax will hinder attempts to
attract foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, more than 200 Muslims rallied outside the U.S.
Embassy and U.N. offices to demand independence for Aceh, an
Indonesian region that has been wracked by years of separatists
violence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 people in Aceh have been killed in clashes between
rebels and Indonesian security forces since January.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh police said Monday that at least one policeman and four
civilians were killed and two others have been missing since
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two missing were a mother and her three-year-old child,
abducted Saturday by unidentified gunmen along with her husband,
who was found dead, Lt. Col. Satria Hariprasetyo said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also said six bomb blasts had rocked various villages
and towns over the weekend and on Monday. No injuries were
reported.

<HEADLINE> Study: Poor Kids Insurance Dropping  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of poor children covered by
private health insurance is dropping, offsetting government efforts
to increase the number of American kids with health benefits,
according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the percentage of poor children with health
coverage has remained about the same, even though the government
has signed up more children for a special public insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say fewer kids are covered by private insurance
because more working poor parents don't get health benefits at
their companies or can't afford the premiums. The study showed a
significant increase in the percentage of uninsured working parents
-- from 31 percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most troubling trend is the increase in (uninsured)
low-income parents who, unlike their children, do not have access
to public programs,'' said Peter Cunningham, author of a study on
children's health coverage funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, a philanthropic organization that advocates better
access to health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The findings conflict with a study by an insurance
industry-backed group showing the percentage of kids covered by
private plans increased slightly from 1994 to 1998. Cunningham said
the previous study only showed a small increase and didn't cover
the period of insurance premium increases in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 33,000 families, conducted by the foundation-funded
Center for Studying Health System Change, showed the percentage of
children with private coverage, such as employer-sponsored health
plans, fell to 42 percent from 47 percent from 1997 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   About 33 percent of children in the center's study were covered
by Medicaid and the state Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP) in 1999, up from 29 percent in 1997. Medicaid and CHIP are
funded with state and federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The government created CHIP in 1997 to help children whose
families earn too much for Medicaid but can't afford insurance on
their own. Some 2 million children have signed up for the program.
</P>
<P>
   But children are being dropped from private insurance plans just
as quickly as others are joining CHIP so the problem of the
uninsured hasn't improved, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in public enrollment, the study showed that
20 percent of kids living in families making less than $26,000 a
year lacked health insurance in 1999, which is about the same as in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some 11 million children and 33 million adults in the United
States have no health benefits, according to government studies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the biggest factors in children losing private
coverage probably were higher health care costs and fewer small
companies offering health benefits to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums at small firms -- where many low-income employers are
likely to work -- rose 5.2 percent in 1998 and another 6.9 percent
in 1999. Workers' share of premiums averaged $145 a month in 1999,
up from $122 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies either can't afford to offer workers health
benefits or pay a smaller share of the premium because their costs
are higher, said Neil Trautwein, director of employment policy at
the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The size of their work force tends to be more volatile and
more expensive for insurers and they charge higher premiums,''
Trautwein said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he would give
low-income families a $2,000 tax credit to help them purchase
private insurance. Vice President Al Gore wants to expand CHIP,
allowing adults to sign up, which would cost the government $146
billion.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cracks Down on Media  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranians searched street kiosks in vain for
their favorite newspapers Monday, after hard-liners closed down 14
pro-democracy publications in a strike against a major pillar of
the reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown of pro-reform newspapers, part of a crackdown that
has seen two journalists jailed in the past three days, is a strong
backlash by Islamic hard-liners trying to preserve their power and
is a blow against popular President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The move also showed how much power the hard-liners still hold,
despite a crushing defeat by Khatami supporters in recent
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   The judiciary, which handed down the ban against the newspapers
Sunday, has been the hard-liners' most powerful instrument in the
power struggle against the movement for social and political
reforms that has swelled since Khatami's 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   ''The power struggle in Iran is entering dire straits,'' said
Saeed Leylaz, an analyst and writer for several reformist
newspapers. ''The press has been the main instrument for Khatami to
speak to the people, and if that is taken away from him he is in
serious trouble,'' Leylaz told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
expressed concern, saying: ''More than anything, these actions are
a blow to the people of Iran, which have clearly expressed their
desire for openness and this kind of freedom in successive
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami spoke in public Monday to mark Armed Forces Day, but
made no mention of the closures or the future of his reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Ten major daily newspapers and four weekly or biweekly magazines
were closed down by order of the hard-line judiciary in Tehran late
Sunday and Monday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Only two reformist newspapers -- Mosharekat and Bayan -- escaped
the ban. It was not clear why they were not included. Azad, which
was banned, was on sale Monday, because the daily already had gone
to print before the ban. It is unlikely to appear Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary statements quoted by IRNA said the publications were
closed for ''printing material against the lofty Islamic principles
and commands.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Khatami is still strong and very popular among the people, but
now he is handicapped without his main pillars of support,'' said
Hossein Qaragozlu, a shopkeeper, who was buying papers.
</P>
<P>
   The closures came three days after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
hard-line supreme leader whose powers supersede those of the
elected president, said there were 10 to 15 reformist papers
undermining Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, religious schools around the country were ordered to
close by hard-liners to protest a recent conference in Berlin
attended by several reformist journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners were outraged after footage from the conference was
aired last week on state television, showing Iranian exiles
criticizing Iran's religious government and a woman dancing in a
skimpy outfit. In Iran, women must adhere to a strict Islamic dress
code.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners, who have ruled by decree since the 1979 Islamic
revolution, have been losing popularity to a barrage of newspaper
criticism against their heavy-handed policies. The newspapers had
turned Khatami, who advocates democracy and the rule of law, into a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reformists' election victories, the hard-liners still
control key institutions, including the military, the broadcast
network and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police seized Latif Safari, director of the banned
Neshat daily, and took him to Tehran's Evin prison, a day after
detaining Akbar Ganji, the nation's top investigative reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the judiciary upheld the conviction of
Mahmoud Shams, editor in chief of Asr-e-Azadegan, giving him a
2{-year jail term on charges of ''insulting religious sanctities.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Saeed Hajjarian, another leading journalist, was shot
in the face and gravely wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every leading reformist journalist has been summoned for
questioning by the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the outgoing Parliament dominated by hard-liners
tightened an existing press law, granting greater powers of
prosecution against writers and publishers. The changes have to be
endorsed by the hard-line Guardian Council, a likely formality.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers make closing arguments in insider trading trial  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A photograph of the face of an X-rated actress
rested on a black background before a jury as a lawyer for a Wall
Street executive on Monday sternly defended a client accused of
trading inside stock secrets for love.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason Mr. McDermott recommended these stocks is because
they are good stocks,'' Denis J. McInerney told jurors in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan during a closing statement on behalf of
James McDermott Jr. of Briarcliff Manor.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors have been told throughout a two-week trial that
Kathryn Gannon is a model, an actress and a dancer but have been
spared more salacious details of a career that made her a star.
</P>
<P>
   She remains a fugitive in a case that has left McDermott on
trial with Anthony Pomponio, a businessman who also is alleged to
have had an affair with Gannon and to have bought stocks based on
McDermott's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, formerly a $4 million-a-year executive, Pomponio, 45,
of North Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami,
Fla., are each charged with conspiracy and securities fraud.
Prosecutors allege the trio made more than $170,000 in illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the testimony and thick stacks of documents introduced
during the trial have centered the case on McDermott, the former
chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney told jurors that his 48-year-old client has never
wavered in his insistence that an extramarital affair never
involved the trading of secrets about stocks of companies involved
in mergers or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do anything wrong. I did not engage in insider
trading. I did not break the law,'' McInerney said his client has
said for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer conceded that McDermott gave Gannon tips about six
companies that he contends later went on a list of companies to be
kept secret. But he said the tips occurred before the stocks went
on the list.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the recommendations were made during 1987 and 1988,
when it ''was bank stock heaven,'' a period after government
deregulation when bank stocks rose dramatically as many of them
merged.
</P>
<P>
   ''If ever there was a rocket scientist on bank stocks, it's Mr.
McDermott,'' McInerney said. ''Mr. McDermott knew what he was
talking about, more than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the expert knowledge landed him television interviews
''all the time'' and said it was no coincidence that many stocks he
recommended later ended up involved in mergers and on lists
requiring secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be stunning if that didn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said McDermott wanted to flash his stock-picking
prowess to impress the then 28-year-old star of movies with titles
like ''Shades of Blonde'' and ''Sins of the Flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Benjamin said McDermott gave her
tips on six stocks of companies that he knew were about to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did this to further his relationship with Kathryn Gannon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then cautioned the jury that ''nobody is accusing McDermott
or Pomponio of committing a crime because they had an extramarital
relationship with Kathryn Gannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said McDermott recommended six stocks, five of which he
had never mentioned during hundreds of television interviews or
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He said all three of the defendants engaged in conspiracy when
they agreed ''to tamper with the integrity of the stock market
through insider trading.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is seeking the extradition of Gannon from her
Canadian home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dunn, a lawyer for Pomponio, said his client was
innocent, having told the Securities and Exchange Commission
everything he knew about his trades and how they originated.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Forces Clash  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli security
faced-off at gunpoint Monday after Palestinians used a bulldozer to
redirect sewage pouring from a Jewish settlement onto agricultural
land.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli paramilitary police blocked the path of the bulldozer
and scuffled with Palestinians, drawing Palestinian police who
brawled with the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have repeatedly complained that sewage from the
settlements in the Gaza Strip either passes through or is dumped
into Palestinian areas, causing health problems and contaminating
coastal waters. Most of the settlements are in a bloc at the
southern end of the strip.
</P>
<P>
   Sewage from the Kfar Darom settlement has been repeatedly dumped
into the valley next to the Palestinian town of Deir el-Balah over
the last six months, Hassan Shaban, an activist in a Palestinian
anti-settlement group, said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaban said that repeated requests to the joint
Israeli-Palestinian coordination office to stop the sewage have
gone unanswered and ''because of that we had to resort to force
today to stop the adverse health affects.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulldozer was eventually allowed to complete the work.
</P>
<P>
   The army spokesman's office said that the incident was the
latest ''illegal'' blocking of sewage pipes by Palestinian
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian leaders have warned recently that a
failure to achieve progress in peace talks could lead to violence.
Negotiations remain stalemated with another round of talks
scheduled for next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said he was convening his
security Cabinet this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not say what would be discussed, but Jewish
settler leaders said they have learned that the Cabinet will
consider an additional withdrawal from 2-3 percent of the West Bank
as a goodwill gesture to the Palestinians while the sides are
discussing larger withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers did not say what their source was, but Housing
Minister Yithzak Levy, who is very sympathetic to their cause, is a
member of the security Cabinet, and has leaked information to them
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of increased American involvement, President Clinton
has extracted stalemate-breaking ideas from the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, the chief Israeli negotiator said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
met Clinton separately this month. Israeli negotiator Oded Eran
said both ''deposited certain ideas'' with Clinton about how to
move forward. He gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Eran said Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross will take part in
the talks as an observer.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey insurers try to put brakes on auto insurance report  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A lobbying group for the state's auto
insurers is trying to put the brakes on a survey that shows that
New Jersey motorists paid the highest auto insurance premiums in
the nation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Figures expected to be officially released later this week by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners reveal that New
Jersey drivers paid an average of $1,138 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists in neighboring states paid significantly lower rates
in 1998: $960 in New York; $901 in Connecticut; $845 in Delaware,
and $723 in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives people the wrong impression,'' said John Tiene,
director of the Insurance Council of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Tiene said different states require motorists to carry different
levels of coverage, so a comparison of rates alone isn't valid. He
also pointed out that rates were cut in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Garden State drivers were paying $1,161 in the beginning of
1999. That figure was cut by $173.50, or about 15 percent, after
the state imposed mandatory reductions last spring. By the end of
1999 drivers were paying an average of $988.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least they are 15 percent lower than they were last year
when we were the highest in the nation,'' Gov. Christie Whitman
said, when asked about the survey.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey drivers have paid the highest average car insurance
rates in the nation since 1993, taking over the dubious distinction
from Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said part of the reason that the high rates persist is
geography -- New Jersey is a small state with a lot of drivers and
that means more expensive auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she will continue to look at ways to lower rates,
including cracking down on fraud, which Whitman said adds
substantially to the cost of auto insurance for New Jersey drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Heine, a spokesman for the state Department of Banking and
Insurance, said the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
doesn't incorporate dividends paid back to policy owners. But he
wasn't sure that the dividends would change the standings. State
law requires insurers to refund profits when a company earns more
than 6 percent over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based group intends to release its final report
by the end of this week. The final numbers will not change the
standings of the states that pay the highest rates, said
association spokesman Bob Martin said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Criticizes U.S. Missile  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Monday warned that growing pressure to deploy national missile
defenses ''could well lead to a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright countered that a way
should be found to mount a limited defense against new threats.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a conference of dozens of non-nuclear nations as
well as the handful of nuclear-armed states, Annan was responding
to those who argue a 1972 treaty signed by the United States and
the Soviet Union to ban anti-missile defenses should be overhauled
or even scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   Annan referred to the treaty as a cornerstone of strategic
stability and called for ''great care'' before taking steps that
''may well reduce, rather than enhance, global security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary-General made no direct reference to President
Clinton's consideration of a limited anti-missile defenses against
what administration officials say is a threat of attack by North
Korea and other so-called ''rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright stoutly defended amending the treaty to defend
against ''at most a few tens of incoming missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The treaty has been amended before and there is no good reason
it cannot be amended again to reflect new threats from third
countries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a news conference, Albright said North Korea and Iran
posed the threats.
</P>
<P>
   She said ''there is not enough understanding'' of the threats
and how the 1972 treaty can be amended to cope with them without
harming the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Annan's views, Albright said ''there doesn't need
to be a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to urge Russian President Vladimir Putin at
their summit in Moscow June 4-5 to cooperate in modifying the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Many conservative Republicans in
Congress would go further by scrapping the pact and proceeding with
a spaced-based weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has denounced tinkering with the treaty but in 1997 his
presidential predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, agreed to take steps to
destroy ''strategic nuclear warheads'' at a Helsinki, Finland,
summit with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   American and Russian negotiators opened talks last week in
Geneva, Switzerland, on reducing nuclear stockpiles and defending
against nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. conference was called to review a 1968 treaty signed by
187 countries in which non-nuclear states agreed not to try to
develop or acquire nuclear weapons on condition the nuclear nations
pursue disarmament. The treaty was extended indefinitely in 1995
with the Clinton administration's strong support.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear testing by India and Pakistan in 1998 has fueled
complaints that the United States, Russia and the others have not
taken steps toward a world free of nuclear weapons. Those
complaints are expected to be aired during the four-week
conference.
</P>
<P>
   A group of seven nations considered politically moderate called
for negotiations ''without delay'' to achieve nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Rosario Green of Mexico, presenting the group's
''new agenda,'' proposed that nuclear states pledge not to use
nuclear weapons first, as well as speed up the removal of warheads
from missile launchers, end of the deployment of battlefield
nuclear weapons and expand nuclear-free zones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to move now or to signal new determination to will
make these weapons accepted currency,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three nations endorsed the agenda advocated by Mexico, New
Zeland, Egypt, South Africa, Sweden, Brazil and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's minister for disarmament and arms control, Matt
Robson, backed Annan on anti-missile defenses as a setback to arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do think there clearly is a domino effect -- that if the
U.S. is going to develop such a system, that other countries that
have that capacity would look towards that as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright replied: ''We share the frustration many feel about the
pace of progress toward a world free of nuclear weapons. But we
also know that if countries demand unrealistic and premature
measures, they will harm the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) and set
back everyone's cause.''
</P>
<P>
   She criticized India and Pakistan for posing ''a serious
challenge'' to the treaty with nuclear weapons tests in 1998, but
said the treaty was accomplishing its goal of limiting the spread
of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a swipe at the proposed ''new agenda,'' Albright said the
United States was not turning its back on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mission to the United Nations circulated a colorful
brochure to the delegates that declared the United States was
making a good-faith effort to end the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   It cited several agreements, a voluntary ban on nuclear weapons
tests and support for a halt to the production of fissile material
for nuclear weapons. The U.S. statement said the U.S. nuclear
weapons arsenals has been reduced by 60 percent since the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Merav Datan, program director of International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War, said while disarmament could not
happen overnight, ''the world has been waiting since the formation
of the Untied Nations and since nuclear weapons themselves were
developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The British-American Security Information Council, a private
group that advocates arms control, criticized Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore for coming to New York to help raise funds for
the Democratic Party but not attending the U.N. conference only a
few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, due to make his speech to
the conference on Tuesday, told reporters he welcomed Annan's
statement.

<HEADLINE> 'Dwarf' A Disappointment  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When life's tribulations turn out to be too
much, nebbish Howard Miller takes to his bed, holing up under the
covers, doing jigsaw puzzles and singing ''Nobody Knows the Trouble
I've Seen'' with a blue hand puppet.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble? At least he hasn't had to sit through ''Taller Than a
Dwarf,'' the frantic and foolish farce that playwright Elaine May
and director Alan Arkin unleashed Monday at Broadway's Longacre
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dwarf,'' a long 90 minutes, is a disappointment, considering
the talent, on and off-stage, involved in this misguided
enterprise. The humor is sitcom deep with an undercurrent of
nastiness provided by what appears to be May's weird contempt for
her underachieving hero.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Howard is browbeaten and battered from the moment he gets
up in the morning, goes into the shower, turns on the water and
breaks the knob.
</P>
<P>
   Things go downhill from there, a series of catastrophes that
precipitate Howard's retreat from life, from his marriage and from
his dead-end job in market research.
</P>
<P>
   As Howard, Matthew Broderick, an engaging actor with proven
comic ability, appears a bit dazed as he staggers through May's
morass of jokes, a surprising number of which misfire.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Posey displays considerable stage presence as his
exasperated wife, but she has very little to do except react to
Howard's desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Into the fray rides Howard's stereotypical Jewish mother, a
woman who lives to produce guilt while tossing off such
observations as ''A mother's heart never hardens, it just breaks.''
The role may be familiar, but the wonderful Joyce Van Patten
delivers her lines with a glee that finally produces some laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is accompanied by Dad, Howard's acquiescent father, nicely
underplayed by Jerry Adler, and Howard's mother-in-law, another
Jewish momma played to comic perfection, this time by Marcia Jean
Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   The trio conspire to get Howard out of bed, especially since his
boss is on the way over, and the lad could get fired for refusing
to work. At first, May seems to be siding with the hapless, but
good-hearted Howard. She seems to be poking fun at the dom.com
millionaires who are making all the money, while poor jerks like
Howard face a lifetime of ordinary indignities -- not to mention
only making enough money to pay the next credit card bill.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the end of the evening, Howard has joined the other side,
refusing to be satisfied with only getting by. Being thankful for
not being poor, though, is like expressing gratitude for being
''taller than a dwarf,'' Howard explains.
</P>
<P>
   The newly revitalized Howard is willing to sue to get what he
wants, his inept sweetness turning into a determination that is
vaguely unpleasant, and even more important, unfunny.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin's direction keeps the show moving at a furious pace with
the actors high-pitched to the point of hysteria. For all the
motion and commotion, the play never seems to be going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Tony Walton has come up with a cleverly angled living
room set, a skewered playing area that also extends to the stoop in
front of Howard's apartment building in Queens. It's a
not-so-subtle reminder that Howard's life is equally out of whack.
But then so is the play, at least as an example of what should pass
for comedy on Broadway at the beginning of the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Refrains From Gloating  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell wouldn't answer yes or no
when asked Monday if he thought he was a better player than Vince
Carter. In Game 1 he was. In Game 2 he expects to see a different
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was the primary defender on Carter, who shot just
3-for-20 in the New York Knicks' 92-88 victory. He forced him into
rushed jumpers and off-balance misses. Of Carter's three baskets
Sunday, two came when Larry Johnson was guarding him midway through
the fourth quarter while Sprewell was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's other basket -- a 3-pointer that brought the Toronto
Raptors into a tie late in the fourth quarter -- came in transition
before Sprewell had a chance to get downcourt. So in a way,
Sprewell shut out Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wanted to get out there and guard him, and he played Vince
tough, made him take tough shots,'' teammate Marcus Camby said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell also had a productive offensive game, scoring 21 points
on a variety of aggressive moves. He had three layups, a 3-pointer,
four jumpers from 16 to 21 feet and an 8-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pretty much had his way on the offensive end,'' Camby said,
''driving the ball, hitting layups, hitting his pull-up jumper.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell admitted he was proud of his effort, although he didn't
want to rank it among the hundreds he has played during his eight
seasons in the NBA. He did admit he takes this assignment as a
personal challenge -- especially with the way Carter scorched him
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're both going at each other. It's a great matchup. It's fun
to be a part of,'' Sprewell said. ''It's something that's not easy.
It's a lot of hard work, a lot of studying and trying to figure out
what he likes to do and doesn't like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell played Carter tight on the perimeter, taking away the
uncontested jumper and daring him to beat him on the drive. The
Knicks also threw a new wrinkle at the Raptors by occasionally
having Patrick Ewing come out to double-team Carter -- a strategy
Toronto coach Butch Carter said was also used successfully by
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody at Knicks practice Monday was predicting any different
type of offensive schemes from the Raptors in Game 2 Wednesday
night, just more of Carter and Tracy McGrady getting the bulk of
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the focus is still on Vince,'' Sprewell said. ''I
expect him to be aggressive in the next game. There's no reason for
him not to be. They look to him to score and put up points, so I
don't see them changing at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   That means another defensive challenge for Sprewell, whose
two-season stint with the Knicks has been marked by a declining
number of the types of defensive lapses he brought with him from
Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some things that are definitely a lot different
here. Learning the schemes took time,'' Sprewell said. ''I still go
for steals and dunks, but I've been a lot more disciplined since
I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, meanwhile, told reporters in Toronto that he had a
restless night after traveling home with the team. Normally a sound
sleeper, Carter said he awoke a half-hour before his alarm was set
to go off and immediately started thinking about the game again.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his 17 missed shots, including his first 12, Carter
had a ghastly turnover in then first quarter when he threw the ball
so far out of bounds it sailed five feet over Spike Lee's head and
into the third row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   He also slammed the ball in frustration at one point, shook his
head in disbelief during timeouts and generally seemed to succumb
to the pressure of playing in his first NBA playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ''People can tell you about it (playoffs), but you have go out
there and actually experience it and get one game under your
belt,'' Carter said. ''Now that's over with, I have one game under
my belt. I just have to be smarter.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Desperate for a Win  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers feel fortunate
to have a 1-0 lead in their opening-round NBA playoff series with
Minnesota, because they know the Timberwolves aren't likely to
endure another fourth-quarter meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon each scored just two points
and missed a combined seven of nine shots in the fourth quarter
Sunday as the Blazers came back from six points down to win 91-88
in the opener of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have the pressure on us to be able to defend our own
court,'' Portland's Scottie Pippen said before practice Monday.
''So winning one game hasn't benefited us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves also will have to re-examine their defense of
Rasheed Wallace for Wednesday's Game 2. They double-teamed Wallace
consistently in the first quarter, but the Blazers moved the ball
around too well and hit some wide-open shots to take a 33-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was quiet until the fourth quarter, when he scored seven
points. Fellow big man Arvydas Sabonis also became a factor,
scoring five points and delivering two key assists after going
scoreless the first 37{ minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully some of the inside play can loosen up and we can get
our big guys inside and score some points, but we have to take
whatever the defense gives us,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota coach Flip Saunders claimed the Blazers were getting
away with too much contact -- particularly Wallace, who took a shot
at Garnett's groin on one play that went unnoticed by the
officials. Either way, Saunders said, the Timberwolves were
physically dominated by the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett disagreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not a physical team, but we do what we have to do to
win,'' he said. ''But on the same token, we're not like the Knicks
-- we're not known for throwing you to the ground and kicking you. I
think the only person who stomped somebody in Timberwolves history
was Christian Laettner, and I think he did that back when he was at
Duke, so we're not known for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett added, however: ''We're not going to be pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen scored 28 points -- his most since coming to Portland in a
trade with Houston last fall -- and played terrific defense in the
fourth quarter against Minnesota, which was outscored 20-11 in the
final 9:02.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves executed their offense masterfully in the
second and third quarters, hitting high-percentage jumpers off a
variety of screens. But in the fourth they struggled. They missed
10 of 11 shots during one stretch, including four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers got by without any early production from Sabonis,
who missed his first six shots and picked up two early fouls
against Radoslav Nesterovic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for Arvydas, it'll be important to get him involved,
because he always plays well against Minnesota,'' said Blazers
point guard Damon Stoudamire. ''(Sunday) he got in foul trouble and
he wasn't able to be as effective as he usually is. But we
definitely need him, and we need his presence in the post.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett played Wallace to a virtual standstill and had his third
career triple-double with with 12 points, 11 assists and 10
rebounds. But he shot just 6-of-20 and missed a long jumper and a
short hook on consecutive possessions late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to take all the bad stuff and pull some good out of
it,'' Garnett said. ''You go back and look at your mistakes, and
you try to fix them. ... I'm pretty good at reading defenses, and
yesterday I was being impatient, and it caused me to either turn
the ball over or not make wise decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves have a matchup problem with Wally Szczerbiak,
against Pippen, who scored 13 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy, who led Minnesota with 23 points, guarded Pippen
later, but Pippen still scored six of the Blazers' final 10 points
to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves can take heart in one playoff fact: Although
they are 0-4 in series openers, they are 2-1 in Game 2s.

<HEADLINE> Andreychuk Eager for 2nd Round  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- When Colorado acquired defenseman Ray Bourque from
Boston in a five-player trade last month, few people took notice of
another Bruins player who went to the Avalanche: Dave Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   Except his new teammates, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to be kidding,'' Colorado captain Joe Sakic said.
''There is no question what Ray Bourque brings to a hockey club,
but the same can be said for Dave Andreychuk.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk and the Avalanche went through an hour skate Monday
awaiting the outcome of the San Jose-St. Louis series to determine
their second-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   If St. Louis wins Game 7 on Tuesday night, Colorado will open
their next series on the road against Dallas. If San Jose wins,
Colorado will host Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andreychuk had only a goal and two assists in 14
regular season games with the Avalanche, Bourque sees the benefits
going well beyond those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dave is a guy who can do so much for you,'' Bourque said. ''He
will kill penalties, contribute on the power play, take a big
faceoff in your end and score the big goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does so many things and you only have to look at his
numbers. He has scored over 550 goals, but a lot of the other
things that he does and brings to the rink are very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk, 37, has 552 goals and 1,156 assists in his 18-year
career. He also has 37 goals and 35 assists in playoff games,
including two goals and an assist in Colorado's 4-1 first-round
series victory over Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to step up your game in the playoffs,'' said
Andreychuk, who has been in the postseason in 12 of his last 13
seasons. ''I think we all have to do that if we are going to be
successful because everybody else in the league is doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a time of the year that is do or die. This is our
living. This is what we play for and you want to play your best.''
</P>
<P>
   With the San Jose-St. Louis series going the distance, Colorado
has been forced to wait for the start of its next series.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is tough mentally,'' Andreychuk said. ''Sometimes it is
tough to practice all week long to get ready for the game.
Sometimes the guys get anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk said he had no preference for Colorado's next
opponent. He has 23 goals in his career against Dallas and 16
against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams have very good talent,'' Andreychuk said. ''We have
played well against Dallas in their building, but we will have to
play either of them well to beat them.''

<HEADLINE> Raptors' Carter Defends Camby Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Raptors coach Butch Carter responded
Monday to criticism over his lawsuit against Marcus Camby of the
New York Knicks by comparing it to last month's furor over coaches
wearing microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game against the Knicks, a league official
handed Carter a memo written by NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
that read: ''The idea of a coach suing a player over his public
comments seems unprecedented and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The league is the league,'' Carter said after Monday's
practice. ''I'm not good at managing the league. I'm just good at
trying to run a basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said it was inappropriate when I didn't wear a mike.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA fined the Raptors $100,000 after Carter refused to obey
a league mandate that ordered coaches to wear microphones during
selected national broadcasts. The fine was later rescinded
following an outcry from coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the fact they got to run a league, but history has
shown they don't understand everything it takes to be in a locker
room and coach a team,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter filed a $5 million defamation suit against Camby on
Friday after the Knicks forward called him a liar and said the
Raptors players don't like him.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he expects more razzing from Knicks fans on
Wednesday in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the atmosphere of the Garden will be worse because all
the stock brokers will be back from Easter vacation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won the opener 92-88.

<HEADLINE> Replacement Radar Working At Logan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- An airport radar system that collapsed at Logan
International Airport, delaying hundreds of Easter weekend flights,
was replaced Monday and the new radar was tracking flights by
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Airport Surveillance Radar 9 system, installed in 1991, was
used by air traffic controllers to track weather and planes within
an eight-mile radius of Logan. It was built to withstand
hurricane-force winds but collapsed Saturday morning under winds
half that strength.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers switched to a slower backup system that
allowed for only about 26 flights an hour, half the airport's usual
capacity. More than 500 flights were canceled, and hundreds of
others were delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ASR9 is considered 99.6 percent reliable,'' Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said Monday.
''This is that .4 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Salac said the FAA does not plan to inspect ASR9 units located
at 133 other U.S. airports.

<HEADLINE> Security Breach Reshuffles Officials  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about the disappearance of a laptop
computer with highly sensitive documents, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is removing two office directors involved in the
security breach. She also announced a five-point plan to help guard
against such lapses in the future.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official told The Associated Press many documents
dealing with the spread of nuclear arms were missing and that much
of the material was sensitive. The official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he did not know exactly how many documents were
involved, but added: ''There were lots of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said highly sensitive information about sources
and methods of U.S. intelligence collection were missing.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the two officials
were being assigned to other duties but added that the action was
not a finding of fault because the investigation has not been
completed. The identities of the officials were withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing briefly before reporters Monday at the State
Department, Albright said the disappearance of the laptop from the
Bureau of Intelligence and Research was ''inexcusable and
intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the missing laptop large quantities of documents
about arms proliferation issues, including highly sensitive
information about sources and methods of U.S. intelligence
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such failures put our nation's secrets at risk,'' Albright
said. ''They also damage the department's reputation and that of
its employees, the vast majority of whom take their security
responsibilities very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, security is not a subject in a university
course--99 percent success is a failing grade. So today I want to
reiterate to every employee in every office, in every bureau and
diplomatic: Security must be your top priority in all its aspects,
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said it is not clear whether the laptop was taken because
of the value of the information it contained or the value of the
laptop itself.
</P>
<P>
   Albright indicated that the missing laptop contained a type of
information with a classification higher than top secret. She said
protection of such information was being transferred from the
Bureau of Intelligence and Research to the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Albright listed four other steps to enhance
security.
</P>
<P>
   --All principal supervisory personnel are to review security
practices and procedures this week and to stress the importance of
security to their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bureau of Diplomatic Security will intensify a program of
annual refresher security briefings with attendance mandatory for
all appropriate department employees.
</P>
<P>
   --Assuming Congress consents, a new under secretary of state for
security will be created.
</P>
<P>
   --In light of the disappearance of the laptop, questions of
accountability will be examined carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The laptop disappeared two months ago, but it was not disclosed
publicly until last week. House International Relations Committee
chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. welcomed Albright's action but
said it should have been taken months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ''casual attitude of the State Department toward
security matters must change.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gilman announced plans for hearings on the issue next
month.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the security is an ongoing problem at the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the department expelled a Russian diplomat,
Stanislav Borisovich Gusev, who was accused of gathering
information from the department with an eavesdropping device.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an internal department audit, issued in December, found
that the department let visitors, contractors and maintenance
workers roam the building unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman also recalled that in 1998, a man walked into the office
of the executive secretary to the secretary of state and removed a
sheaf of papers.
</P>
<P>
   The man and the papers were never found, he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies gag order in Gravano case  </HEADLINE>
By ALISA BLACKWOOD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A gag order won't be issued to keep prosecutors
and police from talking to the media about the case against
Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, a judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's attorney Larry Hammond had requested that Maricopa
County Superior Court Judge Steven Sheldon issue the order, citing
what he said were improper and false comments made to the media by
the Arizona Attorney General's Office and Phoenix police.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said investigators shouldn't have said the former mob
hit man was tied with an ecstasy drug ring or referred to his
development company as a drug front. He said such comments could
affect Gravano's chance at a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is doubly troubling that those statements are false,''
Hammond said. ''You will not find the case that has been described
in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Paul McMurdie didn't deny that some
comments may have been inappropriate but didn't discuss specifics.
And he said that in the last six weeks his office and the police
have restricted their media contact regarding the case. He said now
the only comments pertaining to Gravano will be general or to
inform the media when public documents are released.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not doing interviews with the press and have instructed
the police to do the same,'' McMurdie said.
</P>
<P>
   In denying Hammond's request, Sheldon said he didn't have any
reason to believe that the policy would change.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano was arrested in February with 44 other members of an
alleged ecstasy-peddling ring. Investigators say the ring sold
$500,000 a week worth of the designer party drug.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said in court Monday that police and prosecutors were
incorrect in accusing Gravano of being the brains and money behind
the operation and in saying his pool construction business,
Marathon Development, was a front.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond also said authorities incorrectly linked Gravano to a
violent white supremacist gang founded by Michael Papa, 23. Papa
was one of the others indicted in the ecstasy drug ring.
</P>
<P>
   Papa had apparently been friends with Gravano's son, Gerard, who
was also arrested in the alleged ring. The arrestees also included
the 55-year-old former mob underboss' ex-wife, daughter and
daughter's boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano is being held on $5 million cash bond.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-hitman admitted murdering 19 people while part of the
Gambino crime organization, but he testified against its boss, John
Gotti, and served just five years in prison. Gotti is serving a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   When he was released from prison in 1995, Gravano entered the
witness protection program, using the name Jimmy Moran. He dropped
out by early 1997. Before his arrest, he had been living in
suburban Tempe, near his family.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Group Denounces Violence  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTO SEGURO, Brazil (AP) -- A Roman Catholic Church group said
Monday it will complain to the Organization of American States
about alleged police brutality during protests at Brazil's 500th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Indigenous Missionary Council will request a
special meeting of the OAS Interamerican Human Rights Commission in
October, Council vice president Saulo Feitosa said. The commission
could convene the Interamerican Human Rights Court, which could
impose sanctions on the Brazilian government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence between riot police and Indians protesting what they
called Portugal's ''invasion'' of this country broke out Saturday
at Porto Seguro, where Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral
first made landfall on April 22, 1500.
</P>
<P>
   Police used clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a
crowd of about 2,000 Indians from all over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred protesters from black rights, student and labor
groups tried to join the Indians, but also were gassed and pushed
back by police to keep them away from President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who was at celebrations 10 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained and later released 141 protesters, including 30
Catholic missionaries. Unofficial reports said at least 15 people,
mostly Indians, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Brasilia, the government fired Carlos Frederico Mares,
president of the Indian Affairs Bureau. Mares announced he would
resign in protest over the way the Indians were treated Saturday,
but the government sacked him first.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot remain in a government that resorts to physical
violence against an organized Indian movement,'' Mares said Sunday,
when he announced his plan to resign.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore's Elian Stance Not Good  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The public appears uneasy with Vice President
Al Gore's position on the Elian Gonzalez case, recent polls
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-Gallup poll taken Saturday showed a nearly 2-to-1 margin
of disapproval of Gore's statements in the custody case. In an NBC
News poll Sunday, almost a fourth of those surveyed said his
handling of the matter made them less likely to vote for him for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents seized the 6-year-old Cuban boy from the home of
relatives in Miami on Saturday and returned him to his Cuban
father, who has been waiting near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, says the case
should be settled in family court. He also broke with his
administration to support legislation to grant permanent resident
status to Elian, his father and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore's position has been
''consistent over an extended period of time ... and he expressed
those thoughts without making a political calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither survey asked about likely Republican George W. Bush, a
consistent critic of the administration's handling of the case.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Commission Looks At Case  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIA PARRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) -- A state human rights panel is
investigating the validity of charges against a prize-winning
environmentalist and how he is being treated in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Commission president Juan Alarcon Hernandez announced Sunday
that it would look into the detention of Rodolfo Montiel, leader of
a peasant ecological group in Guerrero state, on Mexico's Pacific
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel, 44, was arrested on May 2, 1999, along with another
member of his group and now face arms possession and drug
trafficking charges. Montiel maintains that he was charged in
retaliation for his environmental efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel's group forms human chains to stop logging trucks from
passing through Guerrero. He is widely considered by environmental
groups to be a fearless crusader for trees. He and his supporters
believe old-growth forests there are being excessively logged.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Monday, Montiel was one of seven recipients of the
$125,000 Goldman prize, given by the San Francisco-based Goldman
Environmental Foundation for efforts to preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities say Montiel and his supporters were protecting
marijuana plants, not old-growth woods. In addition, the Mexican
defense department says that the two prisoners admitted belonging
to guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said that prison officials have restricted and sometimes
denied visits to Montiel by fellow group members, independent human
rights organizations and journalists.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept: Elian Case Handled OK  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to keep a federal court decision intact
that would return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, the Justice Department
said Monday that U.S. officials have properly weighed the wishes of
the 6-year-old boy's father against the asylum request from family
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a substantial intrusion into the realm of parental
authority for a distant relative to be able to trigger government
procedures concerning the parent's 6-year-old son that could
seriously disrupt the parent-child relationship and family
stability,'' the department said in an 83-page appeals court filing
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives in the United States have gone to the 11th Circuit
Court of Appeals, challenging a district court decision that
upholds immigration officials' handling of the asylum application
made on Elian Gonzalez' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives went to court after Attorney General Janet Reno
decided to respect the father's determination not to pursue an
asylum claim on Elian's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said U.S. Immigration Commissioner Doris
Meissner ''strikes an appropriate balance by respecting the
father's right to speak for his son, unless there is an objective
basis for asylum indicating a divergence of interests between
father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question here is not whether Elian will be allowed to
apply for some minor benefit against his father's wishes,'' said
the Justice Department. ''This is a question of whether a
6-year-old will live in another country apart from his father's.''
</P>
<P>
   The department noted that there is an ''absence of evidence that
Elian will suffer persecution if he returns home.''

<HEADLINE> Starzz Get Jennifer Azzi  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Hoping to create a version of the
Stockton-to-Malone magic on the Utah Jazz's sister team, the WNBA's
Starzz traded two first-round draft picks to the Detroit Shock for
veteran point guard Jennifer Azzi and a draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Starzz gave up the Nos. 3 and 8 picks in Tuesday's draft for
Azzi and the Shock's 12th pick in the round.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that we've been working on for some time
now,'' Starzz coach Fred Williams said. ''The addition of Azzi to
our lineup with Natalie Williams will provide us with our own
'Stockton-to-Malone' combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade was completed minutes after the 31-year-old Azzi
re-signed her WNBA contract Monday. She had threatened to sit out
the season citing her unhappiness with her salary and lagging
motivation for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''When veteran players aren't being paid the same as a draft
pick, that's definitely tough, I think,'' Azzi told the Detroit
Free Press in March. ''I think that, coupled with where I am in my
life ... I just need a year off.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose resident also told the newspaper in March that she
was not trying to force a trade to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Starzz were looking to fill the point guard position in
Tuesday's draft. After losing Debbie Black and Chantel Tremitiere
to WNBA expansion last December and guard Krystyna Lara sustaining
a knee injury in January, the only guard left was Dalma Ivanyi.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8 Azzi was selected by Detroit in the first round of
the 1999 WNBA draft. Before joining the WNBA she played three
seasons with the defunct American Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   In her only season in the WNBA, Azzi led the league in 3-point
percentage (.517, 30-58) and was seventh in field goal percentage
(.514, 93-181).
</P>
<P>
   She was a member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic team that won a gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   The trade puts Azzi and Kate Starbird, two of the most famous
women players from Stanford, on the same pro team. Starbird was
acquired in a December trade.
</P>
<P>
   They are the only two players in Stanford history to win the
Naismith award as the nation's best women's basketball player.
Starbird won in 1997, Azzi in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- Apparently Bela Karolyi's touch
hasn't worn off.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after finishing last in the medal round at the world
championships, the U.S. women's gymnastics team won the Senior
Pacific Alliance championships.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Ray won the individual all-around gold and Morgan White
tied for the bronze in the competition that ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was really good to see the team come together after all the
work we have been doing,'' said Karolyi, who came out of retirement
to be women's national team coordinator after the disaster at
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us, the road to Sydney began here in Christchurch.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia was second and China, the world bronze medalist,
finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Four-time U.S. champion Blaine Wilson, competing for the first
time since shoulder surgery last November, won the men's
all-around. The American men finished second to defending world
champion China in the team competition.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women had been in free fall since winning gold at the
Atlanta Olympics. They were last in the medal round at the 1997
world championships and again last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi agreed in November to take over the women's program,
immediately putting the emphasis on physical conditioning,
repetition and more difficult skills and routines. National team
members have been meeting once a month for training camps at his
ranch outside of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Though Romania and Russia, the world's top two teams, weren't at
the meet, beating China is a big step toward medal contention at
the Sydney Olympics. China finished fourth in Atlanta, and has won
the bronze at the last two world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, whose eight-place finish at worlds was the highest for an
American, easily beat Ling Jie for the all-around title. Ray
finished with 38 points while Ling, the world gold medalist on
beam, had 37.275.

   ''We are indeed closing the gap,'' said Bob Colarossi, president
of USA Gymnastics. ''These medals should serve as a huge confidence
builder for the U.S. program. The hard work will continue as we
push forward to the 2000 Olympic Games.''

<HEADLINE> Carter Determined To Rebound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Vince Carter uncharacteristically awoke before
his alarm clock went off Monday, determined to put his awful
playoff debut behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was up early and that's not like me. I was just sitting in
bed saying, 'All right, it's a new day,''' said the Toronto Raptors
star, who made just 3-of-20 field-goal attempts in Sunday's 92-88
loss to the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I had to come to practice and watch film, and bring up
that memory, but I said to myself: 'It's a new day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Antonio Davis said Carter and Tracy McGrady were
unusually vocal during the morning film session, which is usually
dominated by comments from the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''For once, we had some of the young guys say a lot,'' Davis
said. ''The young guys were really talking and observing. With all
the talent they have, if they can correct their mistakes and
correct ours, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto coach Butch Carter said Vince Carter took his
performance hard, becoming unusually quiet during the flight home
as teammates tried to console him. Davis told to Carter forget the
pressure of being the game's newest sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The league and the media have put him in a position where if
he doesn't perform well he's going to feel bad, but we're not
putting him in that position,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to let him put his head down because he's done
too much for me, and for this team. For him to have one bad
shooting night is not going to disrupt this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley, Carter's mentor, stressed to Carter that he
played decent defense and that there were four games left in the
series. Game 2 is Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They picked me up,'' Carter said. ''They didn't let me get
down on myself, or let me throw things.

<HEADLINE> Fourth-graders to take shorter, revamped test next week  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- It's shorter and, hopefully, clearer.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents and educators still worry that the state's
fourth-grade test, which will be administered next week, is too
long and difficult for 10-year-old students.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 fourth-graders will spend about six hours
taking the tests.
</P>
<P>
   After more than half of New Jersey's fourth-graders failed the
writing and reading portion of last year's test and almost half
failed the math section, state officials did some revamping.
</P>
<P>
   They clarified instructions, changed test questions and
eliminated some portions of the test, shaving hours off the time
students will spend taking the test.
</P>
<P>
   That will give kids a better shot at doing well, some educators
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''The test schedule itself certainly seems to be greatly
improved,'' said Robert Reid, principal at Wildwood Elementary
School in Mountain Lakes. ''The advance sample practice tests were
certainly a lot clearer. We're confident the kids will do better
than they did last year and I think that's a common feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Students will start testing Monday with science, move into
language arts on Tuesday and Wednesday and then spend the remaining
two days on math.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary tests are linked to the state's new core
curriculum standards. They are designed to measure students'
progress toward meeting those standards and guide schools on areas
of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The language arts portion, which only 42 percent of students
passed last year, has been significantly changed.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner David Hespe responded to local
school officials' complaints about the length of the test by
eliminating a section that required students to read passages and
then answer questions, said Richard Vespucci, education department
spokesman. That saved about one hour of test time.
</P>
<P>
   Also eliminated were a public speaking section and a hands-on
science experiment. Vespucci couldn't say exactly how much time
those two sections took last year.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Calvo, co-chairman of the New Jersey School Boards
Association's assessment committee, estimated that this year's test
will be about four hours shorter than last year's, which were given
over a period of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns linger.
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that five mornings of testing is still too much for
10-year-olds to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you can get a sense of where a child is in a much
shorter time,'' said Molly Emiliani, school board member in
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such an intimidating test, from the viewpoint of a fourth
grader,'' added Toni Hopkins, a Moorestown parent who was elected
to the school board last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Moorestown, fourth-graders finish elementary school and head
to middle school. Many kids see the test as a kind of ''finishing
of their elementary period,'' said Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   And that puts on pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know the test is used in terms of placement for next
year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said the state needs to be more ''sensitive to the fact
that the children are going into this testing situation with all of
these fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also complained about the timing of the test -- the week
after many schools are on spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our kids are out all this week,'' said Hopkins. ''They come
right back to school on Monday morning and get tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Vespucci said the state is allowing districts to skip the tests
on Monday, start Tuesday with language arts and finish the
following Monday with the science test.
</P>
<P>
   District officials also complained that they received results in
the fall -- too late to make meaningful changes to curriculum or the
way a particular student is being taught. Hespe has promised to
return results to districts by June.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 60 percent of fourth-graders failed the
reading and writing portion of the test. In math, 40 percent of
fourth-graders flunked. But nearly 90 percent passed the science
portion.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe last week announced that a social studies test, which was
supposed to be administered to this year's fourth-graders in the
fall, will be delayed until September 2001. He said schools need
more time to fine-tune their curriculum to prepare for the new
test.
</P>
<P>
   He also may adjust the schedule for introduction of tests on
world languages, fine and performing arts and health and physical
education, which were originally scheduled to be phased in over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe formed a panel to study the best way to test in those
areas. It must report back to him in the fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- It was Senior Citizen's Day at Sportsman's
Park on Monday -- especially in the third race.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old thoroughbreds Torole and Rut finished 1-2 in the
mile-long event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time it's happened but it's certainly an
oddity,'' track publicist David Zenner said. ''There are not that
many 10-year-olds racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Torole, a son of 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, took
command at the eighth pole and drew away under Chris Emigh to win
by three lengths. He covered the mile in 1:40.53 and paid $23.40,
$10 and $5.20.
</P>
<P>
   Rut, sired by champion sprinter Gulch, was second in the field
of eight and returned $6 and $3.20.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Banjo, a 9-year-old, rallied to finish third and paid
$3.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Those trackgoers 55 or older were admitted free of charge and
received a free program.

<HEADLINE> Panama Wants US To Clean Up Canal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama's foreign minister said his
government may consider asking for international arbitration to
force the United States to remove unexploded ordinance from former
firing ranges, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said Panama needs the issue
resolved soon because it wants to draw up plans on how to use
former U.S. bases in the canal zone that were returned to
Panamanian control in December.
</P>
<P>
   Panama wants to use some of the former bases for tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman said Panama has not yet received a response to an April
14 letter to the U.S. government, asking for a copy of report on
the problem that U.S. experts had promised to draw up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said they have cleaned up as many of the
former firing ranges as they could with disturbing the ecology of
the jungle sites.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Innocent in N.M. Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A man pleaded innocent Monday to murder
and kidnapping charges in the shooting deaths of two teen-agers
during a Good Friday pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Herrera, 19, was charged in the deaths of Richard
Martinez and Karen Castanon, both 17. A decision on whether to seek
the death penalty will be made within 10 days, District Attorney
Henry Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney released documents disclosing evidence
that police used to establish the probable cause for Herrera's
arrest early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Herrera's pickup truck had been stuck in a
rugged area outside of Espanola near where Castanon's body was
found. A friend of Herrera's helped free the truck only a few hours
before Castanon's body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, police seized a .22-caliber rifle belonging to
Herrera. It appeared to be the same caliber as the gunshots that
killed the teen-agers, but tests have not yet been performed to
determine whether the gun was used to kill the high school
sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   Affidavits by a state police investigator and search warrants
did not offer a possible motive for the killings or describe a
possible relationship between Herrera and the victims. Valdez said
it appeared robbery was not a motive.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers were among thousands of pilgrims making the
annual spiritual trek to the Santuario de Chimayo, a small Roman
Catholic church in the village of Chimayo.

<HEADLINE> Appeal Filed On Colorado Gun Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Opponents of a gun-control ballot initiative
backed by President Clinton challenged the proposal in the Colorado
Supreme Court on Monday, forcing sponsors to hold off gathering
signatures for now.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, scheduled to be on the November ballot, would
require background checks on all gun sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   William Herpin Jr. of Colorado Springs challenged the measure,
saying it violates the state Constitution because it covers more
than one subject.
</P>
<P>
   The state Title Board has already rejected that challenge and
approved the initiative for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, sponsor of the
initiative, has until August to gather more than 62,000 signatures
of Colorado voters.
</P>
<P>
   Herpin's challenge will force SAFE to wait weeks before
collecting signatures. SAFE co-founder Arnie Grossman has called
the legal challenge a delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited Colorado two weeks ago at SAFE's invitation to
endorse the initiative, which SAFE decided to take to the ballot
after the Legislature killed a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   SAFE was formed after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High
School, in which the two teen-age gunmen used weapons bought
through private dealers at a gun show.

<HEADLINE> 6 Hurt At Washington Zoo Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gunfire rang through the National Zoo on
Monday evening as a feud between youths turned violent, leaving six
children wounded. A 12-year-old boy was in grave condition,
according to witnesses and authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Brian Lee, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire
and Emergency Medical Services, said one boy suffered grave wounds
to the head and and the others did not appear to have
life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   One girl was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the
chest. A seventh victim suffered a seizure, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Police helicopters hovered over the zoo after the shooting as
authorities sought a gunman. The zoo, a unit of the Smithsonian
Institution, was playing host to a African-American family
celebration day at the time gunfire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo visitors were shaken by the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not bring them back. These are my grandkids. It is not
safe,'' said Sandra Edwards, who was visiting the zoo with her
grandchildren when she heard the shots and saw youths fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Nakisha Johnson, 17, said she saw one young man open fire after
a feud between youths became violent. She said the children who
were wounded were caught in the middle of the two groups of youths.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just shooting at the people he was fighting'' but
struck the children bystanders, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was
thrown from one group of youths to another. A piece of glass struck
a young woman in the face, and then shots rang out, the witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Vice President Al Gore announced the
shootings at a Democratic fund-raiser in New York City, bringing
gasps from members of the audience that included actress Lauren
Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have to have mandatory child safety trigger locks,
and photo license IDs for the purchase of new handguns,'' Gore told
the crowd, sounding a frequent Clinton administration theme. The
president and first lady were also at the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Reports said at least two of the victims were shot at the zoo's
visitors center and one was shot at the zoo entrance on Connecticut
Avenue, a main thoroughfare in the northwest section of the
capital.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Janitors Approve New Contract  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of striking janitors overwhelmingly
approved a new contract Monday, ending a 3-week-old walkout at Los
Angeles-area office buildings. The janitors were headed back to
work Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 88 percent of janitors voting at union headquarters
approved the three-year contract, which will increase their pay by
26 percent for workers downtown and 22 percent for those in
outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders praised the agreement, even though it fell short
of their original goal of $1-an-hour increases each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It met our primary goal of lifting our members out of
poverty,'' Mike Garcia, president of the Service Employees
International Union Local 1877, told cheering janitors at union
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reinvented labor's most powerful weapon -- the
strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for 8,500 unionized workers reached agreement on the
pact Saturday with the major cleaning companies.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown contract includes a 70-cents-an-hour increase in
the first year, plus a one-time bonus of $500. Hourly wages will
rise by 60 cents in each of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors in outlying areas, such as Beverly Hills and Santa
Monica, will receive a 30-cents-an-hour increase in the first year
plus a $500 bonus, and 60-cents-an-hour increases in the second and
third year.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Davis, chief negotiator for nine of 18 cleaning companies,
said, ''it's a decent deal for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies had hired replacement workers after 4,000 to 5,000
union members began walkouts in Los Angeles County on March 31. The
janitors make an average $6.90 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities also face walkouts by maintenance workers
affiliated with the union.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chicago suburbs, 1,200 janitors went on strike last week
and more were expected to join. An SEIU local in San Diego is on
strike and contracts in Oakland, Calif.; Silicon Valley, Calif.;
Cleveland and Seattle will expire within the next few months. In
New York City, the union local representing 26,000 doormen, porters
and maintenance workers agreed to a tentative contract Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Contreras, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County
Federation of Labor, told the janitors their example was watched
carefully by teachers, truck drivers and other union workers in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rallying important political and community
support, including Mayor Richard Riordan and Roman Catholic
Cardinal Roger Mahony, the union had appealed directly to building
owners rather than fighting with the cleaning companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the next four months, 300,000 people will be at the
bargaining table,'' Contreras said. ''They were all looking at your
strike to set the tone for their negotiations. ... You showed what
it was to fight for dignity, to fight for respect.''

   The Seahawks also signed defensive backs Omar Evans and Warner
Herndon, fullback Anthony Green, safeties Maurice Kelly and Yapher
Warren, and linebacker Mac Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Green, playing in the same backfield as standout Avon Cobourne,
had only 18 rushing attempts for 68 yards and no touchdowns last
season. He also had 10 receptions for 69 yards.

Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, world leaders on Monday urged four
remaining countries to ratify it and join in efforts to stop the
spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Those four countries -- India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba -- drew
mention in comments of many ministers at the start of a four-week
conference to review progress implementing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan referred to recent nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan as indications of an urgent need for
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 were a serious
setback against the global norms against nuclear testing and
nuclear proliferation,'' Annan said in his opening remarks. The
tests, he said, ''should make clear to all the need to fight
proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which went into force in 1970, calls for efforts to
rid the world of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four countries that haven't committed themselves to
the treaty have tested nuclear weapons or are believed to be
capable of doing so: India, Pakistan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said the three should
commit themselves to the treaty and place their nuclear facilities
under the purview of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as
called for by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also call for the establishment of additional nuclear
weapon free zones especially in areas of tension such as the Middle
East and South Asia,'' said Green, who was speaking on behalf of
seven countries that have formed a coalition to press for progress
on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   India's U.N. ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said there was
''inequality'' in the treaty that his country could not accept.
</P>
<P>
   ''This does not mean that we do not hope that the treaty will
succeed,'' he said. ''We remain advocates -- very strong advocates --
of global nuclear disarmament, despite being a nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma said it is not right for the five original nuclear powers
-- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- to be
allowed to keep their weapons while other countries are not.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington,
said Israel supports the principal of nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel faces very real threats to its existence,'' he said.
''We support the eventual establishment of a Middle East zone free
of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Pakistani diplomats could not immediately be reached
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Kimberly-Clark Has Record Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Kimberly-Clark Corp. said Monday that strong sales
for the company's major paper and personal-care products drove
first quarter operating earnings up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based maker of Kleenex, Kotex and Huggies brand
products reported operating earnings of 80 cents a share, a penny
more than analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Wayne R. Sanders had given the highlights of the
earnings report at an April 13 shareholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The company said sales of all its major product categories grew
strongly enough to overcome higher costs for raw materials and
currency changes in Europe. Sales were $8.4 billion, up more than 8
percent from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly-Clark shares rose 75 cents to $60.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> N.England Man Sentenced in Mob Case  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A man who prosecutors say was the ''right-hand
man'' for a New England mob boss was sentenced Monday in federal
court on racketeering, extortion and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeLuca's sentence of 2 years, 10 months will run
concurrent with a 10{-year sentence he is already serving for a
related crime in Rhode Island, meaning no additional prison time.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca also faces a five-year state prison sentence -- to begin
when the federal sentence ends -- in Rhode Island for violating
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sentence is a reasonable sentence in the circumstances of
the case,'' U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLuca was indicted in a 1995 racketeering indictment that
included New England mob boss Francis ''Cadillac Frank'' Salemme
and hit man John Martorano, who also pleaded guilty; Stephen ''The
Rifleman'' Flemmi, who is still fighting his case; and James J.
''Whitey'' Bulger, who remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Brian Kelly said DeLuca admitted to the charges
against him, but didn't admit to being a member of the mob and
didn't agree to serve as a cooperating witness.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his guilty plea, DeLuca agreed to drop any further
challenges to the FBI's wiretapping of a 1989 Mafia ceremony,
prosecutors said. That tape has been used at several organized
crime trials to prove the existence of the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement at his sentencing, DeLuca told the judge:
''I want you to know I felt you were very fair and I thank you for
it.''

<HEADLINE> Waco Judge Denies Justice Dept Plea  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The federal judge presiding over the Branch
Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit denied the Justice Department's
request to throw out most of the plaintiffs' claims Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The government had asked U.S. District Judge Walter Smith to
reject three of the five major aspects in the civil lawsuit -- that
federal agents erred in not bringing in armored firefighting
equipment; that they wrongly held back firefighters as the compound
burned; and that using tanks to push into the compound deviated
from the operations plan the attorney general approved.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's order, released at the close of a pre-trial hearing
dealing with alleged evidence tampering, said: ''The court has
determined that too many material fact issues are presented to
justify dismissal or summary judgment as to the claims remaining in
the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, lead counsel for the Branch Davidian
plaintiffs, said: ''This means we will go trial on every issue,
including gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Smith confirmed that a preliminary review of infrared
videotapes recorded during the final hours of the 1993 siege found
no firearm muzzle flashes from either federal agents or sect
members.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results from the court experts' analysis, which
compared the 1993 aerial footage to recordings made during a March
19 field test at Fort Hood, showed the flashes most likely were
sunlight reflecting off debris, not government gunfire, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith said he does not consider the preliminary
analysis by Vector Data Systems indisputable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford said: ''We were very pleased to hear
the results of the Vector test. It's consistent with what we've
said all along -- that there was no government gunfire on April
19.''
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians have argued that government gunfire, which
they believe appears as flashes on the infrared video, cut off the
sect members' only avenue of escape as flames consumed their
retreat. Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died in the
April 19, 1993, fire that started during an FBI tear-gassing
operation intended to end the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also contend the FBI's on-scene commanders did
little to prepare for the possibility of fire -- despite Attorney
General Janet Reno's order that they be ready for all emergencies --
and that the government withheld, destroyed or tampered with
crucial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends the deaths, whether from fire or gunshot
wounds, came by the Davidians' own hands.
</P>
<P>
   The British experts identified 57 flashes signifying heat on the
infrared film, but none was attributed to muzzle blasts -- either
from Davidians or government agents, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The full analysis of the simulation is expected to be completed
by May 8.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs shrugged off the preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get good news. You get bad news. ... This is not going to
result in a dismissal of the case,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, an FBI pilot who flew the aircraft that videotaped the
final hours of the siege testified that he was surprised to learn
last year that no audio accompanied one videotape copy of the
infrared recording.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys have questioned the repeated silences on
the aerial infrared surveillance footage captured by the FBI's
Nightstalker plane.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell has called the lack of audio on the tapes
''suspicious.'' On one tape, he said, someone is heard asking for
the audio to be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs were in federal court to air their allegations
that the government has tampered with or withheld key evidence in
the case, which heads to trial in mid-June. They contend that some
of the Forward Looking Infrared, or FLIR, footage bears signs of
the audio having been erased.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has dismissed as ''baseless'' the
plaintiffs' charges of evidence tampering.

<HEADLINE> Albright Speaks On U.S. Security  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, affirming
her faith in ''the goodness of America's power,'' said Monday the
United States prefers international support when it acts to protect
its security.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes it more likely we will succeed and that the costs
and risks of taking action will be shared,'' Albright said in a
speech prepared for a global forum sponsored by media baron Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there may be times in the future, as in the past, when the
stakes and circumstances are such that America will act in advance
of world opinion rather than merely reflect it,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   That option goes with leadership, and that, Albright said, and
should serve as ''fair warning to potential adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum was designed for discussion of global issues. Among
the invited participants were former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and
World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, in her speech at a dinner at the World Trade Center,
called for trade benefits for China and defended U.S. intervention
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   On a philosophic note, and with her term due to expire in
January, Albright said she was concerned at the onset of the 21st
century that the United States might do too little, rather than too
much.
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, Albright criticized the Republican-controlled
Congress for approving a budget resolution that cut President
Clinton's request for foreign affairs funding by more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she said, the Senate was lagging in approving emergency
funds to help Colombia cope with drug criminals and was blocking
efforts to pay the U.S. share of costs of badly needed U.N.
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Eat Timor, the Congo and Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   This, she suggested, was in conflict with the proper role of the
United States -- to lead, ''and alone when we must.''
</P>
<P>
   All nations have flaws, and the United States is no exception,
Albright said. ''But I believe to the depths of my being in the
goodness of America's power. This faith is grounded in my study of
history, the experience of my own life, and my knowledge of the
American people.''

<HEADLINE> Kings' Webber Frustrated  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal was an unstoppable force,
averaging a point a minute on an assortment of dunks, finger rolls
and bank shots in equaling his career playoff high.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber scored at an even higher rate, and easily surpassed
his top previous output in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sunday's game between the Los Angeles Lakers and
Sacramento Kings was decided in the late going, O'Neal was putting
the finishing touches on a 46-point effort and doing the deciding,
and Webber was on the bench with six fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key man on their team got in foul trouble,'' said Robert
Horry, who spent significant time guarding Webber during the
Lakers' 117-107 victory over the Kings in the opener of their
first-round series. ''A lot of times in playoff games, they let
people play. If there's no big harm, they don't call (fouls) with
certain people.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber wasn't one of those people in this game, although A.C.
Green, who also spent time defending Webber, pointed out, ''Some
nights you're going to get the calls, some nights you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber picked up three fouls on the offensive end, including his
final two -- against Horry late in the third quarter, and against
Derek Fisher with 6:53 left. Webber had returned to the court just
two seconds before fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings scored 10 straight points after Webber left to draw
within six, but the Lakers scored the next six points, four by
O'Neal, to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Horry and Fisher both expressed the opinion Monday that the
final two foul calls against Webber were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that (last) one was one he could argue about,''
Fisher said. ''Maybe some of the others were. I can understand why
he'd be so upset. He's a competitor, and wants to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber, who scored made his first five shots in the game's
opening 5{ minutes and finished with 28 points in 27 minutes, was
shaking his head afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same way with LA every time because Horry flops a
lot,'' he said. ''If you don't call one charge on Shaq, how can you
call a charge on me? I can't make any apologies for playing
physical with Horry. That's their plan, to flop and get sympathy on
their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Rick Adelman said he didn't believe the game was
officiated the same way at both ends of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the case, but the Lakers finished with 24 fouls
to 19 for the Kings, and Los Angeles was 10-of-14 from the foul
line while Sacramento was 26-of-35.
</P>
<P>
   Horry chuckled about Webber's flopping charge, saying, ''He
talks about flopping, (Sacramento's Vlade) Divac is the master of
flopping.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing with (Webber), he loves to reach back and grab
you,'' Horry added. ''That's a no-no. He always does that, every
time down the court. Every time I throw my arm up, he's grabbing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said he wasn't trying to draw fouls, and isn't doing
anything different against Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just try to stay in front of him and contest his shots,''
Horry said. ''If he misses, he misses. If he makes, you cuss your
teammates for not giving you help.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said he expects Webber to be even more aggressive Thursday
night when the teams play Game 2 of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just have to go out there and keep on playing,'' Horry
said. ''All we did was win one game. I don't think they've lost any
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has repeatedly expressed great respect for Webber, and
did so again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of those special players who's going to get his
recommended numbers,'' O'Neal said. ''He's a dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber said Monday he hopes to get more than 27 minutes and more
than five rebounds in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rebounding is a key, it was a glaring statistic why we lost,''
he said. ''They beat us on the boards, no excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers outrebounded the Kings 54-37, and got 25 offensive
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Webber made 11 of his 16 shots, and Jason Williams was 8-of-16
in scoring 20 points. The rest of the Kings players were 18-of-53
and scored 59 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we let all of those guys get off, we're going to be in
trouble,'' O'Neal said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Fallout May Affect Marlins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The fallout from the Elian Gonzalez case could
spill over to the Florida Marlins this week.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a call by Cuban-Americans for a work stoppage in
the Miami area Tuesday over how the 6-year-old Gonzalez was taken
from his great-uncle's home, Marlins general manager Dave
Dombrowski said the team will respect any of its employees'
decisions to take the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins play San Francisco at home Tuesday night. Dombrowski
said any of the team's front-office workers, players and coaches
would be excused, but not stadium employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins will close their downtown Marlins en Miami Store for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who's passionate about the situation, we will respect
their wishes,'' Dombrowski said before Monday night's game against
Philadelphia. ''We have also alerted the Giants of the situation
because they'll be flying into this. They also have Livan
(Hernandez) and we wanted to make them aware.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins have three players with Cuban bloodlines -- pitchers
Alex Fernandez, who started Monday night, Vladimir Nunez and
Michael Tejera.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez was scheduled to start Wednesday night against former
Marlins hero Hernandez. Both pitchers were born in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins Cuban-born coach Fredi Gonzalez made it clear he will be
in the third-base box Tuesday. Cuban-born Hall of Famer Tony Perez,
a special assistant to Dombrowski, was to make his viewpoint known
later.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager John Boles spoke to the players before the game
and said that anyone who feels they need to take off may do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski doesn't believe the work stoppage will affect the
status of the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think so,'' Dombrowski said. ''I don't feel it
will reach that proportion. We never went down that road.''

<HEADLINE> CSX Announces Diminished Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- CSX Corp. blamed higher fuel costs, wage
increases and congestion on the rail lines for ''unsatisfactory''
first-quarter earnings released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CSX earned $29 million, or 14 cents per share, in the
three-month period ended March 31. That compares to $26 million, or
12 cents per share during the 1999 period, adjusting for an
accounting charge related to workers' compensation coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The results were a penny shy of analysts' expectations of 15
cents per share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues fell 15 percent to $2.15 billion, compared with $2.54
billion in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ''These results are unsatisfactory,'' said chairman and chief
executive John Snow. ''With demand expected to stay strong for the
rest of the year, we can improve earnings substantially by running
the railroad more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   The company noted that revenues for 1999 included results from
Sea-Land's international shipping container business, which was
sold last year.
</P>
<P>
   In July, CSX sold approximately 70 container vessels, about
200,000 containers, related container terminals and other assets to
A.P. Moller-Maersk Line for $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first quarter of 1999 also was 14 weeks, compared to 13
weeks this year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from the rail and intermodal businesses were $1.8
billion, compared to $1.47 billion a year ago. Expenses were $1.64
billion, compared to $1.19 billion in 1999. Expense increases were
attributed to congestion, higher fuel prices and wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   CSX, headquartered in Richmond, operates the largest rail
network in the eastern United States and also provides container
shipping and contract logistics services.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CSX were up 31\ cents Monday at $20.93} on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Mexico Rulers, Rival Tied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- With just 2{ months to go before Mexico's
election, the ruling party candidate and his chief rival are in a
dead heat for the presidency, according to a poll published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, candidate for the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was favored by 45 percent of the
voters, while Vicente Fox, candidate for the center-right National
Action Party, was preferred by 42 percent, according to the poll by
the daily newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between Labastida and Fox shrunk from 7 percent to 3
percent since Reforma's last poll, published March 27. Given the
latest poll's margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage
points, that leaves the two candidates in a virtual tie, Reforma
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party trailed a distant third, with 12 percent, while the remaining
1 percent were divided between three candidates from smaller
parties, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for Mexico's president, congressmen and Mexico City's
mayor will be held on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokeswoman Martha Sahagun said the poll ''reaffirms our own
surveys in which we come out four points ahead and where the
tendency indicates not just a tie, but Fox leading.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that voters' choices were based not on the
candidates' specific proposals or even their personalities, but on
whether the voters felt it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has governed the country uninterrupted for 71 years. The
major theme of Fox's campaign, above and beyond any of his
proposals, has been the need for change.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ''Ya!'' -- which means ''it's time'' or ''enough
already'' -- has dominated his radio and television ads as well as
billboards and posters featuring the word in capital letters next
to the smiling candidate offering the victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida was favored most by poll respondents 50 and older,
while Fox was favored by those 30 and younger. The two are still
vying for voters between 30 and 40, Reforma said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, voters with less education said they would vote for
Labastida, while those with higher levels of schooling preferred
Fox, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Among those polled, 58 percent believed that the country would
experience political instability if the PRI were removed from
office after seven decades, while 50 percent believed Mexico would
go through a period of economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   But those in favor of a change said the fear of instability
would not cause them to change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The door-to-door poll was conducted on April 7-10 and 14-17
among 1,647 residents at least 18 years of age throughout the
country's 32 states, Reforma said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Depression Key For Heart  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Heart patients with chronic depression are three
times more likely to suffer a second heart attack within a year of
their first one, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term depression is common after a heart attack. The new
findings suggest, however, that if depression lingers and there is
no support from family, friends or mental health professionals, a
second heart attack is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's that chronic depression that's so troubling -- about half
of them remain depressed,'' said lead researcher Nancy
Frasure-Smith of the Montreal Heart Institute. ''That's not
something that just goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in Monday's issue of Circulation, an
American Heart Association journal.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers surveyed 887 people who had suffered heart
attacks. About a third reported lingering depression after their
attacks. Within a year, 7.5 percent of those died of heart disease
compared with 2.5 percent of the two-thirds who did not report
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Knox of the National Institutes of Health said the
findings are further proof that the psychological health of heart
patients is just as important as their physical health.
</P>
<P>
   In a study released in August, Carnegie Mellon University
researchers found that patients with lower measures of self-esteem,
optimism and feelings of control were more likely to experience a
second blockage within six months than those with better attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 subjects in the Carnegie Mellon study had undergone an
angioplasty, in which a balloon is used to clear a blockage in a
blood vessel.

<HEADLINE> 6 Shot At Washington National Zoo  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A feud between youths at the National Zoo
ended in a hail of gunfire Monday evening, wounding six children at
one of the capital's most popular tourist sites. A 12-year-old boy
was in grave condition.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Brian Lee, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire
and Emergency Medical Services, said one boy suffered grave wounds
to the head. The other victims ranged in age from 11 to 16 and most
were listed in critical or serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, police were still seeking a gunman, circling the
zoo in helicopters and investigating whether shots were fired by
more than one youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking into the possibility that it is gang-related,
but we are not certain,'' Police Chief Charles Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution, is one of the
most visited sites in Washington, drawing 3 million local residents
and visiting tourists each year. Nestled inside one of northwest
Washington's wealthiest neiughborhoods, it has seldom experienced
violence and was better known for the rare Chinese pandas it housed
for over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting shortly after 6 p.m. EDT, the zoo
was playing host to an African-American family celebration day, a
century-old tradition. The gunfire in broad daylight stunned
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not bringing them back. These are my grandkids. It is not
safe,'' said Sandra Edwards, who was visiting the zoo with her
grandchildren when she heard the shots and saw youths fighting.
</P>
<P>
   One girl was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the
chest, and at least three others were listed in critical condition
A seventh victim suffered a seizure, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred near the entrance along
Connecticut Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   Nakisha Johnson, 17, said she saw one young man open fire after
a feud between youths became violent. She said the children who
were wounded were caught in the middle of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just shooting at the people he was fighting'' but
struck the children bystanders, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo planned to remain closed Tuesday. ''It is just a
terrible, terrible tragedy. Our hearts go out to the families,''
zoo spokesman Robert Hoage said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was thrown
from one group of youths at some other youths in a crowd near the
zoo gate. A piece of glass struck a young woman in the face, and
then shots rang out, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams visited Children's Hospital to console
victims' families. Three of the wounded were taken there and all
were in critical condition, said Dr. Marty Eichelberger, the chief
trauma surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the shooting, Vice President Al Gore
announced the shootings at a Democratic fund-raiser in New York
City, bringing gasps from the audience that included actress Lauren
Bacall. ''We really have to have mandatory child safety trigger
locks,'' Gore told the crowd, sounding a frequent administration
theme.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was established by Congress in 1889 as part of the
Smithsonian Institution. It covers 163 wooded acres along Rock
Creek in the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though located on one of the capital's main boulevards, it has
seldom experienced violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Little Rock, Ark., woman was found mauled to death in
the lion exhibit. Police and the medical examiner ruled the death a
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, a group of teens killed an Australian black swan
by dropping a large rock on the bird as it slept in its enclosure.
The youths fled before police could catch them.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A feud between two youths turned violent today as gunfire
rang through the National Zoo leaving six children wounded. A 12-year-old boy
was in grave condition. Capt. Brian Lee, a spokesman for the District of
Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services, said one boy suffered grave wounds
to the head and the others did not appear to have life-threatening injuries.

Government Mulls Microsoft Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states
that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways
to break up the company as a way to stop its anticompetitive practices, a source
close to the talks said today. Microsoft denounced as ''extreme and radical''
rumored government proposals today to break up the software giant. However, any
kind of divestiture is part of a ''full array of options'' being discussed, the
source said. Another person familiar with the talks said the plaintiffs are also
considering temporary sanctions that could be imposed against Microsoft while
the case makes its way to the appeals court.

Justice Dept: Elian Case Handled OK
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to keep a federal court decision intact that would
return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, the Justice Department said today that U.S.
officials have properly weighed the wishes of the 6-year-old boy's father
against the asylum request from family relatives in Miami. ''It would be a
substantial intrusion into the realm of parental authority for a distant
relative to be able to trigger government procedures concerning the parent's
6-year-old son that could seriously disrupt the parent-child relationship and
family stability,'' the department said in an 83-page appeals court filing in
Atlanta.

   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The federal judge presiding over the Branch Davidians'

of the plaintiffs' claims today. The government had asked U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith to reject three of the five major aspects in the civil lawsuit --
that federal agents erred in not bringing in armored firefighting equipment;
that they wrongly held back firefighters as the compound burned; and that using
tanks to push into the compound deviated from the operations plan the attorney
general approved.

blocked the path of the bulldozer and scuffled with Palestinians, drawing
Palestinian police who brawled with the Israeli troops. Palestinians have
repeatedly complained that sewage from the settlements in the Gaza Strip either
passes through or is dumped into Palestinian areas, causing health problems and
contaminating coastal waters.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With 187 countries committed to the Nuclear

countries -- India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba -- drew mention in comments of
many ministers at the start of a four-week conference to review progress
implementing the treaty. The treaty, which went into force in 1970, calls for

the team will respect any of its employees' decisions to take the day off. The
Marlins play San Francisco at home tomorrow night. Dombrowski said any of the
team's front-office workers, players and coaches would be excused, but not
stadium employees.

<HEADLINE> AU Goes From Colonial to Patriot  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite protests from athletes and objections
from coaches, American University President Benjamin Ladner said
Monday his school will leave the Colonial Athletic Association and
seek admittance to the Patriot League.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Patriot League, considered a formality, the
move will take effect in the 2001-02 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ends more than a month of contentious debate in
which athletes marched on campus to protest the move and several
said they would consider transferring if it were carried through.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes said they did not want to play in a less competitive
league. Coaches from sports other than men's and women's basketball
also expressed reservations over the move, which was generally seen
as an attempt by Ladner to save money.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the university, Ladner conceded a
financial motivation and said the decision was not ''strictly an
athletics one.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision has been made with the broad interests of the
entire university in mind,'' Ladner said. ''It has significant and
positive ramifications not only for our athletes, but also for our
other students, the alumni, our academic standing and funding
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriot League schools award scholarships only in basketball,
while the CAA allows its members to offer scholarships in all
varsity sports. In an effort to lure American, Patriot League
officials have said AU can keep offering scholarships in sports
other than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But some who voiced objections said they expect AU to reduce
coaching staffs and scholarships once the move is made.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot League recruited American because it needs an eighth
member to keep its automatic bid to the NCAA basketball tournament.
The league is comprised of Army, Bucknell, Colgate, Holy Cross,
Lafayette, Lehigh and Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial will drop to eight members -- George Mason, James
Madison, Richmond, North Carolina-Wilmington, Virginia
Commonwealth, William &AMP; Mary, Old Dominion and East Carolina.
However, East Carolina is leaving for Conference USA in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   Ladner said the move would align American with a cluster of
mainly private schools in an area from which AU draws a large
portion of its students. About 30 percent of AU's enrollment comes
from the Patriot League's area, compared to 5 percent from the CAA
region, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not widespread transfers, the switch should give
American a better chance at a winning record in men's basketball
for the first time since 1990-91. The school recently fired coach
Art Perry and replaced him with former Virginia coach Jeff Jones.

<HEADLINE> Oilers' Goalie Bill Ranford Retires  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Bill Ranford, who played 15 seasons as
an NHL goalie, retired Monday from the Edmonton Oilers -- the team
with which he won two Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Goaltending is tough on the body and I wanted to be able to
walk away from the game rather than crawl away from it,'' said the
35-year-old veteran, who played parts of 10 seasons with the
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Ranford also played for Boston, Washington, Tampa Bay and
Detroit -- all since the 1995-96 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last four years, we've moved around a little,'' said
Ranford, who made his NHL debut with the Bruins in the 1985-86
season before returning a decade later to Boston. ''My youngest
daughter turned five a week ago and has not lived longer in one
place than seven months. I feel I owe it to her, let her start
school in one spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranford, who rejoined the Oilers prior to this season, said the
best moments of his career came in Edmonton. He arrived in 1988
just in time for a playoff run that ended in a Stanley Cup, when he
backed up Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   Another championship followed in 1990, as well as the Conn
Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP. Ranford was named team MVP for
four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was in goal for Canada's world hockey championship
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers were eliminated in the first round of this year's
playoffs, losing in five games to the defending Stanley Cup
champion Dallas Stars.

Ontario Pushes To Eliminate Conditional Sentences
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Ontario's attorney general wants to ensure people
guilty of violent crimes serve time in jail, not time in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Flaherty said Monday he has issued a directive to the
province's Crown prosecutors telling them it's inappropriate to
recommend conditional sentences to violent criminals, sex offenders
and drivers who cause death or serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conditional sentences for serious and violent crimes must
stop,'' he told a news conference outside the city's Don Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty also wants Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to
eliminate conditional sentences, which were introduced by the
federal Liberals in September of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Conditional sentences allow offenders who would otherwise be
imprisoned for up to two years less one day to serve time in the
community.

Students Urged To Report Harassment, Teasing
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Students must drop their code of silence and alert
authorities to harassment and teasing in their midst, says the
principal of the high school where five people were stabbed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the messages Michael Jordan will be delivering
this morning to his 650 students at Cairine Wilson secondary school
as they return to class after the four-day holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is credited with disarming a knife-wielding 15-year-old
boy last Thursday after a youth slashed four fellow students and a
teaching assistant during a lunch-break rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports over the weekend suggested the youth was often
teased, had talked of suicide last autumn and had been counting
down the days to the one-year anniversary of the massacre at
Columbine high school in Colorado, which coincided almost to the
minute with his own attack.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the Ottawa school board and Cairine Wilson have
programs in place to deal with harassment and troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injuries inflicted in the stabbings was
life-threatening and all the victims have been released from
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Armenian Genocide To Be Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Armenian genocide will be studied alongside
the Holocaust in Israeli schools, Israel's education minister
announced Monday at a commemoration of the killing of an estimated
1.5 million Armenians.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is likely to upset Turkey, Israel's closest
ally in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick education minister Yossi Sarid said Israel, which
commemorates the murder of six million Jews during the German
occupation of Europe from 1939-45, should be especially sensitive
to the deaths of some 1.5 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman
Turks from 1915 to 1923.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this day, we, the Jews, the victims of the Holocaust, test
our attitude to the pains of others,'' Sarid said in remarks
distributed to the press before his speech in the crowded St. James
Armenian Orthodox church in Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey says 300,000 Armenians died in the deportation, but
rejects accusations of genocide, saying they were killed during
civil war. The Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv would not respond to a
request for comment on Sarid's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Turkey have conducted joint military exercises, and
are major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's curriculum will include a book written in 1929 by a
Prague-born Jew, Franz Werfel, about the Armenian suffering, Sarid
said. Werfel wrote ''The 40 Days of Moussa Dag'' after he witnessed
the plight of the Armenian refugees in Damascus on his way to the
Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book, which appeared in Germany in the spring of 1933,
shocked millions of people,'' Sarid said. ''Adolf Hitler was
already in power. 'The 40 Days of Moussa Dag' was thrown into the
fires, together with other forbidden books.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferop Sahagian, a member of the Jerusalem Council for the
Commemoration of the Armenian Genocide, said Sarid's decision did
not go far enough. He noted that Israel's parliament, the Knesset,
had yet to pass a declarative resolution condemning the genocide.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eight parliaments, including Europe's, have recognized
the genocide, Sahagian said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's Holocaust Memorial welcomed Sarid's announcement,
saying the study of the Armenian suffering could only aide in
teaching about the atrocities suffered by the Jewish people in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yad Vashem does not think that this could damage the study of
the Holocaust but the opposite,'' the memorial said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid, who heads a dovish junior party in Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's Labor-led government, upset Barak when he introduced works
by a nationalist Palestinian into the curriculum, and when he
blocked funds to an ultra-Orthodox school system Sarid says is rife
with mismanagement. Barak, who assumed power last July, is under
pressure to replace Sarid.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Begins In Xerox Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a
copier repairman accused of killing seven of his Xerox Corp.
co-workers last fall in one of the nation's deadliest workplace
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Byran Uyesugi, 40, is accused of firing a Glock 9 mm
semiautomatic handgun more than two dozen times at co-workers who
had gathered for a Nov. 2 meeting to discuss Uyesugi's light
workload.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys do not dispute that Uyesugi, a 15-year Xerox
employee, was the gunman but say he suffers from delusions and
lacks the ability to distinguish between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Three court-appointed mental health experts concluded earlier
this year that Uyesugi suffers from schizophrenia and a delusional
disorder that causes him to believe he is being persecuted by
others.
</P>
<P>
   However, the experts said Uyesugi knows right from wrong and can
obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people were summoned to Circuit Court Monday in
the pool for 12 jurors and four alternates. Jury selection is
expected to take at least two weeks. The trial is scheduled to
begin May 15 and last six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Anti-whaling Activist Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- An anti-whaling activist who suffered a
broken shoulder when a Coast Guard boat ran over her jet ski during
a tribal whale hunt was released on her own recognizance Monday
after an initial appearance in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Erin Abbott was charged with violating a ''moving exclusionary
zone'' around Makah tribal members who were hunting gray whales
last week off the northwestern tip of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was filed Friday, a day after Abbott was injured by a
motorized Coast Guard inflatable boat as she attempted to prevent
Makah hunters in a canoe from killing a whale.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah have not yet killed a whale during a spring hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, 24, of Seattle, appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate
Judge J. Kelley Arnold, who scheduled a preliminary hearing for May
5. Abbott has not yet entered a plea.
</P>
<P>
   She is charged with violating a 500-yard exclusion zone enforced
by the Coast Guard around the Makahs' hand-carved whaling canoe and
motorized support boat.
</P>
<P>
   The zone was declared last spring, during hunts leading to the
first Makah kill of a gray whale in some 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction for violating the zone carries a maximum sentence of
six years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Government Mulls Microsoft Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states
that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways
to break up the company as a way to stop its anticompetitive practices, a source
close to the talks said today. Microsoft denounced as ''extreme and radical''
rumored government proposals today to break up the software giant. However, any
kind of divestiture is part of a ''full array of options'' being discussed, the
source said. Another person familiar with the talks said the plaintiffs are also
considering temporary sanctions that could be imposed against Microsoft while
the case makes its way to the appeals court.

Justice Dept: Elian Case Handled OK

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to keep a federal court decision intact that would
return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, the Justice Department said today that U.S.
officials have properly weighed the wishes of the 6-year-old boy's father
against the asylum request from family relatives in Miami. ''It would be a
substantial intrusion into the realm of parental authority for a distant
relative to be able to trigger government procedures concerning the parent's
6-year-old son that could seriously disrupt the parent-child relationship and
family stability,'' the department said in an 83-page appeals court filing in

of the plaintiffs' claims today. The government had asked U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith to reject three of the five major aspects in the civil lawsuit --
that federal agents erred in not bringing in armored firefighting equipment;
that they wrongly held back firefighters as the compound burned; and that using
tanks to push into the compound deviated from the operations plan the attorney
general approved.

blocked the path of the bulldozer and scuffled with Palestinians, drawing
Palestinian police who brawled with the Israeli troops. Palestinians have
repeatedly complained that sewage from the settlements in the Gaza Strip either
passes through or is dumped into Palestinian areas, causing health problems and

countries -- India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba -- drew mention in comments of
many ministers at the start of a four-week conference to review progress

taken from his great-uncle's home, Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said
the team will respect any of its employees' decisions to take the day off. The
Marlins play San Francisco at home tomorrow night. Dombrowski said any of the
team's front-office workers, players and coaches would be excused, but not
stadium employees.

Fritz W. Alexander II
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fritz W. Alexander II, a former judge on New
York State's Court of Appeals and a deputy mayor under Mayor David
Dinkins, died Saturday of cancer. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Following New York University School of Law, he became an
associate in what is now the firm of Demov, Morris, Levin &AMP;
Hammerling. In 1958 he became a founding partner of the firm of
Dyett, Alexander and Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's judicial career began in 1970 when he accepted an
interim appointment to the Civil Court in New York City. Later that
year he was elected to serve a 10-year term on the same court. He
also served in State Supreme Court and the Appellate Division
before being appointed to the Court of Appeals by then-Gov. Mario
Cuomo in 1985. He was the first black judge to serve a full term on
New York's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   He left the court in 1992 to serve as deputy mayor for public
safety under his former law partner, Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
Jeanie Austin
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Jeanie Austin, co-chairman of the
Republican National Committee from 1989 to 1992, died Saturday of
cancer. She was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Second in power and influence to fellow co-chairman Lee Atwater
during the Bush administration, Austin was a tireless party
builder, traveling around the country and urging working people --
especially women -- to vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   She helped organize the Orange County Republican Party, find
candidates and raise money -- quickly making it the state's
Republican stronghold. In 1984 she mounted an improbable bid to
become chairman of the state party.
</P>
<P>
   Under her leadership, Republican voter registration climbed from
36 percent to 42 percent, Bob Martinez became the first Republican
elected governor in 20 years and Connie Mack won the U.S. Senate
seat held for 18 years by Democrat Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
Ulla Isaksson
</P>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Ulla Isaksson, who wrote the
manuscripts for two Ingmar Bergman movies and was honored for her
writings about women's issues, died Monday after a long illness.
She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the manuscripts for the Bergman-directed films
''The Virgin Spring'' (1960) and ''Brink of Life'' (1958) saw her
early work marked by tension and religious conflict, while her
later novels focused on erotic motifs, women's issues and raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   Isaksson wrote her first novel, ''The Tree'', in 1940. Other
works included ''Paradise Square'', ''The Women's House'', ''The
Birthday'', and ''The Book About E'', which was about her husband,
Erik Hjalmar Linder who died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She and Linder also co-wrote a two-part biography of Swedish
novelist Elin Wagner that is considered the foremost work on the
feminist writer, who died in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Isaksson received an honorary doctorate degree in philosophy
from Stockholm University in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish literary society De Nio also awarded her $11,400
last year for her ''penetrating, clear and bold depiction of
women's reality.''
</P>
<P>
Philip Keenan
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Philip Keenan, whose study of the stars
helped astronomers understand their nature and evolution, died
Thursday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan helped write the Atlas of Stellar Spectra in 1943. Its
system of classifying stars by their spectra, or the wavelengths of
the light they emit, remains in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan became an assistant professor at Ohio State and a staff
member at the Perkins Observatory in 1946. He remained on the
faulty until 1976 when he became professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
Al Purdy
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Al Purdy, who captured the
common voice through use of vernacular and other touches to become
one of Canada's greatest poets, died Friday of lung cancer. He was
81.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-decade career, Purdy published 33 books of poetry and
won the Governor General's Literary Award in 1966 for ''The Cariboo
Horses'' and in 1986 for ''Collected Poems, 1956-86.''
</P>
<P>
   His final work, a 652-page collection titled ''Beyond
Remembering,'' will come out later this year. Purdy also wrote a
novel, nine collections of essays and an autobiography.
</P>
<P>
Jay Robinson
</P>
<P>
   WILMINGTON (AP) -- Jay Robinson, the former Charlotte school
superintendent and state education board chairman who helped launch
the state's aggressive school accountability program, died Monday
of lung cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was persuaded by Gov. Jim Hunt in 1993 to delay
retirement to become chairman of the state board of education,
where he helped launch the ABCs of Public Education testing
program.
</P>
<P>
   The ABCs plan grades schools on how well their students perform
on end-of-grade tests. Assistance teams of teachers and
administrators are sent to help the worst performing schools, while
educators at schools that met or exceeded expectations receive
bonuses.

Charles Barnard Stewart
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Retired Brig. Gen. Charles Barnard Stewart, a
World War II fighter pilot who became a nuclear physicist and high
official of the old Atomic Energy Commission, died Thursday of
heart failure. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, one of the few Army Air Force pilots to get airborne in
search of Japanese vessels during the attack on Pearl Harbor in
1941, was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and
served with the 7th Fighter Command on Oahu. He joined the Saipan
invasion task force and became deputy commander of the Air Defense
Command of the Mariana Islands during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he earned a doctorate in nuclear physics at Ohio
State University, worked in weapons development in New Mexico and
was deputy director of the Division of Military Applications for
the Atomic Energy Commission, which later became the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years before he retired from the military in
1966, he was Air Force director of nuclear safety in Albuquerque,
N.M..

   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- An overloaded 1950's-era bus
slammed into a tree on the main highway along Honduras' Atlantic
coast and caught fire, killing at least 22 people and injuring 58,
police reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the vehicle was speeding when the accident occurred
late Sunday, 70 miles north Tegucigalpa, the capital. Passengers on
the rented bus were returning home from Holy Week vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old driver and owner of the bus, Marco Tulio
Turcios, survived the crash without injuries. He told local media
that he tried to stop after police flagged him down at a checkpoint
on a curve in the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brakes didn't respond, they failed,'' Turcios said. Police
roadblocks were set up throughout the country to cut down on
speeding during Easter week.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the bus was carrying 80 passengers, 20 more than its
rated capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what charges might be brought
against the driver.

<HEADLINE> Source: Beathard Retiring Next Week  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers general manager Bobby
Beathard likely will announce his retirement after this weekend's
minicamp, a team source told The Associated Press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard, 63, has been considering retirement for several weeks,
and all signs have been pointing to him ending a 37-year NFL career
in which he built Super Bowl teams on both coasts. He also often
left fans flabbergasted with his draft-day gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been so strong about Beathard's future that it
would be a shock if he chose to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard was having second thoughts, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. But when asked if he thought Beathard
was going to retire for sure, the source said: ''I believe so.''
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was for Beathard to announce his retirement
during the minicamp, so that team president Dean Spanos could
explain the order of succession to the team, the source said. The
plan now is for the announcement to be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any event, it sounds like in the next 7-10 days something
will happen,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com reported Monday that Beathard would announce his
retirement next week. It did not cite a source.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard, who has been heavily criticized for his player
acquisitions the last several years, is under contract through the
2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Before and during the draft on April 15-16, Beathard said
nothing to dispel rumors he was retiring. He said then he would
meet with Spanos after the minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get all pumped up and excited about this because of the
draft and everything. Now you do it and you want to see what they
look like,'' he said after the draft concluded. ''I'll probably go
through minicamp and see.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking on the other side, it's exciting thinking about doing
it,'' he said, referring to retiring. ''They both are. I go back
and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Beathard, who's been with the Chargers for 10 years, didn't
return a phone call seeking comment. A team spokesman said Beathard
still planned to sit down with Spanos after minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard likes the direction the Chargers are headed under coach
Mike Riley, who led them to an 8-8 record last season, so he would
have little trouble stepping aside now.
</P>
<P>
   If Beathard goes through with his retirement plans, Spanos wants
an organizer/administrator at the top, the source said. Ed McGuire,
the coordinator of football operations who handles contract
negotiations, would keep that role, probably with a vice
president's title, the source said. Billy Devaney, the director of
player personnel, would make the decisions on player moves.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation Riley would be involved in the power
structure, but he likely would stick to coaching, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire and Spanos didn't return phone calls, and Devaney and
Riley declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Beathard was associated with seven Super Bowl teams in his
career, starting when he was a scout for the 1966 Kansas City
Chiefs and continuing with the 1972 and '73 Miami Dolphins, for
whom he was director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   He built three Super Bowl teams as GM of the Washington
Redskins, winning two, then put together San Diego's only Super
Bowl team, in 1994. That team was routed 49-26 by the San Francisco
49ers, and the Chargers have been back to the playoffs only once
since then.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, out since April
9 with a bruised left thumb, was activated Monday by the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had been put on the 15-day disabled list retroactive
to April 9, a day after he injured his thumb diving for a line
drive hit by Boston's Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, 32, was hitting .412 with one double and five RBIs in
five games before he was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Angels shortstop was out from March 22 until
June 22 with a broken bone in his left arm, a spring training
injury.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for DiSarcina, the Angels optioned infielder Keith
Johnson to Triple-A Edmonton. Johnson, 29, was 2-of-3 with two runs
scored in five appearances for Anaheim. He got his first major
league hit on April 18 at Toronto, a single off Pedro Borbon.

House announced an investigation into Saturday's pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of this had to happen,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart asserted, suggesting the ''intransigent position'' of the
6-year-old's Miami relatives forced the government's armed seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart accused Republicans of ''wild statements,'' singling
out House Majority Whip Tom DeLay for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But leading Republicans pursued a verbal indictment of both
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for the raid that
resulted in the boy's reunion with his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. -- who
presided over 1998 impeachment hearings against President Clinton --
announced his panel's staff would begin ''a preliminary inquiry''
into the tactics used to seize the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inquiry will focus on whether the use of such force was
necessary or appropriate under all of the circumstances,'' Hyde
said in a statement, adding that he hoped the inquiry could be
bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he was undertaking the effort at the request of House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who said he was ''appalled'' by
Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., meanwhile, planned
to meet with Reno and other top Justice Department officials in the
Capitol on Tuesday morning to discuss Saturday's raid.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 invitees included two Democrats who have been supportive
of the administration: Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Lott did not want to turn the matter into ''a
three-ring circus,'' his spokesman, John Czwartacki said, ''We are
all curious as to how the attorney general answers some of the
questions that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno will be accompanied by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
and possibly by Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris M. Meissner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno defended the tactics anew Monday evening, saying, ''What
you saw was a law enforcement operation that went the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on PBS' ''NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' Reno said she
struggled with different options before giving the go-ahead for the
seizure, including ''going up there myself'' to try to claim the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it was clear that the crowds outside ''were going
to intervene in any attempt to extract Elian from the house.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, she believed she had no realistic choice
but to proceed with the seizure. ''Here was, in effect, a little
boy being kept from his father,'' she said. ''It was time he was
returned to his daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has
indicated he was considering holding hearings. He asked Reno in a
letter to provide his panel with ''all documents'' related to the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a House Judiciary Committee member,
said the panel should investigate what he called use of ''an
increasing pattern of force -- excessive force'' by the
administration in dealing with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian remain secluded with his father at Andrews Air
Force Base in the Maryland suburbs. His Florida relatives, who are
also in the area, did not make another attempt to see him after
being rebuffed twice over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Elian
and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would leave the air base and
take up residence at the Wye Plantation, a secluded conference
center on Maryland's Eastern Shore that was the site of the October
1968 peace talks among the Israelis, Palestinians and the United
States. It was uncertain when the move would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Miami, Cuban-Americans upset about the case called
for a general strike Tuesday to turn Miami into a ''dead city.''
The protesters pledged to shut the town down quietly, with none of
the violent protests that broke out after Elian was seized
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Lockhart defended the government actions,
saying the seizure ''was done in an appropriate way, it was done
safely, there was no one hurt, the boy has been reunited with the
father.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's got to take a deep breath ... there are a lot of
wild claims being made right now,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the allegations were suggestions by some of
Elian's Florida family members that smiling pictures of the boy
with his father -- after their reunion at Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland -- had been doctored, or that the boy had been
given drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said emphatically
that Elian ''wasn't drugged'' and that any such suggestion was
''preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart accused Republicans in general of seeking to politicize
the matter and had particular criticism for DeLay, R-Texas, who
promised hearings into the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a frightening event, that American citizens now can
expect that the executive branch on their own can decide on whether
to raid a home,'' DeLay said. ''I was outraged, I was sickened, and
afterward I was ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lockhart: ''Tom DeLay went on television yesterday and said
there was no warrant in this case, that they didn't get a search
warrant. It's factually not true, and easily knowable, if you're
not trying to play politics.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Justice Department released previously sealed
court papers stating that U.S. immigration officials had ''probable
cause to believe that Elian Gonzalez is being unlawfully
restrained'' at the Gonzalez family residence in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit in support of a request for a search warrant asks
permission from a federal magistrate to execute the search warrant
at night ''in order to meet the least amount of resistance from any
crowd gathered outside the home, ensure the safety of Elian
Gonzalez and protect the officers executing the warrant.''

<HEADLINE> One Dead; Five Hurt In Zoo Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A feud between youths at the National Zoo
ended in a hail of gunfire Monday evening, killing one boy and
wounding five other children at one of the capital's most popular
tourist sites.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating whether the shooting was gang related
and sought at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into
groups of youths after a confrontation escalated to bottle throwing
and then shots, according to authorities and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The victims ranged in age from 11 to 16 and were attending a
century-old post-Easter gathering at the zoo celebrating
African-American families. A high-ranking police official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said a boy, either 11 or 12 years old,
who was shot in the head died after being taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl was in serious condition with a wound to the
pelvis, a 14-year-old boy was in serious condition with a leg
wound, and three other youths were hospitalized with less serious
injuries, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, police still circled the zoo in helicopters. ''We
are looking into the possibility that it is gang-related, but we
are not certain,'' Police Chief Charles Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo, a unit of the Smithsonian Institution, is one of the
most visited sites in Washington, drawing 3 million local residents
and tourists each year. Nestled inside one of northwest
Washington's wealthiest neighborhoods, it has seldom experienced
violence and was better known for the rare Chinese pandas it housed
for over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire shortly after 6 p.m. EDT in broad daylight stunned
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not bringing them back. These are my grandkids. It is not
safe,'' said Sandra Edwards, who was visiting the zoo with her
grandchildren when she heard the shots and saw youths fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the shootings, a seventh victim suffered a
seizure and a pregnant woman was taken to the hospital after going
into apparent labor, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred near the entrance along
Connecticut Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Chief Terrance Gainer said police suspected a 9 mm
handgun was used and roped off two shooting scenes -- one just
outside the zoo entrance and the other about 300 feet inside the
zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Nakisha Johnson, 17, said she saw one young man open fire after
a feud between youths became violent. She said the children who
were wounded were caught in the middle of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just shooting at the people he was fighting'' but
struck the children bystanders, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo planned to remain closed Tuesday. ''It is just a
terrible, terrible tragedy. Our hearts go out to the families,''
zoo spokesman Robert Hoage said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the shooting occurred when a bottle was thrown
from one group of youths at some other youths in a crowd near the
zoo gate. A piece of glass struck a young woman in the face, and
then shots rang out, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams visited Children's Hospital to console
victims' families. Three of the wounded were taken there and all
were in critical condition, said Dr. Marty Eichelberger, the chief
trauma surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after the shooting, Vice President Al Gore
announced the shootings at a Democratic fund-raiser in New York
City, bringing gasps from the audience that included actress Lauren
Bacall. ''We really have to have mandatory child safety trigger
locks,'' Gore told the crowd, sounding a frequent administration
theme.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo was established by Congress in 1889 as part of the
Smithsonian Institution. It covers 163 wooded acres along Rock
Creek in the heart of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though located on one of the capital's main boulevards, it has
seldom experienced violence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a Little Rock, Ark., woman was found mauled to death in
the lion exhibit. Police and the medical examiner ruled the death a
suicide.

<HEADLINE> New Russian Auditor Asks For Help  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The newly appointed head of the Russian
parliament's auditing office said Monday that he needs more help
from Russian security and law-enforcement agencies to investigate
money-laundering, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Stepashin made the comment after meeting with U.S.
Representative Jim Leach, head of the House Banking and Financial
Service Committee, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a former prime minister, is one of the few major
Russian politicians with a clean reputation. He was elected by the
State Duma last week to be head of the chamber responsible for
auditing government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The main topic of Stepashin's meeting with Leach was the Bank of
New York money-laundering scandal, which U.S. prosecutors say
involved up to $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Russian agencies should do more to help investigate that case,
Stepashin said, adding that an FBI agent at the meeting complained
that Russian authorities often do not respond to U.S. inquiries,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also quoted Stepashin as saying the Bank of New York
case included funds lent to Russia by the International Monetary
Fund, but did not provide details.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF says audits have not produced evidence that any of the
money lent to Russia was misused.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules On Columbine Tapes  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The families of Columbine victims must immediately
be given videotapes from the day of the shootings and must get
copies of a sheriff's report by May 15, a judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a response to six families' lawsuits against the
Jefferson County sheriff under the state open-records law. They
want copies of helicopter footage of the April 20, 1999, assault
and tapes from school surveillance cameras showing the two student
gunmen opening fire in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very pleased with finally having a deadline of the
sheriff getting this report to them,'' said lawyer James Rouse, who
represents some of the families who sued to get the tapes and
report.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said the judge ordered the sheriff's office to release the
report to the families by May 15 whether it is complete or not. It
will not include the roughly 200 volumes of backup material,
including eyewitness and ballistic reports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's supposed to the unedited version,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families contend that the sheriff's office has
stonewalled them on details of the shootings and has taken too long
to complete the report. Officials say it likely will be released in
late May.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office said its spokesman would not be available
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine lawsuits were filed last week against the sheriff's office,
claiming the agency mishandled the response to the country's
deadliest school shooting. Allegations include that one of the
students was fatally hit by police fire and a sharpshooter was
denied permission to shoot through a library window at one of the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   The families' frustration was aggravated when the sheriff's
office released information to the media before they got to see it.
A Time magazine reporter watched videotapes on which gunmen Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold discussed their plans and then wrote a
story.
</P>
<P>
   Rouse said he was not sure if the judge's order on the tapes and
report applies to other people who are suing over the sheriff
department's handling of the assault.

<HEADLINE> Bush Helps Dedicate Border Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) -- Arguing strongly for open trade,
George W. Bush made a quick trip to Mexico Monday to help dedicate
a new border bridge to Texas. As president, he said, ''I will work
to create an entire hemisphere in free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate said he would seek ''fast-track''
negotiating status from Congress to expand free trade in the
Western Hemisphere -- something the Democratic administration has
sought for years.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's Democratic presidential opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, supports more open trade, the administration has faced strong
opposition within its own party, especially from labor
organizations concerned about workers rights and losing jobs to
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, appearing with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, did not
mention Gore. He hailed the bridge as a new link to free trade and
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor spoke a bit of Spanish to welcome the mostly
Mexican crowd. Then he said he wanted to build on the North
American Free Trade Agreement to bring other countries throughout
Latin America under the free trade umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ''As president, I will work to create an entire hemisphere in
free trade,'' he said. ''I will work to extend the benefits of
NAFTA from the northernmost Alaska to the tip of Cape Horn.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has unsuccessfully sought from Congress the
negotiating authority he would need to achieve the same objective.
Clinton pushed NAFTA through Congress in 1993 over labor
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo, Texas, just across the Rio Grande, is the largest inland
port in the United States. The city has nearly doubled in
population in the past decade, mostly because of the trade
generated because of the free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The new World Trade Bridge, a $128 million span, is the fourth
international bridge connecting Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
Local, state and federal governments in the United States
contributed a total of $107.3 million to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo-only bridge took six years to complete. It was
designed to handle commercial traffic between Mexico and the United
States and to alleviate heavy truck traffic -- some days totaling up
to 10,000 trucks per day -- over downtown bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, is moving toward a final decision on who will
be general chairman of his campaign, work that has been essentially
done by his top fund-raiser and close friend Don Evans. Aides said
Evans has begun chairing meetings at the campaign's Austin
headquarters and is the most likely candidate, although Bush is
still weighing other options.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidential campaign Bush has touted his
experience in dealing with Mexico. He said that $200 billion in
goods are traded each year between the United States and Mexico and
half of all U.S. exports to Mexico travel through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, speaking in Spanish, described Bush as a friend of
Mexico, saying the governor had ''a profound appreciation for our
people and our culture.'' Zedillo also said Mexico has a friend in
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican president said he hopes the World Trade Bridge helps
to bring more jobs and better salaries to the people of Mexico --
and helps reduce illegal trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a dignified border on both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign distributed a policy statement that
said he supports admission of China and Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''As president, Governor Bush will work to open the China market
-- and other key export markets -- for America's farmers and
ranchers,'' the campaign statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to elaborate on his trade positions later in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Nuevo Laredo was Bush's sixth meeting with Zedillo
since becoming governor in 1995. Last September, Bush joined
Zedillo in inaugurating a new international bridge linking Eagle
Pass, Texas, and Piedras Negras, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Laredo bridge actually opened more than a week ago. Bush
declined to attend an opening ceremony on the Texas side on April
14, which offended some Laredo city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush received the invitation
to attend Zedillo's dedication ceremony first and that he had a
longtime commitment with family friends on the Friday of the U.S.
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Furrow Lawyers Against Death Penalty  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Public defenders for white supremacist Buford
O. Furrow asked a judge Monday to prevent the government from
seeking the death penalty in the Jewish center shooting and the
killing of a Filipino-American postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefs submitted just before the filing deadline, the
lawyers offered wide-ranging arguments including a general attack
on the federal death penalty statute as unconstitutional and claims
that the grand jury that indicted Furrow did not authorize seeking
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers did not address a pressing issue in the case --
whether they plan to present a mental illness defense.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is charged with killing letter carrier Joseph Ileto just
hours after he allegedly wounded three boys, a teen-age girl and a
woman at the North Valley Jewish Community Center. Furrow has
pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The documents argued that the ''aggravating factors'' cited by
the government in seeking the death penalty for Furrow are not
specific enough to allow a meaningful defense.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that the federal death penalty violates the
Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death penalty has resulted in the execution of innocent
people in the past, and inevitably will do so in the future,'' the
motion said.
</P>
<P>
   The government can file answering briefs before a hearing June 5
before U.S. District Judge Richard Paez on the death penalty issue.
Paez, recently was elevated to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, has not said whether he will continue to preside over the
Furrow case.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's trial has been delayed until Nov. 14.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Proposes Harder Work Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A Harvard University committee has proposed
tighter controls on outside faculty work, hoping to protect the
Harvard name and classroom quality as professors increasingly weigh
new opportunities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Online lecturing, Web-based classrooms and various dot-com
consulting jobs are among the Internet offerings now available to
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's 42-year-old policy on outside work had to be revised
to adjust to the new technologies, said Dennis Thompson, Harvard's
assistant provost and chair of the committee that recommended the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal forbids faculty to teach, conduct research or offer
consulting outside of Harvard, either in person or online, without
permission from the appropriate dean, according to a draft copy
obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Free time and vacation time are included in the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities, including Princeton, Columbia, Chicago and
Stanford, are changing their policies, too, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the changes at Harvard will ensure that full-time
students get full-time faculty, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see academic freedom at stake at all,'' he said. ''It
does limit the commercial freedom of faculty members in order to
promote the educational freedom of our students.''
</P>
<P>
   But some professors at the school in Cambridge say the proposal
would infringe on academic freedom, and is even a bit insulting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I have to justify everything I do,'' said law professor
Arthur Miller, former host of the public television show ''Miller's
Court.'' ''I find it offensive I now have to go through a process I
haven't had to go through in 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes follow Harvard's decision last fall to
force Miller to give up an online course he produced for the
Concord University School of Law, an online school founded by
Kaplan Educational Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether my contract bounds me exclusively to
Harvard Law School, or whether I have free choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has been working on the policy for about a year,
and passed out proposed changes to faculty members for input last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the policy, which still needs approval by a board
that includes the university president and seven administrators,
should be in place by the end of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nesson, director of the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society at Harvard Law School, said he wants the school to approve
of any Internet ventures he undertakes.
</P>
<P>
   He called the proposed policy an overdue step forward, saying
Harvard has been slow to recognize the value of its name on the
Internet. For example, he said, the domain names www.harvard.com
and www.harvard.net aren't owned by the university, but by a
bookstore and Web-consulting company.

<HEADLINE> Family Describes Suspected Killer  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN K. WILEY, Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The family of a man described as the prime
suspect in a series of prostitute slayings said Monday that Robert
L. Yates Jr. is a dedicated father who is ''the type of person you
would want to have for your best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates, 47, is being held in the Spokane County Jail in lieu of
$1.5 million bond on a single charge of first-degree murder in the
death of prostitute Jennifer Joseph in August 1997. County
authorities last week said Yates is a suspect in as many as 11
other homicides.
</P>
<P>
   In their first public statement, members of Yates' family said
they were shocked by the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby is a loving, caring and sensitive son, a fun-loving and
giving brother, an understanding, generous and dedicated father,
who enjoys playing ball, fishing and camping with his kids,'' the
three-paragraph statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel deeply for the families who have experienced loss,''
the statement said. ''We ask that all judgments be reserved until
the timely due process of law has been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was signed ''the Robert L. Yates family members.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates and his wife, Linda, have five children. The family is
staying in another city with Mrs. Yates' family, Spokane County
Sheriff Mark Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office is collecting school homework for two of
the Yates children and sending it to them, Sterk said.

<HEADLINE> Clintons, Gore Meet At Fund-Raiser  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On a day marked by reminders of President
Clinton's baggage, his closest partners campaigning for their own
political futures -- Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- shared a
$2-million spotlight Monday night and embraced the president's
tenure as ''one of the best investments'' American voters ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned the compliment by passing the torch. ''The
theme song of this election year ought to be the first song Tony
Bennett sang tonight, 'The Best is Yet to Come.'''
</P>
<P>
   The $2.2-million fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee marked the first time this year that ''the principals,''
as the Clintons, Gore and Tipper Gore are known in White House
shorthand, campaigned together this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has made
a core campaign issue of ''restoring honor and integrity'' to the
White House after Clinton's scandals, Gore and Mrs. Clinton eagerly
grabbed hold of the president's policy coattails.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic performance under President Bill Clinton has been
so stunning that we've all run out of adjectives to describe it,''
said Gore, the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee.
'''Great' is the least of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how her husband won this state in 1992 and 1996, the
first lady-cum-Senate candidate from New York told supporters:
''Now we can look back and say that investment you made ... was one
of the best investments that New York and New Yorkers and Americans
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples strode into a Manhattan hotel ballroom together
but schmoozed donors from separate tables.
</P>
<P>
   The president, perhaps betraying his longing to hold the stage,
was halfway up the stage steps before realizing he was supposed to
take a seat at Table 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gore worked a bit of the room -- packed by the Democratic
National Committee with celebrities and business tycoons at $1,000
apiece -- then settled at Table 4.
</P>
<P>
   The paid talent, Bennett and comic Jon Stewart, who got laughs
with Elian Gonzalez jokes, were mere sideshow to the political
crosscurrents among partners who have struck out in their own
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had kisses for decorator Martha Stewart and fashion
designer Vera Wang. Model Christie Brinkley, film mogul Harvey
Weinstein and actress Lauren Bacall also attended the filet mignon
dinner for 1,000, plus an assortment of intimate receptions on the
side for the DNC's biggest donors.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke movingly about seeing a kitchen worker he
met at the same hotel in 1992. He brought a hush to the crowd when
he rhetorically passed the torch to Gore:
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably know more about him than anybody but Tipper. I know
what he likes and can't stand. I know what he loves. I know when
he's having a bad day and how he deals with it. ... I feel
absolutely comfortable putting the future of my daughter, and the
grandchildren I hope she'll give us, in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the microphone last, the headliner's spot, Gore drifted
on at length about the importance of future Supreme Court nominees,
education reform and the use of public-private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republicans of ''fraud'' and ''illusion'' in their
education, tax and defense policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Gores joined hands on the day officials
reported that Independent Counsel Robert Ray has subpoenaed the
National Archives to determine whether White House officials tried
to obstruct investigations ranging from Whitewater to Monica
Lewinsky by not turning over e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is going to resist the easy political
temptations to turn this election into a referendum on the
scandals,'' said spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''But he will remind
voters of the importance of restoring honor and integrity to the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Clinton helped raise campaign funds for Rep.
Michael Forbes, who, before leaving the GOP for the Democratic
Party, voted to impeach Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the mixed signals of that $500,000 luncheon, Forbes
took a poke at Gore, joking that one of his Top 10 reasons for
switching parties was that ''I always wanted to hang around with
the guy who invented the Internet.'' Forbes has not endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's economic record is at the heart of a
compare-and-contrast strategy against Bush that Gore will roll out
beginning with an economic speech Tuesday to the Association for a
Better New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said he expected a slash-and-burn strategy from Gore
while Bush, by contrast, planned to speak in Dayton, Ohio, on
Tuesday and Wednesday at a Republican National Committee
fund-raiser in Washington about his interests in working with
Democrats. He was bringing Texas Democratic lawmakers with him to
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a powerful draw for party contributors, so far has only
helped Gore and Mrs. Clinton raise money. The last joint appearance
by the president and vice president was a Hollywood fund-raiser on
April 15. The two, and their wives, are next scheduled to appear
together at a $7 million DNC ''tribute to Clinton'' in Washington
on May 24.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 8, Orioles 2  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Cal Eldred pitched a two-hitter, retiring 26 of
the final 27 batters, as the surprising Chicago White Sox kept
rolling Monday night, beating the Baltimore Orioles 8-2 for their
sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Josh Paul hit his first major league homer, a three-run
shot in the second against Mike Mussina (0-2), who failed for the
fifth straight start to get his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, plagued by arm problems for several years and acquired
in an off-season trade, got his first victory since last Sept. 1
when he beat the Dodgers while with Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   His overpowering, 11-strikeout performance Monday night came in
his first complete game since May 1997 when he defeated the White
Sox while with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred (1-0), who won only two games last season, walked lead
off hitter Brady Anderson and then gave up an RBI double to Delino
DeShields before retiring 14 straight. Charles Johnson hit a
leadoff homer in the sixth, but Eldred didn't allow another runner.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, meanwhile, hasn't won since last Sept. 30 against the
Yankees. He gave up two more homers and has surrendered seven this
season, tying him for the AL lead. He lasted 6 1-3 innings, giving
up eight hits and seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's three-run shot in the second gave the White Sox a 5-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton led off the second with a bunt single and a
missed tag by Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick helped the inning
along. Bordick fielded Carlos Lee's grounder to short and caught
Singleton off the bag at second, but couldn't get to him before he
dove back to the base. Greg Norton then hit an RBI single before
Paul followed with a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which has always given Mussina trouble, drove the
right-hander out in the seventh as Paul tripled, Ray Durham hit an
RBI single and Frank Thomas delivered a run-scoring double. Norton
hit a solo home run off Chuck McElroy in the eighth inning to
extend the lead to 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox tied the game at 1 in the bottom half on Jose
Valentin's first homer of the season and first with the White Sox.
Notes: Chicago is 13-6, the best start through 19 games since the
1973 team had the same mark. ... Eldred is now 8-2 against the
Orioles lifetime, his best winning percentage against any American
League club. It was his first win in the AL since 1997. ... Mussina
is now 9-10 against the White Sox, his most losses against any
team. ... Cal Ripken was rested and didn't start for just the third
time in 18 games. The Orioles didn't arrive in Chicago until nearly
7 a.m. CDT Monday following an extra-inning game in Oakland on
Sunday night and then a delayed flight from the West Coast. ...
Albert Belle, who played two seasons with the White Sox, was booed
loudly every time he came to bat or made a play in right field
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Pres. Announces New Colombian Pact  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK BAJAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana announced
Monday a preliminary agreement with Colombia's second-largest rebel
army to withdraw government troops from a northern region as a
condition for opening peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, however, specified neither a timetable nor the
geographical confines for the pullout zone, announcing instead ''a
general framework of an understanding'' with the leftist National
Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN's leader, Nicolas Rodriguez, told Radionet network his
movement had reached ''a basic accord'' with the government to
convene a ''national convention'' in the pullout zone as a prelude
to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The demilitarized zone would be the second conceded to a leftist
rebel band by Pastrana since he took office in August 1998 after
running a single-issue campaign focused on promises to end 36 years
of civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana granted the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, a Switzerland-sized southern region 17 months
ago as a condition for launching peace talks that have proceeded at
a snail's pace -- without a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-inspired ELN, with an estimated 5,000 combatants, has
since New Year's tested the nation with a withering sabotage
campaign, knocking out electrical power to millions by dynamiting
power pylons and snarling major highways with attacks on commercial
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it seized everyone aboard a domestic airliner and
celebrants of a Catholic Mass to push its desire for political
recognition equal to what the FARC received.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN has released all but five of the nearly 200 airplane and
Mass hostages -- and declared an Easter week truce that coincided
with negotiations in which Colombia's ambassador to Cuba, Julio
Londono, presided over the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebel band also vowed not to cease hostilities until
granted its own demilitarized zone in its traditional stronghold in
the northern state of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   That proposed zone differs vastly, however, from the southern
region granted the FARC. Right-wing paramilitary fighters have
infiltrated the traditional ELN stronghold, which is rich in gold
and in illegal cocaine cultivation and includes Colombia's
principal waterway, the Magdalena River.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thousands of peasants have launched dayslong
protests against the demilitarized zone, snarling traffic on major
north-south highways.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pastrana and Rodriguez said international and domestic
observers would monitor the incipient peace process with the ELN.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander said the pullout zone would comprise San
Pablo and Cantagallo counties in Bolivar and Yondo county in
Antioquia state to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the present agreement we are seeking to make serious
steps in constructing a solution to the conflict by means different
from war,'' said Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Twins:
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Corey Koskie was moved up to the fifth spot in the
batting order, but was hitless in four at-bats and struck out three
times. ... Hector Carrasco struck out Paul O'Neill to end the
seventh inning, giving the reliever five straight scoreless
appearances. He has allowed only one earned run in 10 games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: IF D'Angelo Jimenez, who broke a bone in his neck
during a January car accident in the Dominican Republic, has
started throwing and said he might start swinging a bat in the next
1-2 months. ... University of Michigan quarterback and 3B prospect
Drew Henson reported the team's training complex in Tampa over the
weekend. He is expected join Double-A Norwich in the next 7-10
days. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch had an MRI, CAT scan and X-ray
examinations on his wrist injury and is expected to miss a couple
games. ''It was such a weird thing, I was just swinging the
weighted bat,'' said Knoblauch, who hurt himself Sunday in Toronto.
Red Sox-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Justin Thompson, recovering from shoulder surgery
last August while with Detroit, will start Tuesday night for
Triple-A Oklahoma. He will have a 105-pitch limit. Thompson
reported no problems with the shoulder in his previous rehab start
last Thursday for Double-A Tulsa, throwing 90 pitches. ... Royce
Clayton was batting only .160 as a leadoff hitter, but he's thrived
since he was moved to the No. 9 spot. Clayton is 8-for-11 since
moving out of the leadoff spot on Friday, raising his average to
.250.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox got back on the field after four straight
rainouts, the first time they've had four straight postponements
since April 24-28, 1975. The '75 Red Sox lost 10 straight games
after the series of rainouts. ... Boston pitchers entered Monday
night's game against the Rangers having allowed only one run their
last three games and seven in their last five.
Orioles-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: After losing an 11-inning game in Oakland on Sunday
night, the Orioles had a long trip to Chicago. Baltimore's plane
was delayed and manager Mike Hargrove said the team didn't get into
its hotel until almost 7 a.m. CDT Monday. Because of the long trip,
Hargrove didn't start Cal Ripken. Ripken had started 15 of the
Orioles' first 17 games. To rest, the Orioles also skipped batting
practice and hit in the cages. ... The talk around Comiskey Park
was still about Saturday's brawl between the White Sox and Tigers.
Hargrove said as a player he was once involved in a game where five
separate melees broke out. ''The fifth time I couldn't make it, I
was so tired,'' Hargrove said. ''I gave everything I had in the
other four.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: LHP Mike Sirotka is ready to start Tuesday against the
Orioles. He'd skipped his previous outing because of a tender
forearm. ... The White Sox still had bumps and bruises Monday from
Saturday's bench-clearing brawl with the Tigers. Manager Jerry
Manuel said he had no idea when the commissioner's office would
hand out penalties ... CF Chris Singleton was named co-player of
the week in the AL along with Toronto's Carlos Delgado. Singleton
battled .600 last week, including a 5-for-5 game against Detroit.
... RHP Aaron Myette, who broke his hand after angrily punching a
door during spring training, is scheduled to make a start in
extended spring training this week.
Indians-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel was the happiest man in the
world on Monday after watching his Indians have all three of their
weekend games in Boston rained out. Safeco Field has a retractable
roof, meaning the Indians were assured of getting in all three of
their games in Seattle even if it rained. ''It feels good to come
out and see the sun shine,'' Manuel said. ''For me, the last three
days went so slow. It was kind of boring.'' ... Indians two-time
All-Star shortstop Omar Vizquel celebrated his 33rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners are expected to bring up a starting
pitcher from Triple-A Tacoma to take RHP Freddy Garcia's place in
the rotation on Wednesday against the Indians. Garcia is on the
15-day disabled list with a small hairline fracture in his right
tibia. Manager Lou Piniella said before Monday night's game that he
definitely is leaving RHP Paul Abbott in the bullpen. ... For the
first time in his life, Garcia is on crutches this week. He is
expected to be sidelined from 4-6 weeks.
Blue Jays-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: LF Marty Cordova was a late scratch from Toronto's
lineup Monday night at Oakland. He was taken out of the lineup
because of a sore left ankle, injured on a foul ball Sunday.
Dewayne Wise replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The brother act of Jason Giambi and Jeremy Giambi has
been broken up by the Athletics, at least for now. Jeremy, hitting
just .179, was sent to Triple-A Sacramento. ... Reliever Jeff Tam's
availability was in question because of a back strain. He hurt
himself lifting weights following Saturday's game and underwent
treatment Monday.
Tigers-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Manager Phil Garner said speculation that Juan Gonzalez
will spend just one year with the Tigers hasn't proven a
distraction. ''I've had no indication whatsoever that he is unhappy
and doesn't want to be here. It doesn't seem to be Juan's nature to
say that. Negotiations take a life of their own, but I do know
we're going to do everything to get something done with Juan,''
Garner said. Gonzalez can become a free agent after this season.
... 3B Dean Palmer was scratched from Monday night's starting
lineup against Anaheim due to a tightness in his lower back, which
he experienced during batting practice. Shane Halter replaced him
at third.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: SS Gary DiSarcina, out since April 9 with a bruised
left thumb, started Monday night's game against Detroit after being
activated earlier in the day. The Angels optioned Keith Johnson to
Triple-A Vancouver to make room on the roster. ... Right-hander Tim
Belcher, coming back from arm surgery in the offseason, is
scheduled to start for Vancouver on Tuesday night against Calgary.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Dodgers-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Kevin Brown, who broke his right pinky trying to
bunt against the Mets on April 8, is scheduled to come off the
disabled list and start against Tom Glavine and the Braves on
Tuesday night. ... The Dodgers had their seven-game road winning
streak snapped. Los Angeles hasn't won eight in a row away from
home since June 1982. ... Todd Hundley, a former Met, went 3-for-4
to raise his career average against New York to .222 (6-for-27).
... The Dodgers have outscored their opponents 50-22 in seven day
games.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets have won six games in their last at-bat and
are 6-1 in one-run games this season. ... Right fielder Derek Bell
was named NL player of the week after hitting .609 (14-for-23) with
two homers, three doubles, eight RBIs and eight runs scored. Mike
Piazza won the award last week. ... Piazza went 0-for-3 against
Darren Dreifort and is 2-for-16 (.125) against him in his career.
Phillies-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Phillies starters went at least six innings in
every game in their 1-6 road trip. ... The Phillies begin a
nine-game homestand Tuesday against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: 2B Luis Castillo, who is on the 15-day disabled list
with a lower back strain, is expected to join Triple-A Calgary for
a rehabilitation assignment Friday and then be activated by the
Marlins next Monday. ... LF Cliff Floyd missed his third straight
game due to a nagging groin pull.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs 4, Senators 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Steve Thomas started a four-goal spurt in
the second period, lifting the Toronto Maple Leafs into the second
round of the NHL playoffs Monday night with a 4-2 victory over the
Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto won the best-of-seven series 4-2 and will open the
Eastern Conference semifinals Thursday night at home against the
New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Mats Sundin, Sergei Berezin and Wendel Clark scored as
the Leafs erased a 2-0 Ottawa lead built on goals by Joe Juneau and
Igor Kravchuk.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators outshot Toronto 38-24, but their failure to hold
the lead resulted in an opening-round elimination for the second
straight year and third time in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The team that held the shots advantage lost all six games of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played real gritty,'' Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph said.
''We played tough along the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   A capacity crowd of 18,500 watched in dismay as the Senators
became the first team to lose at home in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the last game was key for us,'' Joseph said. ''Getting
up 3-2 in dramatic fashion (with a come-from-behind, overtime
victory), I think that spilled over into tonight's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa got the early lead on a rush when Shawn McEachern's shot
was kicked out to the high slot, where Juneau swept the puck inside
the near post 3:45 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to score during an abbreviated two-man advantage,
Ottawa went ahead 2-0 when Kravchuk's point shot through traffic
beat Joseph 3:59 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But just 12 seconds later, Ottawa defenseman Sami Salo passed
the puck right onto Thomas' stick in the slot, and he unleashed a
quick shot for his sixth goal of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never quit in here,'' Joseph said. ''We played hard and we
knew we could come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A Thomas pass then went off Kravchuk's skate onto the stick of
Sundin, breaking in on the left side. Sundin scored into an open
side of the net to tie it at 7:16.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin was allowed to sneak in front of goalie Tom Barrasso and
whack a shot in to put Toronto ahead 3-2 at 10:40.
</P>
<P>
   A Cory Cross pass went off a series of sticks and skates to
Clark, who was parked alone at the side of the Ottawa net. He
easily swept the puck in with 1:13 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa's top line of Radek Bonk, Marian Hossa and Magnus
Arvedson did not score in the series, the first between Canadian
teams since Vancouver beat Calgary and Toronto en route to the 1994
Stanley Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> Nike Founder Halts Donations  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Nike founder Phil Knight said Monday he
will make no further donations to his alma mater, the University of
Oregon, because of its membership in a student-driven labor rights
organization that has criticized Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nike will honor its contractual commitment. But for me
personally there will be no further donations of any kind to the
University of Oregon. At this time, this is not a situation that
can be resolved,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bonds of trust, which allowed me to give at a high level,
have been shredded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight noted he has given $50 million to the school in Eugene --
$30 million for athletics and $20 million for academics. He had
been expected to also be a substantial donor to a planned expansion
of the university's Autzen Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   University President David Frohnmayer said Knight's generosity
has helped the university.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are disappointed to hear that he plans to curtail future
contributions to the University of Oregon,'' he said in a
statement. ''I still hope to speak with him in person and look
forward to working with him in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor practices at factories under contract to the shoe and
sportswear giant around the globe have come under criticism from
several universities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said he was ''shocked'' to learn on April 14 that the
university had joined the Workers Rights Consortium.
Beaverton-based Nike supports another group, the Fair Labor
Association, in the fight against sweatshop labor.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is who will monitor factories that produce apparel to
ensure safe and humane working conditions, and whose code of
conduct will companies be held to.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses largely support the association, which gives more
leeway to manufacturers, allowing them a greater say in how
monitoring is carried out and putting limits on the release of
inspection results. The association also gives businesses strong
representation on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Student activists have supported the consortium, which doesn't
allow corporate representatives on its board. The consortium
intends to keep corporations at arm's length, conducting surprise
inspections with independent monitors and releasing the results of
its inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Nike has contracts with almost 200 colleges, and many of them,
including the University of Oregon, are members of the consortium.

<HEADLINE> Americans Escape Hostage Abduction  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- James and Mary Murphy were just
another American couple escaping on a dream vacation to a lush
Malaysian resort island.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a mass
abduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20
hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to talk to our children,'' Mary Murphy told The
Associated Press at Malaysia's international airport. ''We really
want to get to the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murphys, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y., appeared shaken up and
very much alone. Scores of reporters waited for them to arrive, but
no Malaysian authorities or U.S. embassy officials were there to
escort them from their plane after their long ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Murphy, wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, was close to tears.
They had not yet informed their three children living in Boston,
Rochester and Australia about their trauma. The Murphys have been
living in Sydney for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Six gunmen stormed the Sipadan Island Resort off the eastern
Malaysian state of Sabah late Sunday, taking 20 people, including
10 foreign tourists, hostage on two boats.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue teams searching southeast Asian seas say they've zeroed
on assailants -- an attack that the Philippine rebel group Bbu
Sayyaf on Tuesday claimed it carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of
militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed
responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping. But Philippine
officials quickly expressed skepticism over the statement.

<P>
   The Murphys escaped by refusing to get on the boats, according
to police in Semporna. Eyewitnesses said the hostages were forced
to swim to the boats. They said Mary Murphy couldn't swim and when
the kidnappers tried to force her, her husband said they'd have to
shoot him if they forced her into the water.
</P>
<P>
   When the hostage-takers turned around, the Murphys ran into the
bushes and hid until dawn, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this was an accurate account, the Murphys smiled
but would not elaborate. Asked if they had hidden in the bushes,
Murphy said, ''We did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, an executive for Eastman Kodak Co. in Sydney, said they
had not slept since the previous night but were otherwise fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's got lots of bites from sleeping in the bushes, a lot of
sand fleas,'' he said, pointing to Mary Murphy's legs, which were
covered with a rash of insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that he would speak more extensively once he knew
that the other hostages were released and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to do anything that would endanger their lives,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As cameras flashed around them, Mary Murphy said all she wanted
now was ''a good night's sleep and a hot shower.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Workers Killed in Fall From Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Construction scaffolding tore away from a
bridge Monday, killing three ironworkers and injuring two others in
a 60-foot plunge into the shallows of the Illinois River.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth worker on a construction barge below the McClugage
Bridge was treated for hypothermia after jumping into the cold
water in an attempt to help his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Franklin, executive vice president of Midwest Foundation
Corp., the company handling the construction, said the 80 workers
on the project were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people working out there are friends and know one
another and have been working together for years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred on the southern span of the twin-span
bridge, which is undergoing a $26 million reconstruction that began
last month.
</P>
<P>
   The ironworkers were replacing rusted metal plates in the
bridge's floor, Franklin said. The scaffolding, about 30 feet wide
and 16 feet long, was suspended underneath the bridge. It fell into
about five feet of murky, brown water.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the accident were Robert L. Foulks, 55, and Ronald F.
Watson, 50, both of Peoria, and John W. Irby, 37, of Lacon, the
Peoria County Coroner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   One injured worker was impaled on a pipe and was in fair
condition after several hours in surgery. A second, Randy McComb,
41, was treated and released. Would-be rescuer Ralph Bill, 36, was
released after being treated for hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving construction workers and families gathered at the
hospital where the victims were treated refused to discuss the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge, a major artery connecting Peoria to bedroom
communities across the river, handles more than 42,500 vehicles
each day.
</P>
<P>
   The construction project was halted until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go over with the ironworkers what has happened
and what they saw or what they think may have happened,'' Franklin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Salerno, assistant area director for the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said two
investigators were dispatched to pinpoint the cause of the accident
and determine whether Midwest was in compliance with safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the OSHA Web site, the last time Midwest was
involved in a fatal accident was in 1985, when a carpenter was
crushed by an overloaded crane that overturned during work on a
bridge in Milan, Ill.

Zoo Shooting Leaves Boy Brain Dead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A feud between youths at the National Zoo ended in a hail
of gunfire Monday evening, leaving one boy brain dead and wounding five other
children at one of the capital's most popular tourist sites, police officials
said. Police were investigating whether the shooting was gang-related and sought
at least one teen-age gunman who fired a handgun into groups of youths after a
confrontation escalated to bottle throwing and then shots, according to
authorities and witnesses. A high-ranking police official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said a boy, either 11 or 12 years old, was shot in the head and
declared brain dead at a hospital. He said the boy was being kept alive to allow
his family to donate his organs.

White House, GOPs Spar Over Elian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans and the White House sparred
today over the seizure of Elian Gonzalez as each accused the other of playing
politics. The House announced an investigation into Saturday's pre-dawn raid.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. -- who presided over 1998
impeachment hearings against President Clinton -- announced his panel's staff
would begin ''a preliminary inquiry'' into the tactics used to seize the boy.
Attorney General Janet Reno defended the tactics anew Monday evening, saying,
''What you saw was a law enforcement operation that went the right way.''

Microsoft Shares Plummet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Shares of Microsoft Corp. fell nearly 16 percent today as
investors coped with a bearish financial outlook, analyst downgrades and
government rumblings about a possible company breakup. Microsoft closed down
$12.31\ to $66.62{ on the Nasdaq Stock Market, helping push the Nasdaq composite
index down more than 4 percent. The software company, riding a wave of bad news,
has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since its high point last
December, dropping from about $620 billion to $345 billion as of Monday's close.

Subpoena Issued in White House E-Mail Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Widening his investigation, Independent Counsel Robert Ray
is conducting interviews and has issued a subpoena to find out whether
administration officials tried to obstruct investigators by not turning over
e-mails. The move immerses Ray deeper into the most recent Clinton
administration controversy at a time when the independent's office is trying to
finish its six-year investigation -- and decide whether the president should be
indicted when he leaves office. Ray's office issued a subpoena last Tuesday to
the National Archives and Records Administration, the government's official

22 Die, 58 Hurt in Honduras Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- An overloaded 1950's-era bus slammed into a
tree on the main highway along Honduras' Atlantic coast and caught fire, killing
at least 22 people and injuring 58, police reported today. Police said the
vehicle was speeding when the accident occurred late last night, 70 miles north
Tegucigalpa, the capital. Passengers on the rented bus were returning home from
Holy Week vacations. The 25-year-old driver and owner of the bus, Marco Tulio
Turcios, survived the crash without injuries. He told local media that he tried
to stop after police flagged him down at a checkpoint on a curve in the highway.

Internet Census Filing Successful
</SUBHEAD>

   FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- About 66,000 census questionnaires were answered
over the Internet this year, the first time the Census Bureau offered the
cyberspace option to Americans. Census officials had earlier said that up to 7
million of the nation's 120 million households could answer forms online through
a computer system that could handle up to 800,000 users per hour. But the bureau
never widely publicized the option, in part because it was still testing the
system.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Red Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rafael Palmeiro homered twice and Luis
Alicea hit a two-run tiebreaking single as the Texas Rangers beat
the Red Sox 5-4 Monday night in Boston's first game in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit a two-run shot in the third inning and added a solo
blast in the seventh for the 23rd two-homer game of his career.
Palmeiro's 369 homers tie him with Ralph Kiner for 47th on the
career list, two behind Gil Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the sixth and the game tied at 2, Mike Lamb
singled off reliever Tim Wakefield (1-1) and Royce Clayton walked.
Alicea lined a single in front of center fielder Carl Everett,
scoring both runners, who were running on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's eighth homer and sixth in his last four games against
Boston made it 5-2 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rallied in the eighth on Brian Daubach's two-run double
off reliever Tim Crabtree to narrow Texas' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox played for the first time after getting rained out
for four straight days, including an entire weekend series at home
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Kenny Rogers (2-3) allowed two runs and six hits
in seven innings. He struck out two and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his second save in four
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield gave up two runs and two hits in two innings in relief
of starter Ramon Martinez, who struggled through four innings.
Wakefield struck out three and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had won eight of their previous 10 games while Texas
had lost six of seven.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 2-0 lead in the third off Martinez when Chad
Curtis doubled, stole third and scored ahead of Palmeiro's homer,
which broke a string of 23 consecutive scoreless innings by Red Sox
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston tied it at 2 in the fourth when Troy O'Leary singled and
Everett followed with his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, making his first start in nine days because of the
rainouts, allowed two runs and three hits, struck out five and
walked five.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hornets 108, 76ers 98, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Back in the playoffs after a five-year
absence, Derrick Coleman scored eight of his 29 points in overtime,
leading the Charlotte Hornets to a 108-98 victory over the
Philadelphia 76ers to tie their playoff series Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and the Hornets now go to Philadelphia -- where Coleman
spent almost three years before signing with Charlotte -- for Game 3
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson, who scored a career playoff high 40 points in
Game 1, tied his career playoff low with 13 points. It was the
first time in Iverson's 10 playoff games he failed to lead the
76ers in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte went back to the basics in overtime, using its huge
front line of Coleman, Anthony Mason and Elden Campbell to dominate
the 76ers. The Hornets hit their first six shots and eight of nine
in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   Mason opened the OT with a brusing layup that gave the Hornets a
93-91 lead. Coleman then took over, scoring six straight points on
a layup and two 15-foot jumpers for a 99-95 lead with 2:47 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman then took away a rebound at the other end from Tyrone
Hill and Charlotte capitalized when Eddie Jones hit a 3. Coleman
added a turnaround jumper and Mason and Campbell dunked to even the
series 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell finished with 20 points, Jones had 19 and Mason scored
14.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was held in check the entire night by Jones, who unlike
in Game 1 stayed out of foul trouble and in Iverson's face.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was horribly off early, missing badly on a 3-point
attempt and bricking a layup in the first half. He had just seven
points at the break on 2-for-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't any better in the second half, either.
</P>
<P>
   His first shot of the third quarter didn't even hit the rim, and
as he struggled to get anything off on Jones -- who has a six-inch
height advantage on Iverson -- he ended up passing the ball more
than shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   What shots Iverson did take either rattled off the rim or grazed
the glass and bounced into Charlotte's hands.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a 3-point attempt with under a minute to play in
overtime and shot just 5-for-21 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the Sixers picked up the slack for him and had
an 89-84 lead with four minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   But David Wesley hit a 3 and the Hornets tied it at 89 when
Mason dunked with one second left on the shot clock and 1:01 to
play in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets then took a 91-89 lead, their first since early in
the fourth quarter, on Campbell's tip-in with 26 seconds to play.
The 76ers tied it on Eric Snow's jumper with 12 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jones missed an 18-foot fadeaway jumper over Aaron McKie, who
was in on defense in place of Iverson, as time expired in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc led Philadelphia with 20 points, Snow scored 19 and
Hill had 10.
Notes: The win snapped a four-game playoff losing streak for the
Hornets. Charlotte lost Game 1 of this series, and three in a row
to Chicago in 1998. ... The fouls went against Philadelphia early:
the 76ers were whistled four times in a 16-second span in the first
quarter. The Hornets felt the calls went against them in Game 1.
... Mason moved past Vlade Divac for second place on Charlotte's
list in career playoff rebounds with 126. He needs 16 more to pass
Alonzo Mourning's mark of 142.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Arrest 3 Falun Gong  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Falun Gong followers by the dozens unfurled
banners and sat silently in Tiananmen Square Tuesday, prompting
swift arrest from police, as the spiritual group marked the first
anniversary of a mass protest that provoked a Chinese government
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained at least 68 people within 90 minutes Tuesday
morning. The vast plaza in Beijing's center became a swirl of chaos
with small-scale protests erupting in all directions. Officers
sometimes reacted violently, even though they were expecting the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   One officer punched a man in the face as he and three others
tried to raise a banner. Fifteen people who sat in meditation on
the square were jerked to their feet and pushed into a mini-bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Great Way of Falun is good,'' shouted one middle-aged
protester, leaning out a police bus window, his fist raised.
</P>
<P>
   The charged atmosphere and violence stood in contrast with the
event sect members were commemorating. On April 25 last year,
10,000 group members surrounded the communist leadership compound
near Tiananmen, meditating in silence for a day to protest official
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Then police kept their distance. But the group's ability to
mobilize followers alarmed Chinese leaders. President Jiang Zemin
ordered a crackdown. In July Falun Gong was officially proscribed,
its leading members arrested and its rank-and-file told to recant
or face jail.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, peaceful, defiant protests by Falun Gong adherents
have become a daily sight in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Since the April 25 demonstration, ''we have come to witness the
Chinese government execute one of the largest, harshest and most
arbitrary persecutions in modern history,'' Gail Rachlin, a New
York-based spokeswoman for Falun Gong, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese leaders turned their country upside down'' by banning
the group, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It said 35,000 followers have been detained, with another 5,000
sent without trial to labor camps. Practitioners have been
tortured, held in psychiatric institutions and given anti-psychotic
drugs while others have lost jobs or been refused permission to
attend school, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong attracted millions of followers with its blend of
traditional beliefs, slow-motion exercises and the ideas of founder
Li Hongzhi, a former government grain clerk who now lives in New
York. Followers say Falun Gong promotes health and good
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Three Falun Gong followers protested Monday on Tiananmen Square
and were quickly detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy security, the three middle-aged men raised their
arms in a meditation pose. Plainclothes police patrolling among the
throngs of tourists on the square ordered the men to put their arms
down, and within minutes led them to a police van which drove them
away.
</P>
<P>
   The government says Falun Gong is an evil cult that threatened
public order and Communist Party rule, and led 1,500 followers to
their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In another official report about the group's alleged misdeeds,
police in eastern China's Weifang city arrested three principal
Falun Gong members for cheating other followers of $36,000,
state-run newspapers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Weijun, Li Weihua and his wife, Li Fang, told followers that
Tan was even more powerful than Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, the
Guangming Daily and other newspapers reported. The accounts said
they promised Tan's protection if followers donated money.
</P>
<P>
   The three allegedly concocted the scam to pay a $4,200 fine from
August for selling Falun Gong literature.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index rose moderately
Tuesday morning on buying of Internet-related issues. The U.S.
dollar edged lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down
some 46 points early in the session, gained 68.96 points, or 0.37
percent, to 18,549.11 at the end of the morning session. On Monday,
the average closed up 227.47 points, or 1.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.28 yen, down 0.40 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.69 yen
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei opened lower on selling of high
technology issues and information technology-related stocks after
the Nasdaq composite index lost 161.40 points to close at 3,482.48
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the market later moved into positive territory on buying of
Internet-related issues, including Softbank Corp., erasing the
early losses.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.36 points, or 0.44 percent, to 1,668.17. The
TOPIX closed up 26.69 points, or 1.63 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
62.05 points to 10,906.10 at Monday's finish.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar met selling from Japanese
exporters for hedging purposes ahead of Japan's ''Golden Week''
holidays starting Saturday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   A hedge is an investor strategy to reduce investment risk.
</P>
<P>
   But the greenback remained in a relatively narrow range during
Tuesday's morning session amid a lack of major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese companies will give their employees a weeklong
holiday during the annual holiday-studded week.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 98.83 yen, down from
99.24 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7400 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its price
fell 0.05 point to 101.37.

<HEADLINE> Elian Fallout Will Affect Marlins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Four Florida Marlins players, including starting
third baseman Mike Lowell, plan to miss Tuesday night's game
against San Francisco to honor a call by Cuban-Americans for a work
stoppage over the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said the team will
respect the decision of any of its employees to support the
protest. He said the club's front-office workers, players and
coaches would be excused with pay for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree with it 100 percent,'' Marlins manager John Boles
said. ''The skids were greased when I recommended them to do it.
There are more important things in the world than our game with the
San Francisco Giants. Not a lot, but this is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, whose parents are Cuban exiles, will miss the home game
along with pitcher Alex Fernandez, Vladimir Nunez and Michael
Tejera, who's on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Fredi Gonzalez, infield coach Tony Taylor and
bullpen Luis Perez also plan to be absent, as does Cuban-American
Hall of Famer Tony Perez, an assistant to Dombrowski.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans in the Miami area are protesting how the
6-year-old Gonzalez was taken from his great-uncle's home during
the weekend. The Marlins will close their downtown Marlins en Miami
Store for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, born in Puerto Rico, is married to a Cuban woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really hits home,'' Lowell said. ''It's a sensitive issue
and I have to be responsible. It's a little more important than one
baseball game. Thank god, it's not the seventh game of the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez started Monday night against Philadelphia and was the
winning pitcher.
</P>

   ''I wouldn't have pitched (tomorrow),'' he said. ''I'm making it
a point as a Cuban-American, and I'm proud to say that. You won't
be seeing me here tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dombrowski: ''Anyone who's passionate about the situation,
we will respect their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have also alerted the Giants of the situation because
they'll be flying into this. They also have Livan (Hernandez) and
we wanted to make them aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez will start Wednesday night against former Marlins hero
Hernandez. Both pitchers were born in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, Marlins owner John Henry joined a protest outside
Baltimore's spring training camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after
the Orioles announced their intention to play an exhibition game
against a Cuban team in Havana.

<HEADLINE> Ex-American Legion Commander Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Erle Cocke Jr., a former American Legion
commander who advised four presidents, died of cancer Sunday. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Cocke, a highly decorated World War II veteran, died at his home
in Chevy Chase, Md., The American Legion said Monday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Cocke, then 29, became the youngest man elected to head
The American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, President Truman named Cocke a special Defense
Department consultant and sent him to Korea, where he served as a
liaison with Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In 1959, President Eisenhower
appointed him a U.S. delegate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cocke also consulted with the World Bank for the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Cocke served as an Army captain and led
reconnaissance patrols behind enemy lines in Germany. He was twice
captured, only to escape.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Cocke received an MBA from Harvard University. He was
later awarded honorary doctorates from three other universities.
</P>
<P>
   Cocke is survived by his wife, Madelyn, and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He will be buried Thursday with military honors at Arlington
National Cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Hanford Tank Cleanup Now $15.2B  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The cost of cleaning up the Hanford
nuclear reservation's highly radioactive nuclear waste storage
tanks has jumped to $15.2 billion -- more than twice the original
estimate, the contractor estimated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the BNFL Inc. had offered a nearly $13
billion estimate, up from an initial price tag of $6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that the new price in all likelihood is not
affordable,'' said Paul Miskimin, president of BNFL, which is based
in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The company's bid was based on spending $6 billion worth of
private money to build a factory to turn Hanford wastes into a
glass-like substance for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost of designing, building, operating and then
deactivating the plant over the 20-year life of the proposed
contract is now calculated at $15.2 billion, with the financing
costs on the $6 billion accounting for about half the total, BNFL
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few people now believe this is the right way to finance this
job,'' Miskimin said. The company is looking for ways to reduce the
financing costs, presumably by using tax money for at least part of
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms the Department of Energy set for bidders, the
federal government would not pay a penny to the builder until the
first glass is produced, sometime in 2007. That means the winning
bidder would pay all the upfront costs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Mike Lawrence, the general manager of the
project, resigned, saying he was frustrated he didn't have direct
control over key portions of the troubled program.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the deadline for BNFL to submit its proposal to the
Energy Department, which owns Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   The 54 million gallons of radioactive waste are in 177 giant
underground storage tanks. They are leftovers from the production
of plutonium for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling Hanford reservation is 120 miles southwest of
Spokane, near Richland.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Department of Energy and the state Department
of Ecology could not be reached for comment late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Eighth NY Car Service Driver Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A car service driver was found shot to death
inside his car in the Bronx Monday night, the eighth livery cab
driver killed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven private car service drivers were killed in all of 1999.
The rash of slayings this year has alarmed the more than 41,000 car
service drivers and police, who have made solving the slayings a
top priority. An arrest has been made in one case this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has pledged $5 million to help equip the
cars with bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras. It
was unclear whether the car of the driver killed Monday had the
safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the police department has created a task force,
assigning 300 officers to protect the drivers of the private cars
for hire. Some officers will act as decoy drivers, and there will
be designated safe zones, where drivers in trouble can go if they
need help.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike yellow cabs, which can pick up street fares, car service
drivers must be dispatched to passengers, but many flout the rule
to make extra money.
