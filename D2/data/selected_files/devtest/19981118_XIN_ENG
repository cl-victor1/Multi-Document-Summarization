<P>
ABU DHABI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Uzbek Foreign
Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov Tuesday called on the United Nations to
play a bigger role in solving the problem of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan considered the situation in Afghanistan an internal
affair that concerns the Afghan people only, Kamilov told
reporters upon arrival in Sharjah, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan called for non-interference in the internal affairs
of Afghanistan, and for negotiations among all parties involved
so as to reach a peaceful settlement embracing all Afghan

In seeking a solution to the Afghan problem under
U.N. auspices, Uzbekistan proposed to form a group that comprises
Afghanistan's neighboring countries including Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Iran, Pakistan and China, plus U.S. and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Middle East and Israel's failure to
implement its accords with the Palestinians, Kamilov said his
country supported peace negotiations and considered lasting peace
and stability in the region as of paramount significance to the
Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit, he would exchange views with UAE
government officials on the situation in central Asia as well as
security and stability in the region, including developments in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Kamilov noted that agreements would be signed during his stay
in the UAE in such areas as investment, trade, industry,
agriculture and aviation.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan wants the UAE to establish its embassy, consulate or
trade representation office in Uzbekistan, said Kamilov, adding
that his country offers great investment opportunities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of the
Displaced Walid Jumblatt Tuesday called on Italy not to hand
over Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey, the
Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when visiting a pro-Ocalan sit-in staged
by a group of Kurds in front of the office of a Kurdish
magazine "Sorgur" in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fighting for
a Kurdish independent state in southeast Turkey, was arrested
in Rome on Thursday and is being held there.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is pressing Italy to extradite Ocalan to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"We demand the Italian government not to hand him over to
the Turkish authority which perpetrated massacres of the Kurdish
people's rights," Jumblatt told the protesters.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Turkey's most wanted man be tried
in another country like Germany.
</P>
<P>
Turkey threatened last month to take military actions against
Syria over its alleged support for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Lebanon of sheltering PKK members in its
eastern Bekaa Valley, which is under Syrian control.

<P>
BEIJING, November 17 (Xinhu) -- Scientists, astronomy buffs,
and journalists are gathering in the Chinese capital this evening
to wait for the meteor storm in the Constellation Leo.
</P>
<P>
The meteor shower is expected to peak and become a storm early
Wednesday morning and China is one of the best places to observe
the meteor shower, according to local experts.
</P>
<P>
Xinglong Observatory Station, in the suburbs of Beijing, has
been swamped with scientists from China, the United States,
Britain, France, Czech, Switzerland and the Netherlands, as well
as amateur star-gazers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
Because a cold front has hit the area, people have to brave
sub-zero temperatures, but, Paul D. Maley, of the U.S.'s NASA,
says the Chinese have provided good conditions for the observation.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jingyao, a Chinese meteorologist, told Xinhua that this may
be the last meteor storm in the Constellation Leo, because of the
movements of stars.
</P>
<P>
Many people have gathered at other observation spots in
Beijing, like the Miyun and Shahe stations.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Observatory sources say that at the peak of the meteor
storm the observatory will take photographs and use several large
telescopes to study the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Similar observation stations have also been set up in Qinghai
Province in the northwest, Jiangsu Province in the east, the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region in the north, and Jilin Province in the

BRUSSELS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
decided Tuesday not to oppose the Dutch ING Group's proposed
acquisition of Germany's BHF Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, the executive branch of the European Union
(EU), said it concluded that the merger does not create or
strengthen a dominant position for the Dutch company.
</P>
<P>
The EU was notified in October of the proposed merger, in which
ING Group would acquire the control of BHF Bank through buying its
shares.
</P>
<P>
ING provides insurance, investment banking, asset management
and other related services in the Netherlands and Belgium as well
as other parts of the world, while BHF providing similar services
only in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Through the proposed merger, ING hopes to expand its business

<HEADLINE> Profit of Europe's Biggest Bank Falls One Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe's biggest bank UBS AG
reported a sharp drop in profits in the first three quarters on
Tuesday and predicted a mildly positive fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss bank reported a 32 percent drop in nine month net
income to 2.6 billion Swiss francs (1.90 billion U.S. dollars),
while pretax profit fell by 30 percent to 3.465 billion.
</P>
<P>
UBS, Europe's largest in terms of market capitalization, is
said to be hit by several exceptional items, including settlement
of Holocaust era accounts, exposure to the nearly collapsed U.S.
hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and provisions for
derivatives positions.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the fall in profits reflected the impact of
various exceptionals, including the sale of its BSI-Banca della
Svizzera Italiana unit, provisions to cover a global settlement of
Holocaust-era asset lawsuits, and a 790 million franc loss due to
its LTCM exposure, as well as reductions on pre-merger equity
derivative positions.
</P>
<P>
UBS said the Warburg loss was mainly due to value adjustments
on equity derivative positions, and its exposure to LTCM, which
was bailed out by a group of investment and commercial banks after
losing four billion dollars on derivatives.
</P>
<P>
UBS said Russia's economic collapse and severe setbacks in
emerging markets took their toll while "unprecedented volatility"
on equity markets and a sudden and dramatic widening of spreads on
the bond markets adversely impacted its equities and bond
businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine eliminated Monday a
strategic bomber, the first of several dozen it must destroy under
a nuclear disarmament program, the Interfax news agency said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a total of 44 such bombers are scheduled
to be eliminated by December 4, 2001, including 19 Tu-160s and 25
Tu-95 MC bombers, long-range planes designed to carry guided
missiles with nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the elimination work, sponsored by the United
States, is expected to reach over eight million US dollars. The
dismantled engines and other parts will be used for civilian
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the United States has contributed more than 500
million dollars to help Ukraine dismantle the bombers and other
nuclear weapons infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine inherited the world's third largest nuclear arsenal
with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but has since
surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia and pledged to
remain nuclear free.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has destroyed all 130 of its SS-19 nuclear missile
silos and plans to finish dismantling the SS-19 missiles by next
January.
</P>
<P>
It also destroyed the first of 46 SS-24 missile silos this
summer, and is planning to destroy SS-24 missiles.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Launch Initiative to Harmonize Electromagnetic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is launching an initiative to harmonize electromagnetic
field standards worldwide at a meeting in Zagreb, Croatia,
beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the Fourth European BioElectromagnetics Association
(EBEA) congress on November 18-22, WHO's Electromagnetic Field
Project (EMF) will launch the initiative to develop a framework
for internationally-acceptable electromagnetic field standards for
human exposure.
</P>
<P>
The electromagnetic fields are emitted by such sources as high
voltage power lines, radars, mobile telephones and their base
stations, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The standards are developed in order to ensure that they don't
have adverse health effects, that these devices are safe and that
their use does not electrically interfere with other devices.
</P>
<P>
WHO's EMF is to review scientific studies relating possible
health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields to identify
research that will allow improved health risk assessments to be
made. The assessments will provide the basis for future EMF
exposure standards.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that agreement may take some years to achieve and need
much hard work because there are wide differences between national
standards.

<HEADLINE> EU Vows to Further Reform of Financial Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday
restated its commitment to improved financial management and
shared responsibility with member states in seeking to promote the
management of agricultural and structural finances.
</P>
<P>
"Our primary aim is to maximize the benefit to European
citizens from Union funds. We will continue with our reforms, some
of which have started to bear fruit", said EU commissioner Erkki
Liikanen, responsible for budget and administration.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and structural finances represent about 80
percent of the EU spending and are essentially implemented by EU
member states. The EU replied to the remarks made by the Court of
Auditors in its Annual Report on 1997, which presented by Liikanen
in the European Parliament in Strasbourg today.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said many of the Court of Auditors's
remarks address issues in which the commission has taken
corrective action. The EU believes that when translating its
Court's remarks into concrete measures, the audits would be of
greatest value if they also helped set priorities.
</P>
<P>
When assessing the Court of Auditors' findings, the EU
commission said, it is important to make a clear distinction
between fraud, which the court did not detect, and irregularities
found by the court.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it has made it perfectly clear that it
takes any case of suspected fraud extremely seriously. In October
1996 it agreed with the Court of Auditors on a formal arrangement
on accelerated legal action in the event of fraud cases uncovered
in audits.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The APEC Business
Advisory Council (ABAC) on Tuesday obtained the APEC leaders'
endorsement for the establishment of the Partnership for
Equitable Growth (PEG).
</P>
<P>
In its meeting with the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation) leaders here, the ABAC briefed them on the Council's
plans to set up the PEG, a new private sector organization aiming
to boost business involvement in APEC's economic and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC urged APEC leaders to take prompt and bold action to
help restore confidence in regional financial stability and
regenerate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"APEC's response to the crisis to date has been in relation to
the magnitude and depth of the crisis facing Asian businesses and
people," ABAC chairman Tajudin Ramli said.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC advised the leaders on a package of immediate measures
designed to restore confidence in the region and spur capital
inflows.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC members stressed the need for APEC leaders to reaffirm
their commitment to push forward trade and investment
liberalization, including Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization,
which is vital to the region's long-term economic development.
</P>
<P>
They also called for a sound environment for the development of
electronic commerce and a new joint public-private action plan to
build an APEC Food System.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC stressed the key role small and medium-sized
enterprises play in member economies, where they provide the bulk
of employment.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC, APEC's private sector arm established in 1995, has a
mandate to advise APEC leaders on issues affecting business. Each
of the 21 APEC member economies sends three prominent businessmen
to form the 63-member council.

GENEVA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway will
pay a weeklong visit to China beginning on Saturday, WHO announced

</P>
<P>
It will be Brundtland's first official visit to one of WHO's
191 members since she formally took office on July 21, 1998, Dr
Guy Carrin, a senior health economist at the WHO, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reasons why the WHO chief has chosen China as
the first country to pay an official visit include that China has
made major achievements in health care and the Chinese leadership
has put great importance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
China has nearly doubled life expectancy of its population
since the 1950s and decreased infant mortality from 200 deaths per
1,000 live births to 35 per 1,000 live births, said the senior
expert at the WHO Division of Intensified Cooperation with
Countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cooperation among Indian Ocean States Needs to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani official
stressed Tuesday the need for greater cooperation among the Indian
Ocean countries for the common good of the people and economic
prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Akram Zaki, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on
Foreign Affairs, made the remarks at the inauguration of a
three-day international seminar on "Regional Cooperation among
Indian Ocean Countries".
</P>
<P>
Zaki said that security, development and cooperation in the
Indian Ocean region has assumed greater importance and urgency,
after Indian's initiative to destabilize the status quo and
strategic imbalance in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zaki said that a strident and assertive India seems determined
to covert the Indian Ocean into an Indian Lake by a systematic
development of Blue Water Navy, consisting of an ever expanding
fleet of warships, including aircraft carriers and nuclear
submarines.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he added, deeply concerned at India's growing
military might and nuclear ambitions, hoped that the other
countries would also take notice of it, for ensuring peace and
security in the region.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as having said, "time has
come for the littoral and hinterland states of the Indian Ocean to
take their destiny in their own hands for regional peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
Zaki pleaded for Pakistan's admission into Indian Ocean Rim
Organization, as he added it can provide a link between the SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) region and the
Hinterland countries of Central Asia, which are covered by the
region of the Economic Cooperation Organization.

PRETORIA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 Defense Exposition
of South Africa (DEXSA'98), which has international exhibitors
for the first time, opened Tuesday in Waterkloof Air Base near
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 companies from at least 19 countries are showcasing
their products, ranging from multi-million-Dollar jet fighters to
bullet proof vests.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's state-owned arms manufacturer, Denel, unveiled
its first production model of its Rooivalk (red hawk) combat
helicopter, which made its first public flight Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The 26-million-Dollar aircraft will be handed over to the
South African Air Force (SAAF) during the five-day event.
</P>
<P>
The other 11 Rooivalk helicopters ordered by the SAAF are
still under different stages of production, according to a news
release of Armscor, South Africa's state arms sales and
procurement agency.
</P>
<P>
An exhibitor, who refused to be named, told Xinhua that Denel
can manufacture four Rooivalk helicopters a year. But he said
production could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
South African Defense Minister Joe Modise, who officially
opened DEXSA'98, said his country was committed to defense,
raising hopes that a 15-billion-Rand (2.6-billion-Dollar)
armament procurement package could be approved.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Defense Force hopes to acquire
corvettes, submarines, helicopters and jet fighters, in return
for counter-trade investment.
</P>
<P>
Some European companies, which allegedly have been
short-listed as potential suppliers, are aggressively promoting
their products.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Modise also called for international
cooperation on the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
"Global competition is such today that no country can stand
alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa is planning to combine DEXSA with the
commercial Aerospace Africa show.
</P>
<P>
"Planning is under way to organize such a joint exposition in
the year 2000."

At a press conference here in Harare, ZCTU Secretary-General
Morgan Tsvangirai said the government was not deciding whether
the labor movement's demands were urgent or not, hence the
decision to continue with the stay-aways.
</P>
<P>
Last week, thousands of workers countrywide who heeded the
powerful labor movement's decision to stage a stayaway every
Wednesday of the week also intended to press the government to
adjust a 68 percent fuel price hike which has sent the prices of
basic commodities zooming.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai appealed to employers to desist from punishing
workers for participating in the ongoing job stay-aways.
</P>
<P>
"If the government decided to listen to our problems, even
employers stand to benefit. Our action is not aimed at employers
but against the policy makers and the message is that not all is
well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students of the University of Zimbabwe came out in
full support of the job stayaway which is intended to force the
government to tackle economic woes plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
Graciano Masauso, publicity officer of the Students Executive
Council, said: "Students fully support the workers' demands
because of fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar coupled with the
increases in the cost of living which had eroded the workers."
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Directors said in a statement that a
continued job stayaway would lead to job losses, a further fall
in the Dollar and increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
The institute added that unless the government faced its
responsibilities and worked closely with the employers and
organized labor to solve what was a national problem, the future
outlook for the country was serious.

<HEADLINE> Laos, Thailand Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Laos and Thailand have agreed
to enhance their bilateral cooperation, Lao official news agency
(KPL) reported Tuesday, quoting Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Somsavat Lengsavad.
</P>
<P>
Somsavat held a press conference Monday in Vientiane on the
outcome of the eighth session of the Joint Commission on Lao-Thai
Co-operation held in Bangkok last week, KPL said in its report.
</P>
<P>
Somsavat Lengsavad and Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan
attended the session.
</P>
<P>
KPL said the two sides reviewed the implementation of the
minutes to the seventh session held last year. The two sides also
agreed on the orientation of the multi-faceted co-operation
between the two countries for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the co-operation in security keeping, the two sides
have agreed to transform the national boundary between the two
countries into a border of peace, orderliness and benefit to the
two peoples by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
In economic co-operation, the Thai government has reaffirmed
its agreements signed with the Lao government pertaining to the
co-operation in energy development in Laos.
</P>
<P>
At the session, the Thai side also reaffirmed its stance to buy
3,000 megawatts of electricity from Laos till the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will formulate master plans on economic
development between the two countries, which will cover four
areas: electricity, agriculture and industry of processing of
agricultural produce, communication and telecommunication, and
investment.
</P>
<P>
The discussion also touched on technical co-operation in the
fields such as education, public health, sports and culture.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphanh has been invited by his
Thai counterpart to pay a visit to Thailand, announced Mr.
Somsavat.
</P>
<P>
The session also agreed to pave the way for the signing of

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks for No U.N. Political Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday said he will not recommend the establishment of
a United Nations political presence in Serbia's province of mainly
ethnic Albanians in order to avert what he said might turn out as
reporting confusion over the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said, "It is quite
obvious that any need that might have existed for such a presence
has been superseded by the decision to establish the Kosovo
Verification Mission."
</P>
<P>
Since the Kosovo Verification Mission, made up by 2,000
monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), will report to the Security Council, the decision
not to establish a United Nations political presence will serve to
avoid "parallel reporting channels that might lead to confusion
and overlapping in the field, as well as necessary financial
expenditure."
</P>
<P>
At the current stage, it is important to develop clear channels
of communication between the OSCE and the United Nations on the
issue of Kosovo, where conflicts originated from ethnic Albanians'
bids for independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan called on all parties concerned to cooperate
with the OSCE-sanctioned Mission. "For its part, the United
Nations will continue its humanitarian and human rights
activities, and will support the efforts of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, regional organization and individual Member
States aimed at restoring peace and stability to the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said that the military situation in Kosovo
has stabilized recently. Despite some serious but isolated
incidents, there has been no major fighting there since October 1.
</P>
<P>
"While the ceasefire is generally holding, there are continued
reports of sporadic violations, including armed provocations
against police and police harassment of ethnic Albanians," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The human rights situation, characterized by serious
violations, appears not to have changed since the signing of the
October 16 agreement which established the Kosovo Verification
Mission. Violations have been attributed to Serbian Security
forces, Kosovo Albanian paramilitary units and village defense
groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that political action to ensure real
security is a requisite for any solution to the humanitarian
crisis. He called on the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to extend guarantees to all returning civilians "so as
to avoid the blanket interrogation of male internally displaced
persons."
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanian paramilitary units must stop any armed
actions to provoke the Yugoslav security forces as well as
abductions and other violent activities, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Rule on Role of Public Employment Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union announced
here Tuesday a rule on the role of Public Employment Services
(PES) in the European employment strategy.
</P>
<P>
The rule makes a strong case for a modernization of PES, said
the European Commission, the EU's executive body. Public
employment services generally play a threefold function: provide
information on supply and demand on the labor market, offer a
brokerage service between job seekers and employers, and offer
adjustment measures to bridge the gap between the two sides of the
market.
</P>
<P>
With more than 5,000 local employment offices throughout the
European Union, and about 160,000 employees, PES as a whole is a
key institutional component of the European employment strategy.
The National Actions Plans for employment submitted by EU member
states this year confirm their role in carrying forward the
proposed strategies, the EU commission said.
</P>
<P>
PES activity is crucial to the objectives of activation of
employment policies and prevention of long-term unemployment
(LTU), the commission said. The PES thus has the main
responsibility for early identification of people at risk of LTU,
for the establishment of individual action plans for unemployment
job seekers, as well as for the delivery of counselling, guidance,
training services, implementation of job subsidy schemes and
generally a large part of the measures in favor of reintegration
of workers on the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The commission also stressed that four basic requirements
should be fulfilled in order for the PES to discharge their
responsibilities under the European employment strategy: a) obtain
substantial access to vacancies, b) make arrangements for the
systematic case management of all registered unemployed job
seekers, c) contribute to the coordinated delivery of all public
services to job seekers, and d) develop strong partnerships with
other relevant actors on the market.

HARARE, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. pop music superstar
Michael Jackson met Tuesday with Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe at the State House here in Harare.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mugabe told reporters that Jackson was
looking for investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said Jackson was interested in uplifting the Victoria Falls
in northwest Zimbabwe and building a chain of hotels in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to establish a chain of hotels in the country. I
suppose they would be Michael Jackson hotels," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Although Jackson did not confirm, Mugabe said, there was a
chance for the big investment in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"If he can bring his capital here we will be happy," added the
president.
</P>
<P>
Jackson who left for home Tuesday has been a frequent visitor
to southern Africa and is said to be interested in investing in
the region.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Hits Target For Third Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- UK underlying inflation hit the
Government's 2.5 percent target for the third month in succession
in October, according to official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time headline inflation - which includes mortgage
interest repayments - rose 0.1 percent on the month, while the
year-on-year rate slipped to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent in
September.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Byers, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the
inflation figures showed the government was successfully charting
a course of stability.
</P>
<P>
The figures are bound to fuel ongoing calls for more interest
rate cuts to boost a slowing economy - one which sees the
manufacturing sector experiencing recession conditions.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing there to stand in the way of a further
interest rate reduction," said Stephen Lewis, an analyst at
Monument Derivatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of England - which last week warned of rising
inflation next year - may well be cautious about making further
cuts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the figures also provide an early test of Prime
Minister Tony Blair's claims that his government is the government
of stability and economic competence.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the City on Monday night, Blair said that
inflation was under control and showed the Government's economic
policies were the right ones.

<HEADLINE> World Not Governed by "Law of Jungle": Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Tuesday urged the United Nations and other members
of the international community to send a clear message to Eritrea
that the world is not governed by the "law of the jungle".
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Kienran Prendergast, U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Meles said Eritrea
should be told that there are international laws governing the
world, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
An OAU committee which met in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on
November 7 and 8 presented a peace proposal to both Ethiopia and
Eritrea, calling for withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Badme and
its environs to positions it held before May 12 and the return of
Ethiopian civilian administration to the area.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal was rejected by the Eritrean side.
</P>
<P>
Meles also briefed the U.N. official on the existing
cooperation among concerned bodies to sustainably resolve the
problem of Somalia, saying that the U.N. and the international
community should assist the efforts of the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) to bring lasting peace to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast noted that the U.N. is willing to support IGAD's
efforts to settle the problem in the Horn of Africa state
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the coordinated efforts should be further
strengthened to ensure peace in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Reiterates Withdrawal of Foreign Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela reiterated Tuesday that all foreign forces should
withdraw from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"We are especially concerned by the potential of the military
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo to escalate still
further," said Mandela during a short visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally at the National Stadium in Dar es
Salaam, the South African president said the African continent
will become more volatile as more countries get involved in
military confrontations in DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The further shedding of the blood of innocents serves neither
the people of the DRC nor those who are intervening in the
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, South Africa is seeking every
opportunity to peacefully solve the conflicts through the
14-nation Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and in
consultation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"Our guiding principles are those agreed at the Victoria Falls
(in Zimbabwe) and at the SADC Summit in Pretoria in August," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"That means the immediate implementation of a ceasefire; a
standstill of military forces and the withdrawal of all foreign
forces from the DRC," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mandela expressed hopes that Tanzania
should play a significant role in promoting a peaceful resolution
to the conflict in DRC during a speech to members of the National
Executive Committee of Tanzania's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Tanzania have avoided military involvement in
the conflicts in the DRC since rebels took up arms against
President Laurent Kabila's government on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been accused by Kabila of backing rebel
troops, while Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad, Sudan have sent
troops to support the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Despite the convening of a series of meetings to end the
hostilities of conflicting parties, the fightings in the vast
central African country are still going on.

KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is pleased with
Iraq's unconditional resumption of compliance with all
U.N. Security Council resolutions, Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the close of a National Assembly
meeting, Sabah added that if the Iraqi regime re-escalates
tension in the region, it should be held responsible for the
continued sufferings of its people.
</P>
<P>
Sabah's remarks is Kuwait's first official reaction since Iraq
announced last Saturday to allow unconditional return to Baghdad
of the U.N. weapons inspectors, who withdrew to their rear bases
in case a military strike is launched against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended all forms of cooperation on October 31 with
the United Nations Special Commission (Unscom) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, the victim of Baghdad's 1990 invasion, has tried to
avoid being dragged into the standoff between Iraq and the
U.N. since it started, saying twice that it "is not a party of the
crisis".

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Clinton's Threat Violates U.N. Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said on Tuesday the
threat publicly uttered by U.S. President Bill Clinton to
overthrow Iraq's legitimate government is "a flagrant violation of
the U.N. Charter as well as the international laws."
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said although the Iraq-U.N. crisis over
weapons inspections has been defused for the time being, the
U.S. threat against Iraq still exists.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Sunday that Iraq narrowly averted a military
strike by backing down from its defiance of U.N. arms inspectors,
and that Washington would support the efforts of the Iraqi
opposition to overthrow the regime of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Saleh warned that Clinton's remarks, the first time in public,
would legalize international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had taken preventive measures to foil the American scheme
to topple the Iraqi government, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"No country in this world will tolerate interference in its
internal affairs by any other countries, and Iraq is of no
exception," said Saleh, adding that Iraq will not allow the
U.S. to control and plunder its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq resolutely rejects the U.S. flagrant interference
in its internal affairs, and the American attempt to achieve
political end through prolonging sanctions will not succeed.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait can not be lifted unless U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that it has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on Saturday that it would allow an
unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections which it
halted three months ago. Eighty-six weapons inspectors have
returned to Baghdad on Tuesday.

With a foreign debt of 3.6 billion U.S. Dollars, Uganda is
projected to have a total of 680 million Dollars in foreign aid.

CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Tuesday
dismissed statements by Israeli leaders on dealings with the
Palestinians as detrimental to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Arab diplomats in

Netanyahu announced on Monday that he was suspending Israeli

unless Arafat drops plans to declare statehood next May.

<P>
Abdel-Meguid also slammed Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon's call Thursday on Jewish settlers to seize every hilltop
in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of MIPONUH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday recommended to extend the mandate of United
Nations Civilian Police Mission(MIPONUH) for an additional year.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan reported that
MIPONUH had made substantial progress in contributing to the
professionalization of the Haitian National Police. "Although
United Nations civilian police officers have had a positive
effect on the conduct of police work in Haiti, more remains to be
done."
</P>
<P>
"The current force remains extremelyfragile and still lacks
the experience, professional skills, resources and cohesion that
are the hallmarks of a well-established police force," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
The continuing instances of excessive use of force by some
police officers were often a reflection of inadequate experience
and discipline, according to the report. "The Haitian National
Police is also facing the formidable and growing security
challenges caused by drug trafficking and banditry and must
continue to address the cases of crime and corruption that
occasionally arise within its ranks."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General emphasized the need for Haiti to
continue reforming its judiciary, warning that further delays in
this would jeopardize the progress that had been achieved by the
Haitian National Police.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Haiti had not had a Prime Minister since June of
1997, Annan appealed to Haiti's political leaders to solve the
current political impasse, which "has serious" consequences for
the future of democracy in the country and for its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 300 civilian police, 74 international
staff, 133 local staff and 17 United Nations Volunteers working
for MIPONUH.

the government.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from the Portuguese embassy in Angola who refused
to be named said the U.N. mission in Angola tried to evacuate its
staff and equipment last Friday when UNITA forces stopped them in
the excuse that the runway at Audulo airport in central Angola
needed "repair".
</P>
<P>
Supporters of UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi also stopped other
U.N. staff in withdrawing from Bailundo, another city in central
Angola in the same excuse.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat believed that Savimbi tried to turn the U.N.
personnel into some kind of "hostages", having heard a lot of
press reports about possible government offensives on UNITA
occupied areas.
</P>
<P>
Andulo and Bailundo are UNITA's political and military
headquarters. UNITA's failure to hand over the two cities and
their environs to the government early this year has been one of
the major causes for the crisis in the Angola peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
human rights investigator for Nigeria will begin his first visit
to Africa's most populous country next Monday at the government's
invitation, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soli Jehangir Sorabjee, a prominent legal expert in India, was
appointed to the independent U.N. post in October 1997, but the
government of the late Nigerian leader, General Sani Abacha, never
replied to his request to visit the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Sorabjee said in a report last month that General Abdulsalami
Abubakar, the new Nigerian leader who came to power in June this
year, has promised to restore civilian rule by the end of May
1999.
</P>
<P>
The new Nigerian government agreed to the nine-day-long trip
last September. Sorabjee plans to visit four cities including the
capital Abuja, central Nigeria, and Lagos, the economic and
commercial center of the country, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said, citing sources from the Geneva-based U.N. Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been ruled by the military for more than 20 years
in its history of 35-year independence. Shortly after he came to
power, General Abubakar has announced the plan to kick off another
round of the transition to civilian rule in the country.

CAIRO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Tuesday that it is
close to signing free trade agreements separately with Jordan and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Shura (Consultative) Council's Industrial
Committee, Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said that
talks are due to start this month with Saudi Arabia for a similar
deal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Gowaili as saying that
Arab bilateral free trade agreements would help promote the
process of liberalizing Arab trade and increase the inter-Arab
trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Neither Egypt's trade with other Arab countries nor inter-Arab
trade exceed 10 percent of their total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries are exerting efforts both at bilateral and
multilateral levels to negotiate free trade agreements and the
establishment of an Arab common market in a bid to enhance trade.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said the third ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization due to be held in the United States next year will
debate issues including agriculture, trade, services and
intellectual properties.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan official has
refuted press reports that a total of 24,000 prisoners die
annually in the country.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Etima, the commissioners of prisons, told a press
conference here Tuesday that this is impossible because the
prisons cannot even admit so many prisoners each year, Radio
Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that prisons across the country admit some 16,000
prisoners each year and some 480 inmates die during the period.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the death of prisoners mainly to the
poor prison conditions and improper management due to inadequate
funding.
</P>
<P>
Being lack of fund, the prison authorities in the country have
not trained their police officers for several years. And there
are many complaints about the incredibly poor conditions from the
inmates.
</P>
<P>
A report from police headquarters said many of the inmates
suffer starvation because there is not enough money to buy three
meals for them every day.

LUSAKA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from various
Zambian political parties finally arrived Tuesday at agreement on
the chairmanship of the proposed inter-party talks, paving the
way for the materialization of the long-expected dialog.
</P>
<P>
At a two-hour meeting held here Tuesday the representatives
agreed that Frederick Chiluba will preside over the summit
meeting as state president, not as ruling party leader.

It means that the team for the summit meeting of the ruling

<P>
The representatives attending Today's meeting included those
from MMD, the opposition United National Independence party

Party.
</P>
<P>
Last month the political parties worked out an agenda for the
proposed summit to be attended by presidents of the parties.
</P>
<P>
Who will chair the summit meeting had been a long-standing
controversial issue. Opposition parties had been insisting that
a neutral person preside over the meeting but MMD demanding
Chiluba chair the meeting.

Fundamental issues such as eligibility of a presidential
candidate, composition, powers and control of the electoral

AMMAN, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will do its best to
ensure the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord
signed in Washington last month, said Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan, the Regent, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting German
President Roman Herzog, Hassan said he had noticed a deep
commitment by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel
to implementing their peace agreement through his meetings with
PNA and Israeli officials since the signing of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The commitment can also be noticed through the timetable and
other programs presented by both sides to implement the accord,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from 13.1 percent of
the West Bank and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in
exchange for PNA's actions to crack down on anti-Israeli
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said that he had constructive and useful talks with
Herzog who arrived here earlier Tuesday on the third leg of a
Middle East tour that has taken him to Israel and the
Palestinian territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler,
Executive Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in
charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said on
Tuesday he would ask Iraq to hand out its chemical and biological
documents.
</P>
<P>
Butler made the statement in an interview with the American
Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be writing today to the Deputy of Prime Minister
of Iraq asking for them. It is very important," said Butler.
</P>
<P>
"In those documents, we should be able to get a truthful
knowledge of what kind of chemical weapons they had and the same
for the biological area and we need them now," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he would not set a deadline for getting the
documents from Iraq. "We need them now, without any further
delay."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed turning over the documents was part of the
"full and unfettered, unhindered cooperation access" that was
pledged to the United Nations by Iraqi leaders over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Butler said handing over the documents was in Iraq's best
interest and would ease lingering tensions.
</P>
<P>
"We have waited too long. Our purpose is not to sort of
screw Iraq to the wall. It is to get this job done. If they give
us the documents, if they let us into the places we need to go,
we will be able to get an account of their weapons, and get out
of the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to resume full and complete cooperation with
the United Nations on Saturday, avoiding the imminent U.S.
military strikes.

<HEADLINE> OPCW State Parties' Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Third Session of the
Conference of the States Parties of the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was officially opened
Tuesday at the Netherlands Congress Center in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Addressing representatives from 94 member states, 11 signatory
states and two observer states (Lybia and Eritrea), OPCW
Director-General Jose M. Bustani said that at the moment "we have,
under the Convention's verification regime, 48 chemical weapons
production facilities, 34 chemical weapons storage facilities,
five operating chemical weapon destruction production facilities
and 45 sites declared as containing old and abandoned chemical
weapons."
</P>
<P>
Bustani reminded member states that all 8 million chemical
munitions which had been declared along with the 25000 bulk
containers filled with chemical agent will have to be destroyed by
the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
It was essential that States Parties which possess stockpiles
of chemical weapons should keep the other members and the OPCW
Secretariate fully informed of their destruction plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bustani stressed that the work of the OPCW goes beyond the mere
dismantling, destruction of chemical weapons and the conversion of
chemical weapons production facilities. He said the Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC) is a regime of disarmament,
confidence-building, non-proliferation and non-discriminatory,
which encourages the exchange of chemical technology. "This
message needs to permeate to people at all levels, in all walks of
life, and all parts of globe," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 4-day conference's general debate was opened by Alexander
Christiani on behalf of the European Union. Other speakers
included representatives from Japan, Czech Republic, U.S., Russia,
Ukraine, Argentina, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Norway, South Africa,
Republic of Korea, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, China, Kenya,
Saudi Arabia, Slovak Republic, India and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's slide and a
weaker dollar push European bourses Tuesday into the red ahead of
the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The markets began the day cautiously, with investors seemingly
unwilling to take exposed positions in advance of a decision on
U.S. interest rates later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There was some comfort in Europe early on the day from the
Dow's close above the 9,000 level for the first time since July.
</P>
<P>
However, mild profit-taking on Wall Street cramped London
shares later Tuesday, which left the leading index nursing a slim
deficit by the close.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed 8 points lower at 5,503, having ranged
between 5562 and 5492. Market volume was a modest 645m shares
traded.
</P>
<P>
Dealing community seemed content to let their market drift in
tandem with the Dow, with few willing to take new positions ahead
of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
German shares fell in thin volume along with U.S. prices. The
leading Dax index closed down 81 points at 4,702 while the later
trading Xetra Dax electronic index was down 68 points at 4,718
near its close.
</P>
<P>
"The German market is waiting to see what the Fed's Open Market
Committee decides," said a Commerzbank trader in Frankfurt,
explaining the Xetra DAX's current narrow trading range.
</P>
<P>
French stocks retreated as investors stayed on the sidelines
waiting to see if the U.S. will announce an interest rate cut
later in the session.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index finished down 20 points at 3,601.
Traders described volume as "pretty poor".

NAIROBI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to
oust President Laurent Kabila have claimed the fall of Moba, a
small port on Lake Tanganyika, 150 km southeast of Kalemie, in
Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
Rebel radio Bukavu monitored in Kigali by Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) reported Tuesday that the town fell after a short battle
with Kabila's forces and their allies, a special RNA story faxed
to Xinhua based here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a rebel commander "Bob" as claiming that 352
Kabila's soldiers were captured at Moba, but gave no more details
on the exact casualty figure on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels who took arms to fight on August 2
declared that they would march on to seize Congo's second-largest
city, Lubumbashi, about 600 km southwest of Moba.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have in the recent past made considerable progress
in the towns of the Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
After the fall of Kindu, they now control Kabalo, Kongolo, and
a ring of towns in this mineral-rich province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels who are now being backed by Rwandan and Ugandan
forces are occupying about half of the vast country in the east
and the north. President Kabila has invited troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia and Chad to fight on his side to dislodged the
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Angola Helps Refugees by Offering Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- To reduce the financial burden
of the government, Angola has tried to help refugees by offering
them land, seeds and farm tools, with which they can help
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Albino Malungo, Minister of Assistance and Resettlement, said
here Tuesday after meeting international relief organizations,
that by this way, the government will enable the refugees to
produce their own themselves instead of getting daily necessities
from the government as they did before.
</P>
<P>
Malungo said that with 400,000 more refugees emerging after
June when Angola was plunged into another peace process crisis,
the government finds it very heavy a burden to feed the refugees,
with about one million still waiting to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
The government has to allocate about 80 percent of the money
originally planned to be used for development to aid the
refugees, but still finds it hard to guarantee the basic living
standard of the growing number of some refugees, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The key to the refugee problem lies in the materialization of
lasting peace in the country, Malungo said, urging that the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) should
renounce its war policy, and offer financial and material aid to
the government in its refugee relief efforts.

KUWAIT CITY, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Information
Minister Fuad Bin Mohammed Faresi Tuesday urged Arab news agencies

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Further Cooperate with Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said here Tuesday that people in his country will
continue to work with Tanzania in building peace and prosperity
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"As we stood together in the struggle for liberation, we must
now join hands for peace, development and democratic governance,"
he said during a short visit to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who will retire next year, made the visit to bid
farewell to Tanzania which in history gave strong support to
South Africans in national liberation and apartheid eradication.
</P>
<P>
The South African President praised Tanzania for its role in
mediating peace in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
and said peace, stability and democracy are essential conditions
for development.
</P>
<P>
He said the 14-nation Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) should be turned into the engine for development so that
the region could become competitive in the new world economic
order.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Tanzania share a common membership of SADC,
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM), he said, adding that the two countries should
take advantage of their traditional bonds to develop economy.
</P>
<P>
He said it is "deeply encouraging" to note that trade between
Tanzania and South Africa almost trebled in the past three years
but trade imbalance with Tanzania and other SADC counterparts is
still a source of worry which needs to be removed.
</P>
<P>
To change Tanzania's unfavorable trade position, he said,
"We're working together to ensure that imbalance is wiped out to
achieve equality."
</P>
<P>
South Africa's investment in Tanzania is also steadily
increasing with an ever growing number of South African companies
operating in Tanzania, he said, adding that the government
encourages such investments.
</P>
<P>
At the function, Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere
commended Mandela for setting a democratic example in Africa,
where some people love power so much that they refuse to step
down.
</P>
<P>
During nearly seven hours of visit, Mandela also held talks
with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa at the State House and
addressed a public rally at the National Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Introduce Higher Denomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) has concluded arrangements to release higher denomination
currencies into circulation next year, the News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Federal Government had approved the
new denominations of 100 Naira (one U.S. Dollar equals to about
85 Naira) and 500 Naira in view of inconveniencies and security
implications of moving large sums of money in 50 Naira notes.
</P>
<P>
At the just concluded economic summit held in capital Abuja,
CBN Deputy Governor Victor Odozi dismissed allegations that the
introduction of higher denominations would cause inflation as
"unfounded".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that government reflation measures and the
commitment of the organized private sector to the nation's
economic development would boost the convertibility and value of
the new notes.
</P>
<P>
At a business forum held in Lagos last August, participants
favoring higher denomination noted that rather than fuelling
inflation as being expressed in some quarters of the country, the
inflationary economy had necessitated having Naira in higher
denomination.
</P>
<P>
A study released at the forum said that the low denomination
of Naira costs the CBN a whopping 34 billion Naira (about 400
million U.S. Dollars) every year to keep the local currency in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
The study carried out by the Lagos Business School noted that
with 5.4 billion pieces of Naira notes in circulation, the
replacement cost is equal to 11.34 billion Naira (about 133
million Dollars) at the rate of 50 percent of all notes per year.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate is about 86 Naira to one Dollar and
the highest value of the local currency in circulation is 50
Naira.

ANKARA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir Tuesday summoned Italian
Ambassador to Ankara Massimiliano Bandini, demanding extradition
of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK).
</P>
<P>
Haktanir asked Bandini to give Turkey clear information about
the arrest of Ocalan, warning that "the actions of delaying or
complicating the extradition will harm Turco-Italian ties."

Ocalan was arrested by Italian police while trying to enter
Italy with a forged passport last week.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Ahat Andican told the press that the
Turkish government has decided to prepare the profile for the
extradition of Ocalan and send it to the Italian government as

Andican said an Italian lawyer will come to Ankara Wednesday to
exchange views with officials of the Turkish Justice Ministry on

LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn expressed the belief Tuesday that the global economic
crisis was coming close to an end.
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you whether we have reached the bottom, but my
guess is we are pretty close to it," Wolfensohn said in an
interview with a local television news program in London. "What is
important is that Japan should turn around."

<P>
"If you could get the United States continuing, if Europe could
continue the optimism, then if Japan turns around, we can carry
things through," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said he believed the Japanese government had
accepted the need to stimulate its economy and was
"extraordinarily anxious next year to have positive growth."
</P>

Also, he said that the Russian government's plan to cope with
its economic troubles would with luck see it through the next 15

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Yugoslav Cooperation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday called upon Yugoslavia to allow a U.N. probe of
human rights abuses in Serbia's province of Kosovo and condemned
it for preventing the arrest of three men indicted for 1991
massacres in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The vote on a resolution was 14 to 0 with China abstaining on
grounds that investigations by the U.N. war crimes tribunal
interfered in the internal affairs of a nation.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "calls upon the authorities of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, the leaders of the Kosovo Albanian
community and all others concerned" to cooperate fully with the
prosecutors of the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal on
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted in a response to a reported ban by
Belgrade of a prosecution team from the U.N. war crimes tribunal
to travel to to the Serbian province of mainly ethnic Albanians,
including its chief prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, defying Western accusations, has argued that the
conflict in Kosovo was an internal affair and outside the
jurisdiction of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Arbour had planned an investigation into "specific and
credible" allegations of Serbian atrocities against ethnic
Albanian civilians in Kosovo, where conflicts originated from
ethnic Albanians' bids for independence.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also condemns Belgrade for its failure to
surrender to the tribunal three men indicted in November 1995 for
the murders of 260 people in 1991 after the fall of the Croatian
city of Vukovar during the Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
It "demands the immediate and unconditional execution of those
arrest warrants, including the transfer to the custody of the
tribunal of those individuals."
</P>
<P>
The three suspects, Mile Mrksic, Miroslav Radic and Veselin
Slijvancanin were accused of involvement in the killing of unarmed
men forcibly removed from a Vukovar hospital.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Services Sector Targets to Become Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 18 (Xinhua ) -- A sub-committee on
Singapore's competitiveness in services sector has proposed to
spare no efforts to make Singapore the premier services hub in
Asia with a global orientation.
</P>
<P>
In its report made public at a press conference Wednesday, the
Hub Services Sub-Committee of the Committee on Singapore's
Competitiveness recommended several short-term measures to address
the current tight liquidity position of services companies and to
step up international marketing to differentiate Singapore from
the region.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Asian economic crises have affected Singapore
services more severely than manufacturing, the sub-committee
proposed to make significant structural changes in the services
sector and to adopt a new services paradigm and an overall
proactive policy.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended companies to refocus their present regional
market orientation to become more global.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen Singapore's core hub services and
develop new exportable services, the sub-committee said, it is a
must for Singapore to push forward in three broad thrusts: to
sharpen domestic policies and monitor cost competitiveness, to
enhance the international orientation and profile of services and
to exploit Information technology and telecommunications for wider
international linkage.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the sub-committee include efforts to
turn Singapore into Asia's center for knowledge/skills intensive
and other high value-added services, to provide a business
environment that attracts and anchors the world's top service
companies, to have an externally oriented services sector to be
focused on the international market, to have a pool of world-class
local services companies, and to use the country's advantages in
IT and Telecommunications to overcome physical and manpower
limitation and increase its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, priority will be given to the
development of international trading, transport and logistics,
business and professional service, media and communications and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's services sector, ranking 11th in 1997 in the list
of the World Trade Organization, has played an increasing role in
Singapore's economy with its share in the GDP going up for 64
percent in 1986 to 67 percent in 1997 and the share in the overall
employment rising from 64 percent to 70 percent in the same
period.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition showcasing
China's achievements in the past 20 years since the advent of
reforms and opening-up started here Wednesday in the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The show was organized by Russian State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, and the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov said
that "China has achieved real prosperity thanks to Deng Xiaoping's
wise policies, which have all been translated into reality rather
than concepts on paper."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wu Tao thanked the State Duma and its
Foreign Affairs Committee for their assistance in organizing the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 20 years Chinese economy has grown at an average
rate of 9.8 percent a year. In 1997, China's gross national
product (GNP) reached the seventh place in the world, while volume
of foreign trade rose to the tenth," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu Tao acknowledged that though the living conditions
of the Chinese people have been greatly improved, China remains a
developing country.
</P>
<P>
He noted there is still a long way for China to catch up with
the world level in terms of productive forces, science and
technology, and infrastructure in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, including 50 pictures, shows the historic
changes in China's reforms, from economic to political, from the
rural to urban areas, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the show will help the Russian
people get a better understanding of China's reforms and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the State Duma
Vladimir Lykin and Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
also attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be closed on November 26.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank cut its
key lending interest rate Wednesday by a quarter percentage point
in a bid to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Bank of Canada came one day after the
U.S. Federal Reserve cut both the overnight federal funds and
discount emergency lending rate by 0.25 percentage points on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"With the support that this move by the Federal Reserve
provides to help stabilize financial markets in the United States
and abroad, and given low and stable inflation in Canada, the Bank
judged that a similar 0.25 of one percentage point decline in
Canadian short-term interest rates was appropriate," the bank said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in less two months that Canada's central
bank cut its rate by a quarter percentage point.

<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing told a
panel of government officials and scientists discussing
water-efficient agriculture at the China Academy of Agricultural
Sciences today that China needs to save more water in its farming.
</P>
<P>
The only way out is in developing farming technology, Li said,
and using water-saving technology is regarded as a revolutionary
way of improving production.
</P>
<P>
China faces severe water shortages and an even sharper
disparity in water supplies and consumption, he said. Traditional
methods of irrigation have meant a huge waste of water and
developing water-saving irrigation technology is a strategic means
of modernizing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He asked all departments to join in the effort to develop
water-efficient farming and proposed that regional centers be set
up to do research and to spread the use of technological
developments.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also visited an exhibition showing the Academy's
achievements, a bio-tech research center, a lab, and a

BONN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy is in for a
major slowdown in 1999, but it should see a slight drop in
unemployment figures, the government's panel of economic advisors
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The five-strong panel, dubbed as the "five wise men" in
Germany, projected a growth rate in 1999 of around two percent,
down from this year's 2.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
They said next year the export sector could suffer the effects
of the Asian economic crisis, raising the importance of private
consumption in the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The economists also predicted that unemployment would drop
160,000 to 4.1 million, down 0.4 percent from this year's average
rate of 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The five wise men, in their autumn report, joined Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine in pressing the Bundesbank to lower the
interest rate, arguing it would help boost growth and employment.

ZHUHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's top two aircraft
manufacturers, the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, have
turned the China Air Show '98 into a business arena and started
the competition at the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
Airbus stepped out in front on the opening day, November 15, at
a news briefing where it expressed hope that it can establish
long-term cooperative relations with China's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has demonstrated its A330-200 and had 11 of its planes
in a conspicuous place at the exhibition hall. Its promotion
activities have focused on the new A340-600.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, to highlight its 27 years of presence in China, rented
a 180-sq.m. area for its sophisticated exhibits and announced at a
November 16 news conference that, since 1972, it has provided more
than 68 percent of China's jet planes and will try every means to
maintain its ties with the country.
</P>
<P>
On November 17, it showed its latest product, the B717-200, at
the news center. Boeing estimates that China will need 1,800 new
jets over the next two decades, worth 125 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Airbus has released a forecast also, saying that the country
will add another 1,300 aircraft, each with 70 seats or more,
valued at 130 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yuankang, deputy director of the General Administration of
Civil Aviation of China, said here that China's civil aircraft
fleet has grown 19 percent annually since the 1980s. In the next
20 years, that may slow down to 10 percent, he said, but the
country is expected to remain one of the most attractive aviation
markets in the world.

Cole, who has scored 65 goals in 132 games for United, was
furious that Hoddle does not consider him a deadly enough
finisher to warrant an England recall.
</P>
<P>
He said: "His (Hoddle) behavior towards me has been cowardly.
</P>
<P>
"His comments about me are diabolical and disrespectful. I'm
convinced that his reasons for leaving me out of the
international squad are not professional ... they're personal.
</P>
<P>
"If Hoddle doesn't want me to play for him then the feeling is
mutual.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the reaction of a bitter man. I'm not bitter. I
acknowledge a manager's right to select who he wants. That's his
job, what he is paid for, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Cole missed out on the World Cup squad for France this summer
after Hoddle expressed doubts about his strike-rate.
</P>
<P>
The England coach compared Cole's goal-per-chance ratio
unfavorably to other forwards, saying the former Newcastle hitman
needed too many opportunities before finding the net.
</P>
<P>
Despite Cole's recently improved form Hoddle remains
unconvinced he has international quality, with the England
coach-deprived of Michael Owen, Teddy Sheringham and Les
Ferdinand through injury-opting for a below-par Robbie Fowler and
the unproven Emile Heskey instead.

<HEADLINE> Pay Equity Ruling Could Cost Ottawa Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A court decision Tuesday on
women's pay equity could cost Bell Canada hundreds of millions of
dollars and lead to similar costly settlements with several other
corporations.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Federal Court of Appeal threw out a lower court
ruling that had halted the work of a tribunal charged with
figuring out pay equity compensation for Bell's 22,000 female
workers.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has been using the earlier Bell decision
as its rationale for appealing a July 28 ruling on pay equity for
thousands of female civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The appeal court finding could also affect companies such as
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, which face their own pay equity
battles with workers.
</P>
<P>
Unless Bell appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Bell
employees may now take their case to the quasi-judicial body for a
decision on whether 20,000 mostly female telephone operators were
underpaid by millions of dollars in comparison to mostly male
telephone technicians since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the same tribunal awarded a settlement estimated at
four billion Canadian dollars (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) to
200,000 mostly female federal public servants who for up to 14
years were underpaid in comparison to employees in male-dominated
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Angered by Kabila's Visit to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed indignation about the invitation made by some European
countries to Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana, and the
minister in president's office, Patrick Mazimpaka expressed their
discontent to ambassadors of some European countries in Kigali,
Radio Rwanda reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors were received separately and handed over a
message expressing the government's dismay about President
Laurent Kabila's visit to some European countries scheduled
during November 22-28.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government said that these countries known for
their well-advanced respect for human rights should not receive
Kabila as a guest for honor.
</P>
<P>
One reason evoked by the Rwandan government to shun president
Kabila is the execution of 13 loyalist officers on November 14
ordered by Kabila on simple grounds that they refused to fight an
unjustified war.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government also alleged that the Democratic
Republic of Congo has become a harbor for the criminal forces of
region.
</P>
<P>
It cited the former Rwandan government forces who stand
accused of the 1994 genocide, the forces of former Ugandan
dictator Idi Amin, Burundi Hutu rebels, and Sudanese
fundamentalists, and others.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese rebels, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops had
earlier voiced their dismay about the invitation to attend the
French-African summit due in Paris late this month.

</P>
<P>
They said that China needs to ban logging in the remaining

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Imports of Major Items Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's imports of major
items during the first quarter (July-September) of the current
fiscal year registered a major decline due to the stagnation of
domestic economic activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, imports of petroleum
products, machinery and food items declined by 7.9 percent, 6.5
percent and five percent respectively during the three-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's imports during the first quarter of 1998-99 fiscal
year amounted to 2.07 billion U.S. dollars as against 2.64 billion
dollars in the same period of last fiscal year, registering a
decline of 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that imports of petroleum crude and petroleum
products have declined to 298.6 million dollars during the three
months, showing a decline of 41.2 percent over the same period
last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This decline is mainly due to fall in the unit prices of both
petroleum crude and petroleum products by 28.5 percent and 34.3
percent respectively during the period under review.
</P>
<P>
The imports of machinery items declined to 479.6 million during
July-September, showing a short fall of 26.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, it is encouraging to note that the imports of
machinery items in sectors like textile machinery, office
machinery, agriculture machinery and implements and other
machinery have shown substantial increase over the corresponding
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Major decline has been observed in the imports of power
generating machinery, construction and mining machinery and
electrical machinery.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Allots Money for Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The finance committee of
Israel's Knesset (parliament) agreed Wednesday to allot 20 million
shekels (5 million U.S. dollars) for the expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the money was required because of the recent
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and it would be used for
infrastructure work in order to expand Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The decision came one day after the Knesset ratified the
Palestinian-Israeli peace accord with a landslide majority, paving
the way for the start of Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The accord signed last month in Washington envisages that
Israel withdraws its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in
return for tougher Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged
settlers to grab as much land as they can before Israel begins its
troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials described Sharon's remarks as "a
declaration of war," and the U.S. state department criticized the
foreign minister of "undermining trust and confidence" between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Without directly calling for a freeze of settlements expansion,
the deal stipulates that the Israeli and Palestinian sides should
refrain from taking any "unilateral step" to change the status quo
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel holds that its policy to expand existing settlements
has nothing to do with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police removed Jewish settlers occupying a
remote hilltop west of the Kedumin settlement in northern West
Bank. Four settlers were detained and the mobile homes they set up
were demolished. But the settlers vowed to come back repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The settlers began to establish mobile rooms near the hilltop
Monday, a day after Sharon' remarks to encourage them to seize
more land.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Help Pakistan, India Reduce Risk of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed WeMday urged the U.S. to help both Pakistan and India agree
on "measures to reduce risks" of nuclear conflict in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that our friends have also not paid sufficient
attention to the root cause of insecurity and instability in South
Asia," Shamshad said while briefing a group of American editors
here, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is fully alive to the risk and responsibilities of
possessing nuclear weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said, the maintenance of the credible nuclear
deterrence at the lowest possible level was now an indispensable
element of our security policy.
</P>
<P>
"Our security concerns are India-specific and confined only to
South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the propaganda about the so-called threat from China,
"almost all of India's military assets, an army of 1.2 million,
over 700 combat aircraft, a large naval flotilla, are developed
against Pakistan," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was in Pakistan's interest to avert a nuclear
missile race with India. It would like to, "move swiftly towards
the elaboration of a strategic restraint regime between Pakistan
and India. Avoidance of conflict and nuclear and conventional
stabilization measures should be an integral part of this regime."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad dilated on host of issues and made it clear economic
sanctions would not "serve the cause of peace nor of
non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"These sanctions and pressures are unjust and unwarranted.
Pakistan has not violated any legal obligation of international
norms," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the centrality of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to
issues of the security and proliferation in South Asia cannot be
over-emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan decided to resume talks with India with priority
attention being given to issues of peace, security and
confidence-building and the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and
Kashmir issue, Shamshad noted.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, India has so far shown no inclination whatsoever
to discuss Kashmir issue in a serious and purposeful manner
bilaterally with Pakistan, said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
The level of tensions along the line of control in Kashmir is
alarmingly high and Kashmir is now a nuclear flash point.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, particularly the United States,
cannot afford to remain indifferent to this extremely difficult
and volatile situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will continue to pursue in good faith its dialogue
with India," we hope and expect that our friends will do
everything possible to encourage, facilitate and assist the
process of peace and rapprochement in South Asia," the foreign
secretary stressed.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again by a quarter of
a percentage point Tuesday to help keep a gradual economic
slowdown from turning into a recession, but the central bank
signaled it might hold off on further reduction in coming months.
</P>
<P>
-- Preparing for his appearance before the House Judiciary
Committee on Thursday, the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
has rehearsed testimony that details a pattern of obstruction by
the White House extending beyond the matter of Monica S. Lewinsky,
lawyers familiar with his preparations said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The White House Tuesday accepted the House Judiciary
Committee's offer to question independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
when he appears before the committee Thursday, while committee
Republicans suggested they may call more witnesses to flesh out
Starr's allegations against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- Within days, the United States and Russia expect to launch a
new phase in human space exploration with an enterprise no less
audacious than the building of he pyramids in Egypt or the great
cathedrals of Europe. Their vision calls for workers from 16
nations to cooperate across barriers of language and culture in
the orbital construction of a 460-ton, 63 billion dollar space
station more than a football field in length, on one of the most
hostile frontiers known.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Knesset approved the interim peace deal with the
Palestinians by a vote of 75-19, and Arafat retracted calls for
the use of force to back a declaration of Palestinian statehood he
planned on making in May. The latter move led Prime Minister
Netanyahu of Israel to rescind his suspension of the partial West
Bank troop pullout that is at the center of the accord.
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslavia was ordered by the U.S. Security Council to
cooperate in Kosovo war-crimes inquiry, and rebuked for shielding
three men indicted for 1991 massacres in Croatia. Separately, a
U.S. envoy held autonomy talks with top Kosovo Albanians.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has
praised the Special Emergency Assistance Fund (SEAF) of OAU as a
practical example in Africa of expressing concern for fellow
Africans in times of need.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued here on Wednesday by the
OAU Information Division, the OAU Secretary-General said this on
Tuesday as he handed over grants of 200,000 U.S. Dollars to
Ambassador Papa louis Fall of Senegal, of 500,000 Dollars to
Ambassador Assane igodoe of Niger, and of 200,000 Dollars to
Charge D'Affaires Casimir Mpiere of the Embassy of the Republic
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The donations will be used in small projects affecting the
ordinary people in Senegal to alleviate poverty, to improve
people's living standards by installing an early warning system
in Niger to forestall the effects of drought, and to operate
village cooperatives and help in the reconstruction of the social
infrastructure devastated by war in the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted Salim as saying that he always felt
happy and satisfied that donations from the Special Emergency
Assistance Fund went directly to poverty alleviation in African
villages where the majority of grassroots live and have their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Salim also stressed the need to strengthen the Special
Emergency Assistance Fund and broaden its capacity by regular
contributions by member states, according to the press release.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Make Wrong Prediction And Meteor Shower Fails To Appear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Leonid Meteor Storm failed
to appear early this morning turns out to be a result of
astronomers' error.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was that the best place to see it was East Asia
and the best time was between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. (Beijing Time) on
November 18. They were expecting more than 5,000 meteors per
hour. But, at the appointed time in Xinglong County in Hebei
Province, a prime observation site, there were only a few easily
countable meteors.
</P>
<P>
These results were in stark contrast to the expectations,
according to Lan Songzu, head of Beijing Astronomical
Observatory's Xinglong Station. Dr. Zhu Jin says that on the
Beijing Astronomical Observatory's website, Czech astronomers
reported the peak activity at 12:00 on November 17 (Beijing Time),
meaning that the meteor storm was 14 to 15 hours earlier than
expected.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhu explains that the meteors formed in the trail of dust
and debris behind the Tempel-Tuttle Comet which orbits the Sun
every 33 years and the changing density of the debris makes a
correct prediction difficult.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese astronomer, Hu Jingyao, concludes that this
prediction error shows how insufficient our knowledge of meteor
storms is and a golden opportunity was lost.
</P>
<P>
But, not all stargazers are disappointed. Both professional and
amateur astronomers from China, the U.S., the Netherlands, and
Czechoslovakia had come to Xinglong quite a few days before the
event and enjoyed the period before the expected peak.
</P>
<P>
Hu says that this is Beijing Astronomical Observatory's first
look at the meteor shower and Chinese astronomers used very
sensitive cameras to photograph the meteors to gather the
information they can for research. They were also able to
communicate with international colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Annemarie Zoele, of the Dutch Meteor Society, says that she was
a little bit disappointed at first, but that there was a nice
meteor shower Tuesday morning with many fireballs and that she is
satisfied with the data so far.
</P>
<P>
The wrong information may also prove valuable for scientific
research in helping produce more accurate predictions.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders to Work Together for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have decided to work
together to seek an early and sustained recovery in the region, to
contain the risks of the contagion of financial crisis and to
prevent the possibility of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration issued at the end of their two-day informal
meeting here Wednesday, the leaders renewed their determination to
create a prosperous Asia-Pacific community.
</P>
<P>
To this end, they said, it is necessary to strengthen the
foundation for economic growth, provide the environment for the
efficient flow of trade, investment and technology and enhance the
capacities of member economies to participate in and benefit from
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm our confidence in the strong economic fundamentals
and prospects for recovery for the economies of the Asia-Pacific,"
they said in the declaration.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the regional financial crisis has had
economic and social aftershocks more severe than anticipated and
similar problems have appeared in other parts of the world, the
leaders noted that several encouraging developments have appeared
in APEC economies and in the international financial system in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
They said the progress made by Indonesia, South Korea, the
Philippines and Thailand in implementing strong reform programs
has resulted in a substantial degree of financial stability.
</P>
<P>
"In China, interest rates have been eased and an expansionary
fiscal package is being implemented to further stimulate economic
growth," they said. "Maintenance of the Renminbi exchange rate has
provided an important anchor to help secure regional financial
stability."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also pointed out some important challenges,
including the challenges to trade and investment liberalization
and facilitation and those to economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
To meet these challenges, the leaders are committed to pursuing
a cooperative growth strategy, which should include
growth-oriented macro-economic policies, expanded financial
assistance, strengthened financial systems, and stable and
sustainable private capital flows into the region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening
multilateral trade system to ensure fair rules and benefits for
all. They called for prompt accession of the applicants to the
World Trade Organization to achieve its universality.
</P>
<P>
They noted that in view of the diversity and different levels
of development of member economies, globalization and
liberalization must be complemented by initiatives that will build
confidence and increase capacity to benefit fully from these
processes in order to narrow the disparities in income and wealth.
</P>
<P>
The leaders emphasized that it is imperative to "achieve a
balance in all three pillars of APEC cooperation to ensure
sustained economic growth and development. "Economic and technical
cooperation has acquired added urgency in the wake of the
financial crisis," the leaders said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Introduce 1,000 Kyat Bank Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Myanmar
will put into for the first time circulation of 1,000 Kyat bank
notes commencing November 25, State-run Radio Myanmar quoted an
announcement of the bank as saying Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new banknote, which will be the largest
one in value, signifies another devaluation of the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
Other existing bank notes in circulation will remain legal, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in July last
year, the value of the Myanmar Kyat against the U.S. dollar
depreciated, falling from the then 1:160 to 1:350 now.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate sharply increased from 16.2 percent to 29.5
percent shortly after the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
At that time, rumors spread that Myanmar's 200 kyat and 500
Kyat bank notes would be withdrawn in exchange for new ones.
Regarding this, the government later denied by saying that there
was no such plan of the move.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, had also
denied then that his country would not change its monetary system
after becoming a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's entry into the association then coincided with the
outbreak of the regional financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review by Xu Xingtang China's Crucial Step In Financial Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China took a crucial step in
its financial reforms when it announced that the People's Bank of
China (PBOC) will set up nine regional branches to replace
provincial branches.
</P>
<P>
This marks a beginning of the central bank's administrative
system reform to establish a modern financial system and avoid
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that it will increase central bank power in
pursuing monetary policies and its independence in supervising
financial institutions and punishing people who break the law and
improving the efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China has been improving its financial sector and now has a
fairly complete financial system regulated and supervised by the
central bank, which comprises state-owned banks, policy-oriented
banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries have suffered badly from the Asian
financial crisis since last July and defects in financial systems
have led to economic collapses, but China has successfully avoided
any direct impact and implemented its financial reform plan in
an orderly way while other countries have been beset with various
problems.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review Financial Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PBOC Vice-Governor Liu Mingkang says that as early as 1993, the
Chinese government adopted macro-economic controls to stop
duplicate construction, improve financial order, and prevent
financial risks and has been paying attention to the international
balance of payments, foreign currency reserves, improvement of
market laws, and unfair competition among banks.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the financial crisis began, the Chinese
government convened a national finance conference with the goal of
introducing a financial system suited to a socialist market
economy in three years to gradually improve the ability to avoid
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
China's financial reforms have been intensified this year, with
measures to reinforce reforms and financial supervision by
abolishing the ceiling on commercial bank loans and reforming the
deposit reserve system.
</P>
<P>
It has dealt harshly with various illegal practices and closed
a number of institutions which were doing business illegally.
</P>
<P>
China's positive financial reforms have helped economic growth
and benefited regional economies. The stability of the renminbi is
generally recognized as having contributed to the health of Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
China has never stopped opening its financial sector to the
outside world. In the second half of this year the PBOC announced
that more overseas financial institutions will be allowed to deal
in rmb and Shenzhen has become the second city where overseas
financial institutions can deal in rmb.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that China will continue this opening and increase
capital, technology, and personnel exchanges and participate in
international financial integration to make an even greater
contribution to the international financial order.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sanctions Ruin Life, Kill Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Baghdad, once the proud
capital in the richly-endowed Mesopotamia, lost its brilliance and
glory after eight years of crippling U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Its people, and people elsewhere in Iraq, have been, and are
ravaged and killed by the sanctions, imposed following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
"No one has suffered more than the Iraqi people in the past
eight years due to the sanctions," Ali Al Qassab, a 50-year-old
Iraqi businessman, said.
</P>
<P>
A brief walk along Baghdad's streets is more than enough to
come to grips of the devastation of a country of more than 20
million people struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
Battered cars roam the streets, spluttering thick black fumes;
black-veiled women and old men squat on pavements, vendoring
second-hand furniture, electrical appliances, cloths, or whatever
they have.
</P>
<P>
The walls of apartment blocks look filthy; children run around
selling bottles of drinking water as their bare-foot pals follow
passers-by, begging.
</P>
<P>
Primary school attendance in Iraq, which had boasted one of the
best education systems in the Arab world, has fallen from 94
percent in 1990 to 84 percent in 1996, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of food and medicine are the most immediate results
of the sanctions. One in every three Iraqi children are suffering
from malnutrition, and more than 500,000 have died since 1990 of
hunger and lack of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Staples are rationed: one person can buy nine kilograms of
wheat flour, 2.5 kilograms of rice, two kilograms of sugar and one
kilogram of cooking oil every month - at government-subsidized
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meat has long been a luxury, many Iraqis can only afford meat
bones. "My family has not eaten any meat for the past month," said
a middle-aged housewife.
</P>
<P>
At the Children's Hospital in downtown Baghdad with some 400
patients, Dr Rad Al Janab told Xinhua that about six children die
each day in the hospital due to lack of antibiotics and common
diagnostic equipment.
</P>
<P>
The country's mortality rate is 10 times that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the embargo is still in place, there is little hope
for my daughter to recover from her disease," said a tearful
mother, whose two-year-old daughter was suffering from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Six Americans peace activists from the Voices in the Wilderness
group, visited the hospital. "Although a military attack was
averted, the embargo is still killing the Iraqi people silently,"
said Mira Tanaa, a member of the group.
</P>
<P>
"Innocent children became the victims. The United States are
punishing the Iraqi people," she added.
</P>
<P>
Now government employees can get an average monthly payment of
only 4,000 dinars (three U.S. dollars), barely enough to buy some
20 kilograms of wheat flour at market prices. They have to seek
second job to help support their family.
</P>
<P>
Many sold their houses, carpets, and even heirlooms to make
ends meet. "We are tired. We would fight to death rather than
being starved to death," said a shoe store owner.
</P>
<P>
But all are not poor. A few did get rich under sanctions. They
profiteered and smuggled goods from neighboring countries to sell
them at much higher price here.
</P>
<P>
Eight years of sanctions not only took their toll on the Iraqi
economy and people's livelihood, but also left deep mental scars.
</P>
<P>
Although the latest crisis between Iraq and the United Nations
over weapons inspections has been defused, yet many Iraqis were
pessimistic about the lifting the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
It is like "an endless dark tunnel," a store keeper said. He
said he preferred a military showdown to living in the shadow of
sanctions for good.
</P>
<P>
"Come what may, so long as we finish with this," he said.

</P>
<P>
Francois Brun, vice president of business development for
Skybridge, said that the use of satellite communications will rise
steadily, and he estimates that by year 2007, China will account
for ten percent of the world's demand.
</P>
<P>
He said the Skybridge network transmits not only voice and
data, but multimedia broadband traffic, and will allow Chinese
network operators to offer more flexible solutions and services to
end users.
</P>
<P>
He noted that hundreds of villages in China are not yet
connected by telephone lines, adding that Skybridge's
one-antenna-for-one-village solution will help Chinese users
access electronic commerce and video-on-demand in any corner of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company won't compete with local operators for
users, but instead will wholesale its network capacity to local
operators.
</P>
<P>
China now is actively seeking cooperation with foreign
companies to develop its satellite communication
service, and experimental operations of satellite-based mobile
communication systems are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
The France-based Alcatel company is the major owner of
Skybridge.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Jesse Community Demands Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Jesse community in
southern Delta State is demanding 10 billion Naira (about 116
million U.S. Dollars) as compensation for the October 17 petrol
fire disaster, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Jesse community, Chief J.I. Ogude, told a
press briefing at Jesse Tuesday that his community is holding
liable for the disaster the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC), and its subsidiaries--the Pipeline and
Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and the Department of Petroleum
Resources (DPR), and Shell Petroleum Development Company
(SPDC)/NNPC Joint Venture.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that if the demands are not honored, the
community might consider court option.
</P>
<P>
He said that PPMC and DPR are responsible for ensuring the
volume of petroleum products is properly recorded and noted at
the refinery prior to pumping out.
</P>
<P>
The time for the product to reach a depot is pre-determined
before commencement of pumping while the volume finally received
at the depot is recorded and communicated to the refinery in
order to compare figures, Ogude's lawyer, Halims Agoda said at
the press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Agoda stressed that there are sufficient equipment and
computers programed to record any pressure drop along the
pipelines, which will be the first sign of a leakage, and such
equipment and computers are supposed to be manned 24 hours
non-stop.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer stated, "We are therefore convinced that these
subsidiaries have failed to exercise their duty of care to
protect the community and avert the disaster considering the long
period the leakage lasted."
</P>
<P>
According to Ogude, After village to village census of
casualties was made, the last available statistics put the death
toll at 1,068.
</P>
<P>
This figure does not include casualties outside the community
who could not be identified and had to be given mass burial.
</P>
<P>
Ogude also put the number of surviving victims still under
medical attention at 300.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the casualties could not have been so high if
there were hospitals and medical centers in the community and if
first aid was immediately provided.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Prince Slams Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Belgian Prince
Armando de Miroud has termed the U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq
as a crime against humanity as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Prince Armando made the remark in an interview with the
Al-Iraq daily published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Armando, who is also head of the Iraqi-Belgian Forum for
Cooperation, said he came to Iraq to get acquainted with the
sufferings of the Iraqi people under the harsh circumstances of
the "inhumane blockade."
</P>
<P>
"The blockade has claimed lives of hundreds of thousands of
Iraqis over the past eight years, and this is a crime being
perpetuated by America and its allies in contravention of the
international laws and humanitarian norms," said the prince,
quoted by the paper.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and will not lift them until U.N. inspectors verify
that Iraq has been free of all weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors overseeing Baghdad's disarmament
resumed their work Wednesday after the latest Iraqi-U.N. standoff
over inspections was defused.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's October 31 decision to halt
all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraq had vowed not
to resume cooperation until the Security Council set a timetable
for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But Baghdad backed down at the last minute as the U.S. was on
course of launching punishing air strikes against it on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Armando said that he set up the Iraqi Childhood Society
in Brussels four years ago with the aim to inform the Belgian
people of the sufferings of Iraqi children living in acute
shortages of, among other things, food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
His society is seeking to boost cooperation and trade between
Belgium and Iraq, Armando said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 18 (Xinhua) --A top leader of the rebels
fighting the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
have denied reports of a split in the Congolese Democratic
Coalition (CDC).
</P>
<P>
Bizima Karaha who is in charge of the external relations of
(CDC) said here Tuesday that the report about the split among the
rebels is ungrounded, the New Vision newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New Vision reported Sunday that there was a gorgeous split
among the rebels fighting to topple DRC President Kabila, with
the emerging of a powerful new faction, called the Congolese
National Liberation Movement led by 39-year-old business tycoon
Jean Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
Karaha, who arrived in Uganda last weekend, asserted the
Congolese Democratic Coalition is one of the most united
movements, adding that it is united and open and believes in
unity in diversity.
</P>
<P>
There are many political organizations in the movement, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said Bemba, a Congolese, expressed desire to come and join
the movement led by Wamba dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Karaha said he is confident that the CDC forces, who are not
in a hurry to go to Kinshasa, will eventually defeat the allied
forces and make the DRC a peaceful and stable country.
</P>
<P>
Karaha was Kabila's foreign minister until the rebels took up
arms on August 2.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Slams Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- What took place at Wye
Plantation was meant to embellish the image of U.S. President Bill
Clinton, and would not lead to any real result, Esmat Abdul
Meguid, Secretary General of the Arab League has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview printed Wednesday in Syrian daily Tishrin,
Meguid said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to
the Wye talks with the premeditated decision of not withdrawing
from any part of Arab territories even if compelled to sign an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is absolutely capable of creating pretexts and
placing enough obstacles to halt withdrawal and this was exactly
what happened, Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu ordered the expansion of Jewish settlements and the
confiscation of lands in Hebron as soon as he returned, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord is absolutely meager, offering the Palestinians
the least while demanding much from them, he said.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of United States-brokered negotiations in the
Wye Plantation, Maryland, U.S., Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat signed an interim peace accord on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw from another 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for the Palestinian crackdown
on anti-Israeli militants.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt to Convert Loans of Major Ports to Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
expected to convert the loans of the major ports into equity to
corporatize the major port trusts in the country, official sources
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The major ports in the country were set up purely on debts in
the form of loans from the Center. This has resulted in the major
ports running up huge debts on account of government loans and the
interest thereon.
</P>
<P>
"This was a major stumbling block in our attempts to convert
the major ports into corporate entities," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Corporatization cannot take place unless the debts or a part
of it were converted into equity. This would also enable the
corporatized major ports to have a better debt-equity ratio," they
said.
</P>
<P>
After a couple of aborted attempts, the Ministry of Surface
Transport has drafted a corporatization policy for major ports.
</P>
<P>
Following corporatization, the major ports would have to pay
income tax, corporate tax and property tax to the government as
they would no longer be statutory bodies. They would also have to
pay dividend on the equity contributed by the government.
</P>
<P>
Instead of the existing system of the board of trustees, the
new entities would be governed by the board of directors headed by
a chairman.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Boost Oil Exploration With New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
agreed to provide new incentives to oil producing companies to
boost petroleum exploration and production in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
The incentives are contained in a memorandum of understanding
signed recently between the government and operators of the
country's six major oil joint ventures with Shell, Mobile, Elf,
Agip, Chevron and Texaco, according to media reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum will be signed into law
before the end of this year but without elaborating on the
details of the incentives, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Aret Adams, the Special Adviser on
Petroleum Resources to the Nigerian Head of State Abdulsalam
Abubakar, said here Tuesday that the new incentives are part of the
government's efforts to explore more of the country's oil
reserve.
</P>
<P>
According to Adams, Nigeria's current oil reserve of 25
billion barrels will be finished in 34 years, given the daily
production of two million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The special adviser urged the oil companies to be more
efficient in managing their business, given that oil prices will
remain low for a long term.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the Nigerian government will soon
allocate new licenses to local and foreign investors for oil
prospecting in deep offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Oil reserve in Nigeria's deep offshore basin is estimated at
20 billion barrels.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded their 6th two-day informal
meeting here Wednesday, committing themselves to working together
for the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders made their commitments in a declaration issued at
the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also endorsed two important documents -- the 1998 APEC
Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the
21st Century, and the 1998 Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills
Development in APEC.
</P>
<P>
The agenda will "facilitate our vision of enhancing APEC's
ability to harness technologies for the future and catalyze the
development of strong sustainable regional science and technology
networks and partnership," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the establishment of the China APEC Science and
Technology Industry Cooperation Fund," it said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced
that his country would allocate 10 million U.S. dollars for the
fund.
</P>
<P>
The leaders endorsed the Kuala Lumpur Action Program on Skills
Development in APEC as a significant inroad into public-business
collaborative partnership in skills development, the declaration
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the participants, resolved to work together to
support an early and sustained economic recovery in the region,
reaffirmed their confidence in the strong economic fundamentals
and the prospects for recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, important challenges still remained, which included
challenges to trade and investment liberalization and
facilitation, and those to economic and technical cooperation,
said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
During their two-day meeting, the leaders also held a dialogue
with the APEC Business advisory Council (ABAC), which was
established in 1995 as a permanent forum to advise the leaders on
business issues.
</P>
<P>
APEC, founded in November 1989, has 21 members: Australia,
Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong of China, Indonesia,

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weaker After U.S. Interest Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
backpedaled Wednesday despite the failure of the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) to take up the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve,
which overnight eased official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The local currency opened higher here after the monetary policy
easing in the U.S. took American interest rates below their
Australian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
That made the domestic unit more attractive to investors
looking for good returns, said NM Rothschild and Sons senior
manager of foreign exchange Paul Macarounas.
</P>
<P>
But heavy selling of the New Zealand dollar following an easing
in monetary policy in that country dragged the Australian dollar
down with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade, the local unit was buying 63.15 U.S.
cents from 63.33 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it traded between 62.90 U.S. cents and 63.60.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve - in its third cut in seven weeks -
lowered its federal funds rate to 4.75 percent from 5.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
Australian official interest rates currently sit at 5.00
percent, with the last move a 50-basis-point cut in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the interest rate differential caused the
Australian dollar to spike up to its highs for the day.
</P>
<P>
"When the U.S. cut their rates it means that on the interest
rate play, for investors it's much better to hold Aussie dollars
than U.S. dollars because you get a higher interest rate yield on
the Aussie dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar later fell away after the New Zealand
easing and on expectations the RBA would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Most economists remained convinced a rate cut in Australia was
firmly on the cards but where divided on exactly when, with
predictions ranging from almost immediately to early next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the foreign exchange cross rates the Australian
dollar was buying 76.59 Japanese yen from 76.83 and 1.0531 German
marks from 1.0559.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The court of appeal in the French city of Versailles decided
on Tuesday to condemn the president of extreme-right National Front,
Jean-Marie Le Pen, to one year of ineligibility for assaulting a
Socialist deputy last year. However, the new verdict reduced by half
an earlier one and would allow Le Pen to run for the elections of
European Parliament in 2000 and the French presidential election in
2002.
</P>
<P>
-- The new Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has indicated
that he would not agree to a Turkish demand for extradition of the
leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan , because
he would risk death penalty. Ocalan, who was the founder of PKK,
was arrested at the Rome airport when arriving from Moscow with
false immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After the Pinochet affair, the arrest of the Kurdish Worker's
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian police has again
placed Europeans in an awkward position. The Kurdish community in
Europe is demanding Italian goverment to resist Turkish pressure for
his extradition. Kurds from around Europe held demonstration on
Tuesday in Rome to support Ocalan while violence broke out when
Turks demonstrated in Brussels calling for Ocalan's extradition.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli parliament or Knesset Tuesday voted with a
three-fourth majority for the Wye Plantation memorandum between
Israel and Palestinians, a strong approval not seen since the 1979
Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt. Meanwhile, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahua and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat had installed a truce to their verbal war against each other.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Development of Science, Human Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said Wednesday that grasping and organically integrating
science and technology development and human resources utilization
are of great importance to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) members.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in his speech at the APEC Leaders' Informal
Meeting on Science and Technology Cooperation and Human Resources
Development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that though APEC members are in different stages of
development in these two fields, they each have their "own
advantages and thus can complement each other."
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on all members to implement "as soon as possible"
the APEC Agenda on Science and Technology Industry Cooperation
into the 21st Century and the APEC Action Program on Skills
Development, adding that these two documents are "important
results of economic and technical cooperation in APEC this year."
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized three aspects in view of the requirements of
the two documents and the actual needs of the members at the
current stage.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, to carry out science and technology industry
cooperation to help enterprises enhance their innovation
capability.
</P>
<P>
"Only through intensified development of human resources and
institution of a management mechanism that responds to the need of
the market can enterprises increase their capability to turn
scientific and technological findings into productivity and thus
stay competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to increase the financial regulatory and supervisory
capability to ward off any risks that might come with the
globalization of the international financial market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that it is "pressing" for some developing
countries to take more advanced measures and train high-level
managerial personnel so as to enhance their capability to regulate
and supervise the financial sector and ward off risks in this
area.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to provide reemployment training and promote
coordinated social and economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed hope for deeper exchanges and cooperation among
APEC members in this regard, because improvement of social
security systems and provision of reemployment training are new
tasks and important system engineering for all the member
economies.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sinologist Criticizes Unfair Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- American businessmen
influenced by unfair and incomplete reporting by the Western media
have quite likely missed many market opportunities in China, said
Laurence Brahm, an American writer and investment consultant.
</P>
<P>
"Various members of the American media have consistently
focused on the negative side of China and neglected the nation's
progress and improvements. Their attitudes have not only had great
impact on the White House and Congress, but have prevented the
American business sector to gain a better understanding of China,"
according to Brahm.
</P>
<P>
"My view is quite common amongst foreign businesspeople who
speak the Chinese and have lived in China for a long time," said
Brahm, managing director of the Naga Group.
</P>
<P>
Brahm now lives in a quiet Beijing lane lined with cypresses
and traditional quadrangles dating back hundreds of years. And his
house, too, is far different than normal apartment buildings, and
is instead a typical Beijing Siheyuan (a compound with houses
around a courtyard) with a pair of stone lions guarding either
side of a bright red gate door.
</P>
<P>
"I like the lane and my Siheyuan, and I've established good
neighborhood relationships. The neighborhood committee provides
me free rat poison when needed," said Brahm.
</P>
<P>
The author and sinologist has authored more than 10 English
language books on China, including "Red Capital", "China As No.1"
and "Thirty-six Negotiating Strategies In China".
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans receive information about China via Beijing
correspondents for various media agencies, including CNN, the
Washington Post and the New York Times, said Brahm. Unfortunately,
he added, "they should not believe everything they hear."
</P>
<P>
A number of U.S. congressmen have visited Beijing and found
that the Chinese capital is vastly different than reports carried
in some American newspapers. Beijing has expressways, tall
buildings and a World Trade Tower much like any modern western
city, but the Red Guard no longer exists, according to Brahm.

Government to common cause with the states inside monetary union.
</P>
<P>

-- The Federal Reserve Tuesday cut interest rates for the third

the past year.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The most radical overhaul in the 80-year history of the
Territorial Army was announced Tuesday with cuts of more than 50 per
cent in the infantry but a commitment to improve specialist units,
especially medics.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>

Kurdish woman died in a suicide bombing in Turkey as a diplomatic
storm caused by the arrest of a guerrilla leader deepened across
Europe.
</P>

election bill Wednesday after the peers inflicted a rare fourth

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Developed Nations to Adopt Responsible Attitude  in Tackling Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, in a keynote speech at the sixth Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Informal Meeting in Kuala Lumpur
Wednesday, urged developed countries to adopt a responsible attitude
in dealing with the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Calling for strengthened international cooperation in the face
of the crisis, Jiang said members of the international community
should work together to maintain a steady development of the world
economy in a spirit of sharing responsibilities and risks.
</P>
<P>
In this process, he said, developed countries should try to
stimulate their economic growth, boost domestic demand and expand
import by formulating appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
They should refrain from resorting to trade protectionism, the
Chinese president noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jiang said, developed countries should
increase financial assistance to the crisis-stricken countries and
make proper arrangements to reduce their debt burdens in a bid to
help them stablize their financial situation and revitalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
by so doing, the Chinese president said, developed countries
will not only help the affected countries and regions tide over
their difficulties, but also serve their own interests.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, Jiang said, has occurred against the international
background of accelerated economic globalization, a trend which
has enhanced the inter-dependence and interaction of the economies
of different countries.
</P>
<P>
In this context, once a financial crisis breaks out in certain
countries or regions, not only will developing countries suffer
immensely from it, developed countries will also find it hard to
stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese leader said, the international community
should work together to curb the spread of the crisis and jointly
create a favorable external environment for the recovery and
growth of the crisis-stricken economies.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Tuesday killed at least 12 Tamil rebels in skirmishes in the north
of the country, military spokesman here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said government troops in a small group
operation confronted a group Tamil rebels and engaged with small
arms, killing two rebels at Vannivilankulsm in Northern Province

</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, some rebels fired mortars at troops manning

with mortars and artillery causing casualties among the rebels.
However, three soldiers were injured during the incident, he said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Slowdown Worsen in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The third quarter of 1998
turned out to be one of the worst in Israel's economic history,
with economy growth descending, per capita gross domestic product
(GDP) shrinking and public consumption slumping.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter saw the lowest quarterly increase since 1989 of
1.4 percent and the per capita GDP growth dipped by 1 percent for
the fifth consecutive quarter, the report of the Central Bureau of
Statistics showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said exports plunged by 19 percent and imports
by 3.1 percent compared with the second quarter. Public
consumption plummeted by 2.3 percent against the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky said the data
proves that the government should change its goals and give
growth the top priority in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Based on the initial prediction of 3.1 percent GDP growth rate
for this year, the government has forecast that in 1999 at 2-2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the disappointing figures in the third quarter made it hard
to achieve the 3.1 percent growth target, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Israel's central bank, Yaacov Frenkel, has been
under fire recently over his tight financial policy, especially
his move to raise the interest rates twice in less than two weeks
this month.
</P>
<P>
The rise of interest rate, by 2 percentage points each time,
was designed to confront Israeli currency's devaluation against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Critics said Frenkel's high-interest-rate policy failed to
achieve the goal of keeping inflation low, but helped slow down
the economy growth and led to high unemployment by discouraging
investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
After the consumer price index saw a record rise of 3 percent
in October, experts said that the annual inflation rate is likely
to end up at 9 to 11 percent, much higher than the 4 percent the
central bank had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate also experienced a record high of 9.5
percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky has said the government should not stick to its
inflation goal of 4 percent for the next year, but should raise
the level to 5 or 6 percent while boosting exports and stimulating
growth.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Violence up in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of domestic
violence complaints in Israel rose 5.5 percent in the first 10
months of this year compared to the same period in 1997, local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 19,000 complaints were filed with the police in the
period, the reports said, 75 percent of which by women on assault,
battery and property damages.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on domestic violence this week, Israeli Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani criticized legislators for
setting a bad example by using violent language in Knesset
(parliament) debates.
</P>
<P>
"We must ask whether we are doing enough to set a good
example, ...the distance between using (violent) language and
using one's fists is not great," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected charges that the police were not doing
enough to stem domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
Next month, 170 policemen will complete a course on dealing
with domestic violence, according to National Police Chief Yehuda
Wilk.

<HEADLINE> Launching U.S. Satellites with Chinese Rockets Beneficial to Both (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The launching of U.S.-made
satellites with Chinese rockets is a normal business activity
beneficial to the companies concerned and the two countries as
well, said a Chinese company executive.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinxia, president of the China Great Wall Industry Corp.,
who is here in Zhuhai to attend an ongoing air show, made this
remark while briefing the press on launching U.S.-made satellites
with Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
As a general contractor for China's Long March rockets which
launch commercial satellites for the international market, Zhang
said, the China Great Wall Industry Corp. has long maintained a
good relationship of cooperation with U.S. satellite manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In April 1990, the China-made Long March 3 launch vehicle
successfully sent Asia-Sat1, manufactured by the Hughes Space and
Communications Company, into orbit and achieved the highest
accuracy of all the U.S. company's 31 launched satellites.
</P>
<P>
This fact symbolized China's comparatively higher level of
satellite launching in the world market, and made China the
world's third country capable of offering commercial satellite
launches.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that last April, some U.S. media published a number
of untrue and irresponsible reports about China's commercial
satellite launches, and accused U.S. companies, including Hughes
Space and Communications, of helping China improve its missile
guidance and control systems in the process of using Chinese
rockets to launch their satellites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress thus held a judicial investigation into this
matter, which has had a negative impact on normal business
activities between the U.S. and China, and has harmed the
interests of both the concerned companies and the two countries,
said Zhang.

To safeguard the technical security of U.S.-made satellites,
China and the the United States signed a "Memorandum of Agreement
between the Government of the United States and the Government of
the People's Republic of China Regarding Satellite Technical
Security" in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
"China has always abided by the agreement since launching the
first U.S.-made satellite in 1990, and the technical security of
U.S.-made satellites in China is guaranteed," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, 1996, China failed to send an International
Satellite Organization satellite into the orbit due to technical
problems in the Long March 3B launch vehicle, and made an
immediate investigation into the abortive launch, invited six
specialists from the United States, Britain and Germany to discuss
a report based on the investigation, and came to conclusions that
were recognized by both the insurance companies and the satellite
client.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, establishment of an independent group is a
normal commercial practice, wherein China has never obtained any
technical aid.
</P>
<P>
Before entering the world market for commercial satellite
launches, China fully relied on itself and raised its level of
launch vehicle manufacturing and related control systems to a high
standard.
</P>
<P>
China has always conducted commercial satellite launches in
accordance with the law of the market and according to
international common practices, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Launching U.S.-made satellites with Chinese rockets is
mutually beneficial to China, the United States and to concerned
companies of the both countries," said Zhang, "As a matter of
fact, the U.S. side has benefited more."
</P>
<P>
In the 21 commercial launches, China has made thus far,
U.S.-made satellites directly used in the skies over the
Asia-Pacific region, greatly advanced U.S. companies' pace of
entering China's telecommunications market, brought greater
commercial benefit and more employment opportunities to the United
States, and helped increase U.S. satellite manufacturing
industry's advantages, influence and competitiveness, according to
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
It will not do that some people in the United States are
attempting to check normal business activities between the United
States and China, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He added that normal cooperation in the field of commercial
satellite launches between the two countries will be recovered
soon after these disturbances end, as such cooperation conforms to
the common interests of the United States and China.

items in leading Turkish newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- Italian Ambassador to Ankara Massimiliano Bandini Tuesday
was summoned to Turkish Foreign Ministry where he was warned that
the friendly Turco-Italian ties would be harmed if Rome refuses
to extradite Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly preparing an official document for the
extradition of Ocalan and will send it to the Italian government
soon.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said Tuesday in Austria
where he was on a state visit that Turkey is determined to become
a candidate for the full membership of the European Union (EU)
within this year.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the EU should deal with Turkey's membership
bid in a just and equal manner instead of discriminating against
the Muslim country due to religious and cultural reasons.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Development Bank Records $2.5M Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Development Bank of Zambia
(DBZ) has recorded a loss of some 2.5 million U.S. Dollars in the
financial year ending on September 30, 1998 and is in a weak
position to continue its lending.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67 percent of the bank's previous loans had gone
into non-performing projects, DBZ Managing Director Deepak Malik
disclosed here Tuesday when Zambian Minister of Finance and
Economic Development Edith Nawakwi made an inspection of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted Malik as saying
that the bank's liabilities exceeded its current assets which had
weakened the institution's ability to provide medium- and
long-term loans to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The bank chief attributed this to mismanagement and
accountability, inadequate project evaluation and monitoring as
well as poor loan recovery which has dropped from last year's
15.5 percent to six percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Malik called for the amendment of the DBZ Act to bring about
accountability in the institution and to reduce the government's
shareholding so as to attract foreign shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi conceded that the institution was technically
insolvent which compelled the World Bank to recommend its closure
to create an apex financial institution out of it.
</P>
<P>
She, however, said the government is more than keen to
recapitalize the institution because no country can develop
without a development bank to give medium-and long-term finance
to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi urged the bank's management to put in place a strong
loan evaluation, and a monitoring and recovery team to recover
the loans from all the firms that owed the bank.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister criticized the Bank of Zambia,
central bank of the country, for failing to supervise the
country's financial institutions adequately.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions are having difficulties
because of loopholes in the central bank's supervision, she said.

<HEADLINE> Researchers: Well-done Meat May Boost Breast Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Women who regularly eat
well-done red meat may increase the risk of developing breast
cancer, according to a study released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers of the University of South
Caroline and published in Wednesday's Journal of the National
Cancer Institute, asked 273 women recently diagnosed with breast
cancer and 657 healthy female and found those who eat very
well-done meats had a 4.62 times higher risk of breast cancer than
those who prefer for rare or medium-done meat.
</P>
<P>
"In our study, well-done meat referred to meat that was
grilled, pan fried, or broiled extensively, so that the surface
was charred or heavily browned," said Dr. Wei Zheng, author of the
study, who added that risk of breast cancer was also elevated with
increasing intake of well-done to very well-done meat.
</P>
<P>
"We have found a link between well-done meat and breast cancer,
but we are still not sure of the cause," Zhang said, "this is just
one study and it is too early to jump to a final conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Christine Ambrosone of the National Center for
Toxicological Research in Jefferson, said Zheng's findings "are
consistent with what have been found in the laboratory."
</P>
<P>
Lab studies have linked cancer with some chemicals created when
meat is cooked at high temperatures, she said. Some studies, using
nursing mice, have shown that heterocyclic amines are present in
breast milk. But she cautioned against applying this laboratory
data to humans.
</P>
<P>
Other researchers said Zheng's findings are intriguing, but not
conclusive. They said more research is needed.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Canyon Lures Chinese, Foreign Expeditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHAQU (Tibet), November 18 (Xinhua) -- Three expedition teams,
two Chinese and one Spanish, are now exploring the Yarlong Zangbu
Daxiagu, the world's largest canyon, in Tibet, southeast China.
</P>
<P>
The three-member Spanish expedition team is also making
preparations for a larger expedition next year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientific team, with 63 scientists, explorers
and journalists, are hiking along the canyon in three groups.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a Yarlong Zangbu River rafting team also
reached here.
</P>
<P>
Local Menzhong villagers told Xinhua that a U.S. expedition
team recently gave up their ambitious plans when one of its
members was swept away by whirlpools under a group of seven newly
discovered waterfalls when he tried to approach the waterfalls by
kayak.
</P>
<P>
The reported missing U.S. team member has not been found yet
and the team has returned to Lhasa, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
The travel service department of southern China's Guangdong
Province has now arranged for the first-ever tourist group to
visit the canyon.
</P>
<P>
Li Tianyun, a farmer from central China's Henan Province, has
joined the expedition team in Zhaqu after hearing news of the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
Spending his own money, the farmer said, "I just want to breathe
the fresh air in the canyon."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yichou, resources scientist, said the canyon area is
expected to become a new trophy destination for explorers, just as
the world's highest peak, Qomolangma (Mt. Everest), became a prime
destination for explorers and mountaineers at the beginning of
this century.
</P>
<P>
This grand canyon is locally known as the Yarlong Zangbo
Daxiagu; it is 496 kilometers long and has an average depth of
5,000 meters.

<P>
LUSAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- About 5,600 drug addicts have
been recorded in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, an anti-drug official
said.
</P>
<P>
Mukutulu Sinyani, spokesman of the Drug Enforcement Commission
(DEC), said Tuesday that DEC is running 28 rehabilitation centres
in the capital city to help the addicts to get rid of their habit,
the newspaper Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had 22 rehabilitate students and one has so far
graduated," Sinyani said.
</P>
<P>
He said DEC is using United Nations standard calculation
mechanism to come up with the number of addicts in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said Lusaka has 800 actual reported cases, but using
the United Nations global drug addict calculation standard,
addicts in Lusaka come to 5,600.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. stanadard multiplies every reported case seven times
to arrive at the actual number of drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Sinyani noted that it is sad for the nation that the most
productive group aged between 11-35 is addicted to drugs.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Australians Watch Meteor Shower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of stargazers in
eastern and northern Australia were lucky to get best meteor show
views Wednesday, while savage storms Tuesday night dumped hail and
rain over most of Perth, capital of the state of Western
Australia, blotting out a long-awaited star-gazing spectacular.
</P>
<P>
Western Australia was to have been one of the best places to
view the Leonid meteorite shower, caused by the Earth's passage
through the long tail of the Comet Tempel-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
But it became obvious about three hours before the display was
due to start that the thick cloud cover would not budge.
</P>
<P>
"Cloud has been the big killer," a Perth Astronomical
Observatory spokesman told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Hail and heavy rain were dumped on the metro area by a series
of small but intense storms.
</P>
<P>
Stargazers in three states and one territory, namely eastern
Australia's Queensland, Tasmania, New South Wales states and
northern Australia's Northern Territory, were rewarded Wednesday
for having turned out at prime vantage spots early Wednesday to
see the Leonid meteorite shower as they got clear view of the
shower.

<P>
TOKYO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices ended higher in Tokyo
Wednesday with the key Nikkei index hitting its highest level in two
months on active buying by investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 186.23 points, or 1.29
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 14,599.23, its highest finish
since September 10.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) that covers all
First Section issues added 5.77 points or 0.52 percent to 1,113.42.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 477 million
shares from Tuesday's 385.90 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Condominium builder Haseko was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The market was encouraged by a dual interest rate cut in the United
States as analysts think the action will help sustain the country's
economic growth, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Japanese daily reported Wednesday that the opposition
Liberal Party (LP) plans to set aside the issue of suspending the 5
percent consumption tax as it engages in talks with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) on creating a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
But traders said consumer-related stocks continue to rise,
signifying that the market has not yet ruled out the possibility of a
consumption tax cut.

Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, gainers outpaced
losers 818 to 344, with 110 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Prices Low at Weekly Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Prices tended to be
relatively lower in good demand at the weekly tea auction at the
Kenyan Indian Ocean port Mombasa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The market is holding up quite well. There was good general
demand but prices tended to be easier," Richard Surrey, Chairman
of the Tea Brokers Association (of East Africa), was quoted by
Wednesday's East African Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Surrey said Tuesday that Pakistani packers lent the market
good support and general traders (bazaar) from the country had
returned to the market.
</P>
<P>
Traders said Britain bought according to quality and the other
major buyers at Mondays' tea auction were Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The threat of conflict in the Middle East, where U.S.-led air
strikes were averted at the last moment, had no effect on the
Mombasa market.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of extended instability in the Middle East
had no real effect on the (Kenyan tea) market," a senior trader
said.
</P>
<P>
Traders also noted that the quality of Kenyan tea was
generally low but the supply would still be good into December.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is firmly on course for a record crop of 280 million kg
this year, up from around 222 million kg last year and 257
million kg in 1996.

<P>
Under the contract, China will import electric appliances

When the upgrading is complete in 2000, it will raise the annual
production capacity from the present 2 million tons to 3.5 million
tons, yielding an additional profit of 280 million yuan a year.

The existing mill, the largest of its kind in China, was
designed and produced by the China No. 1 Heavy Machine Tool Plant
and Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, the mill has turned out 23 million tons
of rolled steel, yielding a profit of 3 billion yuan and an export
value of 60 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Meishi Power
Holding Co. Ltd. recently purchased 153 hectares of land in
Haikou, capital of Hainan Province, for tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The company said they will invest 1.5 billion yuan in

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Becoming Fatter, Shorter: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The working population in the
Chinese capital, mainly the young and middle-aged, are becoming
heavier and shorter because they are getting less physical
exercise, according to a survey released in today's Beijing
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Many of them also suffer from less healthier functioning hearts
and lungs, and their legs are not as strong as they should be, the
survey says.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1994, the per capita weight for local males has
increased by 3.6 kilograms and for females by 1.2 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
And oddly enough, the survey indicates, the average height has
dropped by 3.89 centimeters in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Beijing Municipal Sports Committee attribute
the "poor health" of local residents to less physical exercise and
eating fewer nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 80 percent of the people who do morning
exercises are elder retired citizens, and only one in a dozen
surveyed local enterprises has work-break exercises.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts warn that less physical exercise and the intake
of too many calories can easily lead to diseases such as tumors,
high blood pressure and diabetes. The incidence of such diseases
has been on the rise among young and middle-aged people in the
Chinese capital, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, statistics show that local workers now travel 53
minutes on average to work every day. Health officials suggest
that people do more physical exercise to keep fit and healthy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Philippines agreed on Tuesday night to lift the
ceiling on the country's consolidated public sector (CPS) deficit
for 1999 in a drive to further boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
CPS, which groups the national government and all its agencies
and instrumentalities, is expected to raise its deficit to 2.53
billion U.S. dollars from an original goal of 2.13 billion U.S.
dollars for 1999, sources close to the negotiation said.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit, the national government's deficit which
represents the bulk of the CPS deficit, would climb to 1.68
billion dollars from an original 450 million dollars in 1999, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 1.68 billion dollars would be poured into preferred areas
of low-cost housing, agriculture and education.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also reduced the government's revenue target of 260
million dollars for 1999 to 125 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of their two-week review of the Philippine
economy, the visiting IMF officials seemed upbeat about it, saying
the domestic banking and corporate sectors remained sound.
</P>
<P>
"This owes much to the stabilization and market-oriented
reforms pursued over the past decade, and the measures implemented
this year to contain the fall-out of the crisis," the officials
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, president of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said today that
China will be able to keep the exchange rate of the yuan stable
next year.
</P>
<P>
The banker told those gathered for the opening of the central
bank's Shanghai branch today that China has witnessed sustained
and healthy economic development and a good record of
international payments.
</P>
<P>
China has enough foreign exchange reserves to pay for the
country's imports for at least one year, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's current floating system of exchange rates
for the yuan against major international currencies is quite
effective, and is under the close supervision of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the floating system is decided by market supply
and demand, which is conducive to maintaining a stablized exchange
rate for the yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cost of Chinese exports will be lowered
further next year, and that the margin of rising prices for
consumer products will not be large.
</P>
<P>
However, severe challenges still remain for the country's
export enterprises next year, and he believes measures that the
Chinese government has taken will enable the country sustain a
balance of international payments, which will prevent the
devaluation of the yuan.

the past 20 years since the introduction of the reform and opening
policies. The country had 13 insurance companies by the end of
1997, including nine foreign-funded insurance groups. A total of
189 representative offices had also been established by overseas
insurance companies throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
Insurance premiums for 1997 hit 108.97 billion yuan, up 39.19
percent on the previous year, with total underwriting rising by 36
percent to 21.5 trillion yuan and the total assets of insurance
companies soaring to 164.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wen pointed out that China's rapidly developing insurance
business involves a number of hidden risks. He said the CIRC will
help improve the nation's insurance market and will be highly
beneficial in terms of efforts to establish an insurance
supervision system suited to socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC will also help reduce financial risk and ensure the
sustained healthy development of the insurance industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC's major tasks will center on formulating policies,
regulations and development blueprints for commercial insurance;
supervising and guiding business practices in the insurance
industry, rendering punishment for illegal practices in accordance
with the law and protecting the rights and interests of
policyholders; ensuring an orderly insurance market order and
promoting fair competition in the sector; and establishing a risk
evaluation and warning system for the industry in order reduce
risk and promote the healthy development of the insurance sector.

SHANGHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's commercial banks
are further expanding their loans, especially to large and
medium-sized enterprises, in order to enlarge consumer credit and
promote consumer credit use.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
revising its food policy to make it relevant to a liberalized
market, East African Standard Wednesday quoted a senior
official as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop "Kenya Food for All" held here
recently, Agriculture Permanent Secretary Philemon Mwaisaka said
that the new food policy will be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy will introduce a new approach to food
production, supply and marketing, inviting stakeholders to
forward their contributions to the ministry for consideration
before the new policy is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry is reviewing the parliamentary acts
related to the agricultural sector to enable it to cope with a
liberalized market, he said, adding that the restructuring will
focus on extended services to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Mwaisaka said that the Kenyan Agriculture
Ministry has created a post of senior deputy director who will
coordinate extension activities.

<HEADLINE> Large Cache of Old Mortar Shells Discovered in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Expressway construction
workers have discovered eighty-five mortar shells at least 50
years old in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The shells, 20-centimeter long and weighing three kilograms,
were discovered by workers in an underground limestone cave at
Huangjiaoya town on the Chongqing-Guizhou expressway.
</P>
<P>
Local public security departments said the highly corroded
shells may have been those of Kuomintang troops stationed in
Chongqing when the city was a transient capital.
</P>
<P>
The underground limestone cave has a size of at least 100
square meters. As the cave entrance is blocked up by silt, more
shells are expected to be found there.
</P>
<P>
The public security departments have removed the shells' fuses
and will destroy them when all the shells are unearthed.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Baichuan, a 92-year-old local farmer, said that the cave
was used as an arsenal by the Kuomintang troops, and he saw with
his own eyes the soldiers moving shells into the cave over half a
century ago.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Weapons Inspectors Resume Work in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspectors, who
returned to Baghdad Tuesday after an imminent U.S. military strike
against Iraq was averted, resumed their work on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Iraqi escorts and some 40 arms inspectors
left for unknown weapons sites from the U.N.'s Baghdad Monitoring
and Verification Center.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the U.N. arms inspectors to resume
their work since last August when Iraq barred the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) which supervise the destruction of Iraq's
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that arms
inspectors on Wednesday would restart the comprehensive monitoring
of potential Iraqi weapons sites as well as repositioning and
checking long-term surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
The sources said arms inspectors' work would also include
taking air, water and soil samples.
</P>
<P>
Intrusive inspections of new suspected sites that usually need
clues may have to wait until next week when UNSCOM have time to
organize, said the sources, adding that not all inspection-related
equipment had been brought back to Iraq yet.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler last Wednesday ordered
the withdrawal of some 100 personnel from Iraq on the "strong
recommendation" from the U.S. government which said a military
strike against Iraq was imminent.
</P>
<P>
Iraq averted possible U.S. and British air strikes at the last
minute on Saturday by agreeing to allow the resumption of
U.N. arms inspections unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq decided to ban UNSCOM and the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from conducting intrusive inspections
of new sites, while allowing their monitoring activities to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on October 31 went further to halt all forms
of cooperation with UNSCOM, including its monitoring activities,
while allowing IAEA to proceed with its monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and UNSCOM of attempting to
prolong the punishing U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China Province to Restructure Farm Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, a major rice
producer in east China, plans to launch a new round of farm
production restructuring by growing more cash crops and boosting
the local farm products processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The new reform is aimed at helping transform traditional
farming into one featuring higher yields, higher quality and
higher efficiency, thus laying a foundation for agricultural
modernization in the coming century, according to provincial
government officials.
</P>
<P>
In three to five years, Jiangsu will plant cash crops on 30
percent of its 4.7 million hectares of cultivated land, while the
remaining 70 percent will be retained for grain production.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to the development of about 30 large
processing enterprises and a number of cooperatives capable of
producing, processing and marketing farm products, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade agriculture, the province will introduce at least
240 new strains of grains along with advanced processing equipment
from abroad before the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be taken to promote some local farm products
as name-brand produce in order to boost development of the
processing industry.

<HEADLINE> Graf Beats Novotna in Chase Tennis Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The five-time champion
Steffi Graf of Germany took advantage of a cramping Jana Novotna
of the Czech Republic and eliminated the defending champion
tonight at the 2 million U.S. dollars Chase Championship, the WTA
Tour's season-ending event in New York.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Graf, unseeded in the tournament, beat Novotna
6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1 tonight in her opening match.
</P>
<P>
Another former No. 1 player joined Graf in the quarter-finals
earlier tonight as Switzerland's Martina Hingis rallied for a
4-6, 6-0, 6-4 triumph over countrywoman and Fed Cup teammate
Patty Schnyder.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Novotna was bothered by cramping in her left
leg and received medical treatment in the opening game of the
third set.
</P>
<P>
The Czech managed to hold serve and had two break points in
the next game, but was unable to capitalize and never won another
game.
</P>
<P>
Graf immediately went up a break in the first game of the
second set and followed by beating the Wimbledon champion with
her serve, losing only one point in her first four service games.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th game, Novotna barely saved one set point as Graf
hit a forehand return just wide, but could not duplicate that
feat on the next point, as Graf hit an overhead smash for a
winner that sent the crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
Graf continued her dominance of Novotna as she improved to
28-4 all-time, including 17 of the last 18 meetings. Graf, who
entered New York having won back-to-back tournaments in her
native Germany and Philadelphia, will face the winner of
Wednesday's match between fifth seed Monica Seles of the United
States and Russian teenager Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
After losing her serve twice in dropping the first set,
Hingis, the second seed, stormed through the second set in 17
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Schnyder went up a break in the second game of the final set,
but Hingis broke right back in the next game when Schnyder hit a
lunging backhand long.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon runner-up and eighth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France
beat Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 6-3, 6-1 in a lackluster daytime
affair. It was Tauziat's third win over Zvereva this season and
she now leads the head-to-head series 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In a rematch of their Wimbledon semi-final won by Tauziat, the
Frenchwoman broke Zvereva twice in the first set and reeled off
six straight games in the second to close out the 499th match
victory of her career in 68 minutes.
</P>
<P>
With the knock-out of Sanchez Vicario of Spain yesterday,
Lindsay Davenport of the United States has assured of the world's
top-ranked player this year.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Davenport plays her opening round match against
Sandrine Testud of France on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Small Satellite Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Xu Fuxiang, president of the
Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST) said here today that
China has achieved a number of technological breakthroughs and
plans to establish a small satellite network.
</P>
<P>
CAST and various related departments recently completed a
feasibility study of technology needed to establish a related
satellite environmental monitoring and disaster warning network,
according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
The network of six advanced satellites, including four optical
satellites and two radar satellites orbiting on two optical
planes, will provide round-the-clock monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China also plans to develop small satellite networks
for navigation, global positioning, mobile telecommunications and
earth observations. Realization of the programs will enable
China's small satellite technology to reach advanced international
standards.
</P>
<P>
China has actively developed, but has not as yet launched
advanced small satellites, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
When compared to traditional satellites developed in the 1970s,
China's advanced satellites feature high technology, longer
operating life and greater functionality.
</P>
<P>
China has joined a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific
region in the development of the small multi-mission satellite
SMMS.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have spent two years developing the advanced
"Practice 5" satellite, and a pickaback launch is planned for the
first half of 1999. China also plans to launch an oceanic survey
satellite in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China recently completed the CAST986 Platform with a physical
interface equalling all international standards.
</P>
<P>
International standards list satellites weighing more than 100
kg but less than 1,000 kg as small satellites, with mini
satellites weighing less than 100 kilograms. Related satellites
offer flexible low cost launch options.
</P>
<P>
The eight small and mini satellites China has launched since
the 1970s are playing an important role in environmental
monitoring and the development of new technology.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Eases Monetary Conditions Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Governor Don Brash of the
Reserve Bank, New Zealand's central bank, Wednesday surprised
local financial markets by unveiling a bigger-than-expected
easing in monetary conditions, the Evening Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper reported that the bank has
slashed its target for the monetary conditions index for the first
quarter of 1999 to negative 400.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts had tipped a target of negative 300. Before the
announcement the index was negative 269, but this morning it
dropped sharply to 339, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The monetary conditions index measures the strength of interest
rates and the New Zealand dollar, and is used by the Reserve Bank
in setting monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Brash as saying that the bank expects the
New Zealand economy would shrink by 1.5 percent in the year to
December.
</P>
<P>
"The international economy is expected to be weak, with less
room for New Zealand to increase exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank is forecasting unemployment in the country to
peak at 8.4 percent in the year to March 1999 and then to fall
slowly, according to the bank governor.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to reach 1.7 percent in the year to March
1999 and then drop away, Brash said.
</P>
<P>
Brash's statement had an immediate and pronounced effect on the
 local financial markets. Within minutes of his statement, yields
on 90-day bank bills fell to 4.3 percent from 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 90-day rates are a key indicator for banks when setting
mortgage rates, which are already at their lowest levels in nearly
30 years.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Trust chief economist David Plank was quoted as saying
that he expects further interest rate falls. He said 90-day bank
bills would be in the 4-4.5 percent range for quite some time with
mortgage rates falling to the 6-6.5 percent level.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the big banks in New Zealand are charging
6.95 percent, though some fixed-rate mortgages are lower still.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar was also falling on the news, the
Evening Post said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Introduces New Component for Mobile Phone Handsets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States-based Lucent
Technologies Group has introduced the world's smallest technology
platform for the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
handsets to the China market.
</P>
<P>
The new platform, only slightly larger than a business card,
consists of the SC1688 chip developed by Lucent and relevant
software.
</P>
<P>
Handsets using this platform can operate in three GSM frequency
bands, allowing users to wander through different mobile
communications networks in the Asia Pacific region and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Using this platform, GSM handset manufacturers can cut by 50
percent or more the testing time and related costs for gaining
official approval.
</P>
<P>
The platform can also prolong the standby time of batteries
up to 500 hours.
</P>
<P>
Handsets equipped with such a platform will be on the market in
the second quarter of next year.

<HEADLINE> Study: Smoking Up Among U.S. College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smoking is on the
rise among U.S. college students, increasing 28 percent during the
past four years, which may cause more tobacco-related disease,
according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association,
was based on a 1997 survey of 14,521 students at 116 colleges in 39
states.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found some 28.5 percent of college students smoked
in 1997, up from 22.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Henry Wechsler, author of the study, blamed the alarming rise in
cigarette smoking among college students on even alarming increase of
teen-ager smokers at high schools.
</P>
<P>
Smoking already had risen among teen-agers by 32 percent in the
1990s, he said, so once those teens hit college, the rates among
college students were sure to rise, too.
</P>
<P>
"College students and people with college educations have
traditionally smoked at lower levels than people not attending
college," said the study, adding the new findings should be a wake-up
call for an examination and strengthening of prevention efforts from
middle school through college.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested colleges adopt policies to discourage smoking,
such as expanding smoke-free areas on campuses and making sure that
dormitories and other shared living quarters are smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and
death. The U.S. government says it kills more than 400,000 Americans a
year.

<HEADLINE> hke111823 - River-Dredging Project Proposed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A project proposal has been made
for dredging 1,150 kilometers of rivers and rivulets in Bangladesh
at an estimated cost of 34.17 billion taka (about 704.5 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak
while answering a question in the parliament Tuesday, a daily
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project proposal was made against the background of the
devastating floods which occurred in the country earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Steps would be undertaken for the implementation of the project
after approval by the appropriate authorities as well as
availability of funds, The Independent daily quoted the minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dredging of 30 kilometers from the mouth of the river Gorai
started in October this year to protect the environmental balance
in the southwestern part of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three project concept proposals for a feasibility study on
dredging seven rivers in different districts as well as the
Kapotakkha and Betna rivers in greater Khulna-Jessore district
were under process in the Planning Commission, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project will start in the current fiscal year (July
1998-June 1999) and is expected to be completed by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Situated along the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh has as many as 230
rivers, the majority of which constituting an interlocking net
fall into three river systems -- the Ganges, the
Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Meghna.
</P>
<P>
The river systems shape the daily life of the people and also
pose the perennial threat of flood.
</P>
<P>
This South Asian nation experienced the worst floods in a
century during the July-September period this year, with
two-thirds of its territory hit and about half of its 127 million
people affected. The floods inflicted a preliminary estimated loss
of around 4.3 billion dollars.

GENEVA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 FIFA/Confederations'
Cup will take place in Mexico from July 28 to August 8, 1999

<HEADLINE> U.S. Small Businesses Urged to Embrace Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority
of small and medium businesses in the United States have not
strategically embraced the Internet as a business tool, according
to a new survey released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nor do they grasp the unprecedented opportunity the Internet
offers to level the playing field," said the Yankee Group, an
Internet technology and communications market research firm.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the firm said, Internet solution providers need to
revise their product lines to reflect a staged approach to Internet
commerce focused on first building a foundation, before attempting
to migrate small and medium businesses to higher-value services.
</P>
<P>
The research firm identified a three-phase process that small and
medium businesses undergo as their Internet commitment strengthens:
connectivity, customer connections and commerce. More than two-thirds
of the companies surveyed have yet to move into the customer
connection phase.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting the Internet as a tool to transform the way small and
medium businesses buy and sell will not connect with this market," the
Yankee Group said. "Their needs today are focused on improving
communications, with commerce coming much later."
</P>
<P>
Small businesses are those with two to 99 employees while medium
businesses employ 100 to 499 people. Among the two categories
surveyed, only an average of 30 percent stated that the Internet was
important to achieving business goals. In fact, although 61 percent of
small businesses and 82 percent of medium businesses report that they
have some form of Internet access, only 50 percent of all PCs within
small businesses and 31 percent of all PCs within medium businesses
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm, small and medium businesses account
for 98 percent of all U.S. businesses, represent about 50 percent of
the nation's GNP, and spend approximately 445 billion U.S. dollars
annually on information technology products and services.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that service providers, as well as equipment
manufacturers, have a huge opportunity to turn these companies into
'Internet believers' through substantial education efforts and
long-term relationship building," the Yankee Group said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Continue Falling on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices fell to
five-month lows on Tuesday as the U.S. market continues to retrace
its steps after last week's jump on fears of U.S. military strike
against Iraq, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Oil traders said Tuesday that the end of the military threat only
turned market focus back on an extremely weak demand picture and
ample U.S. supplies.
</P>
<P>
Extremely weak demand from Asia and only moderate demand from
Europe have made exporters turn to the United States as their chief
source for income. That has allowed U.S. inventories to swell some
10 percent over year-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for December
delivery closed 37 cents lower at 12.45 U.S. dollars a barrel,
dipping closer to the 10-year lows below 12 dollars a barrel seen
in June.
</P>
<P>
Oil product prices were also weak in line with crude oil's
weakness. Gasoline prices fell to 12-year lows as December gasoline
ended at 38.06 cents a gallon, down 1.51 cents. December heating oil
fell 1.05 cents a gallon to end at 35.10 cents.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even predict the possibility of a decline in oil
prices into single digit for the first time since 1986, unless the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries takes dramatic steps at
its winter meeting next week to reduce oil supplies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stargazers Observe "Drizzle" Instead of Expected "Storm" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Chinese stargazers, braving winter chills and night wind, observed
a much smaller meteor shower than scientists predicted during the
overnight observations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kemin, researcher with the Beijing Observatory, said the
predicted Leonid Meteor Storm (LMS) of around 5,000 meteors an
hour did not occur, and they only observed one or so every three
to five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Li Meijia, a student at the middle school attached to Beijing
Medical University, said though she spotted the largest number of
shooting stars she ever saw, like most of the night's stargazers
she was disappointed since "scientists painted a much more
beautiful meteor storm" than was visible last night.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Jin, astronomer who observed at the Xinglong station of
Beijing Observatory, said "the number of shooting stars was even
less than that during the small hours yesterday."
</P>
<P>
He said that according to Czech observatories, the LMS had
reached its climax yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Mountain Observatory attached to the Chinese Academy
of Sciences reported at 4:30 am this morning after collecting
nationwide LMS observation information that from 1:00 am to 4:00
am this morning, most of the observation stations only spotted
about a dozen or so shooting stars an hour.
</P>
<P>
They reported that only Lijiang Prefecture in southwest China's
Yunnan Province observed as many as 20 to 50 shooting stars an
hour.
</P>
<P>
However, Beijing Observatory has decided to continue
observations at small hours tomorrow in case a larger shower
appears.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Beijing residents observed the rare event
in suburban counties, while many more stayed up late to watch the
shooting stars through windows or by standing atop their
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The lowest temperature in Beijing was at around eight degrees
below zero last night.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Changchun in northeast China's Jilin Province,
tens of thousands of residents went into the snow-covered
streets to observe the meteor shower in 19-degrees-below-zero
weather.
</P>
<P>
In China's leading industrial city of Shanghai, residents
ranging from five-year-old kids to old folks in their 80's went to
squares and riverside areas to watch the long-anticipated event.
</P>
<P>
By 4:00 am this morning, more than 300,000 people had visited
the "Shanghai on Line" website to get the latest information on
the LMS.
</P>
<P>
A number of astronomers from the U.S., Britain, France, the
Netherlands and other countries joined the observations at the
Beijing Observatory.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of the keynote speech delivered by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the 6th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders
Informal Meeting which opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
Malaysia, Fellow Colleagues:
</P>
<P>
It is a real pleasure for me to meet you again, my colleagues,
in this beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur. I wish to thank our host
the Malaysian Government for its thoughtful arrangement. I would
also like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome our three
colleagues from Russia, Peru and Vietnam, who have joined us at
the meeting for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At the Vancouver meeting last year, the financial crisis in
some Asian countries aroused wide concerns among APEC members.
Now a year has passed but its ramification is still spreading out,
not only bringing serious economic difficulties to some countries
and regions in Asia, but also affecting the world economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
This crisis has occurred against the international background
of accelerated economic globalization, and it has given the world
people important revelations.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization has become a trend as a result of the
economic, scientific and technological development in the
present-day world. It has brought to countries in the world not
only development opportunities, but also serious challenges and
risks. It has also presented to countries, developing ones in
particular, a new subject to tackle, that is how to ensure the
economic security of a country.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization requires active
participation by all countries in international economic
cooperation. However, countries should expand their opening-up
program in the light of their national conditions and in a
step-by-step manner while paying attention to increasing their
capabilities of preventing and withstanding risks.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization has made the economies of
countries more and more inter-dependent and interactive. Once a
financial crisis breaks out in certain countries or regions, not
only developing countries will suffer immensely from it, but
developed ones will also find it hard to stay out of it. A
globalized economy calls for global cooperation. All members of
the international community should work together to maintain a
steady development of the world economy in a spirit of sharing
responsibilities and risks.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization is emerging and developing
in a context where there is no fundamental change in the
inequitable and irrational old international economic order, which
will inevitably widen the gap between the poor and the rich
countries. The ultimate solution to this problem is to work for
the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international
economic order in the interest of the common development of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the international community has a common concern
about how to curb the ramification of the financial crisis at an
early date and prevent a worldwide economic recession. In order
to promote steady development of the international financial
sector and the establishment of a new international financial
order, I would like to put forward three proposals:
</P>
<P>
I. To strengthen international cooperation, prevent the spread
of the crisis and create a favorable external environment for the
economic recovery and growth of the crisis-stricken countries and
regions. The developed countries should adopt a responsible
attitude to stimulate economic growth, boost domestic demand and
expand import by means of fiscal and monetary policies, and
refrain from resorting to trade protectionism. At the same time,
they should increase financial assistance to the crisis-stricken
countries and make proper arrangements to reduce their debt
burdens in an effort to help them stablize the finances and
recover the economy. In this way, they will not only help these
countries tide over the difficulties, but also serve their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
II. To restructure and improve the international financial
system and ensure a safe and orderly operation of the
international financial market. Those big powers with influence
in international finances are duty-bound to take effective
measures to improve the supervision and regulation of the flow of
the international financial capital, contain over-speculation of
the international hot money, and enhance the capability for the
forecast and prevention of financial risks and for their relief.
It is essential to deliberate the establishment of a new
international financial order which conforms to the interests of
all sides, through dialogue and consultation between developed and
developing countries in compliance with the principle of equality
and mutual benefit and on the basis of extensive participation by
the international community. I agree that the APEC Finance
Ministers' Meeting should study the questions related to the
restructuring of the international financial system and put
forward relevant proposals.
</P>
<P>
III. To respect the independent choices made by any countries
or regions on overcoming the crisis. The countries and regions
stricken or affected by the crisis differ in the level of economic
development and historical tradition, and also in the cause and
impact of the crisis. Therefore, there is no, and can not be, a
fixed model or single remedy for them all to tide over the crisis
and revitalize the economy. Instead, they should be given support
in taking measures in the light of their own situation. The
international community and organizations should respect the right
of a country to make decisions on its own, and help it lift itself
out of the difficulties as soon as possible through consultation
on an equal footing. Developing countries, particularly countries
and regions stricken or affected by the crisis, should make
necessary readjustment of their economic structure and policies in
the light of their own conditions, properly handle the prominent
problems in their economic development, and increase economic
dynamism by taking full advantage of the favorable conditions,
both internal and external.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis has also brought negative effect and great
pressure on the economic development in China. The Chinese
government has assumed a highly responsible attitude. China has
provided assistance to the relevant countries within the framework
of the IMF arrangements and through bilateral channels.
Proceeding from the overall interests of maintaining sustained
economic growth and international economic development, China has
made the decision of not devaluating the RMB, for which China has
paid a high price. Having won a battle against the catastrophic
floods this summer, we are now going ahead with more in-depth
reforms, adopting active fiscal policies, increasing input for
infrastructure construction, and boosting domestic demand in an
effort to achieve this year's objective of economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
APEC, as the most important international economic organization
in this region, must adapt to the new situation, persist in
narrowing the gap and realizing the objective of common prosperity
through economic cooperation and make timely readjustment of the
priority areas for cooperation so as to better meet the needs of
the developing members, which make up the majority of the
membership. At present, it is more important than ever to stick
to the APEC Approach characterized mainly by respect for
diversity, voluntarism and consensus-building. APEC should make
its own contribution to increased regional stability and
prosperity by adhering to this approach.
</P>
<P>
Promoting economic and technical cooperation (Ecotech) among
its members is a major task of APEC and a primary way to common
development. In the world of today, science and technology are
progressing with each passing day and the knowledge economy is
unfolding. To redouble the efforts to develop high and new
technology and speed up the economic restructuring are the only
way to promote a long-term and steady development of the economies
of APEC members. We are glad to see the formulation by APEC of
the APEC Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation
into the 21st Century and Skills Development Action Plan this year
under the chairmanship of Malaysia the host country. They
represent a major step by APEC members towards enhanced Ecotech.
China attaches importance to and supports the implementation of
these two important documents. As an expression of this, the
Chinese Government has set aside 10 million U.S. dollars to
establish the China APEC Science and Technology Industry
Cooperation Fund for the purpose of financing cooperation between
China and other APEC members in the field of science and
technology industry, and has put forward a series of proposals on
cooperation projects. China has also set up a China APEC
Enterprises Assembly to promote enterprise participation in APEC
activities.
</P>
<P>
Promoting trade and investment liberalization is another
important task of APEC. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all
members, positive progress has been made and will continue to be
made in this area. In the current circumstances, it is important
to pursue an active and prudent policy, and its members should be
allowed to make efforts towards the realization of the goal --
trade and investment liberalization -- at a pace and in a mode
suitable to their own conditions and in accordance with the two
timetables on the basis of voluntarism, flexibility and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
The current difficulties facing some Asia-Pacific countries and
regions are temporary ones. I believe that there is huge economic
vitality and development potentiality in the Asia-Pacific region.
So long as we work together to increase cooperation and surmount
difficulties, the economic and social development in this region
will have a broad and bright prospect.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Respect for Independent Choices Over Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Wednesday called on the international community to respect
choices independently made by any countries or regions in their
efforts to overcome the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at the sixth Informal Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the moment, the international community has a
common concern about how to curb the ramification of the financial
crisis at an early date and prevent a worldwide economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
However, in the process of coping with the crisis, there is no,
and can not be, a fixed model or single remedy for all the
affected countries and regions to tide themselves over the
difficulties and revitalize their economies, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The reason, he argued, lies in the fact that they differ in the
level of economic development and historical tradition, and also
in the cause and impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the international community and organizations should
respect the right of the countries and regions to make decisions
on their own, and support the measures they adopt in the light of
their own situation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president called on the developing countries,
particularly the crisis-stricken regions, to make necessary
readjustment of their economic structure and policies in light of
their own conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they should also properly handle the prominent
problems in their economic development, and increase economic
dynamism by taking full advantage of both the internal and
external favorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on APEC to adapt to the new situation and
make timely readjustment of the priority areas for cooperation so
as to better meet the needs of the developing members, which make
up the majority of the membership.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, Jiang was optimistic, saying the current
difficulties facing some Asia-Pacific countries and regions are
temporary ones.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region boasts huge economic vitality and
development potentiality, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
The economic and social development in the region will have a
broad and bright prospect as long as all the countries and regions
concerned make concerted efforts to surmount the difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Presents New Development Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres
Pastrana said Tuesday that his new development plan will help
restore peace in this country troubled by years of guerrilla
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his new development bill to the National Planning
Council, the president said that "development is the strongest
weapon to find peace."
</P>
<P>
The bill will be submitted to the Congress for approval in
February next year.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said the bill aimed to revitalize the economy which he
described as "in its death throes."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the high unemployment rate on the lack of "rigor and
discipline" in the current economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana deplored the years wasted on warring against armed
guerrilla groups, saying that his new plan would help the poorest
people escape from the effects of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that there will be no children suffering from
malnutrition or not attending school." he said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana also noted that the agriculture sector should be
rescued from the effects of war.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of the keynote speech delivered by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the 6th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders
Informal Meeting which opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
Malaysia, Fellow Colleagues:
</P>
<P>
It is a real pleasure for me to meet you again, my colleagues,
in this beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur. I wish to thank our host
the Malaysian Government for its thoughtful arrangement. I would
also like to take this opportunity to warmly welcome our three
colleagues from Russia, Peru and Vietnam, who have joined us at
the meeting for the first time.
</P>
<P>
At the Vancouver meeting last year, the financial crisis in
some Asian countries aroused wide concerns among APEC members.
Now a year has passed but its ramification is still spreading out,
not only bringing serious economic difficulties to some countries
and regions in Asia, but also affecting the world economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
This crisis has occurred against the international background
of accelerated economic globalization, and it has given the world
people important revelations.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization has become a trend as a result of the
economic, scientific and technological development in the
present-day world. It has brought to countries in the world not
only development opportunities, but also serious challenges and
risks. It has also presented to countries, developing ones in
particular, a new subject to tackle, that is how to ensure the
economic security of a country.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization requires active
participation by all countries in international economic
cooperation. However, countries should expand their opening-up
program in the light of their national conditions and in a
step-by-step manner while paying attention to increasing their
capabilities of preventing and withstanding risks.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization has made the economies of
countries more and more inter-dependent and interactive. Once a
financial crisis breaks out in certain countries or regions, not
only developing countries will suffer immensely from it, but
developed ones will also find it hard to stay out of it. A
globalized economy calls for global cooperation. All members of
the international community should work together to maintain a
steady development of the world economy in a spirit of sharing
responsibilities and risks.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization is emerging and developing
in a context where there is no fundamental change in the
inequitable and irrational old international economic order, which
will inevitably widen the gap between the poor and the rich
countries. The ultimate solution to this problem is to work for
the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international
economic order in the interest of the common development of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the international community has a common concern
about how to curb the ramification of the financial crisis at an
early date and prevent a worldwide economic recession. In order
to promote steady development of the international financial
sector and the establishment of a new international financial
order, I would like to put forward three proposals:
</P>
<P>
I. To strengthen international cooperation, prevent the spread
of the crisis and create a favorable external environment for the
economic recovery and growth of the crisis-stricken countries and
regions. The developed countries should adopt a responsible
attitude to stimulate economic growth, boost domestic demand and
expand import by means of fiscal and monetary policies, and
refrain from resorting to trade protectionism. At the same time,
they should increase financial assistance to the crisis-stricken
countries and make proper arrangements to reduce their debt
burdens in an effort to help them stablize the finances and
recover the economy. In this way, they will not only help these
countries tide over the difficulties, but also serve their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
II. To restructure and improve the international financial
system and ensure a safe and orderly operation of the
international financial market. Those big powers with influence
in international finances are duty-bound to take effective
measures to improve the supervision and regulation of the flow of
the international financial capital, contain over-speculation of
the international hot money, and enhance the capability for the
forecast and prevention of financial risks and for their relief.
It is essential to deliberate the establishment of a new
international financial order which conforms to the interests of
all sides, through dialogue and consultation between developed and
developing countries in compliance with the principle of equality
and mutual benefit and on the basis of extensive participation by
the international community. I agree that the APEC Finance
Ministers' Meeting should study the questions related to the
restructuring of the international financial system and put
forward relevant proposals. More

<HEADLINE> Italy Transfers Convicted Ex-Nazi Officer to Military Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Nazi Schutzschtaffel (SS)
officer Erich Priebke was transferred to a military prison near
Rome on Tuesday, one day after Italy's Supreme Court upheld his
life sentence, judicial officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old convict was taken to the Forte Boccea military
prison in an ambulance escorted by two police cars.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Rome court confirmed life sentences against
Priebke and another former Nazi SS officer, Karl Hass, 86, for
their involvement in a World War II massacre in Italy in which 335
civilians, including 75 Jews, were killed near Rome in March, 1944.
</P>
<P>
Priebke has been under house arrest in Rome since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Doctors who examined him ruled that his health would not
prevent him from being jailed at the Forte Boccea prison.
</P>
<P>
Hass, meanwhile, will serve his sentence in a Castel Gandolfo
clinic near Rome, after a military doctor ruled that he could not
be jailed for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, extradited from Argentina in 1995, was first convicted
on July 31, 1996, for his "participation in repeated murders,
aggravated by cruelty and premeditation."
</P>
<P>
But the court granted him "attenuated circumstances", which led
to his immediate release. In October 1996, an appeals court
rejected the first ruling and said he was to be re-tried.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Hawaii Supreme
Court on Tuesday reversed a 22-billion-U.S.-dollar judgment
against former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, for allegedly stealing crates of gold bullion from a
treasure hunter.
</P>
<P>
The high court said the evidence was too speculative to support
the late Roger Roxas' claim that he discovered boxes containing 22
billion dollars worth of gold bullion while treasure hunting north
of Manila in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Roxas had claimed that Ferdinand Marcos learned of his
discovery, ordered troops to confiscate whatever gold he had, and
then had the rest removed from the tunnels. The booty included a
diamond-stuffed gold Buddhist statuette.
</P>
<P>
The treasure is believed to have been looted and buried by
Japanese troops during their occupation of the Philippines in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Hawaii court also ordered another hearing to determine the
value of the Buddhist statuette. That and the gold bars were
originally valued at about 1.4 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Largest Insurer Covers Risk of Job Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- As a measure to help people
counter the effect of the economic crisis, American International
Assurance Co. (AIA), Thailand's largest insurer, has launched a
new product for the jobless, an AIA executive said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the product, called Unemployment Benefit Plan (UBP),
provides additional welfare benefits for retrenched employees.
</P>
<P>
The new product, launched early this month, provides a
protection coverage on life, accident, disability and health
insurance, as well as hospital care.
</P>
<P>
The economic meltdown has caused the collapse of many
companies. And though laid-off employees received compensation
from their companies, they might face financial difficulties if
accidents or illness occur.
</P>
<P>
AIA offers the UBP to companies that have more than 20
employees. Companies and employees can share premium payment and
can pay premium under a one- or two-year contract. Premiums range
from 1,000 to 2,000 baht (27.8-55.6 U.S. dollars) per person per
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company offers "fax claims services" which
allows claims for medical fees to be approved within 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
AIA will also pay the full amount of the medical fees to the
hospital in accordance with the protection coverage provided to
the insured.

NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- LG Electronics India, a
subsidiary of South Korea's giant LG Electronics, plans to make a
big expansion in its investment in India, The Business Standard
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company has decided to increase its color television
manufacturing capacity from 400,000 sets a year to 800,000, the
washing machine manufacturing capacity from 200,000 to 800,000 and
air-conditioner manufacturing capacity from 50,000 to 100,000.
</P>
<P>
LG will begin manufacturing microwave ovens in January 1999
with an initial capacity of 50,000 units per annum near New Delhi,
capital of India. The company is also gearing up to establish its
own manufacturing facility for refrigerators after the year 2000,
when the capacity expansions in color televisions, washing
machines and air-conditioners complete.
</P>
<P>
The capacity expansion and installation of fresh capacity will
involve total investments of 300 million U.S. dollars by the
company by 2005, making it the largest investor in India in the
area of consumer electronics and white goods, the paper quoted the
company's Vice President (Marketing) Rajeev Karwal as saying.

<HEADLINE> 52 AIDS Cases Detected in Sri Lanka This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua)-- Fifty-two persons have been
tested positive of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
in Sri Lanka during the past 10 months this year, health sources
disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine of them are Sri Lankans while the other three are
foreigners. Of the 49 Sri Lankans, 23 are males while 26 are
females.
</P>
<P>
The recorded infected cases are only from government hospitals.
Hence there is a possibility of the actual number of cases being
much higher, the sources said, adding that there were 256 reported
positive cases from 1986 up to the end of November 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities consider the detection of the 52 cases
during the 10 months of this year as rather serious. They said
this means an average of one positive case recorded per week.
</P>
<P>
Up to October 31 this year, as many as 67 deaths of AIDS had
been reported. It is estimated that there will be about 30,000
positive cases of AIDS in Sri Lanka by the turn of the century.

<TEXT>
<P>
Catherine, winner of three golds at last year's 19th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games here, injured her thigh during a regular
practice in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Swimming Federation's technical director Lukman
Niode expressed his regret on Tuesday over Catherine's injury.
</P>
<P>
"Catherine has been showing progress during her overseas stint
but her injury will seriously affect her preparations for the
quadrennial event," Lukman said.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old swimmer, who has been training in Australia
since the SEA Games, had been expected to win a medal either in t
he 100 or 200 meters butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said Indonesia would put all its hopes on Rita, who is
now training in the United States, in the 100 and 200 meters
breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
Rita is expected to take on tough challenges from Chinese,
Japanese and South Korean swimmers. Lukman said that

<HEADLINE> China Announces Move to Set Up APEC Science Cooperation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua)-- Chinese government has set
aside 10 million U.S. dollars to establish the China APEC Science
and Technology Industry Cooperation Fund to finance cooperation
between China and other APEC members in the field of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
at the sixth APEC Leaders Informal Meeting held at the Cyberview
Lodge, which is about 45 kilometers south of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be co-provided by China's Ministry of Science and
Technology (MST), the Ministry of Finance and the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Sun Mengxin, an official from the MST, told Xinhua that the
fund will help implement the APEC Agenda for Science and
Technology Industry Cooperation in the 21st Century, which was
proposed by Jiang at the fifth APEC Leaders Informal Meeting in
Vancouver in 1997 and adopted at the current meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that the Chinese government has all along been
promoting the cooperation on science and technology industry among
APEC members, and the establishment of the fund is simply another
example of China's sincerity for the issue.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that other member economies could proceed
from their own national realities and make due contributions to
push forward this great cause.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Association to Ask IBF's Mercy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a hearing with Sigit on Monday, the IBF has suspended
the 22-year-old shuttler from competition for one year for using
an anabolic steroid. Sigit will serve the suspension until
November 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Sigit was also fined 2,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IBF announced that Sigit's urine samples, selected in a
random doping test during the Singapore Open in August, were
positive for nandrolone, the drug banned by the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI deputy chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah Tuesday said
they would ask the IBF to halve the term of punishment.
</P>
<P>
"Sigit deserves a milder penalty because of his great
contribution to the IBF in expanding the sport's market. The IBF
has gained profits from Sigit's performance so far," Agus said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Indonesia would be prepared to pay a higher
penalty to have the duration of Sigit's suspension reduced.
</P>
<P>
A PBSI contingent of doctor Michael Triangto, athlete
development chairman Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar and Indonesia's
representative to the IBF Justian Suhandinata accompanied Sigit
during the hearing which held in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Agus said he had instructed the group to warn the IBF that
Indonesia would quit the world badminton organization if Sigit
received a two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
Despite the punishment, Agus said hope remained that Sigit
would qualify for the Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is who will partner him when he returns to
competition next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sigit won the Singapore Open with Candra Wijaya. In Sigit's
absence, Candra often teams with Tony Gunawan and the pair will
also play in the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Agus said Sigit would remain in the national training program
even though he could not participate in competition.
</P>
<P>
The dope case is the second to mar Indonesia's illustrious
badminton record since women's singles players Minarti Timur was
banned in 1991 for use of a stimulant. Like Sigit, Minarti
claimed she took the drug unintentionally.

<HEADLINE> Unidentified Aircraft Hovers Over Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified aircraft has
been seen hovering over northern Sri Lanka during the past four
days, according to reports reaching here from the north Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed at different times since last Saturday by
naval patrols in northern Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was spotted again Tuesday by an Israeli-built
Drova fast attack craft of the Sri Lankan Navy, which had fired at
it without success, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The first unidentified aircraft was seen on September 26 by the
navy. Then again since last Saturday, the aircraft has been seen
regularly by naval patrols.
</P>
<P>
The army and the air force have not yet reported the sighting
of any such aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports quoted military sources as saying they are
vigilant over the reports as there is a strong possibility of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam coming into possession of
aircraft for use in their anti-government war, which is now in its
15th year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Developed Nations to Adopt Responsible Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, in a keynote speech at the sixth Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Informal Meeting in Kuala Lumpur
Tuesday, urged developed countries to adopt a responsible attitude
in dealing with the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Calling for strengthened international cooperation in the face
of the crisis, Jiang said members of the international community
should work together to maintain a steady development of the world
economy in a spirit of sharing responsibilities and risks.
</P>
<P>
In this process, he said, developed countries should try to
stimulate their economic growth, boost domestic demand and expand
import by formulating appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
They should refrain from resorting to trade protectionism, the
Chinese president noted.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jiang said, developed countries should
increase financial assistance to the crisis-stricken countries and
make proper arrangements to reduce their debt burdens in a bid to
help them stablize their financial situation and revitalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
by so doing, the Chinese president said, developed countries
will not only help the affected countries and regions tide over
their difficulties, but also serve their own interests.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, Jiang said, has occurred against the international
background of accelerated economic globalization, a trend which
has enhanced the inter-dependence and interaction of the economies
of different countries.
</P>
<P>
In this context, once a financial crisis breaks out in certain
countries or regions, not only will developing countries suffer
immensely from it, developed countries will also find it hard to
stay out of it.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese leader said, the international community
should work together to curb the spread of the crisis and jointly
create a favorable external environment for the recovery and
growth of the crisis-stricken economies.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Announce Probe Results Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie will announce soon the result of the probe into last
week's bloody incident which left 15 dead, The Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung as
saying Habibie would receive all inputs from the public especially
the National Commission for Human Rights to enable him to take a
"just and transparent decision."
</P>
<P>
The president has promised quick action against those
responsible for last week's clashes and rioting in the capital.
</P>
<P>
At least 125 buildings and 70 vehicles were damaged during mass
looting and burning in the city last Saturday following bloody
clashes between demonstrating students and security officers.
</P>
<P>
"We promise a fair, transparent and thorough investigation
based on the law, and we also promise to take firm action against
those who have violated the law, including the security forces,"
Habibie said in an address broadcast nationally by radio and
television networks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habibie earlier accused certain unnamed groups of trying to
topple the legitimate government by mobilizing mass mobs to force
their will upon the nation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 10 politicians have been questioned by
police and banned from leaving the country over alleged coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The 10 were among the signatories to a declaration signed on
November 12 demanding the resignation of Habibie, the disbanding
of the parliament and canceling of the recently convened People's
Consultative Assembly special session.
</P>
<P>
They included opposition National Front Chairman Kemal Idris,
Lieut. Gen. (retired) Ali Sadikin, Chairman of the Association of
University of Indonesia Alumni Hariyadi Dharmawan, founding
president Soekarno's daughter Sukmawati Sukarnoputri and Chairman
of the Indonesia United Democracy Party Sri Bintang Pamungkas.
</P>
<P>
"From the investigation and interrogation, (we found) there
have been violations of the law covering conspiracy, acts of
treason, and an attempt to topple a legitimate government," The
Indonesian Observer Wednesday quoted police spokesman Brig. Gen.
Togar Sianipar as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the use of the word "coup" itself is still debatable
with legal experts expressing agreement and disagreement on the
charge, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> WEU Calls for Closer Cooperation With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU)
should strengthen cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) for a joint European security and defense
policy, according to a declaration by a WEU meeting here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the Rome Declaration approved by the two-day meeting, the
WEU ministerial council called for closer cooperation between the
WEU and NATO so that European countries could use NATO's military
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The European defense policy should be "separable, but not
separate from" NATO, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, whose country is
serving the rotating presidency of the 10-member WEU, said that
limiting the WEU's role to "military police" operations would be
"unjustified," and the WEU is not a second NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said the WEU could eventually take up a major role in peace
missions providing it can show an ability for rapid reaction.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Declaration was intended to define problems rather
than offer solutions, so that the debate can continue and deepen
before NATO's summit in Washington next spring, Dini noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. does not take an "unfavorable"
attitude towards greater European commitment to defense matters.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at the meeting that the WEU should be turned into
a European Union agency, which could form the nucleus of a defense
force and act independently by using NATO's military facilities to
solve European crises in which the United States cannot or does
not want to be involved.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, defense ministers of the WEU members also held
a meeting in Rome. Both Dini and Italian Defense Minister Carlo
Scognamiglio cited the WEU's role in Kosovo and Albania as
"exemplary" and providing new mechanisms for solving crises.
</P>
<P>
However, Scognamiglio said that European armed forces still
remained below European expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The European armed forces are 60 percent of the U.S.'s, but
they do not provide Europeans with 60 percent as much security,"
said Scognamiglio. But he continued to remain "optimistic" about
Europe's future security measures.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Restructuring of Financial System Against Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Wednesday called for efforts to restructure and improve the
international financial system to prevent speculative attacks and
the occurrence of financial crises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sixth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Leaders Informal Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Jiang especially called
on big powers with influence in international finance to take
effective measures in this respect.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a safe and orderly operation of the international
financial market, Jiang believed big powers with influence in
international finance are duty-bound to take effective measures to
improve the supervision and regulation of the flow of
international financial capital, contain the over-speculation of
international hot money, and enhance the capability for the
forecast and prevention of financial risks and for their relief,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is essential to deliberate the establishment of a
new international financial order which conforms to the interests
of all sides, through dialogue and consultation between developed
and developing countries in compliance with the principle of
equality and mutual benefit and on the basis of extensive
participation by the international community.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting should study
the questions related to the restructuring of the international
financial system and put forward relevant proposals.
</P>
<P>
The trend of economic globalization is emerging and developing
in a context where there is no fundamental change in the
inequitable and irrational old international economic order, which
will inevitably widen the gap between the poor and the rich
countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate solution to this problem is to work for the
establishment of a fair and reasonable new international economic
order in the interest of the common development of all countries,
he said.

<HEADLINE> China May Postpone Fuel Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to postpone
the introduction of the controversial fuel tax that it has planned
to levy from the beginning of next year, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government decided in June to replace various fees
for the use of roads and automobiles with fuel and consumption
taxes, and submitted the proposal to the legislature for approval.
</P>
<P>
The proposal met spirited debates at the country's legislature
-- the National People's Congress (NPC) -- when its Standing
Committee discussed amendments to the road law which concern the
fuel tax later last month. The NPC Standing Committee failed to
vote on the amendments on that occasion.
</P>
<P>
As the NPC Standing Committee is to meet again to discuss the
issue in mid December, sources said there will not be enough time
for imposing the fuel tax by January 1, 1999 as scheduled, even
when the proposal is approved.
</P>
<P>
Relevant authorities are undertaking further assessment of the
impact of the new tax, and it may take three to six months before
the tax is imposed, they said.
</P>
<P>
Before the fuel tax is introduced, they said, the government is
expected to adopt administrative measures to stop unwarranted
fees levied on automobile and road usage that have run rampant in
various localities.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics of the State Development Planning
Commission, authorities at various levels collect more than 100
billion yuan in fees on the use of roads and automobiles each
year. The total amount of various fees levied by governments at
all levels stands at 400 billion yuan a year, about half of the
nation's fiscal revenue.
</P>
<P>
The excessive fees have eroded tax sources, weakened the
central government's ability for macroeconomic control, and caused
corruption, officials said.
</P>
<P>
William Powers, vice-president of Research of Ford Motor
Company, said it is necessary for China to introduce fuel tax. He
said that many countries in the world have adopted such taxes.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiaochun, an official of the First Automobile Works of
China, said that replacing unwarranted fees with taxes is a good
measure to regulate government activities and to develop a sound
market order. The move will be of profound significance for the
long-term interests of automobile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
A car buyer in Beijing said that though fuel tax will increase
fuel price, it will be cheaper than various fees put
together. With the fuel tax to replace fees, it will be as
convenient to buy a car as to buy a TV set.
</P>
<P>
However, economist Li Yining said that fuel tax will increase
the burdens of farmers who consume big amount of fuel for farming
machines. He pointed out that the countries that have adopted the
fuel tax are all faced with such dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Ruan Chongwu, former governor of Hainan province that leads
other provinces in imposing local fuel tax, said that as fuel tax
revenues will all go to the central government, local governments,
individuals and foreign investors who have put their money in road
construction will find it difficult to recover their investment.

NEW DELHI, November 18 (Xinhua) -- India conducted a major
tri-service military exercise on its western coast on Tuesday, The
Statesman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give the exact location where the exercise
was held. India's two major news agencies, the Press Trust of
India and the United News of India, did not give any hint about
the military exercise Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was the biggest one in the decade to demonstrate
the country's military might and fierce striking power, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The mock amphibious assault, a maritime warfare of launching an
attack from sea toward a hostile shore, was the focus of the
operation. Taking part in the exercise were 10,000 personnel, 28
ships, including the aircraft carrier Viraat, two submarines and
amphibious ships, 31 fighter aircraft and helicopters and five
T-72 tanks.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, the fighter planes carried out aerial
bombing, making way for troops, vessels and tanks from and around
the aircraft carrier, stationed miles off the coast, to reach the
beach.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries, including the United States, and
Pakistan had expressed great concern about the military exercise
before it was held.

<P>
YANGON, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has won high
appreciation from countries in East Asia and the Pacific region
for its efforts in environmental sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The official The New Light of Myanmar newspaper Wednesday said
the country won the appreciation for having built nearly 1 million
fly-proof latrines during its environmental sanitation week in
May.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of East Asia and the Pacific
Region on Children's Development Targets in 2000 held in Bangkok
last weekend, participating countries and the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) called on developing nations to emulate Myanmar's
exemplary achievement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was represented by 23 nations including Myanmar and
attended by 12 ministers and five deputy ministers. Minister of
Health Major-General Ket Sein headed the Myanmar delegation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, in cooperation with the UNICEF, launched the first
national environmental sanitation week as a mass movement in May
to push the country's sanitation work ahead and achieve the
national goal of total sanitation coverage by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sanitation work has been promoted in Myanmar for more than two
decades and success has been attained to a certain extent and
endeavors are being doubled to realize the goal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, maternal and child health care, nutrition and AIDS
prevention and education are also being carried out in the country
with the assistance of the UNICEF.

CHANGSHA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- A railway container platform
wagon developed by Chinese engineers achieved a maximum speed of

<P>
This contrasts sharply with China's ordinary railway container
platform wagons which have a speed of 80 to 90 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Because of speed limitations, China has to cut down about four
pairs of cargo trains to make way for one additional pair of

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Energy Demand May Rise Slightly Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's energy demand is
expected to begin to grow again next year, albeit marginally, on
the anticipation of a slight economic recovery, Piyasvati
Amranand, secretary-general of the National Energy Policy Office
said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Wednesday quoted Piyasvati as saying Tuesday
that it is "possible" consumption of petroleum products and
electricity in 1999 would increase by 1-2 percent over this year
on the back of a projected economic growth of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
That would be a reversal from this year's projected likely
decline in petroleum demand of 10 percent and 2-3 percent in power
consumption.
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a strong consensus that Thailand's financial
turmoil would bottom out in the next few months with the economy
turning around next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis which began in July last year changed the
country's energy scene with consumption forcing a contraction for
the first time in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Figures just released by the Petroleum Authority of Thailand
showed that the country's total petroleum demand excluding
consumption by petrochemical companies slipped 8 percent in the
first nine months of 1998 to an average of 870,950 barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
According to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand,
the peak power demand in the first half of this year occurred in
April with a record of 14,179.9 mw, compared to 14,506.3 mw
registered in May 1997, a 2.25-percent drop.

<HEADLINE> Chile Reports Drops in Exports of Forest Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile's exports of forest
products in the first nine months of this year dropped to 1.2
billion U.S. dollars, down by 11.4 percent from the same period
last year, the national forest corporation said Tuesay..
</P>
<P>
The corporation attributed the drop to falls in Asian imports,
especially that of Japan and South Korea, and to lower prices of
cellulose, Chile's main forest export product, due to excessive
supplies.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, cellulose exports slightly exceeded
500 million dollars, 40.6 percent of total forest exports. Sawed
wood exports, the second biggest item, reached 136.2 million
dollars, or 22 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Chile sells lots of its forest products to the United States,
which purchased 272.9 million dollars worth of the products, or 22
percent of the total output.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the second largest market for Chilean forest products,
with imports worth 191.8 million dollars, 15.5 percent of the
total, followed by Belgium with 89.5 million dollars and China
with 80.4 million dollars.

COLOMBO, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Following the dissolution of
Sri Lanka's North Western Provincial Council last week, the
Elections Commissioner (EC) has called for the nomination of
candidates from December 1 to 8 this year for new polls, EC
sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Election Law, the date of polls will be a
date not earlier than five weeks and not more than eight weeks
from the issue of any such notices.
</P>
<P>
The North Western Provincial Council comprises the two
districts of Kurunegala and Puttalam. Political parties and
independent candidates will be seeking election to 35 seats in
Kurunegala district and 15 seats in Puttalam district, according
to the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said it is unlikely that the elections
will be duly held as those to other provincial councils which had
been scheduled for earlier this year were postponed by the

<HEADLINE> D'Alema says Italy Won't Extradite Kurdish Leader to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema said Tuesday Italy won't extradite Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey where he is wanted for treason.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has accused Ocalan of leading the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers' Party in terrorist activities for a Kurdish homeland in
southeastern Turkey, where over 31,000 people have died in the
14-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested by police on international warrants on his
arrival at Rome's international airport from a Moscow flight. He
has requested political asylum and is now reportedly detained in a
hospital in Palestrina, a town outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before parliament on Tuesday, the Italian prime
minister urged the Turkish government to find a peaceful political
solution to the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
"If an extradition request arrives from Turkey, the response
will be negative because the death penalty exists in Turkey,"
D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
Under Italian law, extradition is forbidden if the requesting
country has the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
"This is the great European tradition and therefore, whatever
we decide (on the Ocalan case) should not be interpreted as a
hostile act against Turkey, but as an act of respect for our own
laws, our history and our values," said D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, more than 2,000 Kurds marched in Rome to show
support for Ocalan. The march followed a three-day sit-in by
thousands of Kurds from across Europe in front of the Celio
Military Hospital where Ocalan was initially detained.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime on Rise in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Violent crimes in Phnom
Penh, capital of Cambodia, in the first 10 months of this year,
already exceeded those in the whole year of 1997, according to
municipal figures.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October, 297 people died as victims of
crime, compared with 284 in 1997, the Cambodia Daily quoted
municipal statistics released recently as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the rise in crime, the municipality said in a
statement, is that "the use of illegal weapons has increased,
creating insecurity and public disorder."
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed that 115 of the deaths this year involved
unregistered weapons. Illegal weapons also played a role in 130
injuries.
</P>
<P>
The city could have an estimated 150,000 illegal and
unregistered weapons, or about one for every seven people, the
report said. The figure only includes weapons that people have
reported to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have launched a crackdown on unregistered
weapons in the city as part of an anti-crime initiative ordered by
Chea Sophara, first deputy governor, last month. At the end of the
three- month campaign, Phnom Penh residents will be asked to
surrender all unregistered weapons.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has collected 185 weapons from people in a
buy-back program that is expected to end in January. Chea Sophara
admitted that some of the crimes are linked with low-paid
municipal police and soldiers with weapons.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Draws Private, Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Overseas and private investors
have replaced the government to become the main source of
investment for the Chinese textile industry, a senior industrial
official said today.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, private and overseas investors injected 18.3 billion
yuan into the industry, accounting for two-thirds of the total,
said Yang Jichao, director of the Planning and Development
Department of the State Administration of Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997, some 35,600
overseas-funded businesses had been approved in the industry, with
a contractual capital of 33.3 billion U.S. dollars, playing a
major role in the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some 70 textile enterprises in the country
have gone public, raising about 20 billion yuan from the issuance
of shares.
</P>
<P>
The change in investment sources has boosted the industry's
shift from the decades-old planned system to a more
market-oriented one, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to pull the sector out of the difficult situation,
China has since the beginning of this year launched a massive
campaign to upgrade its textile industry, aiming at abandoning 10
million outdated spindles and reducing the number of staff by 1.2
million in three years.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal, the country will further reform its
investment system in the industry and encourage overseas and
private business people to make more investment, Yang said.

WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the
U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) boarded
planes to get above the clouds over Japan to study the meteor
storm, the Associated Press reported from Okinawa of Japan on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two NASA research planes carrying imaging equipment, infrared
sensors and spectrometers took off from a U.S. Air Force base on
the island of Okinawa, and circled around the East China Sea to
analyze visible light.
</P>
<P>
The equipment may provide scientists with data to determine the
cosmic debris' molecular composition, and may even find traces of
any organic material it carries.
</P>
<P>
NASA said that this is a rare chance to study the composition
of comets and meteoroids, and perhaps learn something about the
origin of life.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists suggest that the elements necessary for life
may have been brought to the Earth by comets or meteorites.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Announce Probe Results Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie will announce soon the result of the probe into last
week's bloody incident which left 15 dead, The Jakarta Post
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Minister/State Secretary Akbar Tandjung as
saying Habibie would receive all inputs from the public especially
the National Commission for Human Rights to enable him to take a
"just and transparent decision."
</P>
<P>
The president has promised quick action against those
responsible for last week's clashes and rioting in the capital.
</P>
<P>
At least 125 buildings and 70 vehicles were damaged during mass
looting and burning in the city last Saturday following bloody
clashes between demonstrating students and security officers.
</P>
<P>
"We promise a fair, transparent and thorough investigation
based on the law, and we also promise to take firm action against
those who have violated the law, including the security forces,"
Habibie said in an address broadcast nationally by radio and
television networks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habibie earlier accused certain unnamed groups of trying to
topple the legitimate government by mobilizing mass mobs to force
their will upon the nation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 10 politicians have been questioned by
police and banned from leaving the country over alleged coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The 10 were among the signatories to a declaration signed on
November 12 demanding the resignation of Habibie, the disbanding
of the parliament and canceling of the recently convened People's
Consultative Assembly special session.
</P>
<P>
They included opposition National Front Chairman Kemal Idris,
Lieut. Gen. (retired) Ali Sadikin, Chairman of the Association of
University of Indonesia Alumni Hariyadi Dharmawan, founding
president Soekarno's daughter Sukmawati Sukarnoputri and Chairman
of the Indonesia United Democracy Party Sri Bintang Pamungkas.
</P>
<P>
"From the investigation and interrogation, (we found) there
have been violations of the law covering conspiracy, acts of
treason, and an attempt to topple a legitimate government," The
Indonesian Observer Wednesday quoted police spokesman Brig. Gen.
Togar Sianipar as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the use of the word "coup" itself is still debatable
with legal experts expressing agreement and disagreement on the
charge, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Congress Promises to Approve Tight Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Congress has
guaranteed that it will approve a 1999 austerity budget with few
or no amendments, a visiting senior U.S. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Undersecretary for economic affairs
Stuart Eizenstat said he received guarantees that most of the
austerity plan would be approved before the end of this year, or
in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget plans to scrap the Brazilian government's deficit,
which reached 7.02 percent of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) in June this year, and to convert it into a surplus.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced last Friday a
41-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package for Brazil over the next
three years. In exchange, they expect an austerity policy that
will achieve a budget surplus of 2.6 percent of the GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among the 41 billion dollars, five billion dollars will be
provided by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has pledged that its budget surplus will reach 2.8
percent of the GDP in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Brazil could meet the IMF and U.S. demands if the austerity
policy ensures a steady positive growth, gaining investors'
confidence with a strong policy performance.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent declines, short-term real (Brazil's currency)
interest rates are running above 30 percent, a high level
incompatible with fiscal stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here warned that if market confidence is not restored
soon, the economy could be crippled by the high interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Considers Russia Strategic Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam always considers the
Russian Federation a strategic partner in its socioeconomic
development, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remarks during a bilateral meeting with his
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, Tuesday evening in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia, where they were attending a leaders' meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Khai pledged that "Vietnam will do its utmost to pay part of
its debts to Russia."
</P>
<P>
According to VNA, Primakov spoke highly of "the traditional
relations" between Russia and Vietnam and expressed his belief
that those ties will be strengthened in the future as both
countries are now members of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Together with Peru, Vietnam and Russia became full members of
APEC last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties, Russia agreed to reschedule payment of
the debts Vietnam owes to Russia, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He described Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong's recent visit
to Russia as "an event of great significance in the development of
bilateral ties."
</P>
<P>
VNA said the two prime ministers exchanged views on
opportunities for cooperation between businesses of Vietnam and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction over the on-going effective
cooperation in many fields, especially in the energy and oil and
gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Khai attended an informal meeting of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) leaders on issues to be
discussed at an APEC summit scheduled to be held in Vietnam later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam on Tuesday met with U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky who is also in Malaysia for the
APEC summit.
</P>
<P>
VNA said they discussed issues concerning speeding up
negotiations for a Vietnam-U.S. trade agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Finds More Evidence of Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian National Land
Agency's Jambi office has uncovered evidence of former President
Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth in Central Sumatra Province
alone, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's fortune, part of which has been sold to his crony
and noted businessman Prayogo Pangestu, reportedly comprised
stocks, land, a plywood factory, a bank, a pineapple cannery and a
TV relay station, worth 122.4 billion rupiah (15.3 million U.S.
dollars) in all.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Minister for Land Affairs Hasan Basru
Durin as saying ownership of the property would be canceled and
sanctions applied if charges were proven.
</P>
<P>
The government prosecutor's office would continue a thorough
investigation into the wealth while the land would be seized for
the state or returned to its original owners, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Prosecutor's Office in Irian Jaya Province T.H.
Sidabutar said they were also investigating thousands of hectares
of land allegedly belonging to Soeharto, his children and cronies.
</P>
<P>
At least five factories were built there, he said, adding that
so far the probe has been focused on Soeharto and his family and
has yet to be directed at cronies.
</P>
<P>
A prominent crony, Bob Hasan, for instance, apparently held a
virtual monopoly on the supply of vegetables, meat, eggs, fruits
and various other necessities for employees of PT Freeport
Indonesia mining firm in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais
urged the government to put Soeharto under city arrest and to
confiscate his wealth and that of his family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
"The law should be upheld if we want reform to go on. The time
has come to bring economic and political criminals to court," he
said after installing the executive board of the party's chapter
in Lampung Province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He cited the new decree of the special session of the People's
Consultative Assembly from November 10 through November 13. The
decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the
government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible for the government to consider forgiving
Soeharto because of his age but his children and cronies should be
tried and punished if they are proven guilty," Rais added.

<HEADLINE> ATP Tour World Doubles Championships to Start Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dutch pairs have teamed up to win 38 doubles titles,
including five Grand Slam titles, since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Eltingh announced he would retire at the end
of the year, and he and Haarhuis would like nothing better than
to finish the year No. 1 for the second time and wrap up their
second World Championship. They finished No. 1 in 1994 and won
the season-ending event in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Eltingh and Haarhuis currently are the top-ranked doubles
tandem in the world, and with good reason. They have won eight
titles together in nine finals appearances this year, including
the French Open and Wimbledon doubles crowns. Their victory in
England made them the first team in the Open Era to win each of
the four Grand Slam doubles titles.
</P>
<P>
Eltingh and Haarhuis both became parents for the first time
this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Dutch pair, Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes of
India are also the men to beat at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bhupathi and Paes advanced to the final in their
World Championship debut and with a strong showing this time,
they could become the first Indian team to finish the year No.
1.Entering this week, they trail the Dutchmen by only 183 points
in the ATP doubles rankings.
</P>
<P>
While Australians Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge did not
win a Grand Slam title for the first time since 1991, the
top-ranked team over the last three years must be considered a
strong favorite at this event. They won World Championships in
1992 and 1996 and were finalists in 1993 and 1994.
</P>

Eight teams will compete in a round-robin format in two

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Aid for Ecuador, Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
approved a 4.7-million-U.S.-dollar aid package for victims of
floods and droughts caused by El Nino in Ecuador and Peru, the
Ecuadoran Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be shared equally between the two countries, where
thousands of people have suffered from heavy rains and serious
droughts caused by the warming of equatorial Pacific waters in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations will use the fund to launch
health care, potable water and agricultural programs in the next
six months, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Campbell to Captain England Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the absence of Shearer and former captains Tony Adams and
Paul Ince, Hoddle turned to Campbell to lead the side against the
Czech Republic on Wednesday as England return to Wembley just
over a month after being booed off the pitch following the
goalless draw against Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old center-back, who has been capped 23 times,
already has the experience of one match as captain in the
pre-World Cup friendly against Belgium in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
While the Tottenham skipper is certainly not the loudest
player on the pitch, he has been backed by club boss George
Graham to become a full-time England captain more in the mold of
Bobby Moore.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle seems to agree as he said: "Sol leads by example and
the players respond to him. He did a good job when he led the
team in Morocco but Wembley will be different.
</P>
<P>
"It is another part of his international experience. I'm sure
it will be a proud occasion for him and rightly so. Some time in
the future he could be earmarked for the job full-time.
</P>
<P>
"The crowd respond to Sol too. I'm sure they will get behind
him and the team, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said: "It's a great honor and a wonderful feeling.
Yes there is an added feeling because the game is at Wembley. But
I must not let the occasion take over my performance. I want to
do well, we all want to do well for the supporters."

TEGUCIGALPA, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina made a surprise visit Tuesday to Honduras, the
Central American country most affected by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Robaina, whose visit had neither been scheduled by the Honduran
president's office nor by its foreign ministry, visited a market
destroyed by flooding from the Choluteca river crossing the
capital city, accompanied by his Honduran counterpart Fernando
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has sent at least three aid packages to Honduras,
including medicine and a team of doctors, after Mitch hit the
country in the last week of October.

<HEADLINE> FA to Probe Palace Transfer Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palace chairman Mark Goldberg claimed that the club agreed to
pay 1.35 million pounds (about 2.25 million U.S. dollars) to buy
Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai in August, but that the Chinese Football
Association are only anticipating receiving a fee of 950,000
pounds (about 1.58 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Palace chief is keen to establish where the allegedly
missing 400,000 pounds has gone and has called in the FA to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
The club said in a statement: "At Tuesday's board meeting, it
was confirmed that the board had requested an FA-assisted inquiry
into the destination of money paid by the club to a Chinese FA
bank account in London, authorized by its London representative
Liu Shijun, for its two Chinese players."
</P>
<P>
Liu Shijun, manager of Greatgate Overseas Development Co., had
no comment on the statement. He only said both sides signed a
confidentiality clause and the fee is a secret.
</P>
<P>
However, he disclosed that according to the contract, the
transfer fee would be paid in four installments.
</P>
<P>
"The first has been paid, but we have not received the second
installment, which, as the contract regulates, should have been
paid last month, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shijun, who arranged a tour of China and Hong Kong by the
England team during Terry Venables' tenure as national coach,
said he would take a necessary legal action against Gregory if
the second installment is not paid within this month.
</P>
<P>
Venables, who serves as Palace manager, has distanced himself
from the deal, telling The Independent's Tuesday edition: "Thank
goodness transfers have nothing to do with me any more. I am just
the coach."
</P>
<P>
Former Arsenal boss George Graham and agent Rune Hauge both
received worldwide bans after the so-called 'bungs' inquiry and
the FA are certain to take an equally hard stance if any
impropriety is proved in this case.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "When we hear from Palace, we
will certainly take a look at it. Because it involves an
international transfer, it may be something that FIFA will want
to get involved in as well."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palace also confirmed that an in-depth
investigation was taking place at the club into financial
dealings before Goldberg took charge this summer.
</P>
<P>
The statement added: "The board of Crystal Palace advised that
they are committed to high standards of corporate governance and
strong financial management procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The new board of the club following the change of ownership
in June 1998 is resolute in ensuring its affairs are conducted in
a totally professional manner."

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis-Hit Economies Slowly Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua)-- There are some signs of hopes
for recovery for crisis-hit Asian economies although the glimmers
of light are faint, U.S. economic Experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets throughout the region have rebounded,local
currencies have risen and interest rates have come down, according
to recent reports from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea and
Indonesia have all been taking measures for their economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Steven Radelet, an economist at the U.S. Harvard Institute for
Economic Development, said that there are signs that the Asian
crisis economies "have hit bottom."
</P>
<P>
"But it's going to be long haul until they turn around and
recover," Radelet said.
</P>
<P>
Not like the Mexico economy that went through a V-shaped cycle
after 1994-1995 currency crisis, the Asian economy looks more like
an "L" shape in the recovery course.
</P>
<P>
Most American economic experts say that they believe Japan is
the key to the recovery of Asian crisis economies. Japan, whose
economy accounts for about two-thirds of Asia's output, is the
major market for much of the rest of Asia's exports.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that they still saw the Japanese economy in
trouble although the country has taken a series of steps to turn
its economy around, including adopting a 500 billion U.S. dollars
plan last month to rescue its ailing banks.
</P>
<P>
The United States is worried for the slow recovery of the Asian
economy. The near depression in Asia has already slashed U.S.
exports of everything from corn to computer chips. Economic
experts expect the delay in Asia's recovery will prolong the pain
for U.S. farmers and manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Web Maestro Wins Lifetime Achievement Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 17 (Xinhua) -- PC Magazine, the largest
business magazine in the United States, announced Tuesday that its
Lifetime Achievement Award of 1998 was given to the Web maestro
Tim Berners-Lee.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Berners-Lee proposed a global hypertext project,
to be known as the World Wide Web, that would allow people to work
together by combining their knowledge in a Web of hypertext
documents. He also wrote the first Web server and the first client
browser. Through 1991 and 1993, he continued working on the design
of the Web, coordinating feedback from users across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Berners_Lee graduated from the Queen's College at Oxford
University, England, in 1976. While working in the European
Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, he wrote for his own
private use his first program for storing information, which
formed the conceptual basis for the future development of the
World Wide Web. In 1994, he accepted a position at MIT's
Laboratory for Computer Science, where he remains today as
director of the influential World Wide Web Consortium, the
organization that coordinates Web developments all around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, in response to a question whether he was
happy with what the World Wide Web has turned out so far,
Bermers-Lee approved the richness of material on the Web and the
diversity of ways in which it is being used. But he said "there
are many parts of the original dream which are not yet
implemented." For example, he said, very few people have an easy,
intuitive tool for putting their thoughts into hypertext.
</P>
<P>
PC Magazine also presented the Person of the Year Award to
Jerry Yang and David Filo, founders of Yahoo. While both studying
at Stanford as graduate students in 1994, they created the
directory company.
</P>
<P>
The magazine has also given awards to breakthrough products and
technologies since 1984, including PC hardware, software, Internet
and networking technologies.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed mixed on
Tuesday with the Dow Jones industrial average down 24.97 to
8996.28.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip barometer opened lower after two sessions of a
total of 181 point gain. After the Federal Reserve announced
short-term interests cuts this afternoon, the Dow soared for some
time, but couldn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
The Fed cut overnight federal funds rate to 4.75 percent from 5
percent and reduced the discount emergency lending rate to 4.50
percent from 4.75 percent. This is the third time the central bank
cut interest rates this year.
</P>
<P>
It cited "unusual strains" in financial markets as the reason
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had cut the interest interests on September 29
and October 15, pushing the Dow to surge on many sessions until
recently. The index is 1088 points or 13.8 % up from the beginning
of the year, but 341 points lower than the peak of 9337.97 reached
on July 17.
</P>
<P>
The market today saw gains by financial stocks and a loss by
computer maker Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
Both the technology-laced Nasdaq composite index and Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose, but other major indexes retreated.
</P>
<P>
ON the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers on a
very slim margin, with trading volume up to 699 million shares
from 610 million previously.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Paraguay Reach Intellectual Property Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday Paraguay has agreed to crack down on copyright piracy,
averting the threat of U.S. trade sanctions against the South
American nation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said Paraguay agreed under a new bilateral accord to strengthen
its intellectual property laws and enforcement along its borders.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay also promised to "take immediate action" against known
centers of piracy and counterfeiting, she added.
</P>
<P>
"This is a strong bilateral agreement that will significantly
improve intellectual property protection for copyrights, patents
and trademarks and ensure continued progress in the fight against
piracy and counterfeiting in Paraguay," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. in February accused Paraguay of failing to provide
adequate protection against copyright piracy and launched an
investigation into the charges under Section 301 of U.S. trade
laws, which could lead to sanctions. Barshefsky called off the
Section 301 investigation.
</P>
<P>
But she said, "We will closely monitor the implementation of
this agreement, especially during the special enforcement period,
and look forward to seeing significant additional progress before
the next annual Special 301 review."
</P>
<P>
U.S. industries lost an estimated 117 million U.S. dollars in
1996 due to piracy in Paraguay, according to the International
Intellectual Property Alliance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Kosovo Separatists to Stop Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
warned ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo that
their aggressive conduct was jeopardizing international support
for them.
</P>
<P>
The warning was passed by U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill, who
is mediating between the Belgrade government and the separatists,
to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), said State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"He urged, as we have from Washington, the Kosovo Liberation
Army to exercise restraint and reduce their aggressive presence on
the highways," Rubin told his daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
"If the KLA doesn't hold to the ceasefire and conducts
provocations, that will negatively affect international support
for their cause," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Hill had a two-and-a-half-hour meeting with the KLA and a
spokesman for the guerrillas later said talks would continue.
</P>
<P>
"We have our remarks and general comments about the draft
document," added Jakup Krasniqi, the spokesman for KLA general
headquarters, referring to a peace plan drafted by international
mediators.
</P>
<P>
The KLA has moved into many of the areas evacuated by Serbian
forces under an agreement mediated by U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke last month. In some cases, they have clashed with the
remaining Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
Rubin listed several recent incidents that were investigated by
international observers. On Monday, one team of observers helped
Serbian police escape from a KLA ambush near the town of Malisevo
while another team elsewhere persuaded Serbian police not to
retaliate after they took fire.
</P>
<P>
"Our personnel are increasing their presence in this village to
reduce the potential for violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the incidents the ceasefire was generally
holding in most areas.

<HEADLINE> Costs Rise Threatens Higher Education Rate in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Continued college cost is
threatening higher education rate in the United States as
low-income families could not afford it, a study released Tuesday
showed.
</P>
<P>
Over two decades, college prices rose by 49 percent, but family
incomes increased just 10 percent, while the average Pell grant,
the major federal funding source for low-income students, declined
by 23 percent, adjusting for inflation, said a study report
releaded by the Education Resources Institute on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If low-income students do not attend community college, they
could not afford to go to college at all, said Thomas Parker,
senior vice president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
"What we like to think is we have a system where people have
both access and choice, but what we're rapidly developing is a
system where people have access but not choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-96, the average cost of attending a two-year public
community college, including tuition, room and board, was 7,265
dollars for a full-time student without financial aid. For a
public four-year university, it was 10,889 dollars, and for a
private college the average was 19,443 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the last decades, student grants are covering a large
proportion of college costs. Pell grants provide about half of
what they did 20 years ago, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
In the 1976-77 school year, the average Pell grant covered 19
percent of the cost of attending a private, four-year institution,
and 39 percent of the price of a public four-year school. But in
1996-97, the average grant covered 9 percent for private schools,
and 22 percent for public.
</P>
<P>
Even more striking, the maximum Pell grant -- given to the
neediest students -- fell from covering 35 percent of private
college costs in 1976-77 to 13 percent in 1996-97; for public
schools, it dropped from covering 72 percent of the price to 34
percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-97, the maximum Pell grant available was 2,470 U.S.
dollars for qualifying students. In 1997-98, it went up to 2,700
dollars and is at 3,000 dollars for the current year.
</P>
<P>
Even with those increases, the bottom line is the net price
still increases for most families, particularly for the
lowest-income students.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 3.6 million of the 14 million college
students receive Pell grants, and more than half of Pell
recipients in four-year schools qualify for the maximum amount of
funding.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Yugoslav Initiative on Kosovo Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- China supports the
Yugoslav initiative to conduct investigations itself into alleged
atrocities in Serbia's province of Kosovo and calls upon the
international community to refrain from interfering into Yugoslav
internal affairs, a senior diplomat said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement at the U.N. Security Council in
explaining China's stance on a draft resolution calling for
Yugoslavia's cooperation with the U.N. International Crime
Tribunal on Kosovo probe. China abstained from voting on the
draft.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has initiatived its own
investigations and China supports its efforts," Shen said.
"Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Federal Republic must be observed."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government supports the Tribunal's work, but its
position regarding the principles underlying the adoption of
resolution 827 (1993) remains unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The tribunal was established as a special case in 1993 and has
a specific task," he said. "It is not a permanent court of law and
is still less an organ to intervene in the internal affairs of any
country in the Balkan region that fall within its jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
"China condemns the terrorist crimes in violation of
international humanitarian law in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, while stressing that there can be no double
standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
China supports Belgrade's statement that the conflicts in
Kosovo, a province in Serbia with a majority of ethnic Albanians,
are nothing but internal affairs in the Federal Republic. The
conflicts broke out in August after ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had
been stepping up their efforts to seek independence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Spends Billions in Containing Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
wasted about billions U.S. dollars every year in trying to contain
Iraq, according to budget analysts.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 war, frequent military buildups in the Gulf have
cost Washington about seven billion U.S. dollars while tens of
billions of dollars is spent annually on maintaining a strong U.S.
military in the region, analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 50 billion U.S. dollars of the annual 270 billion U.S.
dollars in U.S. defense spending goes toward maintaining the Gulf
deployment, said Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of
defense for manpower in the Reagon administration.
</P>
<P>
"You've got carriers, ground troops in Kuwait, prepositioned
equipment all over and you're spending money on no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq," said Lawrence Korb.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's worth it if this is part of a long-term strategic
plan," Korb added. "The problem we've had recently is the
initiative has been with Saddam since Clinton has been in office."
</P>
<P>
However, Susan Hansen, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the 50
billion U.S. dollars estimate seemed high, although the Defense
Department doesn't keep track of spending by region. "We find it
hard to believe it would be that much," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration called off an airstrike against Iraq
over the weekend after Saddam agreed to allow back U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said he would intensify efforts to support
opposition groups in hopes of seeing another government in Iraq,
and he warned Saddam an airstrike would come without warning if he
again barred U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen halted the flow of additional
warplanes to the Gulf on Monday, but dozens of fighter jets and
bombers had already taken off on their way there.
</P>
<P>
The current buildup could cost about 500 million U.S. dollars,
much less than the peak Gulf deployment in March of two aircraft
carriers, 34 ships, 430 aircraft and 44,700 troops, said Elizabeth
Heeter of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a
private research group.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. national security strategy, the Defense Department
is supposed to be able to wage two wars in different regions at
the same time so it stations many of its 1.4 million force around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
In the hottest of hot spots, 37,000 American troops help keep
the peace on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Around the Gulf, U.S. forces include at least 24,000 soldiers,
sailors and Marines, many on ships.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Price Picks Up 0.2 Pct in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. inflation picked
up in October, mainly caused by prices for consumer goods from
fruits and vegetables to gasoline and baby clothes, the Labor
Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index (CPI) edged a 0.2
percent, after remaining unchanged in September, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the inflation rate for the first 10 months of this
year, at just 1.6 percent, is better than the 11-year low of 1.7
percent for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices in October rose 0.9 percent, the first increase
since May. Gasoline prices, which jumped by 2.7 percent, the most
since August 1997, largely offset declining prices for fuel oil,
electricity and natural gas. Gasoline prices, however, are still
15 percent lower than a year ago, and energy prices overall have
fallen at an 8.9 percent annual rate so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were up 0.6 percent in October. While prices for
meats including beef, veal and pork fell, the cost of vegetables
shot up 5.7 percent. Tomato prices rose more than 20 percent,
their biggest increase since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The price of fresh fruit was up 2.8 percent, with oranges
costing 3.2 percent more.
</P>
<P>
Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, rose
0.2 percent, the same as the overall index.
</P>
<P>
Clothing prices were up 0.1 percent, following a drop the month
before. Prices for infant and toddler clothes rose 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price of medical care rose 0.2 percent in October and is up
3.6 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The cost of tobacco products was up another 0.3 percent and has
risen nearly 14 percent from a year ago as tobacco companies
struggle with costly liability lawsuits and consider government
actions that could cost them hundreds of billions.
</P>
<P>
The price of school books and supplies was up 1.4 percent, but
computer prices, influenced by slumping world demand, fell again
in October, by 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares dropped 0.4 percent and are now slightly, 0.1
percent, below prices a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Tuesday, the Commerce Department said
inventories of unsold goods at the nation's businesses rose 0.6
percent in September. But sales rose by a bigger 0.8 percent,
decreasing the likelihood that stockroom backlogs will slow the
economy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Prices Rise Fast in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nation-wide prices
of existing homes are rising faster than inflation in many
metropolitan areas, the National Association of Realtors said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the median resale price was 132,700 dollars during
the third quarter of this year, up 4.9 percent from the median
during the same quarter a year earlier, according to the
association.
</P>
<P>
The increase matched the 4.9 percent increase in personal
incomes over the same period, but was more than double the
inflation rate in consumer prices of around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of 132 metro areas surveyed by the trade group
reported median price increases greater than 10 percent. Only
eight areas reported price declines.
</P>
<P>
Median resale prices ranged from 69,700 dollars in Waterloo,
Iowa to 330,700 dollars in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The cities with the top five increases were: Charleston, South
Carolina, 18.1 percent; Orange County, California., 17.4 percent;
Seattle, 14.4 percent, and Montgomery, Alabama, and Beaumont,
Texas, both 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other cities with double-digit gains over the year were San
Francisco; San Diego; Jacksonville of Florida; Los Angeles; Biloxi
of Mississippi; Davenport, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska, and Wichita,
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The cities with the five worst drops were Sarasota, Florida.,
8.7 percent; Greenville, South Carolina, 6.5 percent; Honolulu,
5.9 percent; Amarillo, Texas, 3.7 percent, and Akron, Ohio, 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Others with declines were Springfield, Massachusetts;
Birmingham, Alabama, and Nashville, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
By region, the Midwest and West recorded the largest increases,
7.2 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. The Northeast lagged,
with a 2.1 percent rise. In the South, the median advanced 5.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Fossil of Land Bird Found in U.S. Wyoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- A new analysis of a jaw
from an ancient parrot by U.S. scientists suggests that the fossil
dates to the time of the dinosaurs, indicating that modern land
birds evolved earlier than scientists had thought.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Washington Post, the jaw, found in
eastern Wyoming around 1960 and kept since in the University of
California at berkeley's Museum of Paleontology, is about 65
million years old, therefore making it the oldest known fossil of
a modern land bird.
</P>
<P>
Primitive birds with teeth were the most common birds during
this period, said the report, but they became extinct with the
dinosaurs while toothless birds like the parrot survived for
reasons that remain unknown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rates Once Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve Tuesday
cut short-term interest rates by one-quarter percentage point, the
third time since the end of September in a bid to hold and spur
the U.S. economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Fed monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market
Committee, voted to move the benchmark federal funds rate, charged
on overnight loans between banks, to 4.75 percent, from 5 percent.
Meanwhile, the discount rate, which the Federal Reserve charges on
its own loans, also was reduced by a quarter point, to 4.5
percent. It announced the change at the conclusion of a
closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted immediately. The Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks shot up after being down 60 points just before
the announcement. Fifteen minutes later, it was up 34 points at
9,045.
</P>
<P>
Rates on a variety of consumer and business loans, from credit
cards to auto loans, were expected to fall in response to the
Fed's action.
</P>
<P>
"Although conditions in financial markets have settled down
materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain," the central
bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
With Tuesday's cut, the Fed said, "financial conditions can
reasonably be expected to be consistent with fostering sustained
economic expansion while keeping inflationary pressures subdued."
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Tuesday's reduction, the federal funds rate
dropped to the lowest level in four years. It was the third since
September 29, when the Fed cut rates for the first time in three
years. The first cut wasn't enough to calm Wall Street, and banks
began pulling back from business lending. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan took a surprise action again to lower the rate on
October 15.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the cut, the Dow topped 9,000 Monday for the first
time since July. Tuesday, in advance of the Fed announcement, it
fell below that threshold.
</P>
<P>
Two major factors are considered in support of Tuesday's rate
cut: one is the tameness of inflation and the other is the
nation's sharply increasing trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported earlier Tuesday that its Consumer
Price Index rose a modest 0.2 percent in October. For the first 10
months of the year, inflation is running at a 1.6 percent annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a panel of 29 economists assembled by the National
Association for Business Economics is forecasting the U.S. trade
deficit will reach 250 billion dollars this year and 300 billion
dollars next year as against only some 110 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
That could be interpreted as forcing factories to lay off
workers. Since March, their payrolls are down by 200,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Slide to New 10-Year Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices slid to new
10-year lows Tuesday after the United States called off a military
attack on Iraq and the U.N. weapons inspectors resumed work in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend January futures ended 29 cents down at
11.44 dollars a barrel on London's International Petroleum
Exchange, well below the key support level at the 10-year low of
11.55 dollars a barrel seen in August.
</P>
<P>
Brent slid some 57 cents Monday after Iraq agreed to reverse
its October 31 decision to halt cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors in charge of dismantling any remaining weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The end of the Iraq-U.N. impasse turned market focus back to a
towering overhang of stocks.
</P>
<P>
"What this fall is actually showing is that there is a lot of
crude in the markets and unless OPEC takes action to control
production, there is no guarantee that we will not go lower,"
Reuters quoted Mehdi Varzi at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson as saying.
</P>
<P>
Varzi said it was not possible to rule out a decline in oil
prices into single digits for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
"You can't exclude it. You could foresee many scenarios. One of
them is that production starts going up in December and January
and that will not be good news for oil prices.... We are in a very
difficult situation at the moment and it is hard to tell what's
ahead for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Another leading oil analyst, Philip Verleger, predicted oil
prices could even go as low as 5 dollars a barrel unless OPEC
moved quickly to reverse the towering stockpile of oil.
</P>
<P>
"I remain very concerned. I just don't see a return to growth
in Asia next year," said Verleger, president of PKV Associates of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices remain low despite good compliance with cuts of some
3 million barrels a day agreed earlier this year by producers of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some
non-OPEC nations.
</P>
<P>
Some OPEC members like Kuwait favor a third round of output
cuts this year but a meeting of ministers on the sidelines of an
oil conference in Cape Town two weeks ago appeared to signal only
the likely extension of already agreed reductions.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the OPEC producers are less than happy and there could
be some heated discussions at next week's meeting," said Leslie
Nicholas at the company GNI.

<HEADLINE> Meteor Storm Fails To Appear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 scientists and
amateur stargazers have spent six chilly hours in suburban Beijing
waiting in vain to get a look at the Leonid Meteor Storm, which
failed to appear Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
A number of meteors did appear near the Constellation Leo, with
one or two for every five minute from 2:00 to 6:00 this morning,
according to a scientist at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory's
Shahe Station in the northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The storm may be delayed until early tomorrow morning or will
just not occur at all, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000 amateur observers at Shahe, and at Miyun in suburban
Beijing and the Xinglong Station in Hebei Province are faced with
the question of whether to come to the stations for another night.
</P>
<P>
Leonid forms in the dust debris of the Tempel-Tuttle comet's
tail which orbits the Sun every 33 years. The earth crosses the
tail every November with meteor showers occurring when the debris
is dense.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have predicted that the year's meteor storm will be
particularly dense, with the best viewing in East Asia and the
Western Pacific Region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Releases Linda Tripp Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House investigators on
Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of
Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The House Judiciary Committee released 22 hours of the tapes,
which triggered independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation
into the Lewinsky case and led to his report to Congress alleging
impeachable offenses by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, an edited transcript of the tapes was made
public in October. House audio technicians went through the tapes
line by line to take out the same material removed from the
transcripts.
</P>
<P>
Tripp secretly recorded the tapes of Lewinsky, talking about
her affair with the president, and took the tapes to Starr,
sparking his eight-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an
impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first
witness on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tripp is now being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for
allegedly violating a state law that requires all parties to a
conversation to consent to any taping.

<HEADLINE> Knesset Passes Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 17 (Xinhua) -- Knesset (Israeli Parliament)
passed the Wye peace accord by 75 votes against 19, with nine
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
It was also a vote of confidence in the 120-member Knesset in
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
The accord requires Israel to pull troops out from another 13
percent of West Bank in return for Palestinian tougher measures to
fight Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office said on Tuesday that the cabinet
meeting originally scheduled for Wednesday for approving the
implementation of the Israeli part of the first stage of the Wye
accord has been postponed to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was "in order to enable the Palestinians to complete their
fulfilling of all their commitment according to the Wye
agreement," the office said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian commitment includes the publication of an
order against incitement against Israel, publication of an order
regarding the collection of illegal weapons and the submission of a
plan to collect the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Israeli side is reaching for the verification
from the Palestinian side that it has indeed imprisoned 10
terrorists from a list of 30 and that one article of the
Palestinian national charter against Israel has been abrogated by
the executive committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli part of the first stage of the Wye accord includes the
handing over of 2 percent of the Israeli-controlled area to the
Palestinian-Israeli jointly-controlled area, transfer of 7.1
percent of the jointly-controlled area to total Palestinian
control, and release of 750 Palestinian prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Attacks on Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 17 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
Tuesday condemned "all attacks against civilians" and called for
"a swift punishment of those guilty of such deplorable crimes."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press here, Peter Burleigh, president of
the Security Council for the month of November, said, "The council
condemns all attacks against civilians and reiterates the need for
all parties to respect human rights and humanitarian law, and
reminds the government of its responsibility to protect its
citizens."
</P>
<P>
The resolution said, "the council fully endorses
Secretary-General (Kofi) Annan's statement of November 13, which
condemned the escalating cycle of violence in Burundi."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the council welcomes and encourages the stated
intention of the government to investigate the massacre of
civilians committed on November 2-3, and to swiftly bring to
justice those responsible for such atrocities," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The council expresses the hope that members of the
government's Commission of Inquiry will be granted immediate
access to the site of the alleged massacre," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The council again calls for renewed emphasis on the urgent
need for all groups to participate in a negotiated settlement
leading to a cease-fire established within the context of the
Arusha process," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The army of Burundi killed more than 100 mostly Hutu civilians
in retaliation for a Hutu rebel attack on a camp for Tutsis. The
attack, which took place in Rutovu, some 30 kilometers southeast
of the capital, Bujumbura, was the deadliest since a third round
of peace talks ended last month with little progress.
</P>
<P>
Hutu rebels are fighting to topple the military government of
Pierre Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority, which accounts for
14 percent of Burundi's population of 6 million. Hutus account for
85 percent.
